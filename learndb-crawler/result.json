Lots of uses.\n5. You can't heal HP during DDoor...but you can heal MP. Spirit Shield will prevent you from being TOO frail when it wears off. Combine with a source of channeling (or !Magic) and...you're fairly decent. This can also help you deal with badmuts {No Device Heal, and No Regeneration}.\n6. If a creature can drop a hide, it's body won't blow up (Petrify + LRD, Inner Flame OR IOOD). (Note it still does make the inner flame explosion, it just doesn't fling chunks). Suppose this is to prevent needing to change tactics to get a hide for armour.\n7. When a living creature has been saved by a lost soul, it returns as a \"ghostly\" version. This is identical to the original except it has one pip of rN+ and is vulnerable to holy weapons and dispel undead.\n"

Grants passive noise suppression at 1\\* (cutting it in half!), a passive mimicking shadow at 2\\* (see newDith entries \\[2] through \\[6]), Shadowslip at 3\\* (\\[7]), Aphotic Marionette at 4\\* (\\[8] and \\[9]), and Primordial Nightfall at 5\\* (\\[10]). For pre-0.32, see [olddith](#olddith).\n2. The mimicking player shadow spawns as an actual monster up to 3 tiles away with chances on your spells cast (15% at 2\\* to 25% at 6\\*) + ranged / melee attacks (10% to 20%, melee guaranteed after 15-30 aut). It lingers after acting once, inactive (but can respawn to act while out), blocking enemies, and setting up Shadowslip.\n3. Melee and ranged shadows try to hit what you hit with a +0 unbranded base copy of your weapon, plus base damage scaling with XL. Melee defaults to spawning on the opposite side of the target, then elsewhere adjacent to the target, then a random closest possible target in its 3-tiles spawn radius. Ranged defaults to a distance from the target.\n4. Spell mimics cast irresistable shadow spells with no friendly fire, echoing other spells, scaling to your XL + your spell’s level, choosing a spell randomly from your spell’s schools. Conj = Shadow Ray (Bolt of Fire), Fire = Shadowball (Fireball), Ice = Creeping Shadow (Creeping Frost, centred on it). Further school spells are in entries \\[5]+\\[6]\n5. Damaging shadow spells continued: Air = Shadow Tempest (Call Down Lightning on 30%-50% of hostile enemies on screen + 1), Earth = Shadow Shard (Iron Shot), Alch = Shadow Prism (Fulminant Prism, still on a two turn delay), Necro = Shadow Draining (5x5 AC-ignoring burst around the shadow).\n6. Hexes, Translocations, and Summoning shadow spells all don’t deal direct damage. Hexes = Shadow Torpor (penetrating beam of Slow, irresistable but shortlived), Tloc = Shadow Bind (binds random things in sight scaling to spellpower), Summ = Shadow Puppet (a glass cannon summon outliving the mimic that swoops, flanks, and constricts).\n7. Shadowslip requires your shadow to be present, plus costs MP, HP, and a small amount of piety. You instantly swap places with your shadow, and all enemies that were targeting you are forced to target it until the shadow dies or loses its buff a few turns later (scaling slightly with Invocations). Guarantees distraction stabs.\n8. Aphotic Marionette can only be used once per monster, on monsters with spells / abilities, with more than one monster visible. It irresistably makes an enemy randomly fire its spells & abilities at other random targets it can see, cycling through each valid spell before repeating, never hurting the player, and giving buffs & summons to the player.\n9. Aphotic Marionette’s skipped spells are indicated by !s when examining monsters while worshipping Dithmenos, and a total count is listed when targeting monsters. Most notably, it skips Silence, Mesmerize, blinking, convocations, and purely-bad effects like Warning Cry. Its spell cast count scales slowly with Invocations, going from 3 to 6.\n10. Primordial Nightfall reduces your LOS range to 0 and gradually returns your LOS over a duration scaling slightly with Invo (scaling to max LOS size: slowest for kobolds and fastest for barachi). You can swing weapons and can be swung at while at LOS 0, with penalties as if you’re invisible to one another, but can’t target or be targeted otherwis\n"

From 0.26 through 0.30-a, players could use Lua to memorize any spell, including those which they hadn't found and spells only available to monsters. Let it end in hellfire!\n27. For about an hour in trunk, all monsters except for shifters, toadstools, pillars of salt and blocks of ice were SLOWLY\\_DYING. Slowly meant in about 150-200 turns or so. See !lg :qwqw won xl=1\n28. <https://www.reddit.com/r/dcss/comments/18hvndr/>\n29. For a brief window after Draconian Breath rework, monster yellow draconians offered a new level of annihilation: Caustic Breath (3d195). See !lg \\* cv\\~\\~0.32 max(dam) x=dam\n30. For a brief window after Divine Shield rework, any character (even a mummy!) could become invulnerable to all blockable attacks for the rest of the game by getting a negative number of Divine Shield charges.\n31. For almost two months, the player had a 100% chance to block any blockable beam (think LCS, Iron Shot, Poison Arrow) (see commit 4495e38f).\n32. !git 75b3d6c - Players could use every aux they \\*didn't\\* have, instead of ones they did. Your peck misses the kobold! Your whirl of blades misses the kobold! Your grab misses the kobold! Your kick misses the kobold!\n"

I'm hoping to finally do a full 13-rune run.\n3. i too personally know in irl some real amazing dudes, at crawl, they are like 4-5x times better than elliptic at least. and they all say that minotaur enchanters are super easy, and that if you play a minotaur enchanter and lose, well, your a big noob. none of them play online though for reasons which i wont elaborate on right now\n4. i foind exploit for crawl ,i made a hill orc fighter and moved around the map hitting monsters with an axe until they died. i gained several expeirence levels in this fashion\n5. macro half the keys on your keyboard to aa and the other half to firestorm and hammer the keyboard wildly with your fists\n6. hey check it out im going play MiBe and wear a +0 leateher armor instead of this enchantable plate armor, its my Playstyle you see. whoa hold up what do you mean im a retard?? you cant say that im wrong in an absolute sense. n o dude actually there are a lot of different ways to play cralw, news flash. dude stop being dogmatic. your being really dogmantic right now dude\n7. Have you tried the walking away spell?\n8. I used Disaster Area (see the new god Qazlal) on the 3rd floor of The Tomb. I think I killed 37 mummies in one turn and they death cursed me to death. I had rN+++ but I'm not sure how (or if) that factors in.\n9. (Please note that, for real-life religious reasons, I was advised not to \"worship\" an in-game \"god\". I'd rather gain eternal reward in the afterlife, even if it lowers my chances of winning.)\n10. Holy God, Neil's hardcore.

OTHER GEAR: Upgrade to a tower shield once you have 10-15 shield skill (unless you find a really good kite shield). Wear whatever body armour gives you the most AC (usually plate), and eventually enchant up gold dragon scales or crystal plate. You want rings of strength (protection/slaying are a bit worse) and an amulet of regen (reflection/faith are a bit worse).\n6. TACTICS: Use Finesse in dangerous fights. Use Heroism if you aren't at min delay yet or don't have Finesse or just want a boost to defenses, but Finesse is generally a stronger use of piety. Use potions of might in Zot:5. Haste doesn't stack with Finesse, so potions of haste should be used to run away, not to attack faster.\n"

Moves at speed 30 with inertia - if something casts this at you, sidestep, but watch out behind you! It does less damage at short range; at melee range it only does about half damage. Only in the book of Spheres and randart books.\n2. Monsters with shields might block the orbs. If two orbs collide they will explode with radius 1 and Gong-level noise (40). Orbs that haven't travelled more than one square dissipate instead of exploding.\n3. Does 9d(pow / 4) damage, but power gets an extra stepdown and will never exceed 87. Power is further reduced by 50/30/10 percent if the orb has only traveled 1/2/3 spaces.\n4. OODs are not quantized! A new OOD is generated on the caster's position, aimed at the exact trajectory toward its destination, then perturbed in both position (0.25 of a tile left or right perpendicular to its direction) and angle. Finally it is advanced one move and then loses energy (1, 1.5 or 2 moves' worth). OODs made in bulk spread further.\n5. The maximum angle perturbation decreases with spell power. 50: +/-46.3 deg 75: +/-31.8 deg 100: +/-24.1 deg 150: +/-16.2 deg 200: +/-12.2 deg (if the caster is wearing amulet of inaccuracy, halve spell power first)\n6. Enemy OODs obey movement energy randomization, which is a large effect compared to the low energy required to move, so they will feel 'swingy'.\n7. Homing: If the OOD's target is dead or submerged or it is the first move of a bulk OOD spawn, keep trajectory. Otherwise, if you're more than 17 degrees left or right compared to its (float) trajectory and (float) position, it will adjust its angle by 33.4 degrees.\n8. En passant: If an OOD is one tile away and you diagonally step past to dodge, it hits anyway! Or at least sometimes it will. Besides being tile-adjacent before and after, the angle between OOD real position-target position and OOD trajectory has to be within 97 degrees, and you can't see exact values, so sometimes it doesn't kick in.\n9. <https://imgur.com/JHLmUyW.png>\n"

This is a tremendous amount of HP: To match this naturally, your mhp must be 420. Equipment granting regen+ must be attuned to you and will not grant hp until you have had it equipped at full health.\n4. Each level of the mutation is worth one pip (80 regen rate or 0.8 hp/turn).

Shields prevent off-hand attacks, and until you have enough skill they also slow your melee attacks and make it harder to cast spells. The number of times you can block depends on the size of the shield (see shield\\[2] for details).\n2. Bucklers can block up to twice per turn, kite shields thrice, and large shields four times. If you have SH without a shield ([amulet of reflection](#amulet_of_reflection), mutations, god abilities) you can block once per turn. Attacking faster means your turns go by faster meaning you can block more!\n3. Since 0.28, there are no shield breakpoints and shields do not care about strength. Instead, they scale on dex and scale linearly with shield skill, becoming zero only at 27. Since 0.30, strength helps with spell and attack delay penalties instead of size.\n4. Prior to 0.28, it took 4/15/25 skill to eliminate evasion, melee speed, and casting penalties for bucklers/kite/tower for normal races, 5.6/21/- for kobolds and halflings, 7.2/-/- for spriggans, 2.4/9/15 for nagas, centaurs, and formicids, -/9/15 for trolls and ogres. There may be better uses for your XP than completely eliminating the penalty.\n5. Each enchantment increases SH by 1. Bucklers have 5 SH, -1 EV, max +3; kite shields, 8 SH, -3 EV, max +5; tower shields, 13 SH, -5 EV, max +8. Every level of shield skill increases SH by 1/20 of the base shield value. Dexterity improves your SH bonus from a shield.\n6. You will block a missile if a random number up to 130% of the missile to-hit is less than a random number (on 2 dice) up to 2/3 of your SH; a melee instead uses a random number up to 15 + to-hit / 2. Both to-pass-shield values are inflated by 5 \\* (previous blocks this turn)^2.\n7. see [shield\\_formulas](#shield_formulas)\n"

From (pre-Stone-Soup) version 2.10 to version 2.83, the dungeon (D) was 36 levels deep.\n5. Before (pre-SS) version 3.40, there was a Great Swords skill separate from Long Blades.

Before 0.14, player vampires could sense blood out of LOS (\"You smell fresh blood near-by.\"). The detection range scaled with hunger level (14 at Bloodless), at Satiated or above there was no indication how close the blood was, and detecting blood had a (very small, distance-dependent) chance of waking the player if asleep.\n12. See [knife of accuracy\\[4\\]](#knife_of_accuracy\\[4])\n13. fun fact: when unarmed skill gave you other auxiliary attacks, nagas headbutted more than any other race, because they headbutt when they would roll a kick\n14. 2012-11-22 sapher and elliptic managed to have the same 11168 turns for the minimum turncount win\n15.

Fire, water and air elementals once regenerated health faster when in lava/flame clouds, water, and cloudless squares respectively.\n22. Before 0.13, there was a cloud type called gloom which had no glyph, recoloured anything in it to purple, and dissipated faster when in a halo - as long as it was also not silenced.\n23. Pan lords used to be able to get orc/drac slaying melee attacks if you were playing as an orc/draconian respectively.\n24. Until 0.15, grey draconians players' tail slap would trample enemies. But! Only if player was in deep water, and the enemy was also in a water tile (though they could be flying!).\n25. \\<minqmay> fun fact: if an undead or demonic monster reads a scroll of holy word, and the damage would kill it, it will get set to 1 hp instead and survive \\<minqmay> this is not very useful knowledge however, seeing that monsters cannot read scrolls of holy word\n26. Curse toes are in the lich genus, though not the lich species.\n27. When removing boots of flying, if you're wearing an evocable source of flight (like a ring), the game will automatically evoke it, instantly and for free. This is almost entirely useless (doubly so now that rings of flight do not need to be evoked as of 0.27).\n28. In versions of Crawl prior to 0.6, Kikubaaqudgha was totally different: Kiku's invoked abilities, for example, were \"Recall Undead Slaves,\" \"Enslave Undead,\" and \"Invoke Death\" (summoned a reaper).\n29. Code appearing already in version 0.1 and remaining in the source code for several versions, but never actually used, defines a monster \"The Mollusc Lord.\" Its stats are similar to Gloorx Vloq's.\n30. < crate> btw wielding wyrmbane also reduces the accuracy of dragon breaths against you\n31. < minqmay> amusingly, a monster with a weapon can roll 0 damage, and a monster without one can't\n32. If disaster area turns the tile under the orb of zot into lava the orb will move out of the way, several spaces if it has to.\n33. In old versions, you couldn't turn into a tree (even by deliberately quaffing lignification) while standing in a harmful cloud.\n34. Nagas can still spit poison in tree form.\n35. Since 0.27, [twister](#twister)s are no longer immune to their own tornado clouds. This does not matter, since they have 10000 hp and are always summoned.\n"

Finished branches: D with new generation routines, Ruins, Titan branch, Tower, Lake Lerna, Insect Colonies, Hall of Doors, Mines\n4.

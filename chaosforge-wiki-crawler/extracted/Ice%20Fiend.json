{"title":"Ice Fiend","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ice_Fiend","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ice Fiends''' are a [[fiend]], one of the most feared enemies in the game. Like all fiends, they have powerful magic attacks, [[torment]]ing and freezing you at range. Their melee is no slouch, either - their attacks deal up to 156 damage per turn (reduced by cold resistance). Fortunately, they are weak against [[fire]] as well as holy damage. \n\nThey are usually found in [[Pandemonium]], [[Cocytus]], and on the final floor of [[Dis]]. They can also be found in hard [[ice cave]]s, or [[summon]]ed by enemy casters.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Bring at least rC++ to minimize the mauling they'll give you in melee. You can acquire that plus immunity to torment by playing a [[lichform]] or [[undead]] character, but others will have to gather those resistances the hard way.\n*As with any torment-capable monster, you do not want to give them several turns of free attacks against you as you rush into range. Don't waste turns charging into them if you're capable of luring them around a corner into attack range.\n*Unlike other fiends, ice fiends are threats in melee, unless you have high cold resistance. If your quickest way to kill it is through melee, stack up as many buffs as you can, quite possibly including a [[potion of resistance]] if you lack rC+. The usual tactic of attempting to lure it around a corner still applies.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

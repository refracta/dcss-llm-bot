{"title":"Piety","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Piety","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n'''Piety''' is a measure of your standing with your chosen [[god]] and a resource used to activate divine abilities.\n\n==Useful Info==\nPiety is measured on a scale from 1-200; most characters start at 15 piety when first worshipping a god. If piety drops below 1, you are excommunicated and incur [[penance]]. Piety is gained by doing what your god likes, and lost for doing what it hates (see below for details).\n\nAt certain piety thresholds, your god will grant abilities. Active abilities can be invoked with the '''a''' command; most cost piety to use. Passive abilities work automatically, and usually don't have a cost. Piety is also used, passively, for obtaining [[gift]]s and for resolving [[penance]].\n\n==Estimating Piety==\nYou cannot see your exact piety number in-game, but you can estimate it from the number of stars shown by your god's name on your [[HUD]]:<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|religion.cc|4446}}</ref>\n\n{|border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|-\n!Ability Level !! Piety !! Description\n|-\n| || 1-29 || Noncommital\n|-\n|*|| 30-49 || Aware of your devotion\n|-\n|**|| 50-74 || Pleased with you\n|-\n|***|| 75-99 || Rising star\n|-\n|****|| 100-119 || Shining star\n|-\n|*****|| 120-159 || Favored servant\n|-\n|******|| 160-200 || Prized avatar\n|}\n\nNot coincidentally, these stars are the levels of piety required for you to receive new abilities. You don't always get a new ability for each star. For example, [[Okawaru]] gives the ability to invoke Heroism at *, and then nothing until Finesse at ****. \n\nNote that many gods grant powers that improve with your exact piety, not just your star level. Also, 'excess' piety can be used to invoke abilities more often. Therefore, gaining piety remains helpful until you reach the maximum.\n\n==Piety Gain==\nUsually, you'll start with 15 piety on worship, though [[Monk]]s start at 50 piety. Worshipping from a [[faded altar]]s gives a +20 bonus, even for Monks.\n\nYou can gain piety by following your god's conduct. A majority of gods reward you for one of two things:\n*Killing creatures, or having an [[ally]] kill a creature. Some gods don't give piety for specific kills, e.g. [[Lugonu]] won't reward you for killing monsters in [[the Abyss]].\n*Exploring the dungeon, i.e., revealing new tiles. You are not rewarded for exploring the [[Temple]] or deep water in [[the Shoals]].\n\nDifferent gods may have different means of gaining piety. For example, [[Zin]] appreciates [[gold]] donations (and killing [[evil]]/[[chaotic]] creatures), while [[Yredelemnul]]'s piety is solely determined by the number of friendly [[undead]] in sight. [[Gozag]] does not use piety at all - this god only cares for gold.\n\nFor most gods, piety gain slows down at 4*, and slows down again at 6*.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|religion.cc|2433}}</ref>\n\n==Piety Loss==\nUsing most types of abilities will cost a set amount of piety. This can bring you below a piety threshold, so watch out.\n\nYou can lose piety by doing things your god dislikes - [[Trog]] hates it when you cast [[spell]]s; [[The Shining One]] hates when you do [[evil]]. Specifically, doing anything your god dislikes will reduce your piety directly, then inflict [[penance]]. While you're under penance, you don't gain piety - instead, any piety you would've gained is used to decrease penance.\n\n===Piety Decay===\nMost gods have a piety decay. When worshipping these gods, your piety will naturally decrease over time. Every 10-30 [[decaAut]] (i.e. turns), the game makes a roll to deplete 1 piety. Depending on your god, there is a 1/17 or 1/35 chance to do so. Therefore, on average, you'll lose 1 piety every 340 or 700 turns, respectively.\n\nGods with fast piety decay (lose 1 piety roughly every 340 turns):\n<div style=\"column-count:2; width:500px\">\n*[[Beogh]]\n*[[Dithmenos]]\n*[[Jiyva]]\n*[[Kikubaaqudgha]]\n*[[Lugonu]]\n*[[Makhleb]]\n*[[Okawaru]]\n*[[Qazlal]]\n*[[Sif Muna]]\n*[[Trog]]\n*[[Vehumet]]\n*The [[Wu Jian Council]]\n*[[Zin]]\n</div>\n\nGods with slow piety decay (lose 1 piety roughly every 700 turns):\n*[[Cheibriados]]\n*[[Elyvilon]]\n*[[Fedhas]]\n*[[Hepliaklqana]]\n*[[Nemelex Xobeh]]\n*[[The Shining One]]\n\n[[Uskayaw]] has extremely fast piety gain and decay, while [[Ignis]] has none. [[Ashenzari]], [[Ru]], [[Xom]], and [[Yredelemnul]] have their own unique piety systems, which do not use the normal decay function. [[Gozag]] doesn't use piety at all.\n\n==Strategy==\nPiety is a \"semi-renewable\" resource. It is much easier to obtain than [[scroll]]s or [[potion]]s, but still finite for most of the game (since there are only so many monsters to kill, tiles to explore, etc.). Still, you'll constantly gain piety, so don't be too stingy with divine abilities.\n\nSome gods have different piety systems, so you should treat their piety differently. See each god's page for more specific advice.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], there were five possible piety decay speeds.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], gods didn't treat followers' kills the same as the player's for purposes of piety gain.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

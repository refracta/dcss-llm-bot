{"title":"Queen bee","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Queen_bee","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Queen bees''' are the massive insect leaders of bee hive [[vault]]s. Slow and somewhat [[poison]]ous, their prefer to let their hordes of [[berserk]] [[killer bee]]s and [[meliai]] handle you. They only appear in bee hive vaults, which mostly appear around [[Dungeon]] and [[Lair]]. If you see a lone queen bee, it's likely a [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While queen bees aren't very dangerous on their own, they are always found with a swarm of killer bees. Queen bees can [[berserk]] other bees nearby, making them much more dangerous.  When encountering a bee hive, lure the killer bees away a few at a time and try not to wake up the queen. If she ''does'' start pursuing you, keep out of her [[line of sight]] as best you can until you've trimmed away her allies.\n*Like most insects, queen bees and killer bees are vulnerable to poison. Hitting them with [[Poisonous Vapours]] / [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] and [[Ignite Poison]] a couple times will eradicate them, while [[Mephitic Cloud]] will turn them against each other."}

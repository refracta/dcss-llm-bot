However, the +5 [[enchant]]ment and +5 [[EV]] make it an above-average robe otherwise. And Harm can be good on blaster characters, as it increases your damage more than your enemies'. But, overall, it's a dangerous artefact for most characters.\n\nHarm and *Slow are the two more dangerous properties -- if you can counteract Slow and make use of Harm, such as being a [[Formicid]] mage, it can be useful. It still remains a ''very'' dubious item for everyone else.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], this item [[contamination|contaminated]] and [[draining|drained]] the wearer on unequip.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], this unrand had a randomised appearance and was not pre-identified on sight, and was a completely useless and terrible item, rather than just a dubious item: it was -5 {EV-5 -Cast *Tele Stlth-- *Contam *Drain *Curse}.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the EV penalty was only -4, and the robe had -2 penalties to Dex, Str, and Int.\n*Prior to [[0.15]] the stealth penalty was -80.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], the Robe of Misfortune was even more dangerous to wear, as it would increase your magical contamination while you wore it.  However, since its contamination was gradual, it was far less dangerous to try on if you had a scroll of remove curse handy.\n\n==References==\n<references /> \n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

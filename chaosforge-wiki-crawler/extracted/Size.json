{"title":"Size","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Size","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\nCrawl uses a discrete system of [[size]]s to decide how large or small a [[monster]] is. There are six categories, as follows from smallest to largest:\n\n*{{tiny}} ([[bat]]-sized)\n*{{little}} ([[spriggan]]-sized)\n*{{small}} ([[kobold]]-sized)\n*{{medium}} ([[human]]-sized)\n*{{large}} ([[ogre]]-sized)\n*{{giant}} ([[giant]]/[[dragon]]-sized)\n\n==Useful Info==\nSize has the following effects:\n\n'''Player only:'''\n* It modifies your [[evasion]]. Smaller sizes increase EV, larger sizes lower it. In specific: size gives a [[Evasion#Base EV|flat bonus/penalty]] to your base EV, and affects how much EV you get out of [[Dodging]] skill. \n* It determines what [[armour]] and [[weapon]]s you can use. Species that aren't [[#Medium|medium]]-sized generally have trouble with certain equipment. Note that a species may have restrictions beyond size; [[octopode]]s can only wear [[hat]]s, for instance.\n\n'''All creatures:'''\n*Creatures can only [[constrict]] enemies that are the same size or smaller.\n*Larger creatures are more resistant to knockback effects (like [[Primal Wave]]) and [[trample]] attacks.\n*Large and Giant creatures can traverse through [[water]] easier.\n\n'''Monster only:'''\n*Larger monsters lose more EV when trapped by a [[throwing net]] or [[web]].\n*Larger monsters drop more gold when killed by a [[Gozag]] worshipper.\n*Tiny monsters create weaker [[Inner Flame]] explosions; giant monsters create larger explosions.\n\n==Sizes==\n===Medium===\nThe majority of player species are medium, and can use almost every kind of item. Only [[giant club]]s, [[giant spiked club]]s, [[large rock]]s, and [[barding]]s are not available.\n*[[Barachi]]\n*[[Deep elf]]\n*[[Demigod]]\n*[[Demonspawn]]\n*[[Djinni]]\n*[[Draconian]]\n*[[Formicid]]\n*[[Gargoyle]]\n*[[Ghoul]]\n*[[Gnoll]]\n*[[Hill orc]]\n*[[Human]]\n*[[Merfolk]]\n*[[Minotaur]]\n*[[Mummy]]\n*[[Octopode]]\n*[[Tengu]]\n*[[Vampire]]\n*[[Vine Stalker]]\n\n===Small===\nAlong with the item restrictions medium species face, small characters cannot use the following: [[bardiche]]s, [[battleaxe]]s, [[dire flail]]s, [[executioner's axe]]s, [[glaive]]s, [[great mace]]s, [[great sword]]s, [[halberd]]s, [[tower shield]]s, [[longbow]]s, [[scythe]]s, [[triple sword]]s, or [[javelin]]s. Furthermore, [[broad axe]]s, [[double sword]]s, [[magical staves]], [[trident]]s, and [[demon trident]]s are treated as two-handed weapons.\n\nOnly one player species is small:\n*[[Kobold]]\n\n[[Pig Form]] makes players small-sized, but disables most types of equipment.\n\n===Little===\nLittle players cannot wield anything that small players cannot, and are also prevented from wearing the following:\n*Any body armour but [[robe]]s, [[troll leather armour]], or any kind of [[dragon armour]]\n*Any [[gloves]]\n*Any [[boots]]\n*[[Helmet]]s\n*[[Kite shield]]s\n\nAlso, [[triple crossbow]]s cannot be wielded.\n\nTwo player species are little:\n*[[Felid]]\n*[[Spriggan]]\n\n===Tiny===\nNo playable species are small enough to qualify as tiny, but there are several [[transformation]]s that shrink characters down that small. This grants them a considerable boost to evasion but often imposes significant drawbacks (not least of which is the inability to use most equipment).\n*[[Bat Form]]\n*[[Wisp Form]]\n*[[Fungus Form]]\n\n===Hybrids===\nThe hybrid species have large-sized bodies but medium-sized torsos, and may wear anything medium-sized characters wear except for boots. Instead, they may use [[barding]]s. They are also large enough to ignore movement and attack penalties from [[shallow water]]. However, their [[Deformed|unusual frames]] cause body armour to grant half the normal base AC bonus.\n\n*[[Naga]]\n*[[Armataur]]\n\n===Large===\nLarge species are subject to all the same armour restrictions as little species, except that they can use kite shields and tower shields, but can't use [[buckler]]s. However, they may use any weapon they find, including [[giant club]]s, [[giant spiked club]]s, and [[large rock]]s, some of the most devastating weapons in the game. They are large enough to move and attack normally in [[shallow water]].\n\n*[[Oni]]\n*[[Troll]]\n\nPlayers in [[Serpent Form]] are also considered large, but cannot make use of any equipment.\n\n===Giant===\nThere are no giant species, but [[Dragon Form]] will make you this size.\n\nGiant creatures have a quality known as \"fake amphibious\" that lets them move through [[deep water]] without drowning. (They are tall enough that their heads stay above the water.) Unlike creatures that are truly amphibious or native to water, they get penalties to fighting when standing in deep water. Dragon Form gives permanent [[flight]], making this moot.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], giant monsters were immune to [[net]]s and [[web]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], size affected [[shield]]s. Hybrid/Large species would receive less encumbrance from their shields, though they received slightly less SH from shields. Small species would be encumbered more, but get slightly more SH from shields. Also, large player species had a movement penalty while walking in shallow water.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], some monsters were Big-sized (between Large and Giant).\n*Prior to [[0.19]], size affected how you escaped [[throwing net]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], smaller monsters and players had a better chance to escape [[shaft]] traps."}

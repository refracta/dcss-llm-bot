They're hardier than [[clay golem]]s, but not as tough as [[iron golem|iron]] or [[crystal golem]]s.\n\n===Variant Stone Golem===\n[[File:Vine-covered golem.png]] You can find '''vine-covered golems''' guarding an altar to [[Fedhas Madash]] in [[Eringya's Formal Garden]].\n\n{{Flavour|While made of ordinary old weathered stone, covered with moss and vines, this golem still needs to be respected. It is still as hard as stone, after all, and its weight spells massive damage if it connects a blow.}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Mid-level melee-focused characters wearing decent armour can probably engage them directly without too much trouble, though they may wish to buff themselves by drinking a [[potion of might]] or going [[berserk]].\n*Stone golems are big and tough, but they're also slow. Kiting them works well, especially for more fragile characters, and you can always run away if you start taking a beating.\n*Casters should try to use non-elemental [[Conjuration]]s or [[Earth Magic]] to take them down, since they resist elemental attacks and are completely immune to [[Hexes]].\n==History==\nStone golems were removed in [[0.14]]\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

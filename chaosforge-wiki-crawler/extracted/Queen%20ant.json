{"title":"Queen ant","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Queen_ant","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Queen ants''' are the massive insect leaders of ant nest [[vault]]s. Although they pack a dangerous [[poison]]ous sting, they prefer to let their hordes of [[worker ant]]s and [[soldier ant]]s handle you. They only appear in their ant nest vaults, which can generate throughout the middle-[[Dungeon]] as well as in some [[branch]]es. If you see one under other circumstances, it's likely a [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Like most insects, queen ants are vulnerable to poison.\n*Poisonous, mephitic and damaging clouds from the [[wand of clouds]] will cause significant damage to the entire nest.\n*The queen herself should pose little difficultyâ€”although it is advisable to ensure that you have curing potions to fight her, because her poisonous attacks can be incredibly potent.\n\n==History==\n*Queen ants were removed in [[0.27]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], queen ants moved slowly."}

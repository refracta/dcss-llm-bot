{"title":"The Hive","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/The_Hive","type":"raw","data":"{{Obsolete}}\n\n{{flavour|You hear an angry and manifold buzzing.}}\n\n'''The Hive''' is a 2-floor [[branch]] found on [[Dungeon]]:11-16, full of [[killer bee]]s, [[honeycomb]]s, and [[royal jelly (item)|royal jelly]].\n\n==Layout==\nThe two floors of the Hive generate in a very predictable pattern. The first is usually made up of one-to-three small open areas, filled with bees, loot, and little else. The second floor is a single unified chamber, a large portion of which is made up of an area filled with wax [[wall]]s, honey, and even more bees than you've encountered thus far (including slightly more dangerous [[queen bee]]s). Also, there is usually a small treasure vault on Hive:2, either hidden in the back of the wax wall area or across a pool of [[deep water]].\n\n==Strategy==\nThe Hive is an excellent early branch to explore. With [[poison resistance]] and a little caution, any melee character can gradually hack their way through the swarm and be very well rewarded for it. Take advantage of the many nooks and crannies in the wall to force bees to face you one at a time.\n\nCasters don't necessarily need poison resistance, as spells such as [[Mephitic Cloud]], [[Poisonous Cloud]], [[Ignite Poison]] (amazingly useful here), or really anything that can strike multiple targets at once can chew through bees quickly (try not to use Ignite Poison when [[scroll]]s or [[book]]s are lying on a tile that will soon burst into flames). Bees flee when injured, but their vulnerability to [[poison]] makes it easy to keep them from escaping.\n\nCharacters with dangerous [[hunger]] issues should definitely raid the Hive as early as possible; the tremendous amount of food found here can keep most characters safe from starvation through to the end of the game. This goes double for characters with poison resistance who can even eat the bees themselves. Also, characters worshiping gods that accept blood sacrifices can collect tremendous piety sacrificing the mountains of corpses this branch generates.\n\nHive:2 is a solid alternative to [[the Lair]] for [[stash]]ing items. Nothing that spawns there can use items or pose much of a threat.\n\nThe hidden Hive vault can be difficult to claim. If it's hidden beyond deep water, you'll need a source of [[levitation]] or water travel to get there, and even then you'll need to discover the hidden [[door]] before your spell wears off and you drown. A [[wand of digging]] or [[wand of disintegration]] will make it much easier to gain access, but expect dangerous [[yellow wasp]]s in the chamber beyond. The more dangerous of the two is the one hidden in the back of the honey chamber. While gaining access is easier, it's usually filled with bees and four [[oklob plant]]s. That much acid being flung around is a menace to anyone; use indirect damage spells or extreme caution when clearing them out.\n\n==Monsters==\n*[[Killer bee]]\n*[[Killer bee larva]]\n*[[Queen bee]] (Hive:2 only)\n*[[Giant goldfish]]\n*[[Big fish]]\n*[[Jellyfish]]\n*[[Electric eel]]\n*[[Oklob plant]]\n*[[Yellow wasp]] ([[Vault]] only)\n\n==History==\nThe Hive was removed in [[0.10]]; the rationale given was that it was predictable and not challenging.

Willpower is of no use against this effect, but resistance to electricity can sometimes prevent it.}}\n\n'''Stunning Burst''' is a monster-only spell that does electrical damage, pierces enemies, and can inflict a very brief (1 turn) [[paralysis]] on hit. [[Electricity resistance]] provides a 50% chance to resist paralysis, [[stasis]] grants full immunity to it, but [[willpower]] has no effect. It can also be dodged with [[EV]]. Electricity-immune monsters can't be harmed or paralysed by this spell.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*The spell was added in [[0.27]].\n\n[[Category: Monster spells]]"}

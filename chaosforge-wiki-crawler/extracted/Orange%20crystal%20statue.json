{"title":"Orange crystal statue","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Orange_crystal_statue","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Orange crystal statues''' are stationary guardians that have the ability to drain your [[intelligence]], your [[MP]], or to confuse you and your allies. Additionally they cast [[Shadow Creatures]], flooding the area around them with powerful summoned monsters. If an orange crystal statue is in your [[LOS]] and your [[intelligence]] is less than 4, you are at risk of [[stat zero]]. They can be found in various [[vault]]s almost anywhere after the early [[Dungeon]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*In general, try not to fight them while other hostile creatures are around.\n*Although they're largely resistant to elemental magic, powerful [[Earth Magic]] spells can take them out quickly. [[Shatter]] and [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] are particularly effective.\n\n===Variant Orange Crystal Statues===\n[[File:Wucad mu statue.png]] A '''Statue of Wucad Mu''' guards the inner treasure chambers of [[Wucad Mu's Monastery]]. Destroying it has the added bonus of wiping out any shadowy monks that are still running around.\n{{flavour|This statue, made from a fine glassy orange crystal, depicts a mystic known as Wucad Mu, who mastered the matters of the mind. Beware of the statue's powers, as you have no chance in mental combat against it.}}\n\n[[File:Zot statue.png]] A '''Lunar statue''' guards a single acquirement-level item on [[Lehudib's Moon Base]]. This variant has [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] in addition to the spells above and a 20% higher cast rate.\n{{flavour|An utterly bizarre statue, hewn from a single piece of dark gabbro scintillating with tiny crystals. It is impossible to tell whether the statue is intended to represent some creature or personage, or is completely abstract.\nOne thing is certain: it is profoundly disturbing.}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], orange crystal statues did not have [[See Invisible]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], they were speed 6 and did not have the Shadow Creatures or Abjuration spells.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], orange crystal statues inflicted the intelligence loss, MP drain, and confusion through irresistible [[Divinations]] [[Miscast effect|miscast effects]]. They could also be immediately destroyed with a zap from a [[wand of disintegration]].\n*Orange crystal statues used to also make you forget spells and maps."}

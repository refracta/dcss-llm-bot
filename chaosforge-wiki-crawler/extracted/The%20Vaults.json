The blood spattered liberally around the entrance suggests that there is a certain amount of violence, too.\n\nThe entrance to this branch can be found between levels 13 and 14 of the Dungeon.\n\nThis branch can only be exited while carrying at least 1 rune of Zot.\n\nThis branch is 5 levels deep.\n\nThis branch contains the entrance to the Crypt.\n\nThis branch contains the silver rune of Zot.}}\n\n[[File:Vaults entry.png]] '''The Vaults''' are 5-floor [[branch]] filled with long, wide hallways and countless chambers. The gate to the Vaults can be found on either floor 13 or 14 of [[the Dungeon]]. \n\nYou can enter at any time, but you must have at least 1 [[rune of Zot]] (no matter where it's from) in order to exit back into the [[Dungeon]]. If you try to enter with no runes, you will receive a prompt warning you that you must have a rune to exit.\n\n==Layout==\nThe Vaults are a sprawling compound made up of wide hallways and small chambers of various shapes and sizes, most of which are separated by [[door]]s. The entirety of this branch is made of [[wand of digging|undiggable]] material; stone, metal, and rarely crystal walls. If you aren't careful, it's easy to get cut off from an upstairs. Try to clear rooms methodically to avoid enemies you missed showing up when you're already half dead.\n\n===Vaults:5===\nThe fifth and final floor changes this pattern abruptly. Vaults:5 contains 4 very large rectangular chambers that take up almost the entire area. Each chamber is filled with loot and/or [[shop]]s. A cross-shaped hallway cuts through the center, and the outer border is a hallway. The silver [[rune]] will be in one of the chambers, although there are [[mimic]]s imitating the rune.\n\nAll three of the regular staircases from Vaults:4 lead to the center of Vaults:5. The center is always surrounded by 24 [[vault guard]]s, as well as a number of other angry inhabitants.\n\nVaults:5 often contains much stronger monsters than the rest of the branch, including  [[titan]]s, [[quicksilver dragon]]s, [[golden dragon]]s, and [[lich]]es.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe Vaults are inhabited by a wide variety of monsters, with many foes from late [[Dungeon]] and early [[Depths]]. Getting beaten to death by brute force is an everpresent threat, but there's many magical monsters as well.\n\nPack enemies appear in great numbers, from [[deep troll]]s and high-level [[orc]] bands, to squads of [[yaktaur]]s firing at range. The wide hallways and open chambers make it difficult to effectively bottleneck opponents or cut off lines of fire.\n\nThe various guard units unique to the Vaults each cause their own issues:\n*{{monsterlink|Vault guard}}- Plentiful lumbering oafs with heavy weapons and sturdy armour.\n*{{monsterlink|Vault sentinel}}- Wakes up nearby enemies, afflicts you with [[Sentinel's Mark]], often has a [[crossbow]].\n*{{monsterlink|Vault warden}}- Can seal [[door]]s and [[stairs]] around you, forcing you to kill it to get past.\n*{{monsterlink|Ironbound convoker}}- Recalls and buffs enemy units from elsewhere on the floor.\n*{{monsterlink|Ironbound preserver}}- Soaks partial damage for other enemies, effectively doubling their HP until the preserver dies.\n*{{monsterlink|Ironbound frostheart}}- [[Creeping Frost|Freezes]] anything standing by the walls.\n*{{monsterlink|Ironbound thunderhulk}}- [[List of ogres|Ogres]] who bombard you with lightning, but only from a distance.\n\nBring sufficient firepower, take your time, and be ready to take a different staircase down if the one you just used places you in a fight you don't want to deal with right away. Also, if you get hit with a Sentinel's Mark, retreat to an empty floor as quickly as possible. The reinforcements it will bring can be devastating on a mostly unexplored floor.\n\nDo not enter Vaults:5 before you are ready for it. If you had difficulty with floors 1-4, floor 5 will probably be too much for you, and even peeking down there can be ''immediately fatal''. Many players will do Vaults:1-4, move on to the other branches, then come down to get the rune.\n\n==Vaults:5 Strategy==\nAs soon as you climb down to V:5, you can be locked in by a [[vault warden]], so preparation is important.\n\n===Preparation===\nResistances are more important than usual. [[Shadow dragon]]s and [[storm dragon]]s can deal surprising damage if you don't resist them. Other elemental threats like [[titan]]s and [[list of deep elves|deep elves]] are common, too.\n\nWhen entering V:5 for the first time, use what buffs are at your disposal before heading down: [[Haste]], [[Might]], [[potion of brilliance|Brilliance]], [[Heroism]]/[[Finesse]]... \n*Haste is particularly important, either for darting through the ring of guards towards a hallway, or for killing as many of them as quickly as possible. \n*[[Invisibility]] isn't very helpful here -- the vault guards and many of the most dangerous threats down here can all [[see invisible]].\n\n===Tactics===\nThere are two/three 'common' strategies to tackling the entry vault. These are not exclusive with each other; you may need to use multiple.\n\n*'''[[Stair dancing]].''' Only adjacent enemies follow you up the stairs. If you have good [[AC]] (and are reasonably lucky), stair dancing can clean up the entrance party.\n:However, a variety of foes may prevent you from using stairs. [[Vault warden]]s can seal stairs. [[Tentacled monstrosities]] can constrict you, and [[list of dragons|dragon]]s can [[trample]] you away. Having a way to snipe enemies ([[javelin]]s, all manner of high-level spells, offensive [[Invocations]], [[evocable]]s, etc.) is great to have.\n:In addition, the stairs may become too dangerous to climb down. Sometimes, the best thing to do is teleport away - see below for detail.\n\n*'''Teleport strategy.''' The basic gist is to [[teleport]] (or use an [[escape hatch]]) to land in a random location. This may land you in one of the sparsely-populated hallways along the edges of the level, where you can begin methodically clearing the level. Your goal is to end up in the corners and create a safe place to rest (by killing nearby monsters).\n:Of course, it might also land you in the middle of one of the treasure chambers, along with an assortment of far deadlier enemies. You may need to teleport multiple times to get a good location - teleport early and often. Buffs are highly recommended. \n\n*'''Being loud.''' Blast through everything in your path. If you can sustain combat for a long time, large AOE can be a good idea. Be aware that (at least when fighting in the center) the noise you generate will wake and lure out monsters from the four chambers.\n**A [[scroll of immolation]] will tear through the initial vault guards, but you'll absolutely need as much [[fire resistance]] as possible. Read the scroll on the guards (or other enemies) and start a chain reaction. It's extremely [[noise|loud]], so will attract a bunch of enemies, but successfully pulling it off is a blast (literally). If you plan to teleport to the edges, making noise in the center can actually be to your benefit.\n**AOE offensive spells: [[Freezing Cloud]], [[Starburst]], [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] + [[Ignite Poison]], [[Eringya's Noxious Bog]], and high level spells like [[Ignition]] and [[Polar Vortex]] can clear things out.\n**[[Discord]] is a powerful crowd clearing effect, though watch out for the frenzied monsters ''you'' have to deal with. Mass debuffs, like [[Metabolic Englaciation]] and [[Alistair's Intoxication]], can also be effective.\n\nOne of the worst possible things that can happen on V:5 is to receive a [[Sentinel's Mark]]. If this happens, quaff a [[potion of cancellation]] or quickly retreat up the stairs to V:4. Normally, targeting yourself with your own [[wand of quicksilver|quicksilver bolt]] or [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]] isn't a recommended tactic, but it may just well be worth the damage.\n\nEven if you don't plan on being loud, it's nice to have some form of AOE attack. If you don't have spells, certain divine abilities ([[Chei]]'s Slouch, [[Nemelex]]'s deck of destruction, [[Ru]]'s Apocalypse, [[Qazlal]]'s Disaster Area...) can fill the gap. For any character, [[evocable]]s ([[condenser vane]] / [[tin of tremorstones]]) are great tools if you have high Evocations skill.\n\nCasters should be mindful of their MP, especially when teleporting. \"MP efficient\" spells like [[Malign Gateway]] and [[Spellforged Servitor]] are very useful. Remember to use [[potions of brilliance]] and/or [[potions of ambrosia]] when you got the chance.\n\n==Monsters==\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Centaur warrior}} || {{monsterlink|Yaktaur}} || {{monsterlink|Yaktaur captain}} || {{monsterlink|Orc knight}} || {{monsterlink|Orc warlord}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Dire elephant}} || {{monsterlink|Slime creature}} || {{monsterlink|Harpy}} || {{monsterlink|Lindwurm}} || {{monsterlink|Boggart}}\n|-\n|{{monsterlink|Vault guard}} || {{monsterlink|Vault sentinel}} || {{monsterlink|Vault warden}} || {{monsterlink|Ironbound convoker}} || {{monsterlink|Ironbound preserver}} \n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Ironbound frostheart}} || {{monsterlink|Ironbound thunderhulk}} || {{monsterlink|Deep troll}} || {{monsterlink|Entropy weaver}} ||{{monsterlink|Necromancer (monster)}}\n|-\n|{{monsterlink|Wizard (monster)}} || {{monsterlink|Very ugly thing}} || {{monsterlink|Great orb of eyes}} || {{monsterlink|Glowing orange brain}} || {{monsterlink|Sphinx}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Peacekeeper}} || {{monsterlink|War gargoyle}} || {{monsterlink|Crystal guardian}} \n|}\n\n===Vaults:5===\nAlso includes most enemies from the above list.\n\n'''Easier'''\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n|{{monsterlink|Hell knight}} || {{monsterlink|Phantasmal warrior}} || {{monsterlink|Freezing wraith}} || {{monsterlink|Shadow wraith}} || {{monsterlink|Flayed ghost}}\n|-\n|{{monsterlink|Deep elf annihilator}} || {{monsterlink|Deep elf sorcerer}} || {{monsterlink|Deep elf death mage}} || {{monsterlink|Deep elf demonologist}} || {{monsterlink|Deep elf high priest}}\n|-\n|{{monsterlink|Stone giant}} || {{monsterlink|Ettin}} || {{monsterlink|Fire giant}} || {{monsterlink|Frost giant}} || {{monsterlink|Ogre mage}}\n|-\n|{{monsterlink|Deep troll earth mage}} || {{monsterlink|Tengu reaver}} || {{monsterlink|Lich}}\n|}\n\n'''Harder'''\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n|-\n|{{monsterlink|Shadow dragon}} || {{monsterlink|Storm dragon}} || {{monsterlink|Quicksilver dragon}} || {{monsterlink|Golden dragon}} \n|-\n|{{monsterlink|Titan}} || {{monsterlink|Tentacled monstrosity}} || {{monsterlink|Ancient lich}} || {{monsterlink|Dread lich}}\n|}\n\n===Uniques===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Aizul}}\n| {{monsterlink|Asterion}}\n| {{monsterlink|Bai Suzhen}}\n| {{monsterlink|Boris}}\n| {{monsterlink|Donald}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Frederick}}\n| {{monsterlink|Jory}}\n| {{monsterlink|Mara}}\n| {{monsterlink|Margery}}\n| {{monsterlink|Mennas}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Nikola}}\n| {{monsterlink|Saint Roka}}\n| {{monsterlink|Sojobo}}\n| {{monsterlink|Xtahua}}\n| {{monsterlink|Zenata}}\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], you needed one [[rune of Zot]] in order to enter this branch.

Additionally, many of the weaker enemies that could spawn in the Vaults were reduced in number or removed altogether.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], it was not necessary to obtain a [[rune of Zot]] to enter this branch, and its entrance was located on D:15-20. Also, the four chambers on Vault:5 only had entrances on the corners nearest the center of the floor.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], the Vaults were made up of 8 floors, the first 7 of which were all wide open areas spotted with rectangular rooms. Also, the [[vault guard]] was the only guard-type monster found here, and they usually appeared on the eighth floor.\n\n{{branches}}"}

{"title":"Crocodile","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Crocodile","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{stub}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Crocodiles''' are large lizards that bite hard, drag their targets backwards, and have enough [[HP]] to take a few hits. Although rarely a major threat, don't underestimate them if you're playing a fragile character. They are usually found in certain [[sewer]] and [[ossuary]] maps.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Certain [[cold]]-based attacks may [[slow]] them, giving mages and light armour users time to soften them up from afar before getting in melee.\n*Unlike [[trample]], their dragging attack doesn't check your character's [[size]].\n*Just because you can handle a crocodile doesn't mean you can take on an [[alligator]]. Those [[Swamp]] inhabitants are ''much'' deadlier.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], crocodiles were reintroduced as [[sewer]] and [[ossuary]] exclusives. They got a new '''AF_DRAG''' attack flavour, which allows them to pull the target back.\n*Crocodiles were removed in [[0.26]]."}

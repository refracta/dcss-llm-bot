{"title":"Draconian shifter","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Draconian_shifter","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{list of | draconians}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Draconian shifters''' are lightly armed [[warper]]s. Although not terribly dangerous on their own, they can [[blink]] their allies into melee range with you, and can disable your own ability to [[blink]] or [[teleport]]. They can be found accompanying other draconians in [[the Realm of Zot]], in [[The Depths]] as well as occasionally appearing in [[the Abyss]]. They typically spawn as [[purple draconian]]s, complete with a [[Quicksilver Bolt|dispelling breath]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Like all draconians, they cannot [[see invisible]], and are much less likely to use magic against you when they cannot see you.\n*Their ability to lock down your most reliable escape abilities and surround you with powerful enemies makes them one of the deadliest members of a draconian band. [[Silence|Silencing]] them will prevent them from using their spells, rendering them much less effective.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], classed draconians could have varying colours.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], draconian shifters knew [[Banishment]] in place of [[Dimension Anchor]] and [[Blink Allies Encircling]]."}

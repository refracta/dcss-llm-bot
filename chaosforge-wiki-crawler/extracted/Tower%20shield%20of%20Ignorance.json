It bears an inscription written in an ancient language. Scholars and wise men laboured for countless hours to decipher it, and in time, a translation was finally settled on:\n\n\"With a shield like this, who needs to think?\"}}\n[[File:Shield_of_ignorance.png]] '''''the +10 tower shield of Ignorance'''''\n\n+10 [[tower shield]]\n\n-4 [[Intelligence]]<br>\nrN+\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''tower shield of Ignorance'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|791}}</ref> is certainly a large shield. [[Kobold]]s and [[Spriggan]]s are unable to wield it, while other species will need high Shields skill and/or strength to mitigate the shield encumbrance. The intelligence penalty only makes it harder to cast spells. However, it offers better protection than regular tower shields, and comes with a nice resistance.\n\nOverall, while casters and [[Gnoll]]s may want a different option, most characters who'd use a tower shield will appreciate this one. A +8 tower shield of [[resistance]] might be preferable, but you first need to find a tower shield of resistance, then use [[scrolls of enchant armour]] on it.\n\nNote that, on low Int characters, the intelligence penalty can put you in real risk of [[stat zero]]. If your character has low intelligence, wear with caution.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], this was known as the '''large shield of Ignorance'''.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], this shield gave +4 [[AC]], reduced intelligence by 6, and only had a +6 enchantment. Also, it had *[[Curse]] property (33% chance to recurse itself on equip).\n*Prior to [[0.19]], this shield had +2 [[EV]] and only a +2 [[AC]] bonus. \n*Prior to [[0.15]], this shield had a +8 enchantment level.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Shields]]"}

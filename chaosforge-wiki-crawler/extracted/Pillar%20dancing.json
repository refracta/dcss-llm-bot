In simplest form, pillar dancing is just walking in circles for an indefinite amount of time. It has been severely nerfed as of version [[0.29]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nTo pillar dance, simply flee a pursuing, ''non-adjacent'' enemy of the same (or lower) speed around a small \"pillar\" of walls - anywhere from a 1x3 block to a whole ring of rooms - always going away from the monster, so that you go around the pillar over and over. Preferably, you should be in a mapped out, open area, to minimize the chances of another monster wandering in. If the pillar is large enough, and you far enough, so that monsters leave your [[line of sight]], then your [[Stealth]] might cause the monster to forget about you and wander off.\n\nIf the enemy doesn't have any ranged attacks, then you should be regenerating both [[HP]] and [[MP]]. For the most part, monsters will also regenerate HP. So while not flawless, this strategy can be used to 'reset' fights from the beginning, or to just restore a few extra MP for a spell.\n\n<gallery widths=\"225px\" heights=\"225px\" class=\"left\" mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Pillar dance.png|thumb|left|1x3 pillar. Remember to cut corners diagonally.\n</gallery>\n\n==Attacks of Opportunity==\n''Main article: [[Attacks of opportunity]]''\n\nThe [[attack of opportunity]] mechanic serves to restrict pillar dancing. If a same speed enemy is adjacent to you, they will have a 33% chance to get a free attack while re-approaching you. This means that you are unable to pillar dance melee enemies that are threatening enough to warrant pillar dancing.\n\nSlow attacking monsters, like [[ogre]]s, will give up a space after an attack of opportunity or two. While this could allow for pillar dancing, typically these monsters have strong attacks for their depth. If they can 2KO you, taking even one extra attack can lead to death.\n\n===Creating a Space===\nThe following methods can separate yourself from an adjacent monster:\n*Being faster than your opponent; dancing around a slower opponent is usually called [[kiting]] instead. (Note that [[Swiftness]] causes a speed penalty after it ends)\n*[[Translocations]] magic: [[Blink]], [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]], [[Dispersal]], etc.\n*Disable or slow the opponent: [[curare|curare darts]], [[Hexes]] spells, [[wand of roots]]/[[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]], [[net]]s.\n*Swap places with an [[ally]] behind you. [[Summonings|Summons]], [[wand of charming|charmed enemies]], [[Beogh|friendly orcs]], or an [[Hepliaklqana|ancestor]] all work equally well for this purpose, preventing all attacks of opportunity.\n*Use items. [[Potion of invisibility]], [[scroll of fear]], [[phial of floods]], anything that can cause the above effects.\n*Get another, weaker monster in the way. An [[adder]] is typically better to face than a [[wight]]. It might not help while you're adjacent, but faster monsters will often swap places with slower ones.\n\nGenerally, prevention is better than the cure. Early on, don't get melee monsters adjacent to you unless you are ''certain'' you are ready to fight. Having unknown floor nearby (i.e. unknown monsters) typically means you aren't certain, so don't be afraid to retreat to known area.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Remember that both you and monsters can cross diagonals. Monsters will generally take the most efficient path to get to you, so one misstep means taking 1 attack.\n*If a ranged monster is just on the edge of unobstructed line of sight, you can still pillar dance them (of course, requiring a pillar of sufficient size to do so). Your movement will break LOS, and as monsters can't attack you while out of sight, they'll always spend their turn chasing you.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], [[random energy]] was replaced with [[attacks of opportunity]], a much stricter counter to pillar dancing.\n:In prior versions, monsters could randomly get +0.1 or -0.1 turn, but without free attacks. The main take away is to always be prepared to take at least 1 hit from a same speed, adjacent enemy, else you could pillar dance melee enemies.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], [[food]] served as a (very) soft, medium-term counter to pillar dancing; running out of food would force you to take a turn to eat. Earlier versions had certain foodstuffs take even longer to eat.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], monsters would [[monster generation|spawn]] over time; these monsters could catch you off guard (\"backspawn\") and interrupt the pillar dance. In 0.21 onwards, monsters that are pre-generated awake can do the same thing, but the chances of them actually interrupting you are significantly lower.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], monster speed was not random, making pillar dancing much safer.\n\n[[Category:Strategy]]"}

{"title":"Wolf spider","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wolf_spider","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Wolf spiders''' are one of the simpler arachnids, but also one of the most durable and vicious. They can keep up with hasted players, have far more [[HP]] than most spiders, and pack a painful, [[poison]]ous bite that can tear up a low-on-mana caster quickly. Even worse, while they may be encountered alone, they also appear in large groups with other spider varieties. They can occasionally be found in [[the Dungeon]] and [[the Vaults]], and are very common in the [[Spider's Nest]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Although poison resistance will mostly prevent their bites from poisoning you, they still do heavy damage. Decent [[AC]] and [[EV]] are strongly recommended.\n*Like most bugs, wolf spiders are vulnerable to poison. [[Mephitic Cloud]]ing a crowd of them should create a lot of dead spiders very quickly.\n*[[Ignite Poison]] also works well, especially since you'll probably be fighting a few other kinds of spiders at the same time.\n\n[[Category:Arachnid]]"}

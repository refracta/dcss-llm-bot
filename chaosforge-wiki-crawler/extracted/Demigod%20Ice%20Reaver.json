My name is... well... I wasn't really given a name. My father was Poseidon, and my mother was a Viking berserker, and none of them really wanted to have much to do with me. My father is ashamed of my mortal half, while my mother is terrified of my divine half. So I suppose I will call myself... Cudgeler. That's a good name, don't you think? Yes, my name is Cudgeler, and I am going to retrieve the Orb of Zot. It's supposed to be buried very far beneath this Dungeon, and no one's ever gotten it. Well, if anyone was going to get it, it would be a demigod, don't you think? So I'm setting off with no more than my leathers, my mace, a bit of bread (it's a shame I inherited my mother's tendencies toward hunger and eventual starvation), and a book of ice magic as a parting gift from dear old Dad.\n\nWandering through the entry levels, I find something ominous - a runed spear and some magical scrolls. Some hapless adventurers must have died this early on! I ignore the spear - I like the feel of a bludgeon myself - and cast the scrolls. The first scroll turns out to be a scroll of identify, and with it I discover that the second is a scroll of detect curse. Well, those are two scrolls that it will be nice to recognize in the future.\n\nOoh, I encountered my first enemy - a goblin! I bashed his brains in without incident, of course. Just after him I discovered a giant bat! I bashed its brains in too. Not too far off from it, I discovered my first bit of treasure: a robe lying on the floor engraved with runes of protection. I used my scroll of detect curse to make sure it wasn't a trap, then donned it in lieu of my leather armor - with the runes of protection, it's both less limiting and more protective.\n\nAfter cudgeling another giant bat, I found a green potion! Curious, I immediately quaffed it and I felt a bit better. Ooh, I found a kobold! He threw some darts at me, but the robes brushed them off, of course. I bashed his brains in. After that I found a giant cockroach and a giant newt. I strolled up to them and as I was bashing their brains in, the newt bit me! Quite hard! Multiple times! That somewhat hurt. I took a short break until I felt better and set off again. I found a gluggy pink potion and drank it. I began to glow a bit - a sign of magical contamination - but I felt... protected. At least until I found a kobold with a dagger, who cut me with it. That wasn't very nice, so I bashed his brains in. And I took his dagger, too. Hah!\n\nI found a kobold with a whip and a rat guarding some more scrolls of detect curse. Bashed their brains in, as usual. And found a white potion. After drinking it, I felt much better. I also found a hobgoblin guarding two more scrolls of detect curse (bashed his brain in). I'm beginning to be somewhat worried about these curses that the residents of the dungeon are all stockpiling scrolls to avoid. Exploring the rest of this level I found a spear that was obviously of orcish make, a piece of blank paper, and a kobold with a glowing dagger. I'm not sure what it was supposed to do to me when it slashed me, but it obviously wasn't a dagger of preventing one's brains from being bashed in. He also had an inky potion that, when I drank it, made me levitate! That was somewhat annoying, as I had to wait until it wore off before I could pick his gold up. Having explored this level completely, I went down one of the staircases to the next level.\n\nDungeon: Level 2.\n\nAt the foot of the stairs, I found a scroll. When I read it, I suddenly felt aware of my surroundings, even those through walls. I guess this is stonesense? It's somewhat disorienting. I feel sorry for dwarves now. I bashed in the brains of a few hobgoblins to discover a marvelous cache of scrolls and potions. One of them made me teleport a short distance, and another cursed my mace! It's now stuck to my hand! This is quite annoying, even though I like my mace. I also found a potion of healing and one of levitation.\n\nI was ambushed by wild animals, but I managed to bash all their brains in. I'm a bit tuckered out, so I'm taking a rest now. I've finished off the last of my bread. I wonder what I'm supposed to eat down here? Well, hopefully I'll find something.\n\nWell, that was frightening! I took on a kobold and several snakes at once, and although I did manage to bash all their brains in, they did quite a bit of damage to me! I must remind myself that I am not fully immortal - I know it sounds silly to say this, but there is the possibility that something in this Dungeon could kill me. On the plus side, I found a ring and after checking for curses, I put it on. I feel much stronger now! I'm down to six scrolls of detect curse.\n\nOuch! That snake poisoned me! I didn't know they were allowed to do that to demigods! I waited it off and continued. I found a fuming blue potion, and when I drank it, I was confused for a bit. I'm okay now though. Having finished the level, I sat down to memorize a couple spells in Dad's book - Magic Dart and Mephitic Cloud. I'll use those while waiting for them to get close enough to bash their brains in.\n\nDungeon: Level 3.\n\nI found a cyan potion near the staircase down. After drinking it, I feel very mighty. I also found some bread!\n\nWhat's this? A denizen of the Dungeon? She looks like some sort of apprentice wizard. She zapped at me with a wand, so I strolled up to bash her brains in. The next zap caught me and confused me for a few seconds, but I came to and bashed her brains in. Her diary indicates that she was an evil apprentice who entered the Dungeon to study in peace. Her robe is embroidered with magical glyphs, so after checking it for curses, I put it on. It turns out it's a robe of magic resistance. Good thing I relied on my adeptness at brainbashing rather than my magical powers! I felt a bit tired after that fight, so I took a rest and ate the bread I found.\n\nWow, that was a close one. I found a giant worm and bashing its brains in didn't work very well. Instead, I fell back and zapped it with magic darts until it ran away, then pursued it to bash its brains in. I also found a goblin named Ijyb, who screamed at me to go away. I bashed his brains in. Oh, look! Orcs! I've seen traces of their presence, but here is my first confirmation that they exist here in the Dungeon. I kill a few of them with magic, but more stream out... accompanied by an ogre. In retrospect, this was a bit foolhardy, but I attempted to take them on. The orcs were no problem, but the ogre was another story. I ran for my life blindly and stumbled down the stairs to...\n\nDungeon: Level 4.\n\nOne of the orcs followed me, so I killed him. The rest stayed upstairs, probably frightened of my prowess. I'm not sure the ogre could actually fit down the stairs. As I was resting and recovering, I was attacked by a ghost who identified himself as Player Character Ghost. What an odd name. He appeared to be a Ogre Monk - an eccentric combination. I was clearly outmatched, so I fled back up the stairs to...\n\nDungeon: Level 3.\n\n...Where my brains were bashed out by the living ogre, who had apparently been waiting for me to come up this whole time. What an undignified way to die."}

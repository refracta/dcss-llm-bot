{"title":"Ignition","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ignition","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n{{AttackSpell\n|name=Ignition\n|formula = 3d(3.33+Power/9) fire\n|maxdmg = 3d(25)\n|maxsp = 200\n|range = LOS\n|target = LOS\n|special = Cloud, AOE\n}}\n\n'''Ignition''' is a level 8 [[Fire Magic]] spell which creates a 3x3 fireball (somewhat weaker than the [[Fireball]] spell) around every enemy in sight. Explosions do not harm the user or their allies. All explosions are created instantly; even if an enemy would die from an explosion, it still creates an explosion.\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile Ignition deal less single-target damage than even [[Fireball]], it hits every enemy on the screen, and the explosions can overlap. This makes it a great spell against groups (that are not resistant to fire).\n* Great in naturally packed areas, like [[Vaults]]:5, [[the Tomb]], or later floors of a [[Ziggurat]].\n* Since Ignition works against [[summon]]ed creatures, it is good against summoners like [[mummy priest]]s.\n* Works great on [[the Royal Jelly]]. Once a few jellies have spilled out, just 2-3 casts are enough to kill TRJ and most of its allies. Just watch out for [[rockslime]]s afterwards.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*As the description suggests, allies will never be harmed by this spell, making it particularly desirable for characters banned from harming companions, such as followers of [[Beogh]] or [[Jiyva]]. Players making use of [[Summonings]] or [[Necromancy]] spells can also benefit.\n\n==History==\n*Ignition was added in version [[0.20]]."}

Its perk only serves to enhance its usefulness in the early Dungeon. However, by the time you enter Lair and mid-Dungeon, the instakill becomes less relevant. \n\nHaving multiple or zero heads does not grant any resistance to the sword's abilities. If this weapon instantly kills a [[hydra]], all of its heads will be cut without regrowth.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-func.h|223}}</ref>  This is not a reliable way to kill hydras, as regular attacks will still regrow heads.\n\nThis artefact is more likely to spawn in the early game, where it is more likely to be useful. The [[unique]] monster [[Terence]] has a small (1%) chance of spawning with this sword.\n\n==History==\n*Throatcutter was added in [[0.28]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Long blades]]"}

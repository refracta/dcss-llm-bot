They are found in [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], and the [[Hell]]s, and are often summoned by other monsters through the [[Summon Demon]] spell.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Iron Shot may look threatening, but these guys have such low HD that it has fairly low accuracy and damage. Furthermore, their tendency to surround you with [[ufetubi]] the second they see you means they rarely get to use it outside of melee range, where they are quite weak otherwise.\n*The biggest threat from an ynoxinul is that you'll waste time clearing out its summons while more dangerous opponents [[smite]] you and/or pelt you with [[damnation]]. Don't waste time with minor threats; take out the summoner to remove all the summons.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], ynoxinuls could [[see invisible]].\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

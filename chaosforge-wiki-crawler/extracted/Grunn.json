{"title":"Grunn","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Grunn","type":"raw","data":"{{version|030}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{list of | gnolls}}''Not to be confused with [[Grum]].''\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Grunn the Punished''' is a [[unique]] monster that comes with a pack of 2-4 [[doom hound]]s. He has a 1% of spawning with the [[Scythe of Curses]], if it hasn't generated already.\n\nGrunn is an alternate version of [[Grum]]. Only one may spawn in a given game.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Crypt]]\n*[[The Depths]]: 2-4\n*[[Realm of Zot]]\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n* The [[doom hound]]s are often the scariest part of the encounter. They spawn ''extremely'' dangerous monsters for where Grunn can be encountered. The Howl status effect can be resisted by [[willpower]], though it takes Will+++++ to be fully immune. You can also use a [[potion of cancellation]] to remove the Howl status.\n** [[Doom Howl]] spawns enemies from [[Tartarus]] around the player for a short time.  Aside from the heavy-hitting [[bone dragon]]s and [[reaper]]s, living players should fear the [[torment]] of [[tormentor]]s and [[Tzitzimimeh]]. The latter, with their irresistible, AC and EV-bypassing [[Dispel Undead Range]], are even scarier to [[undead]] characters, whether naturally or under the effect of [[Necromutation]]. Finally, [[putrid mouth]]s can breathe debilitating [[miasma]], leaving you slowed and even more vulnerable to the onslaught (not to mention Grunn himself).\n* Mind Grunn himself, who often comes with a highly enchanted heavy polearm of [[draining (brand)|draining]]. Still, if alone, he's just an upscaled gnoll with a polearm. Many characters can stay out of his reach, or simply tank the hits.\n\n==History==\n*Grunn was introduced in [[0.29]]."}

{"title":"Deep troll","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Deep_troll","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of|trolls}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Deep trolls''' are an advanced type of [[list of trolls|troll]] that usually roam in packs. While weaker than [[iron troll]]s, they can deal significant damage as a pack, and they'll usually come with magical support. They are commonly found in [[the Vaults]] (accompanied by [[ironbound preserver]]s) and [[the Depths]] (accompanied by [[deep troll earth mage]]s and [[deep troll shaman]]s).\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Their numbers are their only unique trait. Fight them in corridors, or at least avoid being surrounded.  If there's a deep troll earth mage present, however, don't expect rock [[wall]]s to be much use in funneling opponents. Area-of-effect attacks are nice to have.\n*Deep troll shamans can [[Haste Other]] and [[Might Other]]. Even a single deep troll can be dangerous, if it's hasted and mighted.\n\n===Variant Deep Troll===\n[[File:Deep troll monk ghost.png]] The ghosts of '''deep troll monks''' will occasionally coalesce as you explore [[Wucad Mu's Monastery]].\n\n[[Category:Troll]]"}

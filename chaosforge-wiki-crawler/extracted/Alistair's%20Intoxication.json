{"title":"Alistair's Intoxication","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Alistair%27s_Intoxication","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Alistair's Intoxication''' is a level 5 [[Alchemy]] spell which attempts to [[confusion|confuse]] all monsters in your line of sight.\n\n==Useful Info==\nAlistair's Intoxication attempts to [[confusion|confuse]] every monster in sight. It can only affect monsters that are all of the following:\n*[[Natural]], [[demonic]], or [[holy]].\n*Of human [[monster intelligence|intelligence]] (\"it is intelligent\").\n*Do not have poison immunity or [[clarity]].\n\nIt has a <code>40 + [[spell power|power]]/3</code>% chance (max. 90%) to confuse each valid monster without [[poison resistance]]. Monsters with rPois are only x33% as likely to be confused (i.e., a 66% chance to resist).\n\nIf this spell has confused at least one monster, you have a <code>60 - power/3</code>% chance (min. 10%) to gain the [[Vertigo]] status. Poison resistance offers no benefit to players when casting this spell.\n\n==Strategy==\nThis spell faces competition from [[Mephitic Cloud]], a level 3 spell which confuses monsters. Because its clouds last for multiple turns, it has multiple chances to confuse (even if the chance is smaller). Alistair's Intoxication has multiple benefits over Mephitic Cloud:\n*It affects everything in [[LOS]]. Intoxication has better range, and can affect multiple enemies that are spread out.\n*It has a chance to affect monsters with poison resistance.\n*It does not check [[willpower]] or [[HD]]. Unlike [[Hexes]] like [[Cause Fear]], Intoxication has the same chance to affect any vulnerable monster, whether they be a [[goblin]] or [[Antaeus]].\n\nThis spell can be useful in branches like [[Shoals]], [[the Vaults]], or [[Depths]], which have a high number of ranged enemies. Being able to confuse a squad of [[yaktaur]]s from full range is a notable advantage. Can be used to tackle [[Vaults]]:5 in particular, since the [[vault guard]]s surrounding you can all be confused by this spell.\n\nIf you want to get later Alchemy spells like [[Eringya's Noxious Bog]] or [[Irradiate]], Alistair's Intoxication is practically free. If you got the spell levels, you might as well use it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Alistair's Intoxication was a dual-school, level 5 [[Poison Magic]] / [[Transmutations]] spell.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Alistair's Intoxication could not affect demonic or holy monsters.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Alistair's Intoxication had a power cap of 100.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Alistair's Intoxication was level 4 Poison/Transmutations spell, could never affect rPois monsters, and could confuse or int-drain the player instead of causing vertigo. Also, mummies and [[lichform]] characters were unable to cast this spell.\n*In versions [[0.9.2]] and earlier, susceptible monsters would be affected 100% of the time."}

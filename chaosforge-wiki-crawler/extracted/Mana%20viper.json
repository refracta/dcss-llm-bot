{"title":"Mana viper","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mana_viper","type":"raw","data":"{{version023}}\n{{list of | snakes}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Mana vipers''' are unnatural [[list of snakes|snakes]] with an [[antimagic]] melee attack, making them particularly dangerous to anyone whose offense relies heavily on spells. They are primarily found in the [[Snake Pit]], but some [[royal mummy|royal mummies]] can also summon them.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Mana vipers on their own are annoying, but not particularly dangerous compared to the other inhabitants of the Snake Pit. Even accompanied by other opponents, melee and ranged weapon specialists and [[Trog]] worshipers will barely notice them. However, any character whose ability to take down foes is tied to their [[MP]] supply should try to prevent a mana viper from reaching them in melee range.\n*You can summon your own mana vipers to fight alongside you with the spell [[Summon Mana Viper]], a particularly useful summon for taking down enemy spellcasters.\n\n==History==\nMana vipers were added in [[0.14]]."}

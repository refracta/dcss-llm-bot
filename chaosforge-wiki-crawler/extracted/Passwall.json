{"title":"Passwall","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Passwall","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Passwall''' is a level 3 [[Earth Magic|Earth]] spell that allows the caster to pass through a short range of solid [[rock wall]].\n\n[[Earth Elementalist]]s start with this spell in their libraries.\n\n==Useful Info==\nRock wall can be passed in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line. The transfer is instantaneous, but requires an uninterruptible setup phase of <code>wall depth + 1</code> turns, and your [[AC]] is increased by <code>5 + power/10</code> during this phase.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-other.cc|453}}</ref> The maximum range is 3 squares.\n\nAfter direction with at least one passable wall has been selected, the [[MP]] and at least 1 turn will be spent regardless of the result. Potential failures are:\n*\"You sense an overwhelming volume of rock.\" -- the rock wall extends to the edge of the level.\n*\"Something is blocking your path through the rock.\" -- there is an impassible wall or [[stationary]] monster on the way.\n*\"You finish merging with the rock. ...and sense your way blocked. You quickly turn back.\" -- This can be 2 possible situations:\n**In [[the Abyss]], new terrain can generate that prevents you from landing. \n**If you try to passwall into a monster, the spell will try to move the monster one tile away, which will awaken it. However, if there's no room to move the monster, Passwall will fail.\n*\"This rock feels extremely deep.\" -- there are too many walls to pass with the current spell power (or at all).\n*You may also sense [[deep water]], [[lava]], or other dangerous terrain on the other end, which will cancel the move if you cannot currently move through that terrain.\n\n==Strategy==\nPasswall can be used as an escape spell, though it comes with a serious drawback. While preparing Passwall, you'll spend 2+ turns helpless in your old location - there's no way to interrupt the duration. When surrounded by monsters, wasting 2-4 turns can outright kill you. But if you take account of the delay, Passwall can be great in certain, niche situations:\n*When passing through a wall, you get to leave monsters behind, on the other side. It can be used to create a distance from enemies, or to [[kite]] melee monsters.\n*It lets you escape being trapped between monsters and a wall, if you have nothing better.\n*It allows you to travel through walls without a means of [[digging]]. You can take shortcuts or grab items behind transparent rock walls. Unlike digging, you get to leave monsters behind, so it can be useful during the [[orb run]].\n\nPasswall can also be used in order to set up [[stab]]s. After finishing the spell, you'll always have a chance to move before enemies. This spell is silent to cast - popping up beside a sleeping enemy will not wake it, allowing you to make a free stab.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Passwall can be used to lower [[turn]] count.\n*Passwall isn't affected by [[movement speed]], so [[Cheibriados|Cheibriadites]] or other slow characters can use it to shave travel time or reposition.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Passwall was a level 2 [[Transmutations]]/[[Earth Magic|Earth]] spell, its range depended on spellpower, and there was no AC bonus in transit.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Passwall was a level 3 Transmutations / Earth spell, and the maximum possible depth to pass was randomized on each cast.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Passwall's range was dependent on only your [[Earth Magic]] skill.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], it was possible to kill yourself with this spell if your destination tile contained [[lava]] or [[deep water]].\n*Prior to [[0.5]], Passwall would be interrupted by attacks. As any attack would stop the process, it was much worse for escapes.\n*Prior to [[0.4]], Passwall took 1 fewer turns and could ''not'' be interrupted, making it much better for escapes.\n*In [[0.3]], a Passwall bug made the spell very risky; instant death would occur if the spell was used around certain arrangements of rock and stone walls, most often found on [[Tartarus]]:7. Because of this, going any deeper than 4 tiles was hazardous.\n*In even earlier versions, death would occur anytime you failed to travel all the way through a wall. This was considered a feature.\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

{"title":"Divinations","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Divinations","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n'''Divinations''' was the skill which governed the casting of Divinations spells. Improving this skill increased the [[spell power]] of these spells as a well as the chance of casting them successfully.\n\nDivinations focused on knowledge and detection. Many spells like [[Detect Curse]] and [[Magic Mapping]] were replicated from [[scroll]] effects. [[Ashenzari]], the god of Divinations (introduced after this school's removal), filled in the other gaps.\n\nFor a long time, while the Divinations school was unavailable to players, its [[miscast effect]]s were used for a few aspects of the game.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[:Category:Divination|List of Divinations spells]]\n\n==History==\n*Divinations miscast effects were removed in [[0.20]].\n*Several Divinations spells were still available through the use of a [[rod of discovery]] until that was removed in [[0.8]].\n*The Divinations spell school was removed in [[0.6]].\n\n[[Category:Magic skills]]\n[[Category:Obsolete]]\n[[Category:Obsolete skills]]"}

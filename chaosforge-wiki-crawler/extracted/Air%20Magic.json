{"title":"Air Magic","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Air_Magic","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Air Magic''' skill determines how easily you can use spells involving air and electricity. \n\nAir magic features many offensive [[Conjurations]] with unique targeting mechanics, such as [[Shock]]'s ability to [[doublezap]] or [[Plasma Beam]]'s auto-targeting. Many of its earlier spells can also be used to create [[cloud]]s. Most Air Magic can be resisted with [[electricity resistance]].\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n{{spell table by level|Air}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n{{spell sources|Air|Book of Air,Book of Annihilations,Book of Lightning,Book of Storms,Book of Vapours,Maxwell's Memoranda}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Air Elementalist]]\n\n==History==\n*[[0.30]] Added [[Arcjolt]] and [[Plasma Beam]], removed [[Lightning Bolt]]\n*[[0.27]] [[Tornado]] changed to ice-themed [[Polar Vortex]], and [[Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling]] added instead of [[Absolute Zero]].

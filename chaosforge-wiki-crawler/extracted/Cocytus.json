From the frost-bitten lands, a cold chill touches your soul.}}\n\n[[File:Cocytus entry.png]] '''Cocytus''' is the [[cold]]-themed branch of [[Hell]], accessible from the [[Vestibule of Hell]].\n\n==Denizens==\n\n===General Hell monsters===\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Hellion}}\n| {{monsterlink|Tormentor}}\n| {{monsterlink|Ancient lich}}\n| {{monsterlink|Dread lich}}\n|}\n\n===Branch specific===\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{cyan|s}} [[File:Simulacrum (monster).png]] '''[[Simulacrum (monster)|Simulacra]]'''\n| {{monsterlink|Freezing wraith}}\n| {{monsterlink|Frost giant}}\n| {{monsterlink|Titan}}\n| {{monsterlink|Azure jelly}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Shard shrike}}\n| {{monsterlink|Wendigo}}\n| {{monsterlink|Nargun}}\n| {{monsterlink|Ice fiend}}\n|}\n\n===Lord===\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Antaeus}}\n|}\n\n==Useful Info==\nCocytus is 7 levels deep and populated by several kinds of \"ice\"-themed monsters, of which [[ice fiend]]s and powerful [[simulacra]] are the most dangerous if you lack proper cold resistance. [[Wendigo]]s will turn those simulacra into blasts of ice, while [[Nargun]]s will petrify and punch through ill-suited characters. You'll also meet several undead dragons and draconians, [[titan]]s, [[elemental wellspring]]s, and [[shard shrike]]s. All the while a mystical Hellish force will assault you as is usual for all [[Hell]] branches, causing multiple nasty effects.\n\nAs far as layout goes, Cocytus is fairly open with several streams and lakes of deep water. Like the other hells, Cocytus' first 6 floors are much shorter; containing one staircase up and down.\n\nThe last level of Cocytus contains the icy [[rune of Zot]], which is guarded by [[Antaeus]] and a multitude of ice fiends.\n\n===Hell Effects===\nIn addition to the universal [[Hell#Hell's Mystical Force|forces of hell]], Cocytus's bitter cold congeals [[potions]], preventing them from being used inside. (no permanent damage is done)\n\n==Recommendations==\nCocytus is one of the harder Hell branches, and you should not venture here until you've cleared almost everything else in the game, aside possibly from Zot:5, the [[Tomb]], [[Pandemonium]], and [[Ziggurat]]s. Having as much cold resistance as possible is strongly recommended, with rC+ being a strict minimum.\n\n[[Fly]]ing is useful throughout the branch, and especially on the final floor to navigate the sometimes vast expanses of water. In absence of flight, translocations such as [[Passage of Golubria]] can also make your travel through the waterlogged levels of Cocytus much more efficient.\n\nHaving access to fire-based attacks or powerful Fire conjurations such as [[Fire Storm]] will make your journey much smoother, as the vast majority of monsters in Cocytus are not resistant to fire, and many are even vulnerable to it. [[Holy wrath]] weapons are also very effective. See the [[Antaeus]] article for advice on defeating the branch's boss.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nKeep in mind that an elemental wellspring's [[Primal Wave]] can cover you and your adjacent hexes with (temporarily summoned) shallow water, rendering any stairwells inaccessible. For that reason, if you are in a static defensive position, staying 2 squares away from the stairway will keep the stairway open for any possible escape.\n\n==Trivia==\nIn ancient mythology, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocytus Cocytus] was one of the rivers in Hades, with the most famous one being the Styx. In Dante Alighieri's ''Divine Comedy'', Cocytus is the ninth and final circle of Hell, where traitors are imprisoned in its frozen waters along with Satan.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Cocytus did not render potions within unusable, had regular sized floors, had a weaker set of monsers (no Wendigos or Nargun), and had a different and slower set of hell effects.\n*During the Christmas holiday of 2014 and 2015, online ''Crawl'' servers renamed Cocytus to the '''North Pole''':\n{{flavour|This gateway leads to the North Pole.\n\nThe North Pole is a festive place, home to all the world's good cheer.\n\nThe North Pole is seven levels deep and contains the icy rune. It can be accessed via the Vestibule of Hell.}}\n\nThis had no effect on gameplay, and was just plain silly.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], many rune level layouts in Cocytus required flight or use of translocations to access the rune vault.\n*Cocytus got a new layout in [[0.12]].\n\n{{branches}}\n\n[[Category:Hells]]"}

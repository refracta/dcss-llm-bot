However, when thrown with the [[Evaporate]] spell, it creates a 3Ã—3 cloud of steam for a few turns that will damage enemies and block LOS.\n\n[[Transmuter]]s may start with some of these, and they can be distilled from clean corpses via the spell [[Fulsome Distillation]]. When found naturally, they can easily be identified by their unique description as \"clear potions.\"\n\n==History==\nPotions of water were removed in [[0.12]]."}

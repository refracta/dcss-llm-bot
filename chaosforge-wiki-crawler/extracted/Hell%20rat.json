{"title":"Hell rat","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hell_rat","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{list of|rodents}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Hell rats''' are an unusually dangerous breed of [[list of rats|rat]]. Like their weaker cousins, they have fairly low HP, but they move fast and have a powerful [[draining]] bite. They can be found as the bosses of some [[Sewer]] layouts, in packs in the [[Lair]], or in rat [[vault]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Hell rats are thankfully rare in the early game, but finding one in the Sewers can prove very dangerous, and getting swarmed in the Lair can be extremely lethal. Do everything in your power to kill them at range, especially if you lack [[negative energy]] resistance.\n*They've got negligible [[willpower]] and very low [[HD]], so pretty much any negative [[status condition]]s you can hit them with should work.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.16]], hell rats were known as '''orange rats'''."}

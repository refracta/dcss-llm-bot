{"title":"Sonja","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sonja","type":"raw","data":"{{version|028}}\n{{list of|kobolds}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nA [[unique]] [[kobold]], '''Sonja the Graceful Assassin''' usually wields a [[dagger]] or [[short sword]] of [[distortion]], [[venom]], or [[draining]], as well as [[curare]] [[dart]]s. She has exceptional [[EV]] and is faster than average.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:10-13\n*The [[Orcish Mines]]\n*[[The Lair]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Sonja may be a pest at range, but if she's wielding a distortion dagger, she's absolutely deadly in melee; her speed and three attacks per action mean she delivers 3-6 distortion strikes before most characters can even respond.\n*Sonja has very low HP and pathetic [[willpower]], so most disabling [[Hexes]] will stop her easily, as will [[Airstrike]] or other unavoidable spells. Even with low [[Evocations]] skill, a [[wand of mindburst]] or [[wand of paralysis|paralysis]] pretty much guarantees her defeat.\n*[[Poison resistance]] will render her darts harmless, but won't do much against her melee attacks.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to version [[0.28]], Sonja had [[Teleport Self]].\n\n[[Category:Kobold]]"}

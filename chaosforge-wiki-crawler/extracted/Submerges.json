{"title":"Submerges","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Submerges","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\nMonsters with the '''Sumberges''' flag are hidden from the player, until they become adjacent to you for the first time. While hidden, submerged monsters are undetectable, even if in clear [[LOS]] of the player.\n\nThis is usually seen when monsters dip below [[water]] or [[lava]], where they can only remain submerged while they are on a water/lava tile (respectively). [[Trapdoor spider]]s can hide inside ordinary dungeon tiles, however (think of it as burrowing underneath the floor).\n\n==History==\n*The submerging mechanic was removed in [[0.22]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], monsters with this flag could resubmerge if the player managed to escape their notice.\n\n===See Also===\n[[:Category:Submerges | List of monsters that can submerge or hide]]\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

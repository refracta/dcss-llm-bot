{"title":"Ring of teleportation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ring_of_teleportation","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{item\n |itemtype = Jewellery\n |name = Ring of teleportation\n |cost = ?\n}}\n{{flavour|A ring that occasionally exerts its power to teleport its wearer next to monsters.}}\n\nThe [[ring of teleportation]] induces [[teleportitis]] in its wearer so long as it is worn. It is always generated [[cursed]].\n\nTeleportitis only triggers when it would land the player in [[LOS]] of enemies.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Rings of teleportation are almost always bad items to wear, but they may see some potential, albeit risky use in [[stealth]]y stabbers. Note that this ring will not always place the player directly next to a monster, but it does not immediately alert resting monsters to your presence, either. The risk probably outweighs the benefit, especially when considering the value of other available rings.\n*Teleportitis does not trigger in the [[Gauntlet]]. It also does not function in the [[Abyss]].\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], rings of teleportation were removed.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], rings of teleportation could be evoked to teleport, so they were not completely harmful items.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], teleportitis would randomly translocate the player to another location on the map, instead of next to enemies.\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

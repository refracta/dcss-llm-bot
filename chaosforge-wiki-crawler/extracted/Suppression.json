[[Curse]]d items cannot be unequipped under suppression, and any negative effects from unequipping an item ([[vampiric]], [[distortion]]) happen as usual.\n\n[[Moths of suppression]] emit an aura of suppression, inflicting this status to anything inside.\n\n==History==\n*Suppression was added in [[0.12]] and removed in [[0.14]]."}

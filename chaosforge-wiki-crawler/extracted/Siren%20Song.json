Leaving the caster's line of sight will end the effect.}}\n'''Siren Song''' is a monster-only ability that attempts to [[mesmerise]] the player. Mesmerise prevents the player from intentionally moving away from the singer, and prevents [[berserk]]. It can be resisted by [[willpower]], but does not require line of fire.\n\nYou can end mesmerise by disabling the caster ([[confusion]], [[petrification]], [[silence]], etc.) or by breaking [[line of sight]] of the caster.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.20]], creating a sufficiently loud enough noise, such by reading [[scroll of noise]] or casting [[Lightning Bolt]], could break the mesmerisation. \n*Prior to version [[0.16]], this ability could force the player to draw closer to the caster in addition to mesmerising them. That ability has since been moved to [[Avatar Song]] with the renaming of mermaids and sirens into sirens and merfolk avatars, respectively."}

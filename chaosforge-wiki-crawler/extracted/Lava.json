{"title":"Lava","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lava","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|An intensely hot pool of molten rock, emitting clouds of sulphurous smoke. Nothing but the mythical salamander can cross this without flight.}}\n\n'''Lava''' is a type of terrain that is impassible for players without [[flight]]. Only certain monsters, like [[lava snake]]s and [[list of nagas|salamanders]], can inhabit lava without flight.\n__NOTOC__\n===Falling in===\nLava will instantly kill non-flying monsters who fall into it. Non-flying players who are stuck in lava instead enter emergency flight, which inflicts [[drain]]ing (~3% max HP) for every turn spent.\n\nKnockback effects like [[Primal Wave]] or [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] cannot push things into lava - the tile is treated as a wall instead. Monsters can fall in if they are [[confused]], or if [[Polar Vortex]] flings them in. Players won't stumble into lava while confused; they can only \"fall in\" if temporary [[flight]] runs out. Fortunately, you will receive a warning if your flight source is expiring. \n\nItems dropped in lava are lost forever, including [[artefact]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*You can use [[confusion]] to your advantage (e.g. [[Confusing Touch]], [[Mephitic Cloud]]) by targeting monsters near lava. They may attempt to cross it and fall in, killing them instantly. Keep in mind that this will also destroy their equipment in the process.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], lava would melt the icy enchantments of [[Ozocubu's Armour]] and [[Icemail]].\n*Prior to [[0.20]], [[freezing vapour]]s would melt faster over lava.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], falling into lava meant [[instant death]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], you could accidentally step into lava while confused.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

{"title":"Arbitrary Unit of Mass","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Arbitrary_Unit_of_Mass","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\nAn '''aum''' ('''Arbitrary Unit of Mass''') is the standard unit of weight in Crawl. It has no real-world equivalent; item weights are generally assigned according to game balance rather than realism. \n\nPlayers have a carrying capacity of <code>100 + (25 * [[strength]])</code> aum. If you are above capacity, you'll gain the [[encumbered]] condition.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.15]], DCSS lost all concept of weight. Now, the only limitation of the inventory is the 52-slot limit. \n*Prior to [[0.13]], players could carry up to <code>30 * strength</code> aum.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], players could only carry <code>10 * strength</code> aum.\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]\n[[Category:World]]"}

They are worn on the feet, and cover all but the largest hooves or talons.}}\n\n'''Boots''' are a form of [[armour]] worn in a character's feet slot. They provide a small amount of [[AC]] (especially when enchanted, max +2) and can have any of the following [[ego]]s:\n*[[Flight (ego)|Flight]]: Allows the wearer to [[fly]]\n*[[Stealth]]: +50 [[stealth]]\n*[[Rampaging]]: Take a free step when moving directly towards an enemy.\n\n==Restrictions==\nIf you have a rank 3 [[Hooves]] [[mutation]] or the [[Talons]] mutation, you may not wear boots. Characters with fewer ranks of those mutations can freely wear boots, but doing so will disable the associated [[auxiliary attack]].\n\n[[Merfolk]] may wear boots, but they will merge into their tail when they enter water.\n\nThe following [[species]] can never wear boots:\n*[[Armataur]]\n*[[Felid]]\n*[[Naga]]\n*[[Octopode]]\n*[[Oni]]\n*[[Spriggan]]\n*[[Tengu]]\n*[[Troll]]\n\nNagas and Armataurs may wear [[barding]] in their feet slot instead.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], boots could generate with the [[running]] ego.\n*The [[rampaging]] ego was added in [[0.26]].\n*The boots of the Assassin were removed in [[0.25]], replaced by the [[hood of the Assassin]].\n*The [[jumping]] [[ego]] was removed in [[0.16]].\n*The [[boots of the spider]] were removed in [[0.15]] along with the [[cling]]ing mechanic for players.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], [[Racial equipment|elven variant]] boots existed, weighing less and adding +20 stealth along with any other benefits the boots may have provided. Also, boots of jumping and the boots of the spider were introduced in [[0.14]].\n*The original boots of the Assassin were removed in [[0.13]], only to return with new mechanics in [[0.14]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], boots of flight were instead boots of [[levitation]], which were similar but had several limitations.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[Image:Boots 1.png]] [[Image:Boots 1b.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[Image:Boots 2.png]] [[Image:Boots 3.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[Image:Boots 4.png]] [[Image:Boots 5.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]] boots\n|-\n| '''[[Seven-league boots]]''' || [[File:Seven-league boots.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Mountain boots]]''' || [[File:Mountain boots.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Boots]]"}

The layout of the current floor is fully mapped, and everything within a moderate radius, including both visible and invisible monsters, is momentarily shown.}}\n\nReading a '''scroll of revelation''' causes three effects:\n*Reveals the entire map of the current level. This includes all walls, stairs, [[portal]]s, [[shop]]s, and [[trap]]s.\n*Allows the caster to see through [[wall]]s and opaque [[cloud]]s for exactly 1 turn. (It wears off the moment you do another action.)\n*Reveals [[invisible]] monsters, again for exactly 1 turn.\n\nThis scroll cannot be used in [[the Abyss]].\n\n==Strategy==\nYou can use the scroll of revelation for ''either'' the map reveal or the wall reveal. The map reveal helps in the long-term\n\nThe wall-reveal is useful when:\n*You need to [[rest]], and cannot retreat to a safe location. Revelation can help you determine if resting is safe / how much time you have until the next fight. For example, if you spot a monster, but its far away, you can drink a [[potion of ambrosia]] for fast HP/MP regeneration.\n**This is most useful when you are [[teleport]]ed or [[shaft]]ed to an unknown location. Also, it can help when tackling hectic floors like [[Vaults]]:5. If you have the option of going upstairs or retreating backwards, do that instead of reading this scroll.\n*You are forced to retreat to an unknown area and want to know what's next.\n*You are mid-battle and want to know if you can [[wand of digging|dig]] through a wall safely. (Since digging through a wall may reveal monsters behind it.)\n\nThe map-reveal effect is useful when:\n*You are hit by [[shaft]]s or [[teleport trap]]s. This will reveal the location of nearby [[stair]]s, allowing you to escape back to safety.\n*Reaching [[portal]] levels, such as [[Gauntlet]]s and [[Ice cave]]s, before they expire.\n*If you want to skip a floor from Dungeon: 8-12, you can check if the [[Lair]] and/or the [[Orcish Mines]] are on the floor you'd plan to skip.\n\nIf you have spare scrolls, they can be used for:\n*On Dungeon: 4-7, if you haven't found a [[god]] yet, you may want to use these scrolls in order to search for the [[Temple]].\n*If you plan on ninja'ing a [[rune]], using revelation can help find the rune vault.\n*If you have spare scrolls by the time you reach [[Zot]], you might as well use them.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], these scrolls were known as '''scrolls of magic mapping'''. They only revealed the floor's layout; they didn't let you see through walls and didn't reveal invisible creatures for 1 turn.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], scrolls of magic mapping did not reveal [[trap]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], this scroll would not detect secret doors, although these doors were removed in [[0.12]].\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

This makes reading scrolls, casting spells, invoking divine abilities, or shouting impossible in the reader's vicinity. The scroll's oppressive, unnatural effect will greatly hamper stealth.\n\nCertain monsters have innate magical or special abilities which will still be usable while silenced.\n\nThe effect starts out with a large radius, which will then shrink, eventually covering only the reader, before it times out.}}\n\nReading a '''scroll of silence''' creates a radius 4 or 5 [[aura]] of silence around you, as though you had just cast the spell [[Silence]] at a [[spell power]] of 30. This prevents all things inside the aura (including you) from casting spells, reading [[scroll]]s, [[t]]alking to your allies, shouting for attention, or [[pray]]ing. The scroll has a roughly 30 turn duration, but as time passes, the radius of the silence aura will shrink.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Although this disables many player abilities, it may be worth accepting that handicap to apply it to nearby enemies as well, particularly when dealing with dangerous [[unique]] casters or the deadlier [[list of mummies|mummies]]. Be aware, however, that the aura's radius will gradually shrink (eventually only affecting you).\n*Note that some monsters will be completely immune to the effect. This includes all [[demon]]s.\n*The unnatural silence generated by this scroll will hinder your player's [[Stealth]].\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.30]], the formula of the [[Silence]] spell changed, resulting in the scroll having a higher duration.\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

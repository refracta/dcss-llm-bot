{"title":"Habitat","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Habitat","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\nA creature's '''habitat''' determines what tiles it can traverse through without [[flight]].\n*Land: Cannot travel through [[deep water]] or [[lava]]. Receives penalties in [[shallow water]], unless flying or [[large]]-/[[giant]]- sized.\n**Fake Amphibious: [[Giant]] monsters with land habitat can travel through deep water, but without immunity to drowning.\n*Amphibious: Can travel through both land and water without penalty. Grants immunity to [[drowning]].\n*Water: Can only travel in water, both shallow and deep. Grants immunity to [[drowning]].\n*Amphibious lava: Can travel through land and lava without penalty. Receives penalties in [[shallow water]] unless flying or large-/giant- sized.\n*Lava: Can only travel in lava.\n\nAlmost everything in the game has either a land or amphibious habitat.\n\nIf a monster is dropped into deep water or lava without a suitable habitat, and it does not have [[flight]], it will instantly die. E.g. land, amphibious, and water habitat monsters without flight will instantly die when entering a lava tile. If a player enters an unsuitable tile without flight, they are [[drain]]ed for every turn until they escape.\n\nIf a water habitat monster is outside water, or a lava habitat monster outside lava, it will flop around. When a monster is flopping, it takes damage every turn, moves randomly, and will try to seek to re-enter water/lava."}

{"title":"Summon Cactus Giant","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summon_Cactus_Giant","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Sumon Cactus Giant''' is a Level 6 [[Summonings]] spell, which summons a titular [[cactus giant]]. These animated cacti attack extremely slowly, but are [[spiny]] and have remarkably high [[HP]] to boot.\n\n==Useful Info==\nA single [[cactus giant]] is summoned. When attacked in melee, cactus giants will retaliate with 5d8 damage. This damage cannot miss, but is reduced by [[AC]]. Any individual monster can only be harmed by spines once per monster turn, even if they have multiple attacks (such as [[hydra]]s).\n\nHigher spellpower increases the cactus giant's hit points; it doesn't increase [[HD]]. Their base HP is set to <code>27 + <power></code>, which is then randomized like any other monsters HP.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-summoning.cc|150}}</ref> \n\nDuration of the summon is around 27 turns, it does not depend on the spell power.\n\nThere is a summon cap of 1 cactus giant; casting the spell again will cause the old summon to very quickly time out.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Cactus giants are, effectively, a leveled up version of [[Summon Guardian Golem]]. While they don't [[Inner Flame|explode]], they fulfill the same tanky retaliatory summon role that they do. Their low [[EV]] helps with this role; projectiles are likely to hit them.\n*Despite what it may seem on paper, cactus giants actually 'deal' respectable damage in melee. Melee being the keyword here, as ranged attacks don't activate spines.\n*Spines can only affect hostile monsters once per round. While a cactus giant can still take out a regular [[hydra]] quite easily, don't expect one to obliterate [[the Lernaean hydra]] in one turn.\n\n==History==\n*Summon Cactus Giant was added in [[0.28]].\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

{"title":"Deep elf master archer","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Deep_elf_master_archer","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n{{list of | deep elves}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful info==\n'''Deep elf master archers''' are deadly marksmen, dealing heavy ranged damage at lightning speed with their [[bow]]s. Unlike most deep elves, they have no magical capabilities to speak of. They can be found almost exclusively guarding the treasure rooms on the lowest floor of the [[Elven Halls]]. \n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Barring exceptional defenses, deep elf master archers with a clear line of fire will deal staggering amounts of damage very quickly (all the more so if they have a [[brand]]ed bow). If you're playing a character who has trouble taking a hit or two, do what you can to keep ''something'' in the way of their arrows at all times unless you're actively killing them. A flood of summons works well, though weak ones will likely be mowed down almost as fast as you can generate them. Any [[smite]]-targeted spell, however, is perfect here.\n*Luring master archers around a corner is highly preferable to charging headlong into a stream of arrows. Fighting them from a [[kill hole]] is even better, but kill holes don't last long around [[deep elf elementalist]]s.\n*Unlike with some other archers (eg [[centaur]]s), if you are adjacent to a deep elf master archer, they will ''not'' switch to a melee weapon, making them no less deadly at point-blank range. Of course, if you've got the archer next to you, then you can freely pummel them to death; they're lightly armoured and only moderately evasive.\n*If you've found a [[scarf]] of [[Repel Missiles#Player sources|repulsion]], the Elven Halls is a good place to wear it. [[Reflection]] and a good [[SH]] score can also be a boon here.\n*If you have [[curare]] [[dart]]s, this is a good time to use them, either to escape the pummeling or slow down the rate of fire to achieve a kill.\n*A [[scroll of fear]] can get a master archer off your back long enough to regroup, but not reliably; you'll probably need more than one and had better have reasonable [[HP]] to begin with.\n\n[[Category:Elf]]"}

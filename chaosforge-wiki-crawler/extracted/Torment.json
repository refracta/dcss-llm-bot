{"title":"Torment","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Torment","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}} \n'''Torment''' is a difficult-to-resist effect that cuts the [[HP]] of its targets by half.\n\n==Useful Info==\nTorment reduces the target's HP by 50% of its current value. Specifically, torment deals damage equal to <code>50% * current HP - 1</code>, rounded down, so it leaves targets at 1-2 points above half health.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|spl-goditem.cc|1068}}</ref> It can never bring targets below 3 HP. This damage can be reduced by various means, and a few ways make you entirely immune.\n\nTorment's \"50% HP\" does not account for your MP if you have [[spirit shield]]. However, spirit shield works as normal after the 50% HP is calculated. For example, if you have 200 HP and 20 MP, torment would deal 99 damage, bringing you to 110 HP and 11 MP.\n\n==Sources (Player)==\nYou can torment all creatures in [[LOS]], both yourself and monsters, with:\n*Reading a [[scroll of torment]]\n*Using [[Kikubaaqudgha]]'s Torment ability. \n*Incurring Kikubaaqudgha's wrath.\n\nYou can torment only monsters in LOS by:\n*Drawing a [[Pain card|Pain]] card from the [[deck of destruction]] (at [[Cards#Power_level|power level]] 2)\n*Attacking with the [[Sceptre of Torment]], 20% chance\n\nYou can face torment against only yourself in the following ways:\n*[[Xom]] will occasionally torment its followers\n*[[Nemelex Xobeh]]'s wrath may invoke the [[Torment card|Torment]] card against you\n*Suffering the [[death curse]] of a mummy\n\nThe spells [[Agony]] and [[Agony Range]] (monster only) also halve HP, just like torment, but only against a single target. These spells can be resisted entirely with high [[willpower]].\n\n==Sources (Monster)==\n{{monsters with spell|Symbol of Torment}}\n\nThis monster invokes torment upon its death:\n*{{monsterlink|Lurking horror}}\n\nMonsters won't cast [[Symbol of Torment]] if their target is immune to it. Friendly monsters, such as those summoned from the [[sceptre of Asmodeus]], won't cast Symbol of Torment while you are in their LOS.\n\nIf a monster invokes torment, you will see the message\n{{crawlquote|\"The <monster> calls on the powers of darkness!\"}}\n\n==Resistance==\nThere are only a few sources of torment resistance, which all stack:\n*[[Negative energy resistance]]. Each rN+ reduces damage by 10% (i.e. -5% of your current HP). That's -45% current HP at rN+, -40% HP at rN++, and -35% HP at rN+++.\n*[[Kikubaaqudgha]] can shield you from torment. At max piety, there's a 33% chance to block torment entirely, and an 80% chance to reduce it by a random number (from 1 to damage dealt).\n*Being a [[Gargoyle]] or in [[Statue Form]] halves torment damage.\n*The second rank of the [[demonspawn mutation]], [[Hurl Damnation (mutation)|Hurl Damnation]] halves torment damage.\n\n'''Torment immunity:'''\n*Being [[undead]] ([[Ghoul]], [[Mummy]], bloodless [[Vampire]], or through [[Death Form]]).\n*The following [[form]]s:\n**[[Tree Form]]\n**[[Wisp Form]]\n**[[Dithmenos]]' [[Shadow Form]]\n*Being [[Petrified]] (though this prevents you from acting at all).\n\nAlso, [[Death's Door]] makes you immune to all damage, including torment.\n\nMonsters with rN+++ (including all [[undead]], [[demonic]], [[nonliving]], and [[holy]] monsters) are immune to torment.\n\n==Strategy==\nTorment is an extremely deadly effect: no matter how strong your character is, losing half your HP stings. It is one of the main threats in the [[extended]], though you'll find torment in a few earlier places as well.\n\nBeyond being immune to it, there are a few 'common sense' methods to avoiding torment:\n*Blocking [[LOS]] from monsters. If they can't see you, they can't torment you! A [[scroll of fog]], simply closing a door, retreating at speed, or teleporting away can be the wisest option if unprepared to deal with multiple torment-capable enemies, especially if there are [[smiting]]- or [[damnation]]-capable monsters around.\n*Fighting torment-capable monsters one at a time. Usually, you can't kill everything in one turn. Fighting monsters alone gives monsters less time to torment you. Use [[kill hole]]s if possible.\n*Prioritizing torment-capable monsters. If you are around full HP, torment is likely to deal more damage than any regular attack, so it makes sense to kill users of torment first.\n*Monster specific vulnerabilities:\n**Most users of torment are immune to [[silence]]. However, [[mummy priest]]s, [[royal mummies]], [[Menkaure]], and [[Khufu]] ''are'' affected by silence. Be careful when in [[Tomb]], as more tormentors can show up outside the silence radius. Take advantage of terrain to prevent this.\n**The \"[[tormentor]]\" monster cannot see [[invisible]]. Being invisible won't grant immunity, but if a tormentor can't see any enemies, it's much less likely to cast torment. (Note that if a torment-vulnerable [[summon]] is in sight, the tormentor will cast as normal.)\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the second rank of the [[Black Mark (mutation)|Black Mark]] [[demonspawn mutation]] had a 50% chance to completely negate any instance of torment, and the [[Hurl Damnation (mutation)|Hurl Damnation]] mutation had no torment resistance.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the [[Pain card]] did not have a torment effect.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], the [[Sceptre of Torment]] did not protect the wielder from its torment.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], stepping on a [[Zot trap]] could also invoke torment as a random miscast.  When Zot traps were given their own special set of effects in 0.13, torment was not included.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], players could also cast [[Symbol of Torment]] as a L6 Necromancy spell.  The spell would not work for players immune to torment.\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

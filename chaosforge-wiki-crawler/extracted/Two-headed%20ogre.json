{"title":"Two-headed ogre","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Two-headed_ogre","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of|ogres}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Two-headed ogres''' are a stronger version of regular [[Ogre (monster)|ogres]]. In addition to their two heads they have the ability to dual wield their [[giant club]]s and [[giant spiked club]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Two-headed ogres, thanks to their double heavy weapons, hit significantly harder (twice as hard) than their single headed counterparts. It is fully possible for pre-[[Lair]] characters to receive lethal damage if they spend a single turn in melee with one.\n*Most ways of handling their [[ogre (monster)|one-headed counterparts]] apply. They have still no resistances, attack slowly, and only have moderate [[willpower]].\n**[[Tukima's Dance]] can be very useful against two-headed ogres.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], they could hit for up to 28 and 18 damage instead of 20 and 15 damage.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], they could hit for 20 and 15 base damage in melee, but took only 1.3 turns to swing.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], two-headed ogres did not have innately slow attacks, but their giant clubs most often slowed them down.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], two-headed ogres were more common in earlier dungeon levels.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], two-headed ogres were weaker and resembled regular ogres in sturdiness, just with two weapons."}

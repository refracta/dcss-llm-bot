{"title":"Soul Splinter","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Soul_Splinter","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Soul Splinter''' is a level 1 [[Necromancy]] spell that targets an enemy in range and attempts to break off a fragment of its soul to create a [[soul wisp]]. [[Necromancer]]s begin with this spell memorised.\n\n==Useful Info==\nIf the spell passes a [[willpower]] check, and the target can be [[spectral thing|spectralised]], a [[soul wisp]] will be created adjacent to the target with 7-11 HP and HD equal to <code>target's HD + 1</code>. Soul wisp's melee damage is <code>2 + HD</code>. The soul wisp will fixate on the target, similar to [[Haunt]].\n\nThe target is also [[weak]]ened for about 18 turns. <!-- TODO: determine duration of weaken -->\n\n==Strategy==\n\n==History==\nAdded in [[0.32]], replacing [[Necrotise]]."}

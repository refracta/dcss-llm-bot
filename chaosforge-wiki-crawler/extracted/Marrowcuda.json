{"title":"Marrowcuda","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Marrowcuda","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Marrowcudas''' are flying [[undead]] fish that can summon copies of itself when biting enemies. Each marrowcuda can have up to 8 clones. If the original marrowcuda is destroyed, all of its clones will immediately disappear. They appear in the early [[Dungeon]] and [[ossuary|ossuaries]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Marrowcudas' attacks can only create clones if they do damage. Therefore, heavily armoured characters are less likely to get swarmed by clones.\n*Try to target the original marrowcuda if possible. Piercing or AOE attacks shine.\n\n==History==\n*Marrowcudas were added in [[0.32]] with a new '''AF_SWARM''' attack flavour."}

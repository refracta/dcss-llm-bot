{"title":"Unarmed Combat","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Unarmed_Combat","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n__NOTOC__\nThe '''Unarmed Combat''' ('''UC''') skill determines the effectiveness of all attacks made with your character's fists, [[claws]], [[Octopode|tentacles]], and other forelimbs. It increases the damage, [[accuracy]], and [[attack speed|speed]] of your unarmed attacks. It does not boost [[auxiliary attack]]s, except for the off-hand punch done without a shield.\n\nYour fists do not normally benefit from weapon [[brand]]s and definitely don't have [[artefact]] properties. However, training Unarmed Combat gives a special bonus to base damage, and can benefit from [[talisman]] forms.\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nBy default, Unarmed Combat has a base damage of 3, [[to-hit|accuracy]] of +6, [[attack delay|base delay]] of 1.0 decaAut, and a [[mindelay]] of 0.5 decaAut (reached at 27 skill). UC itself functions like any other [[melee weapon]], though your fists cannot be [[enchant]]ed or [[brand]]ed normally.\n\nHowever, each level of Unarmed Combat skill gives different benefits than other weapon skills:\n\n* '''Damage:''' Each level of UC adds +1 to base damage, which is then multiplied by [[strength]] and [[Fighting]]. This is instead of the usual +2% per level boost.\n\n* '''Attack speed:''' Unarmed starts at 1.0 delay, and reaches its mindelay of 0.5 at 27 skill. Therefore, every 5.4 levels of UC reduces attack delay by 0.1 decaAut; each level of UC reduces delay by ~0.0185 decaAut. For comparison, it takes 2 levels of a weapon skill to reduce delay by 0.1 decaAut.\n: As with weapons, your attack delay will be rounded to an integer [[aut]] (i.e. rounding to 0.1 decaAut) in a weighted fashion.\n\n* Increases [[#Offhand punch|offhand punch]] damage and its chance to activate.\n\nThe [[to-hit]] boost is the same as other weapon skills (+0.5 to-hit per level).\n\n===Offhand punch===\nOffhand punches are an [[auxiliary attack]]. Most species are unable to use the offhand punch unless their offhand is empty, which means not wearing a [[shield]] or wielding a [[handedness|two-handed weapon]]. In addition, you can't make these punches in [[Flux Form]] or [[Serpent Form]]. [[Octopode]]s get tentacle slaps instead of offhand punches, and may slap even when their offhand is occupied.\n\nIf offhand punches/slaps are available, then increasing Unarmed skill increases the chance of an attack. At 0 skill, you have a 5% chance per attack to throw a punch, at 27 skill, you have a 50% chance. It scales linearly, meaning you are 1.67% more likely to proc a punch per skill level.\n\nOffhand punch damage equals:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|melee-attack.cc|1019}}</ref>\n 5 + (UC / 2)\n + 1d3 × [[Claws]] rank\n + 6 under [[Blade Form]]\n\n==Damage Modifiers==\nUnarmed Combat's base damage is modified by most [[transformations]], as well as the [[Claws]] mutation. In addition, many transformations have other special effects.\n\n'''General Modifiers'''\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; text-align: center; margin:0; padding:0;\"\t\n!

You don't need to find a weapon, meaning dungeon RNG can't screw you over. Unarmed Combat scales better with skill, so skill 27 unarmed is one of the strongest things in the game. And unarmed can be boosted further with various [[talisman]] forms. The downsides are, as mentioned, the inability to enchant or brand fists, and the poor stats at low skill.\n\nThe skill scaling of Unarmed Combat should be put into perspective. At 16 skill:\n*Unarmed Combat deals 19 base damage, and attacks at 0.7 delay.\n*A [[morningstar]] deals 17 damage (after M&F skill), and attacks at 0.7 delay. However, a morningstar can be [[enchant]]ed and [[brand]]ed. A +0 morningstar with just about any brand will surpass UC at this skill level.\n\nAt high enough skill, Unarmed Combat is around the level of the strongest two-handed weapons (before considering forms). But that's a huge chunk of the game where you are weaker, equal to, or just slightly better than a weapon wielder.\n\nMany forms have high base damage, so you don't need to train ''that'' much Unarmed Combat skill to effectively use them. For example, [[Dragon Form]] has 24 + UC base damage, assuming 16 [[Shapeshifting]] skill. Even at 5 UC skill, that's enough to pulverize your enemies. Of course, you should still train at least some skill, to boost accuracy and speed of your attacks.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Unarmed Combat only had a base accuracy of +2. However, having [[Claws]] or being in most [[transformation]]s provided a hidden extra bonus to accuracy.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], certain forms ([[Blade Hands]], [[Statue Form]], [[Dragon Form]]) scaled their unarmed damage with [[strength]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], unarmed combat attack delay was penalized by [[body armour]]. Also, trolls' claws could inflict the now-removed [[bleeding]] status.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], Unarmed Combat gave a chance to perform kick and headbutt [[auxiliary attack]]s, if you didn't already have [[Hooves]] / [[Horns]] to do so. The off-hand punch was slightly weaker (<code>5 + UC/3</code>).\n*Prior to [[0.7]], Unarmed Combat improved the performance of your non-punch auxiliary attacks, giving all melee fighters a reason to train it.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Skills}}\n\n[[Category:Skills]]"}

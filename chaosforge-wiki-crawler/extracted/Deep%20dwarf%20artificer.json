Like all deep dwarves, they do not regenerate health naturally. They can occasionally be found in the packs of [[deep dwarf (monster)|deep dwarves]] roaming the Abyss or occasionally in [[vault]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nAn artificer's difficulty depends entirely on what kind of wand or rod it's carrying. An artificer with a [[rod of Striking]] is no threat at all, whereas one with a [[rod of Destruction]] can be terrifying. That being said, well-armed artificers carry excellent loot.\n\n==History==\nDeep dwarf artificers were removed in [[0.13]].\n\n[[Category:Dwarf]]\n[[Category:Obsolete_monsters]]"}

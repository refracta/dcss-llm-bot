It is a [[smite-targeted]], range-4 spell that deals high damage for its level. But if the spell hits, then the caster is inflicted with the the '''-Move''' [[status effect]] for 5-8 turns. This prevents regular movement, physical player abilities like [[Barachim|hopping]], and casting this spell again. It does not prevent other types of Translocations from working.\n\nIf a [[status effect]] prevents you from moving, you cannot cast Momentum Strike. In addition to '''-Move''', you cannot cast this spell if you are '''Stuck''' (from [[miscast effects|miscasting]] a Translocations spell) or if you are in [[Tree Form]].\n\n[[Reaver]]s start with this spell in their libraries.\n*[[Book of Spatial Translocations]]\n\n==Strategy==\nMomentum Strike is essentially a spell with a lengthy cooldown (one which prevents you from moving). It is best thought of as a support spell: cast this spell once or twice per encounter for some extra damage. In terms of raw damage, Momentum Strike is roughly equal to [[Stone Arrow]], though it costs 2 MP rather than 3 MP. \n\nSince this spell prevents you from moving for a few turns, it is best to position yourself ''before'' casting it. Try to be around hallways, and try to avoid other monsters from appearing. [[Stair dancing]] beforehand is helpful.\n\nNote that this spell can miss, unlike most smite-targeted spells.\n\n==History==\n*This spell was added in [[0.30]]."}

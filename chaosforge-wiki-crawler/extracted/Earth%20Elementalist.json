More earthen spells are in their set of starting spells.}}\n'''Earth Elementalists''' are mages with a preference for [[Earth Magic]].\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Deep Elf]], [[Spriggan]], [[Gargoyle]], [[Demigod]], [[Ghoul]] and [[Octopode]] are the recommended species if you pick an Earth Elementalist Background.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[robe]]\n*[[Potion of magic]]\n\n'''Available Spells:'''\n*[[Sandblast]]\n*[[Passwall]]\n*[[Stone Arrow]]\n*[[Brom's Barrelling Boulder]]\n*[[Petrify]]\n\nEarth elementalists start with the [[Sandblast]] spell already memorised.\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Stealth]]: 2\n*[[Spellcasting]]: 2\n*[[Conjurations]]: 1\n*[[Earth Magic]]: 3\n\nChoosing Earth Elementalist adds 7 to your starting [[Intelligence]] and 5 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nAn Earth Elementalist's bread and butter consists of two fairly standard damage spells. They have standard beam targeting, aren't countered by a specific resistance, and are perfectly serviceable in the damage department. But what differentiates EE from a more boombastic school, like [[Fire Elementalist]], is Earth Magic's tendency toward utility. [[Bombard]] has a chance to move you away from your target, while [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]] constricts a line of enemies.\n\n===Spell Details===\n[[Sandblast]] is your level 1 spell. It deals more damage than most level 1 spells, but it's low range, inaccurate, and slow to cast. For reference, enemies will get 3 attacks for every 2 Sandblasts. Also, it is poor against foes with high AC.\n\nAt level 3, you gain [[Stone Arrow]]. It's a competent damage spell - nothing special, though no monster resists it. Sandblast is still useful, however. It deals a similar amount of damage, but costs 1 MP instead of Stone Arrow's 3 MP. The advantage of Stone Arrow is that it's cast at normal speed, so it deals more damage per turn. Once you get a decent MP reserve, you should rely on Stone Arrow for its faster kill speed.\n\n[[Brom's Barrelling Boulder]] is a more complex damage spell. It creates a boulder that knocks back enemies, dealing damage each time. It is damaged each time it collides with an enemy; it also explodes when it hits a wall or leaves your line of sight. These features make Brom's Barrelling Boulder less consistent than Stone Arrow, but more useful for [[kiting]].\n\n[[Petrify]] offers an entirely different kind of spell for EE, being very similar to [[Hexes]]. After a few turns, your opponent will be unable to act. It enables a playstyle of [[stab]]bing - and it can work for a while in the stead of more conventionally offensive spells.\n\nIt's often easy to forget that Passwall exists, but it can be a lifesaver in quite a few situations. It takes a few turns to act, but you'll ''pass'' through ''walls'', to the other side. It remains useful in various niches for most of the game, including the [[orb run]].\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*You can create passwall-able corridors with a [[wand of digging]], for future use.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Earth Elementalists started with 1 in [[Transmutations]] instead of Conjurations. [[Brom's Barrelling Boulder]] was also introduced in this version.\n*In [[0.29]], most backgrounds were buffed; all Mage backgrounds gained a [[potion of magic]]. They also lost 30 [[stone]]s (which were required for [[Sandblast]]).\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Earth Elementalists started with the [[Book of Geomancy]], and had [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]]. \n*Prior to [[0.19]], Earth Elementalists started with 20 stones instead of 30. The increase was to compensate for the fact that sandblast now requires a stone for every cast.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Earth Elementalists only started with 1 level of Spellcasting.\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

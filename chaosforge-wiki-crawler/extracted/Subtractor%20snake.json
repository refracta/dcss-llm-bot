{"title":"Subtractor snake","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Subtractor_snake","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n'''Subtractor snakes''' were a monster briefly considered for inclusion in ''Crawl''.  They were, in essence, fast and dangerous snakes with attacks similar to that of a [[Killer Klown]].  They mainly appeared in the Realm of Zot.  There was little to differentiate them from Klowns, so they were removed.\n\nThe name was likely a pun on [[adder]]s.\n\n[[Category:Monsters]]"}

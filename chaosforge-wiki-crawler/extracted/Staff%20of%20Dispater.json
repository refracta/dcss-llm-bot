However, it comes at a cost to [[HP]] and [[MP]]:\n\n{{crawlquote|'''Spell Power''': [[Evocations]]Ã—8<br>'''Damage''': 3d(8+Spell Power/5)<br>'''Cost''': 10% HP, 4 MP <br>'''Restrictions''': You cannot use this ability if you are under the effects of [[Death's Door]].}}\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''staff of Dispater'''<ref>{{source ref|0.29.1|art-data.txt|350}}</ref> is a powerful [[artefact]] [[staff]] which contains dangerous demonic magic. It can only be acquired by slaying [[Dispater]], the lord of the [[Iron City of Dis]]. It is considered an [[evil]] item, so the [[good gods]] frown on its use.\n\nVery few things can resist damnation damage (it's mainly just the [[demon]]s that use damnation themselves), making the staff of Dispater a useful weapon against all manner of end-game monsters. Damnation is particularly helpful against monsters with high defenses (whether high [[AC]], [[EV]], resistance/immunity to multiple elements, or a combination of the above). Of course, if you have this staff, you've managed to successfully kill one of the lords of [[Hell]]; chances are you have other ways of fighting highly durable creatures that don't cost you HP every time you use them.\n\nYou can improve your melee performance with this staff by training [[Fighting]] and [[Staves]], though by the time you're capable of killing Dispater, you'll have found any number of weapons that are far more effective than an unbranded +4 [[staff]].\n\n==See Also==\n[[Damnation]]<br>\n[[:Category:Damnation resistance]]\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.30]], the staff of Dispater was converted into an [[orb]], the [[orb of Dispater]].\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the staff could be activated from the [[v|evoke]] menu instead of the [[a]]bilities menu. Also, the cost of firing damnation was changed from 14 HP and 4 MP to 10% HP and 4 MP.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Staves]]"}

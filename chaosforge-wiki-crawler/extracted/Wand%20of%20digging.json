It also affects [[Statue#Inanimate statues|inanimate statue]]s, [[iron grate]]s, and petrified [[Wall#Petrified_Trees|tree]]s. Digging has no effect on non-rock walls, such as [[Wall#Stone|stone walls]], [[Wall#Metal|metal walls]], [[Wall#Crystal|crystal walls]], [[Wall#Unnaturally_Hard_Wall|\"unnaturally hard\" walls]], nor does it affect non-rock impediments such as [[Wall#Trees|trees]], [[Wall#Mangroves|mangroves]], [[bush]]es, or [[briar patch]]es. In any case, you can't dig past the edge of the map. This wand does not benefit from [[Evocations]] skill.\n\n==Strategy==\nWands of digging let you create corridors and [[killhole]]s virtually anywhere with rock walls. Fighting enemies one-at-a-time is a vital tactic in ''Crawl'' - it'll turn unwinnable fights into something you can manage. It also be used to dig escape routes, create a path to otherwise inaccessible areas, or (if you have spare charges) create routes to enemies. \n\nWands of digging are rare and come with few charges, so use them wisely. Also, beware: digging into a wall may reveal new monsters on the other side, perhaps making your situation worse.\n\n===Corridors and Killholes===\nThe code block below illustrates what corridors and killholes look like when dug with the wand. A corridor only costs 1 charge and allows you to melee enemies 1 at a time, and allows your [[penetration|piercing]] attacks to hit multiple monsters. A killhole costs 1-2 charges, depending on location and has the advantage of preventing distant enemies from using [[smite-targeted]] attacks.\n\n Corridor:    Killhole:\n ..####.#     ..####.#\n ..###@##     ..###.##\n ..##.###     ...#@###\n ..#.####     ..#.####\n ...#####     ..##.###\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Certain levels contain ''only'' stone or crystal walls, so it can be valuable to take account of that fact upon entering such levels.\n*Even [[Formicid]]s can benefit from a wand of digging, as it digs tunnels without [[drain]]ing you.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.23]], wands of digging had significantly more charges.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], the wand could not be aimed past existing walls, reducing its precision.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], this wand could not destroy inanimate statues.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], this effect was also available through use of the level 4 [[Earth Magic]] spell [[Dig]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], monsters would never use wands of digging.\n\n{{wands}}"}

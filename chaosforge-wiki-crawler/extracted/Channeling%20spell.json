{"title":"Channeling spell","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Channeling_spell","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n''For passive MP recovery, see [[Channeling]].''\n\n'''Channeling spells''' are a group of spells that can be recast (\"channeled\") on subsequent turns by [[wait]]ing (with '''.''' or '''s'''). They include:\n*[[Searing Ray]]\n*[[Flame Wave]]\n*[[Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling]]\n\nBeing moved by any effect (an [[elephant]]'s trampling attack, the [[Primal Wave]] spell, an unintentional [[blink]], etc.) ends the channel, as does [[Silence]]. [[Paralysis]], [[confusion]], [[sleep]], and full [[petrification]] will pause channeling. \n\n==Useful Info==\nSearing Ray and Flame Wave cost the normal amount of MP for their initial cast, then 1 additional MP for every turn channeled. Searing Ray can be channeled up to three times, and Flame Wave, two (or three with [[Vehumet]]'s range increase). Channeling does not decrease damage or any other statistic of the spell.\n\nMaxwell's Capacitive Coupling instead uses channeling as a timer; after 3-7 turns waiting, it'll activate and instantly kill the closest enemy. It doesn't use any MP past the initial cast.\n\nThe [[amulet of the acrobat]] works with all channeled spells, as you are considered waiting (even if you are dealing damage).\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

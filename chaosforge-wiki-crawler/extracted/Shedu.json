When you wound (or kill) one, the remaining shedu will heal (or resurrect!) its partner.  \n\nOnce you kill a shedu, its partner senses this and will always wake up. When a shedu has [[line of sight]] to its partner's corpse, it attempts a resurrection (this takes several turns). It even affects shedu corpses that you are carrying in your inventory. This special ability is not a spell and cannot be negated in any way so long as the second shedu lives. \n\nSince shedus are holy beings, you risk suffering a player-centered [[cleansing flame]], care of [[The Shining One]], should you kill one. The probability of this occurring varies according to which type of god you worship. If you worship a good god, there is no risk (although if you worship TSO, you'll suffer [[penance]]). If you are atheistic, there's a 12.5% risk. If you worship an evil god, the risk is 27.1%.\n\n<!--spl-bot-begin-->\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Heal Other]] (2d6)\n|slot2=''none''\n|slot3=[[Heal Other]] (2d6)\n|slot4=''none''\n|slot5=''none''\n|slot6=''none''\n}}\n{{clear}}\n<!--spl-bot-end-->\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*To prevent shedu resurrection, always butcher or sacrifice shedu [[corpse]]s after you kill them.\n*Don't kill a shedu over [[deep water]]. Unless you are a [[merfolk]], [[octopode]], or gray [[draconian]], you won't be able to reach the corpse and the shedu may get a free resurrection.\n*If you worship an evil god and are low on HP, retreat rather than finish off a shedu; TSO's wrath may finish ''you'' off.\n\n==Trivia==\nThe [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamassu shedu] and the lamassu are Mesopotamian protective deities which served as gatekeepers, defending the homes of commoners and kings alike. Their images were engraved on tablets which were buried at each side of a home's entryway, or they were cast in metal as statues and placed in similar positions near a door.\n\n==History==\nShedus were removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

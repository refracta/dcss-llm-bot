{"title":"Actual spells","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Actual_spells","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n'''Actual spells''' is a flag for monsters that cast spells in the same way as players. These monsters are considered to be wizards: they are hated by [[Trog]] and their spells can be [[silence|silenced]].\n\n[[Priest]]s with the \"actual spells\" flag are also considered to be wizards; their abilities (such as [[smite]]) can be silenced and are hated by Trog.\n\nThe counterpart to actual spells is '''fake spells''': monsters with this flag (such as [[Mennas]] or [[orb of fire|orbs of fire]]) are not hated by Trog, and their spells cannot be silenced.  In this regard, fake spells behave more like [[abilities]], although the game processes them internally in the same manner as spells.\n\nSee the category below for a list of monsters that cast spells in this manner.\n\n[[Category:Actual spells]]\n\n==History==\nThis flag was rendered obsolete with [[0.16]]'s introduction of [[Spell slot flags]]. The Wizard flag was applied to monsters' spells in lieu of this flag."}

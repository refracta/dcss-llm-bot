If successful, it will become [[allied]] for a short time. Unlike [[summon]]ed monsters, charmed monsters can follow you up stairs, remaining loyal. Unlike most types of allies, charmed monsters can attack even if they are outside your [[line of sight]].\n\nIf used on the player, this wand inflicts [[confusion]] instead.\n\nThis wand is [[alternate items|mutually exclusive]] with the [[wand of paralysis]]; only one will appear in a given game.\n\n==Strategy==\nThis wand's uses are straightforward:\n*Charm the biggest monster in the group, who'll kill surrounding monsters for you. In the early game, nothing has serious willpower, so try to charm the strongest monsters first. For instance, you can hit an [[orc warrior]], use it to destroy the orc pack, then fight the now-wounded orc warrior in a 1v1 fight. (You can attack allied monsters in melee with '''v''' or '''ctrl-direction'''.)\n*Prevent a given monster from attacking you. When you charm a monster, it won't attack you, prevents other monsters from occupying its space, and even deals damage. In a hallway, a charmed creature will block traffic for a few turns. Great for dealing with pack enemies with low will, such as [[killer bee]]s and [[wolf spider]]s.\n\nAs you progress, more and more tough creatures will have high willpower, making this wand harder to use. Even in the late game, though, \"support\" monsters like [[death cob]]s and [[hellion]]s often have low will (and are prime targets for this wand).\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*If you charm a [[derived undead]] monster, it won't become hostile until the hex wears off. If there are no other enemies nearby to fight your new ally, you can safely punch the charmed monster until it's destroyed, and it won't turn hostile.\n*To get rid of a troublesome monster, you can charm it, and then [[shout|order i'''t''']] to '''r'''etreat. If you want to operate freely on the current level, go up/down the stairs with it following, order it to retreat, then use the stairs again.\n*If you're a D&D veteran, be aware that unlike in that game, charm effects in ''Crawl'' ''can'' work on the [[undead]] and \"mindless\" monsters like [[jelly|jellies]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], this wand did not [[alternate items|alternate]] with the wand of paralysis.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], this wand was called the '''wand of enslavement'''.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], it was impossible to enslave enemies hated by your god. For example, followers of [[Trog]] couldn't enslave [[:Category:Actual_spells|spellcasters]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], monsters could not use this wand (though players could still confuse themselves with it).\n\n{{wands}}"}

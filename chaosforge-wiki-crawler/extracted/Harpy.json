{"title":"Harpy","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Harpy","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Harpies''' are dangerous pack monsters that fly around in the same chaotic way [[bat]]s do, but deal significantly more damage. They can be found in [[the Shoals]], [[the Vaults]], and [[the Depths]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While heavily armoured characters should be able to soften the multiple attacks of harpies, lightly armoured characters can quickly take heavy damage from them, and escaping them on foot is impossible. Reading a [[scroll of fear]] is an excellent way to clear them away, giving you time to regroup or escape if necessary.\n*Their [[willpower]] is fairly low; any [[Hexes]]-specialist can hit them with whatever they want, and even untrained [[wand]] use has a decent chance of affecting them.\n*Attacks that affect multiple targets at once are a good idea against harpies, but they resist [[poison]], so [[Mephitic Cloud]] and [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] are not options. [[Fireball]] works just fine, however, as do enchantments such as [[Confusion]] or a [[wand of charming]]. Also, even a modestly powerful [[Airstrike]] should take them out in one or two hits.\n*Be very careful around [[derived undead|undead]] harpies: they lose the [[batty]] flag, changing them from hard-to-hit pests into something more akin to a nerfed [[Executioner]]. Luckily, undead harpies are fairly rare, but be wary of killing harpies around casters with [[Animate Dead]] or [[Simulacrum]]. Speaking of, also note that harpy simulacra can have horrifying damage output, though thankfully they are much rarer than skeletons or zombies.\n*You can summon your own band of harpies through use of the [[Monstrous Menagerie]] spell.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], harpies had an infuriating ability to destroy your [[food]] supplies; barring [[Jiyva]] worship, any attack of theirs would have a chance of destroying random food items in your [[inventory]]. Coupled with their habit of devouring any corpse they crossed paths with (and the fact that they could affect food and corpses at your feet), they were one of the more legitimate starvation threats in the game, as well as being fairly dangerous physical attackers.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], a popular tactic for dealing with harpies was to [[paralyse]] or [[petrify]] them over the deep water of the Shoals, which would kill them instantly."}

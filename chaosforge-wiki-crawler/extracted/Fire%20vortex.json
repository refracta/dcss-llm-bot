{"title":"Fire vortex","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fire_vortex","type":"raw","data":"{{version017}}\n{{list of | vortices}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Fire vortices''' are swirling clusters of flame that are created by the [[Fire Storm]] spell. Their melee attack deals 15-24 [[fire]] damage that ignores half of your [[AC]], but also hurts themselves for 10 damage. They move around fast, but randomly. Unless encountered early, fire vortices are mainly significant as blockers.\n\nFire vortices can also rarely appear by themselves in the [[Volcano]] and some [[vault]]s. They can also be created by fire [[miscast]]s."}

{"title":"Green death","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Green_death","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nA '''green death''' is a [[poison]]-themed [[tier-2 demon]]. It likes to pelt you with high-powered [[Poison Magic]], but is otherwise not too dangerous. They can be found in [[Pandemonium]], [[the Abyss]], and one [[Swamp]] end.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nEven characters with [[poison]] resistance will take damage and get poisoned by their Poison Arrow spells (unless you're undead), but it still cuts the damage you take from them tremendously.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

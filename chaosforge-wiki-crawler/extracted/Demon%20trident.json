It is a one-handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Demon tridents''' are the best one handed [[polearms]], dealing significantly more damage than regular [[trident]]s. Though a demon trident is slightly weaker than a [[demon blade]] or [[demon whip]], their [[reaching]] ability helps make them more desirable.\n\nWorshippers of [[good]] [[god]]s cannot attack with them without suffering [[penance]]. However, worshippers of [[the Shining One]] can convert a demon trident into a [[trishula]], with better stats and the [[holy wrath]] brand. You can reverse the process with [[Kikubaaqudgha]]'s or [[Lugonu]]'s blessing.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], demon tridents dealt slightly more damage than normal in the hands of [[demonspawn]] characters.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], demon tridents did 13 damage, but lacked innate [[reaching]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

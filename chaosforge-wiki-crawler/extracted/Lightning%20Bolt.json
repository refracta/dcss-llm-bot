{"title":"Lightning Bolt","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lightning_Bolt","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Fires a mighty bolt of lightning. Its damage bypasses half of defender's armour, and it can be bounced off walls to hit targets twice.}}\n'''Lightning Bolt''' is a monster-only spell which fires a somewhat inaccurate bolt of lightning, similar to [[Shock]]. This bolt can pierce through enemies. If the lightning bolt hits a rock or stone [[wall]], it will bounce back at an angle, potentially striking a target twice. See [[doublezap]] for more information.\n\nAs a property of BEAM_ELEC damage, it ignores 1/2 of enemy [[AC]]. It also creates a lot of [[noise]] and will set [[tree]]s on fire. \n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Lightning Bolt was a level 5 [[Conjurations]]/[[Air Magic]] spell that players could cast.\n\n{{Spell\n|name=Lightning Bolt\n|level=5\n|school1={{Conjurations}}\n|school2={{Air Magic}}\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Air]] \n*[[Book of Storms]]\n</div>\n|castingnoise=25\n|spellnoise=25\n}}\n{{AttackSpell\n|name=Lightning Bolt\n|formula = 1d(11+(Power*3)/5)\n|maxdmg = 1d131 [[electricity]]\n|maxsp = 200\n|range = 5 to 12\n|target = Bolt\n|tohit = 7+Power/40\n|special = [[Multizap]]<br>(Elec ignores 1/2 AC)\n|hit_type = normal\n|hit_adder = 7\n|hit_num = 1\n|hit_denom = 40\n|dam_calculator = calcdice\n|dam_numdice = 1\n|dam_adder = 11\n|dam_num = 3\n|dam_denom = 5}}\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

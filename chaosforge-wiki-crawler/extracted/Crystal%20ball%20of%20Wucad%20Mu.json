{"title":"Crystal ball of Wucad Mu","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Crystal_ball_of_Wucad_Mu","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|A perfect sphere of crystal, overflowing with magical energies.}}\n\n[[File:Crystal ball of wucad mu.png]] '''''the crystal ball of Wucad Mu'''''\n\n[[Orb]]\n\n[[Channel]] ([[Energy]] x2)\n\n==Mechanics==\nAn [[orb]] of [[energy]] with double the refund rate.\n\nWhen successfully casting a spell, you have a 40% chance to have the full MP refunded. When you [[miscast]] a spell, you will always have MP refunded. However, it increases your ''raw'' [[spell failure]] chance by +10%. (For reference, the first stack of [[wizardry]] reduces raw spell failure by x75%.)\n\nNote that this does not mean that your spell failure actually increases by +10%, as its modified by a function. See the [[Spell Success#Final Step|Spell Success]] page for details.\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''crystal ball of Wucad Mu'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|268}}</ref> is useful for magical characters. It restores a significant portion of your MP, at the cost of negative wizardry. Since this orb always refunds MP on miscast, it's best thought as \"making you waste a few turns here or there\" rather than \"making you fail more often\".\n\nHowever, it takes up the shield slot, reducing your defense. In addition, the mana reduction is not guaranteed, meaning you can run out of MP without the orb activating once. Regardless, being able to cast spells a few more times can make the difference between victory and running dry mid-fight. Overall, it is a powerful item balanced by its fair share of drawbacks.\n\nCharacters who do not plan to cast spells at all have no use for this orb.\n\n==History==\n*This item was introduced in [[0.30]], replacing the [[staff of Wucad Mu]]. [[Channeling]] mechanics were also changed in this version.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Orbs]]"}

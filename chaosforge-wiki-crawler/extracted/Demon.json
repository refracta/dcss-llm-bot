{"title":"Demon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Demon","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n'''Demons''' are unholy monsters from the infernal planes of [[Hell]], [[Pandemonium]], and [[the Abyss]]. They range in difficulty from minor nuisances like the [[crimson imp]] to the mighty [[Greater Demon]]s, and have a wide variety of powers. They can be brought into the world by [[summoning]] them, and they also appear in later levels of the [[Dungeon]], especially the aforementioned infernal [[branch]]es.\n\nAll demons are considered [[evil]], and take additional damage from [[holy wrath]]-branded weapons and [[Holy Word]]. Many [[god]]s award [[piety]] for destroying them. [[Makhleb]] and [[Xom]] may grant demonic servants to their worshipers.\n\nIn the ASCII version of ''Crawl'', tiered demons are represented by a numeral representing their tier level (1-5). More powerful demons are represented by an ampersand (&).\n\n==Demon List==\n===Tier-5 Demons===\nTier-5 Demons are the weakest class of demons.

They are occasionally granted as allies by [[Makhleb]]'s Lesser Servant invocation.\n\n{{monsterlink|Chaos spawn}}- Ever-shifting creatures that move swiftly and have [[chaos]]-[[brand]]ed melee attacks.

are unholy monsters from the infernal planes of [[Hell]], [[Pandemonium]], and [[the Abyss]]. They range in difficulty from minor nuisances like the [[crimson imp]] to the mighty [[Greater Demon]]s, and have a wide variety of powers. They can be brought into the world by [[summoning]] them, and they also appear in later levels of the [[Dungeon]], especially the aforementioned infernal [[branch]]es.\n\nAll demons are considered [[evil]], and take additional damage from [[holy wrath]]-branded weapons and [[Holy Word]]. Many [[god]]s award [[piety]] for destroying them. [[Makhleb]] and [[Xom]] may grant demonic servants to their worshipers.\n\nIn the ASCII version of ''Crawl'', tiered demons are represented by a numeral representing their tier level (1-5). More powerful demons are represented by an ampersand (&).\n\n==Demon List==\n===Tier-5 Demons===\nTier-5 Demons are the weakest class of demons. They're common in the early dungeon, and are often summoned in droves by stronger creatures. Only fresh adventurers should have trouble dealing with these. The imps can be summoned by using [[Call Imp]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Crimson imp}}- A pesky little beast that [[blink]]s often and regenerates. Very difficult to pin down and kill, but otherwise fairly harmless.\n\n{{monsterlink|Iron imp}}- Metallic imps that are slow, but have more HP and melee power than other imps.\n\n{{monsterlink|Lemure}}- Cursed souls bound into service to interdimensional slavers. Kill [[Pikel|their master]], and they will go free.\n\n{{monsterlink|Quasit}}- Small demons with decent HP and dexterity-draining melee attacks.\n\n{{monsterlink|Shadow imp}}- Minor demonic torturers that can cast [[Pain]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Ufetubus}}- Fast with decent EV, but is otherwise weak. Summoned in droves by the tier-3 [[ynoxinul]].\n\n{{monsterlink|White imp}}- Frosty little demons that have [[Throw Frost]] and a [[cold]]-flavoured melee attack.\n\n===Tier-4 Demons===\nTier-4 Demons are more powerful than tier-5 demons, but are still among some of the weakest demons in the game.  None are capable of inflicting damage at long range, although a few possess other special abilities. They are occasionally granted as allies by [[Makhleb]]'s Lesser Servant invocation.\n\n{{monsterlink|Chaos spawn}}- Ever-shifting creatures that move swiftly and have [[chaos]]-[[brand]]ed melee attacks. They degenerate into clouds of raw chaos when killed.\n\n{{monsterlink|Hellwing}}- Skeletal demons that can soar over intervening creatures to attack their targets from behind.\n\n{{monsterlink|Ice devil}}- Spell-less demons that nonetheless have powerful [[cold]] attacks, though they dislike [[fire]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Orange demon}}- Demons with venomous stinger tails that can [[reaching|reach]] out and inflict [[weakness]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Red devil}}- Flying devils that coat their [[trident]]s with [[barbs]]. Vulnerable to cold.\n\n{{monsterlink|Rust devil}}- Metallic demons with multiple resistances and [[acid|corrosive]] attacks.\n\n===Tier-3 Demons===\nTier-3 Demons are demons of average power that display an assortment of capabilities. Some are notably more dangerous than others.\n\n{{monsterlink|Neqoxec}}- It will gladly [[malmutate]] you, drain your [[intelligence]], or summon imps to attack you.\n\n{{monsterlink|Sixfirhy}}- An electrical imp that moves in bursts of blinding speed. Relatively weak, but very painful if you are not resistant to [[electricity]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Smoke demon}}- Demons of living smoke that are dangerous at range with [[Sticky Flame Range]], [[Steam Ball]], and [[Smite]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Soul eater}}- Moderately powerful demons that can [[Drain Life]] out of nearby foes.\n\n{{monsterlink|Sun demon}}- Speedy fire demons that have powerful, fiery attacks but are vulnerable to cold.\n\n{{monsterlink|Ynoxinul}}- A summoner of [[ufetubi]] which can also cast [[Iron Shot]].\n\n===Tier-2 Demons===\nTier-2 Demons are challenging combatants due to a wide range of abilities. They are the second most powerful tier of standard demon. Additionally, a worshipper of [[Makhleb]] may summon some of them using the Greater Servant ability.\n\n{{monsterlink|Balrug}}- Huge, fast demons that wield branded [[demon whip]]s, cast powerful fire magic, and [[smite]] their foes. \n\n{{monsterlink|Blizzard demon}}- Demons that are capable of casting powerful [[Air Magic|Air]] and [[Ice Magic]] spells.\n\n{{monsterlink|Cacodemon}}- A dangerous, debilitating demon that can cast [[Malmutate]], [[Slow]], and [[Confuse]]. They can also dig through walls or pelt you with energy bolts.\n\n{{monsterlink|Green death}}- Demons that attack you with all manner of dangerous toxins.\n\n{{monsterlink|Hell beast}}- Dangerous melee demons that can trample foes out of position. The [[Horn of Geryon]] can call in hordes of them.\n\n{{monsterlink|Hellion}}- Demons that specialize in pelting you with smite-targeted [[damnation]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Lorocyproca}}- Invisible demons that resist all elements and drain your MP with their attacks.\n\n{{monsterlink|Reaper}}- The archetypal Grim Reapers.

All tier-1 demons can see invisible, and all Fiends are capable of inflicting [[Torment]]. Fighting or even being in sight of multiple tier-1 demons is not recommended. \n\n{{monsterlink|Brimstone fiend}}- Fiends that specialize in [[damnation]] as well as torment. Vulnerable to cold. \n\n{{monsterlink|Executioner}}- Moves twice as fast as normal and will cast [[Haste]] at the slightest provocation. With its speed and 3 melee attacks, it can tear lightly armoured characters to shreds.  \n\n{{monsterlink|Hell sentinel}}- A highly durable demonic construct with painful [[spiny|spines]] and both [[Damnation]] and [[Iron Shot]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Ice fiend}}- Fiends that have torment and [[Bolt of Cold]], but are most dangerous in melee with their powerful freezing attacks. Vulnerable to fire.\n\n{{monsterlink|Tzitzimitl}}- Terrifying divinities that can damage both the living and the undead with an assortment of cold and negative energy spells.\n\n===Archdemons===\nThe most powerful demons of them all, these beings are all [[unique]] creatures that are usually found as boss-type enemies. Many of them serve as guardians of various [[runes of Zot]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Geryon}}- The gatekeeper of [[Hell]], Geryon stands between adventurers and the entrances to the four hells.

Antaeus fights foes with his massive strength augmented by powerful [[Ice Magic|Ice]] and [[Air Magic]]. He watches over the icy rune of Zot.\n\n{{monsterlink|Pandemonium lord}}- Powerful demons that individually rule portions of [[Pandemonium]]. Their powers and appearances vary greatly.\n\n{{monsterlink|Mnoleg}}- Guardian of the glowing rune of Zot, Mnoleg and its minions will [[malmutate]] the crap out of anyone who challenges them... if they don't eat your brains first.\n\n{{monsterlink|Lom Lobon}}- Guardian of the magical rune of Zot, Lom Lobon possesses some of the strongest spells in the game and heads a cabal of [[wizard (monster)|wizards]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Cerebov}}- Guardian of the fiery rune of Zot, Cerebov's [[Sword of Cerebov|sword]] allows it to burn even those with full fire resistance.\n\n{{monsterlink|Gloorx Vloq}}- Guardian of the dark rune of Zot, Gloorx Vloq is extremely fast and can seriously harm both the living and the undead.\n\n===Demonic creatures===\nWhile not considered standard demons in and of themselves, these creatures have demonic [[holiness]], making them vulnerable to weapons of [[holy wrath]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Apocalypse crab}}- [[Abyss]]al crustaceans that spew clouds of pure [[chaos]] at their prey.\n\n{{monsterlink|Small abomination}}- Horrible mockeries of life made from several corpses that have been mashed haphazardly together.\n\n{{monsterlink|Large abomination}}- Unrecognizable combinations of body parts that are somewhat slower but far more powerful than their smaller brethren.\n\n{{monsterlink|Demonic crawler}}- Swift demonic bugs that are often found in the [[Spider's Nest]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Doom hound}}- Demonic [[list of canines|hounds]] that roam [[Tartarus]].

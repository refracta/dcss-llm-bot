{"title":"Rupert","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Rupert","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Rupert the Wild''' is a [[unique]] human [[berserker]] who always wields a branded two-handed weapon. He'll attempt to disable you before rushing in, dealing obscene damage when [[berserk]]ed.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:12-15\n*[[The Lair]]:3-6\n*The [[Orcish Mines]]:1-2\n*[[The Snake Pit]]:1\n*The [[Spider's Nest]]:1\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*All sources of [[paralysis]] are extremely deadly, and Rupert is no exception. You can be paralysed for up to 5 turns. During this time, Rupert can berserk, close 6 tiles of distance, and still get 1-2 attacks off. You might not die, but you'll be next to a berserk Rupert, who can deal 54+ damage per swing. Good [[willpower]] is recommended if you want to fight him.\n**A sudden Rupert appearance can turn a bad situation into a horrible one. Say you were having trouble against a [[hydra]]. Being paralysed next to said hydra is almost certain death. \n*Even if you ignore the paralysis threat, he is a fairly dangerous opponent for Lair. He is strong enough to punch through melee fighters at this point in the game, and has enough HP to shrug off weaker attacks.\n*Rupert has the resistances of a [[death yak]]: his [[willpower]] is great, and his [[HD]] is quite high. [[Hexes]], hex [[wand]]s, [[datura]] darts, and [[Mephitic Cloud]] are unlikely to be effective.\n*Thankfully, he has no other resistances, beyond what equipment might give him.\n**[[Curare]] darts, if he isn't wearing [[poison resistance]] armour, will slow him down. This lets you keep pace with a berserk Rupert, and makes him weaker overall. \n**If he spawns with an [[axe]], Rupert can mow down weak summons like its nothing. However, a few [[cactus giant]]s are strong enough to take him down, axe or not.\n**Rupert cannot [[see invisible]]. If you need to get away, or get an edge in combat, a [[potion of invisibility]] can help.\n**If you got decent [[Evocations]] skill, a [[phial of floods]] prevents him from using Paralyse (but does not prevent berserk).\n*Rupert has a chance of spawning with one of the rare two-handers, such as a [[triple sword]] or [[executioner's axe]]. It's great if you were looking for one, but actually taking it from Rupert is easier said than done.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Rupert could [[see invisible]].\n*While he and his spell set were unchanged, with the removal of the [[Berserker Rage]] player spell and the changing of [[Crusader]]s to [[Skald]]s, Rupert was restyled as a Trog worshiper in [[0.9]]. The text for his Confuse and Paralyse spells was changed to match: apparently one can induce confusion and paralysis by yelling loudly enough.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

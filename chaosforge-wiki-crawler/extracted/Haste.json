{"title":"Haste","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Haste","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Speeds the actions of a creature.}}\n'''Haste''' is a status and a monster-only spell that increases the speed of all actions. \n\n==Effect==\n[[Status effect#Haste|Hasted]] entities have their actions take 2/3rds as long. This makes players and monsters alike significantly more dangerous, as acting more often makes them more effective at virtually everything they do.\n\nOther than the spell, players and monsters can get this status via a [[potion of haste]] or as a result of going [[berserk]].\n\n[[Cheibriados]] hates the haste effect; unintentional hastes will be blocked, intentional hastes will result in [[penance]].\n\n==Monster Spell==\nThe Haste spell gives the hasted status to its user.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nA separate spell ([[Haste Other]]) allows monsters to give the haste status to other creatures. However, fairly few monsters possess it, and no monsters have both spells at once. The separation between the two monster spells and the resultant inability of [[dread lich]]es and [[deep elf sorcerer]]s to haste their summons is more of an artifact of the way monster spellcasting is implemented than a mercy on the part of the developers.\n\n==History==\n{{Spell\n|name=Haste\n|level=6\n|school1={{Charms}}\n|school2=\n|school3=\n|castingnoise=5\n|spellnoise=0\n|sources=[[Book of Enchantments]]\n}}\n*Prior to [[0.20]], haste would cause [[magic contamination]] and [[hunger]] over time. The [[wand of hasting]] existed as another plentiful means of haste.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Haste was a level 6 [[Charms]] spell available to players; the player version allowed you to target either yourself or another creature, though players had to watch out for [[magic contamination]].\n*Prior to [[0.8]], Haste made all actions twice as fast.\n*In very early versions of Crawl it was a level 8 spell: magic contamination did not yet exist, meaning that this spell could be spammed with no downsides other than food costs, so it merited being a higher level.\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]\n[[Category:Movement]]\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

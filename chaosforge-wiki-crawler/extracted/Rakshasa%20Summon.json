{"title":"Rakshasa Summon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Rakshasa_Summon","type":"raw","data":"{{Obsolete}}\n'''Rakshasa Summon''' is a monster-only spell which summons illusory [[rakshasa]]s. These duplicates have 1 [[HP]], 1 [[AC]], 30 [[EV]], 1 [[HD]], and do 0 damage per attack. [[Magic Dart]], [[Fireball]], or any other highly accurate spell makes short work of them.  \n\nWhile their attacks deal no damage themselves, the illusions are given cloned versions of the rakshasa's weapon, with which they ''can'' deal damage. However, given that they have only one HD, they very rarely hit. The attack mostly serves to make it more difficult to distinguish the clones from the real monster.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.14]] Rakshasa Summon was removed and replaced by more dangerous [[Phantom Mirror]] in the [[rakshasa]]'s spell set.\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

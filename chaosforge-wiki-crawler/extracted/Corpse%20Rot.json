Any living thing (including the caster) which enters these clouds will suffer [[drain]], [[poison]], [[slow]], and take damage. Most enemies who aren't immune will try to avoid this, so the spell can be used to block off corridors much like [[Conjure Flame]]. The cloud can be created on top of an enemy if it is adjacent to the caster when the spell is cast.\n\nEach slain enemy in sight will be converted into one cloud of miasma, which will be randomly distributed among the adjacent tiles and last 2-9 turns. Additional slain enemies over the number of available tiles will still rot, and create an additional layer of miasma.\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile this spell is unlikely to wipe out any powerful enemies, hitting an entire group with guaranteed slow and poison can be very helpful, granting you additional turns to safely kite enemies or the opportunity to flee entirely. Though this is a powerful effect, many enemies are able to pelt you with ranged attacks, while you risk boxing yourself in.\n\nHowever, the awkward means of activation, relatively middling effect, combined with the moderate spell level and triple school training, make it one of the weaker spells of the Necromancy school. \n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*This spell has some extra synergy with [[Undead]] and [[Gargoyle]] players, who are immune to miasma and can walk through their own clouds. High level Transmutations like [[Storm Form]], [[Statue Form]] or [[Necromutation]] also grant miasma immunity.\n*If you are short on fodder to slay, [[Kiku]]'s Unearth Wretches ability can provide improved coverage. If you are not immune to miasma, beware the additional chance of boxing yourself in.\n*Clouds will never be formed on closed doors. You can use this to provide yourself a guaranteed escape route.\n\n==History==\n*Corpse Rot was removed in [[0.30]]. It was replaced by [[Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot]].\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Corpse Rot was a level 2 Necromancy/Air Magic spell that would consume [[corpse]]s to create miasma clouds around the caster, instead of a status effect.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Corpse Rot inflicted actual [[rot]], and [[Vine Stalker]]s were immune.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Corpse Rot generated miasma clouds at the position of the corpses, rather than surrounding the caster.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], you were able to pick up corpses. You could position a corpse in a specific place through use of [[Portal Projectile]]."}

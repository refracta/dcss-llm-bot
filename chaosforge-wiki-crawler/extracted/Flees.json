Monsters with less than 8 max HP will never flee. Fleeing monsters will eventually recover and turn to attack you.\n*[[:Category:Flees|List of monsters that can flee]]\n\n==Tips and Tricks==\nWhen engaging an enemy in melee, try to position yourself in such a way that if they do flee, you can quickly corner them. \n\n==History==\n*Fleeing was removed in [[0.17]].

It is not powerful enough to affect tentacles which are already mutated.}}\n\n'''Beastly Appendage''' is a level 1 [[Transmutations]] spell. \n\n[[Transmuter]]s begin with this spell memorized.\n__NOTOC__\n==Effect==\nBeastly Appendage briefly gives you the following temporary combat enhancing [[mutation]]s, melding armour in the process:\n*[[Horns|Horns 2]] - grants an auxiliary headbutt attack, melding [[helmet]]s.\n*[[Talons|Talons 2]] - grants an auxiliary kick attack, melding [[boots]].\n**Like other Transmutations, Beastly Appendage will fully meld [[Lear's hauberk]].\n\nThe duration of these mutations is dependent upon your [[spell power]]. Casting the spell again extends the duration of your current mutations.\n\n===Restrictions===\nYour helmet and boot slot (or equivalent) will meld, even if these mutations aren't valid:\n* [[Armataur]]s, [[naga]]s, [[merfolk]], and [[felid]]s cannot get Talons, as they don't have humanoid feet. However, their [[boots]] / [[barding]]s are melded, anyway.\n*Octopodes, being incompatible with either mutation, gain a [[Good mutations#Tentacle Spike|spiked tentacle 3]] instead. Their hat slot is still melded.\n\n[[Undead]] species ([[ghoul]]s, [[mummies]], bloodless [[vampire]]s) can't cast this spell, like other [[transformation|form]]-changing spells.\n\n==Strategy==\nBeastly Appendage can significantly improve the combat capabilities of low level melee characters. It isn't likely for an early adventurer to have helmets or boots, so melding these aux armour slots shouldn't be noticeable.\n\nBeastly Appendage doesn't give any special bonus to [[Unarmed Combat]]. Low level Transmuters can feel free to wield and train with a weapon. Note that further Transmutations ([[Spider Form]] & [[Ice Form]]) do rely on Unarmed, though.\n\n==History==\n*This spell was removed in [[0.31]], along with the Transmutations spell school.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the spell could provide either Horns 2 or Talons 3 (instead of both) and couldn't meld aux armour in those slots.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], Claws 3 was a possible result.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], Beastly Appendage gave you Tentacles for arms instead of Claws.\n*Beastly Appendage was added in [[0.10]].\n\n{{Forms}}\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

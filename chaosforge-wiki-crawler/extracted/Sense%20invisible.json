{"title":"Sense invisible","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sense_invisible","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\nMonsters which \"sense invisible\" can tell where invisible opponents are, and have bonuses to perception in other cases. \n\nEffects of monster sense_invisible:\n\n* For anything that just checks you.visible_to(monster), it's as strong as [[see invisible]].\n* Monsters with “sense invisible” have a better chance of noticing stealthy players than those with “see invisible”.\n* “sense invisible” has some effect on a monster guessing an invisible foe's position: Without, it guesses within radius 2 around itself, with within radius 3. This makes it easier to escape from non-sensing monsters, but apparently makes sensing monsters less likely to guess your position when you're close (within radius 2) of them.\n* Slightly decreased stabbing chance.\n* An effect on beam targeting fuzz.\n* Note that friendly [[summon]]s with sense invisible can't actually detect invisible monsters.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.16]], sense invisible was removed and replaced with [[see invisible]] and [[blind]]ness immunity.\n\n[[Category:Sense invisible]]\n[[Category:Monster attributes]]"}

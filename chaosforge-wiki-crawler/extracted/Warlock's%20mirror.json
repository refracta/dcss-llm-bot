A skilled user will find that it can reflect almost anything, even spells that pierce through lesser materials and hexes with no physical manifestation at all.}}\n[[File:warlock.png]] '''''the +3 warlock's mirror'''''\n\n+3 [[buckler]]\n\n[[Reflection]] ego<br>\nCan also reflect [[piercing]] attacks, enchantments, and never-missing attacks\n__NOTOC__\n==Mechanics==\nFor piercing attacks, such as [[javelin]]s and [[bolt spell]]s, the chance to block is determined by [[SH]], like any attack you can block normally.\n\nFor enchantments and never-missing attacks, the chance to block is equal to <code>2*SH / (2*SH + 20)</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|beam.cc|6853}}<br>Note that 'internal' SH is twice as high as your actual SH score.</ref> All sources of SH count. Unlike normal blocking, this reflection does not 'decay' after multiple blocks. This equates to 37.5% at 6 [[SH]], reaches 50% at 10 SH, 66% at 20 SH, and gradually increases further from there.\n\nIt cannot block [[smite-targeted]] attacks, explosions like [[Fireball]], or other sorts of AOE effects.\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''warlock's mirror'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|1520}}</ref> is a fairly useful shield, especially in places with many piercing attacks (such as [[javelin]]s in [[the Shoals]]) or enchantments. Even if the enemy is immune to their own attacks, the omnireflect is useful - it lets you block otherwise unblockable effects.\n\nHowever, this shield is still a buckler. Heavier characters or those with lots of Shields skill might prefer a [[tower shield]] or a highly enchanted [[kite shield]], which are more effective against attacks you can block normally. But for those who would use a buckler anyway, there are few better options.\n\nThe mirror can block [[Malmutate]], so it can be a strong(er) choice in places where malmutation is common.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the warlock's mirror only had a <code>2*SH / (2*SH + 40)</code> chance to reflect never-missing effects, and couldn't reflect piercing physical projectiles like [[javelin]]s.\n*The warlock's mirror was introduced in [[0.18]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Shields]]"}

If you see one, it's either a [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]], a sign of a nearby [[vault]] (''e.g.'', \"[[yak]] farm\" or \"sword in the stone\"), or an outrider for one of a few [[unique monster|unique]]s.  \n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nAlthough generally very easy if you meet them, humans can be dangerous if spawned with [[crossbows]], branded weapons, or [[tower shield]]s, and they pack a surprisingly strong punch if they meet a low-level character.\n\n===Variant Humans===\n[[File:Deformed human.png]] You can find '''deformed''', '''febrile''', or '''sickly humans''' in some of the sealed chambers in [[Cigotuvi's Fleshworks]].\n\n{{flavour|A poor creature that looks hideously deformed.}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], there were ghosts of '''human monks''' in [[Wucad Mu's Monastery]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], some vaults could contain '''sacrificial humans''', which were regular humans with a custom description.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

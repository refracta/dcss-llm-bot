In its raw form it does not provide much protection beyond resistance to poison, fire and cold, but with magical means it may be used to make excellent armour.}}\n\n'''Gold dragon hide''' is a [[heavy armour]] which can be obtained by butchering a [[golden dragon]] [[corpse]]. It provides poor physical defense and comes with a heavy [[encumbrance rating]], but also provides a rank of [[fire]], [[cold]], and [[poison]] resistance. Enchanting it with [[scroll of enchant armour]] turns it into a [[gold dragon armour]], one of the most effective armours in the game for purely physical [[strength]]-based characters.\n\nIt takes 5 turns to wear or remove a gold dragon hide.\n\n==History==\nGold dragon hides were removed in [[0.19]]\n\nPrior to [[0.14]], gold dragon hides had an [[encumbrance rating]] of -17.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Hide''' || [[Image:Gold dragon hide.png]]\n|-\n| '''Armour''' || [[Image:Gold dragon armour.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

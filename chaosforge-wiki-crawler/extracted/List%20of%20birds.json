{"title":"List of birds","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_birds","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\nAs the [[Dungeon]] is a largely subterranean structure, only a few '''birds''' call it home. However, those few have adapted themselves to some of the most inhospitable places in the Dungeon and can make for dangerous opponents. All birds can fly, are extremely fast, and are generally quite evasive.\n\n==Bird Types==\n{{monsterlink|Bennu}} - Straddling the line between life and death, these birds of the [[Tomb]] can resurrect themselves once in a blast of unholy flames.\n\n{{monsterlink|Caustic shrike}} - Swift predators of the [[Depths]] whose [[acid|corrosive]] attacks melt through foes' armour as they tear them apart.\n\n{{monsterlink|Shard shrike}} - These avians nest in frigid [[Cocytus]]. Not only do their claws freeze their prey, but they can also launch lethal [[Throw Icicle|shards of ice]].\n\n==Retired birds==\n{{monsterlink|Phoenix}} - A sacred bird capable of resurrecting itself in a blaze of fire. Only found in rare vaults and holy-themed [[Pandemonium]] or [[Ziggurat]] levels.\n\n{{monsterlink|Raven}} - A mundane bird that sometimes spawned guarding pieces of jewellery or accompanying [[tengu warrior]]s.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.17]], ravens were removed.\n*In [[0.15]], phoenixes were removed.\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

{"title":"DCSS April Fools' Jokes","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/DCSS_April_Fools%27_Jokes","type":"raw","data":"{{stub}}\nEach year on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day April Fools' Day], ''Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup'''s dev team releases a mock update. Although primarily meant as a gag, these ''DCSS'' versions are still playable, and many players treat these joke updates as an opportunity for a unique challenge.\n\n==2022==\nOn April 1, 2022, [[Mayflytaur]]s, a [[score|turn-count]]-focused [[species]], were added to the game. Even though Mayflytaurs were available only for one day, more than 20 players managed to win with them.\n\n==2014==\nOn April 1, 2014, a [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crawl/crawl/nostalgia/crawl-ref/docs/changelog.txt Nostalgia update] was applied to ''DCSS'', restoring a wide variety of \"classic\" ''Crawl'' features, such as [[Zot trap]]s appearing on any floor and [[hydra]]s having speed 15, as well as the restoration of all obsolete [[species]] and [[background]]s. In game text was also given more exclamation marks, and your [[god]] would make commentary on your performance.\n\n==2013==\nOn April 1, 2013, the [[jester]] [[background]] was (briefly) added to the game. Although only playable for a short time, several players managed to win with it before its removal.\n\n==2012==\nOn April 1, 2012, the game was translated to a few \"exotic\" languages: dwarven, j√§gerkin, lithp and kraut. The reception of this feature was so positive, that this joke was not completely reverted, and new fake languages were added to the game after that."}

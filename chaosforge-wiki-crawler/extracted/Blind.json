[[See invisible]] is rendered useless while blinded.\n\n==Blindness==\nThe effects of blindness are the same as if you were invisible:\n\n*Blind attackers receive a -35% penalty to [[to-hit]] rolls\n*Blind enemies cannot perform [[attacks of opportunity]].\n*Blind ranged attackers will often target the wrong tile, potentially hitting other targets or missing entirely.\n*Anything with animal [[intelligence]] or worse will occasionally move as though confused, rather than pursuing or attacking you. Anything of human intelligence can still track you normally, however.\n*Blind enemies are be susceptible to low-tier [[stabbing]] attacks.\n\nPlayers can not be blinded. Effects that would blind or dazzle players will instead cause a short [[confusion]].\n\n===Sources===\nYou can blind opponents in the following ways:\n*[[Atropa]] [[dart]]s\n*[[Wand of light]]\n*Blindness is a possible effect of the following divine abilities:\n**[[Ru]]'s Aura of Power and Apocalypse.\n**[[Zin]]'s Recite (when used against heretics).\n\n[[:Category:Unblindable|Some monsters]], e.g., [[warg]]s and [[bat]]s, cannot be blinded by any means.\n\n==Dazzled==\n'''Dazzled''' is a similar condition to blindness. It inflicts all the same penalties, but only lasts for several turns.\n\nYou can dazzle opponents in the following ways:\n*Hitting monsters with [[Dazzling Flash]].\n*The [[cloak of Starlight]] dazzles attackers in retaliation.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|players can be blinded, but it doesn't work the same way it does against monsters. Instead, blindness will cause a player to miss <code>15*(distance+1)%</code> of all attacks that check EV. The maximum miss chance is 90%.}}\n*Wands of light were added in [[0.29]].\n*The cloak of Starlight gained *Dazzle in [[0.26]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], the [[sense invisible]] monster intrinsic would stop blindness.\n*During the brief period in which [[jester]]s existed, you could also temporarily blind monsters by hitting them with [[pie]]s.\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

This book was first written by Olgreb, the infamous Venom Mage, who murdered many of his rivals by sending them highly poisonous copies as gifts. Current editions are fortunately harmless.}}\n\nThe book of Envenomations is the more advanced text for [[Poison Magic]].\n\n==Spells==\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

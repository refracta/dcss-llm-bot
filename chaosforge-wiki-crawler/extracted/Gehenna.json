You'll meet [[hellion]]s, [[balrug]]s, [[brimstone fiend]]s and packs of [[hell hog]]s. Beware of [[creeping inferno]]s, which cast [[Fire Storm]] when they die, and the [[stoker]]s that create them. [[Searing wretch]]es will also strip away at your hard-earned fire resistance. All the while a mystical Hellish force will assault you (like all Hell branches), causing multiple nasty effects.\n\nGehenna's layout consists of cavernous areas dotted with small round rooms and surrounded by lava streams. Like every other hell, floors 1-6 are tiny; consisting of one exit, one staircase down, and about quarter the size of an ordinary floor.\n\nThe last level of Gehenna contains the obsidian [[rune of Zot]], guarded by [[Asmodeus]].\n\n===Hell Effects===\nIn addition to the universal [[Hell#Hell's Mystical Force|forces of hell]], Gehenna's smoke disables any [[scroll]] reading while inside it.\n\n==Recommendations==\nProvided you have enough fire resistance (rF+ at the minimum), as well as a way to kill the fire-resistant monsters you meet, Gehenna's first six floors shouldn't be especially hard (for a hell). [[Ice Magic|Ice]] or [[Earth Magic]] will make your travels much smoother. \n\nGehenna:7, a fortress with a moat of lava, can be brutal if you manage to wake up too many enemies at once while inside [[Asmodeus]]' chambers: having several hellions all calling down damnation at you after being tormented by brimstone fiends can mean a quick end even for strong characters. Proceed with caution. Asmodeus himself is a tough customer, a weaker version of [[Cerebov]] if you will. [[Fly]]ing or use of translocations may be useful to traverse lava ponds quickly.\n\n==Trivia==\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gehenna Gehenna] is a term derived from a geographical site in Jerusalem known as the Valley of Hinnom. According to parts of the Bible, the site was initially where followers of various Ba'als, including Moloch, sacrificed their children by fire. The valley later became the common wasteyard for all the refuse of Jerusalem. Here the corpses and ashes of animals and people, as well as wastes and garbage were cast and, according to legend, consumed by a constant fire. In time it became deemed to be accursed and an image of the place of destruction in Jewish folklore. Gehenna is cited in the New Testament and in early Christian writing to represent the final place where the wicked will be punished or destroyed after resurrection.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Branches]] [[Category:Hells]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Gehenna did not disable [[scroll]] reading. Floors were normal sized, had a weaker set of monsters, and [[Hell]]'s effects were different.\n\n{{branches}}"}

{"title":"Tentacled starspawn","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tentacled_starspawn","type":"raw","data":"{{version017}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nA '''tentacled starspawn''' is a voracious creature of chaos, relying on its nimble [[List of tentacles|tentacles]] to capture prey and pull it into range of its terrible mouth. Any time you are damaged by a tentacle, you are pulled one space toward the starspawn. They can be found in [[the Abyss]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The tentacles have speed 10, but since their movement is relative to the head, they can follow you at speed 20 while the main body is still in your LOS. Most characters will need [[Haste]]+[[Swiftness]] to outrun them.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], tentacled starspawn could [[see invisible]].\n*Tentacled starspawn were added in [[0.12]]."}

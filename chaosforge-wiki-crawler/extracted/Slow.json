{"title":"Slow","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Slow","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n[[Slow]] is a [[status effect]] and a level 1 [[Hexes]] spell that makes the target slower.\n\n[[Hedge Wizard]]s can memorize the Slow spell from turn one.\n\n==Spell==\nIf the target fails a [[willpower]] check, they will be slowed. At higher [[spell power]], the target is slowed for a longer period of time. \n\n==Effect==\nSlowed creatures take 50% longer for [[movement]] and all other actions. [[Haste]] and Slow will cancel each other out, without rounding error. This can seriously reduce the damage output of affected creatures, and it is much easier to escape slowed pursurers (but much harder to escape when slowed).\n\n[[Formicid]]s are completely immune to the effect due to their [[stasis]].\n\n==Sources==\nOther than the Slow spell, the following can inflict slow:\n*[[Metabolic Englaciation]]\n*[[Miasma]] clouds\n*[[Curare]]-tipped [[dart]]s\n*[[Cheibriados]]' Temporal Distortion\n*[[Chaotic]] effects\n*Mummy [[death curse]]s\n\n==Monster Spell==\nThe monster version of this spell functions similarly to the player version.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], [[Hexslinger]]s started with this spell.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the Slow spell had an [[enchantment power]] multiplier of x1.5, making it more likely to succeed.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the Slow spell was a level 2 Hexes spell, with a power cap of 200.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], an [[amulet of stasis]] could protect you from Slow.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], the Slow spell did not have an enchantment power boost.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], slowing made every action take twice as long.\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]\n[[Category:Status effects]]\n[[Category:Movement]]"}

{"title":"Ijyb","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ijyb","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ijyb, the Twisted Goblin''' is a particularly durable [[goblin]] who generates somewhat early on. She always spawns with a [[wand]], which makes her substantially more dangerous than regular goblins.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:3-5\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Ijyb is an exception to the rule stating low-level monsters cannot spawn with powerful wands. Expect to see anything from a [[wand of polymorph]] to [[wand of paralysis|paralysis]] to even [[wand of acid|acid]].\n*Just treat her like any other particularly well-armed goblin. Lure her into melee by hiding behind a corner, and fight her alone, so that other enemies can't surround you when you're paralyzed or polymorphed into a [[bad form]] by her wand.\n*She has terrible [[willpower]]. Consider hitting her with a hex or your own [[wand of paralysis]] before going in for the kill.\n\n==History==\n*Before [[0.20]], Ijyb spawned earlier in the dungeon and did not always spawn with a wand.\n*Ijyb was male before [[0.19]].\n\n[[Category:Goblin]]"}

You'll gain the following:\n\n'''Combat Bonuses'''\n* '''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' 22 base damage.\n* Your [[auxiliary attack|off-hand punch]] gains +6 damage.\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n* '''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' [[Weapon]], [[shield]], and [[gloves]]. [[Claws]] are also melded.\n* You can't [[throw]] items.\n* Makes spells harder to cast (increases [[Spell Success#Modifiers|raw spell failure]] rate by +20%).\n\nBlade Hands does not block [[mutation]]s (other than claws), does not change your [[size]], and gives no innate bonus to HP / [[AC]]. It is considered its own [[form]], so it'll end other statuses like [[Ice Form]] or [[Dragon Form]].\n\n==Strategy==\nBlade Hands is essentially [[hand|two-handed]] Unarmed Combat. Even at 0 Unarmed Combat skill, you'll hit as hard as a [[giant spiked club]], while keeping the off-hand punch and swinging faster. It's certainly strong. However, the spell takes quite a bit of investment to get running, especially if you want to use heavy [[body armour]]. And if you're in light armour, then your defenses will be low.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Like all slashing attacks, Blade Hands is a terrible choice for fighting [[hydra]]s.\n*This spell will meld away even [[cursed]] weapons, allowing [[Ashenzari]] worshipers to have their hands bound and still use Unarmed Combat.\n\n== History ==\n*Blade Hands was replaced with the [[Blade talisman]] in [[0.31]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Blade Hands could be found in the [[Book of Changes]], and thus the [[Transmuter]] start. This spell also lowered [[felid]]s' [[stealth]].\n*Prior to [[0.22]], Blade Hands, and most other transformations, prevented usage of [[wand]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], Blade Hands' base damage scaled with [[strength]] and [[dexterity]] (<code>8 + (str + dex) / 3</code>).\n*Prior to [[0.10]], Blade Hands had higher base damage and lower dependence on stats.\n{{Forms}}\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

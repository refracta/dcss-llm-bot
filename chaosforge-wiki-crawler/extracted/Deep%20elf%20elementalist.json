They appear in the [[Elven Halls]]. \n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Lee's Rapid Deconstruction can be painful to lightly armoured characters. If you aren't made out of stone, you can avoid this spell by standing away from walls. If you have low AC, corridor fighting becomes less viable whenever an elementalist shows up.\n*[[Gargoyle]]s and players in [[Statue Form]] are vulnerable to LRD, and should be especially wary of elementalists.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|deep elf elementalists will cast [[Hoarfrost Cannonade]] instead of [[Freezing Cloud]].}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], deep elf elementalists could cast [[Awaken Earth]], a spell that broke rock [[wall]]s and summoned [[earth elemental]]s, instead of Lee's Rapid Deconstruction.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], they could cast [[Iron Shot]], [[Summon Air Elementals]], [[Sticky Flame#Sticky Flame Range|Sticky Flame Range]], [[Summon Water Elementals]], and [[Blink]]."}

Unlike [[Alistair's Intoxication]], it works on monsters that are non-[[natural]], poison resistant, or of animal or lower [[monster intelligence|intelligence]]. However, it is resistible by [[willpower]], making it ineffective against many monsters in the later game.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nAlthough players can no longer cast this spell, the [[Hepliaklqana]] Hexer ancestor is still able.\n\n==History==\n{{Spell\n|name=Mass Confusion\n|level=6\n|school1={{Hexes}}\n|school2=\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Control]]\n*[[Book of Dreams]]\n</div>\n|castingnoise=5\n|spellnoise=0\n}}\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Mass Confusion was a player-castable spell.\n*In [[0.10]], this spell received a small power boost."}

{"title":"Inescapable Atlas","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Inescapable_Atlas","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\nThe '''Inescapable Atlas''' was a spellbook containing a mixture of spells.\n\n==Spells==\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n! Tile || Spell || Type || Level\n|-\n| [[File:Blink.png]] || a - [[Blink]] || [[Translocation]] || 2\n|-\n| [[File:Manifold assault.png]] || b - [[Manifold Assault]] || [[Translocation]] || 4\n|-\n| [[File:Storm form.png]] || c - [[Storm Form]] || [[Air]]/[[Transmutation]] || 7\n|}\n\n==Strategy==\nThe spells in this book are quite synergistic. [[Storm Form]] deals extremely high melee damage at high spell power, but is lacking in defensive capabilities compared to other high level [[Transmutations]]. [[Manifold Assault]] allows a user of this spellbook to dispense this high damage from a safe distance, then reposition with [[Blink]] when enemies get too close.\n\n==History==\n*Removed in [[0.31]].\n*This book was added in [[0.27]]."}

{"title":"Curse of Agony","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Curse_of_Agony","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n'''Curse of Agony''' is a level 5 [[Necromancy]] spell which hexes the victim. If this spell succeeds, the caster's next two melee attacks will [[torment]] the target, halving their HP for each strike.\n\n[[Necromancer]]s start with this spell in their libaries.\n\n==Useful Info==\nIf Curse of Agony succeeds a [[willpower]] check, it inflicts an Agony enchantment. If the victim is attacked in melee by the caster, it inflicts [[torment]], up to 2 torments. This effect happens after weapon damage is applied. Missed attacks don't trigger this effect. This is subject to [[negative energy resistance]] and torment resistance as usual. \n\nThe Agony enchantment lasts for 6-8 turns. Recasting the spell on a monster will increase the duration, however, it will not increase or reset the number of torments available.\n\nCurse of Agony has an [[enchantment power]] multiplier of x2.5, which makes it harder to resist than the usual [[hex]].\n\n==Strategy==\nCurse of Agony deals considerable damage. It isn't directly lethal, but it can quickly soften up powerful, uninjured targets like [[hydra]]s or [[giant]]s. However, the caster must be able to survive a few turns in melee. Don't skimp on the evasion, and prepare a safe line of retreat if things go sour. \n\nIf you haven't branched into other magic schools, [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]] is a good choice for either an escape tool or a finishing blow.\n\n==Monster Version==\nPlayer ghosts with Curse of Agony instead get [[Agony]], a spell which inflicts 1 torment directly (if it succeeds a willpower check).\n\n==History==\n*Curse of Agony was introduced in [[0.31]], replacing the [[Agony]] player spell."}

{"title":"Human","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Human","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{for monster}}\n{{flavour|Humans are natural explorers. As they uncover new spaces in the dungeon, they are refreshed and invigorated, rapidly healing and recovering magic. They are also the most versatile of all species - having balanced aptitudes for all skills lets them adapt to use whatever they find.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*'''Explore Regeneration:''' Humans regenerate HP and MP as they explore. For every new tile uncovered, they regenerate 1/210 of their max HP and 1/135 of their max MP. The [[Passive Mapping]] mutation and the [[scroll of revelation]] don't count as exploration. Unlike exploration piety, this still works when uncovering [[deep water]] and [[lava]] around the map border, but it doesn't work in the [[Temple]].\n\nHumans have a base [[Strength]], [[Intelligence]] and [[Dexterity]] of 8 (before Background modifiers) and have normal base [[magic points]].\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Zealots:''' [[Berserker]], [[Cinder Acolyte]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Conjurer]], [[Necromancer]], [[Ice Elementalist]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 to a random [[stat]] every 4th level.\n*Average [[hit points]].\n*+3 [[willpower]] per level.\n\n==Starting Skills and Equipment==\nHumans receive all the skills and equipment listed for their background. \n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Moderate}}\n\nHumans are not a difficult species, with decent stats and skills across the board. However, for better or worse, Humans lack the specialization of other species. For example, a [[Minotaur]] might be terrible at magic, but they can rely entirely on their amazing melee prowess instead. Humans do not have something that they are ''great'' at, which makes them more difficult than a \"Simple\" species.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Human}}\n\n==Strategy==\nNote that Humans can still regenerate normally by [[rest]]ing, and in most cases, should rest. The exploration regen can be useful in a few tight scenarios, or to recover MP mid-fight. However, resting is (usually) safer, since you'll be less likely to encounter monsters while regenerating.\n\n==='Item-centric' strategy?===\nThe opposite of a [[Deep Elf]] coming across a suit of [[crystal plate armour]], Humans can be versatile with almost anything. More than many species, they can rely on an 'item-based' play style. In a game like ''Dungeon Crawl'' -- where you're almost guaranteed to chance across at least a few incredibly powerful, if ill-suited, items -- can be a useful asset.\n\n====\"Engines\"====\nLook for items that act as an \"engine\" - a way to win the game, or at least get you past a certain stage of it. A [[whip]] of [[electrocution]] can take out most enemies before you reach [[Lair]]. A [[demon trident]] you found on D:3 can be your weapon all the way until [[Zot]]. For magic, you have spells like [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]] that, once invested, will work for most of the midgame. \n\nIf you find an engine, act accordingly. With the whip of electrocution, you can invest into some [[Maces & Flails]] skill; you only need a few points. Then, you can decide either to commit to Maces & Flails, or swap to something else you found. If you find nothing amazing, you can rely on your [[background]]. Watch out for engines that are too hard to 'jump start'; Vile Clutch may be too difficult for a Human [[Fighter]] in heavy armour to train.\n\n====Generalization & Specialization====\nOne way to capitalize on this is to rely on universal skills, like [[Fighting]] or [[Dodging]], in the earlier portions of the game. Have just enough of your \"killdudes\" skill to get past the early game, and focus on some universal skills otherwise. This lets you make quick, mid-course changes depending on the items you find and [[god]] you pick. By maintaining a particularly adaptable play style, you can make your aptitude for 'averageness' into an overall strength, rather than a weakness to be overcome.\n\nHumans will want to specialize with something ''eventually''. After all, this is what separates a Human from a [[Gnoll]]. For example, a magic-focused Human probably shouldn't wear a +12 [[gold dragon scales]] they found on [[Zot]]:1. This point can vary from game to game. Often, you'll want to have a competent killing skill by the time you enter the [[Lair]]'s rune branches. This doesn't mean you can't switch skills later... just make sure you have a ''good'' way to kill things at any given point. Having 1 good way to kill things is better than 3 bad ways to kill things.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Humans had a +1 XP [[aptitude]], but did not get exploration healing.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], Humans had 0 to all aptitudes. However, certain skills had hidden XP costs/reductions. When these costs were removed (and every species changed to compensate), the \"average\" species changed from \"0 in everything\" to \"what Humans have\".\n\n{{species}}"}

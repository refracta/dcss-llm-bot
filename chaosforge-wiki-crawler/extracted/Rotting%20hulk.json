Although they leave [[corpse]]s, these are already so rotten that [[god]]s will not accept them as blood sacrifices and only [[saprovore]]s can eat them. They are encountered in the [[Dungeon]] on graveyard-themed floors, often in the company of [[skeletal warrior]]s, as well as in [[the Crypt]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nTake advantage of their slow speed to avoid having to face them with company. The normal-speed skeletal warriors they appear with are by far the bigger threat, but getting sickened is never a good prospect. Kite them if you have access to decently powerful ranged attacks.\n\n==History==\nRotting hulks were replaced with [[plague shambler]]s in [[0.13]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

{"title":"Flayed","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Flayed","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|You are covered in illusionary wounds, causing severe damage while the effect remains active. Destroying the source of the illusion will restore all health lost to the flaying.}}\n\n'''Flayed''' is a [[status effect]] inflicted by [[flayed ghost]]s. Each time you are flayed, you'll \"lose\" 25% of your current [[HP]]. Multiple uses of Flay can stack, but will never bring you below 7 HP. This is treated as actual damage for all purposes: it can be healed through normal means, and being reduced to 0 HP with Flay still causes death. However, when the Flay status ends, all HP lost is restored. \n\nYou can end Flay by killing any hostile flayed ghost (regardless of which one caused the status), by spending time outside any ghosts' [[line of sight]], or by using a [[potion of cancellation]] (or any other source of [[dispel]]ling). Unlike [[torment]], there is no way to resist Flay.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], flay's HP loss was equal to the smaller of: <code>(0.06 * max_hp) + (0.18 * current_hp)</code> or <code>current_hp - 24 - 1d15</code>. Also, monsters could only flay if it did a minimum of 10 damage, so they would never flay if you were at 35 HP or lower.\n*Flayed was added in [[0.13]].\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

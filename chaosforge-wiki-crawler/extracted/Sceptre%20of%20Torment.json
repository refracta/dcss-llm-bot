When used in combat, it causes agonising pain in all those unfortunate enough to gaze upon it, save for the wielder.}}\n\n[[File:Sceptre of torment.png]] '''''the +7 sceptre of Torment'''''\n\n+7 [[eveningstar]]\n\n[[Pain brand]]<br>\nCasts [[Symbol of Torment]] on 20% of successful attacks - the wielder is immune to these torments<br>\n[[Evil]]\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''sceptre of Torment'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|311}}</ref> is an excellent weapon for those invested in [[Necromancy]] that can take full advantage of the [[pain brand]]. Even with no Necromancy skill, a +7 eveningstar is still a respectable one-handed weapon for a [[Maces & Flails]] user. Its auto-torment effect is very useful in a standard 3-rune game, but becomes significantly less helpful in late-game areas where most monsters are immune to torment like the [[Tomb]], the [[Hells]], the [[Abyss]], and [[Pandemonium]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.23]], the sceptre of Torment had a [[staff]] as its base type, did not have the [[pain]] brand, triggered torment on 50% of its attacks, and did not protect the wielder from its torment.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], the sceptre of Torment also had a very small chance of activating each turn when you weren't attacking with it.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the sceptre of Torment had a [[mace]] as its base type.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the Sceptre of Torment was a +7, +6 weapon.\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]\n[[Category:Evil]]"}

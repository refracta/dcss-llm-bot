{"title":"Shining eye","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shining_eye","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | eyeballs}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Shining eyes''' are dangerous floating monsters that deal no damage, but aggressively blast you with [[mutation]]-inflicting gaze attacks. Although these give you [[good mutations]] roughly 5% of the time, [[bad mutations]] are much, much more common. They are found in [[the Slime Pits]], and can be summoned by a few enemies through the [[Summon Eyeballs]] spell.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Their attack requires a clear line of fire to hit you. Prevent this as much as possible.\n**Block their malmutate by shielding yourself with other monsters, hostile or friendly. [[Summon]]s, like from [[scroll of butterflies]], [[Haunt]], or [[Summon Horrible Things]], work well. Conjurations users can use [[Fulminant Prism]] to block their line of fire.\n**You can also block their [[line of sight]] with a [[scroll of fog]].\n*If you block their line of fire, you can then use [[piercing]], [[smite-targeted]], or AOE attacks to safely attack the eye. Examples include [[silver]] [[javelin]]s (which are especially effective against malmutators), [[LRD]], [[Airstrike]], and [[Portal Projectile]].\n*Shining eyes are slow. If one appears from the edge of [[LOS]], you can walk away to reposition, buff, and/or summon."}

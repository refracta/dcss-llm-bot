{"title":"Kikubaaqudgha","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Kikubaaqudgha","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n[[File:Kikubaaqudgha altar.png]] \"Spread unending torment and darkness!\"''\n\n{{flavour|Kikubaaqudgha is a terrible Demon-God, served by those who wish to indulge in the powers of death. An evil god, Kikubaaqudgha requires worshippers to cause the death and destruction of as many creatures as possible. In exchange, Kikubaaqudgha offers great assistance to the aspiring necromancer: a supply of useful bodies, knowledge of dark magic, and protection against necromantic backlash.\n\nKikubaaqudgha will enhance servants' necromantic prowess with gifts of Necromancy spells. Kikubaaqudgha will protect followers from the effects of necromantic miscasts, death curses, and may even shield them from unholy torment. Followers can unearth dying wretches as necromantic fodder, and may invoke torment. Kikubaaqudgha will eventually allow followers to either receive knowledge of the most forbidden necromantic magic, or to have their weapon imbued with pain.\n\nKikubaaqudgha likes it when you kill living beings, you destroy the undead, you kill demons, you kill holy beings and you destroy nonliving beings.\n\nKikubaaqudgha's powers are based on Necromancy instead of Invocations skill.}}\n\n==Restrictions==\n*[[Djinn]]'s unusual approach to magic renders them unable to worship Kikubaaqudgha.\n*[[Demigod]]s may not worship Kikubaaqudgha (or any other deity).\n\n==Appreciates==\n*You or your undead slaves killing living, nonliving, holy, undead, or demonic creatures. (Chance of +1 [[Piety]], chance increases with the victim's [[HD]], but decreases with your level.)\n\n==Deprecates==\n*Inactivity: You lose 1 piety per 340 turns, on average (1/17 chance every 20 turns).\n*Abandonment. (Penance)\n\n==Given Abilities==\n'''[[Piety|Piety level -]]''': \"Purveyor of Pain\"\n*No abilities.\n'''[[Piety|Piety level *]]''': \"Scholar of Death\"\n*'''Unearth Wretches''': Creates <code>1d2 + ([[Necromancy]] * 5/27) </code> (1-7) wretches, random Necromancy- and branch- dependent monsters. They are considered hostile, but are unable to act, have 1 HP, 0 [[willpower]], do not give XP, and will die in 2-3 turns. These monsters can be used to raise the dead. (3 MP, 3-4 piety)\n**When these monsters die \"wretchedly\", they will activate passive Necromancy effects (those of [[Fugue of the Fallen]], [[Animate Dead]] and [[Death Channel]]) even if you didn't attack them.\n'''[[Piety|Piety level **]]''': \"Merchant of Misery\"\n*You have a <code>piety/160</code> chance to block Necromancy [[miscast effect#Necromancy|miscast effects]]. Spells that qualify for protection will have \"Kikubaaqudgha supports the use of this spell.\" in the description.\n* Kikubaaqudgha will either completely protect you from [[mummy (monster)|mummy]] [[death curse]]s or reduce their severity by 50%. Complete protection or 50% reduction are equally likely.\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ***]]''': \"Artisan of Death\"\n*No new abilities.\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ****]]''': \"Dealer of Despair\"\n*'''Protection From Torment''': You sometimes take reduced damage from [[torment]] and [[agony]]; there is a piety/600 chance of taking no damage, and failing that, a piety/250 chance to reduce a random amount of damage (at least 1). The average damage is shown below.\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"text-align:center\" cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\"\n|- \n! '''Piety'''\n! '''Unprotected'''\n! '''Kiku Protection'''\n!

This splatters blood over the area, invokes torment, and overwrites the current brand on the weapon.\n\n==Gifts==\nKikubaaqudgha grants a semi-random assortment of spells upon reaching 1* and 3* piety. Kikubaaqudgha will never grant spells your species cannot cast. The first set guarantees the player at least one spell to complement the Unearth Wretches ability.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|religion.cc|1560}}</ref>\n\nAt 1* piety, Kiku will gift one of [[Animate Dead]] or [[Fugue of the Fallen]], then three randomly selected low-level [[Necromancy]] spells:\n*[[Necrotise]]\n*[[Kiss of Death]]\n*[[Sublimation of Blood]]\n*[[Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot]]\n*[[Vampiric Draining]]\n\nAt 3* piety, Kiku will gift four randomly selected mid-level Necromancy spells:\n*[[Anguish]]\n*[[Dispel Undead]]\n*[[Martyr's Knell]]\n*[[Curse of Agony]]\n*[[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]]\n*[[Death Channel]]\n\n==Punishments==\n{{flavour|Kikubaaqudgha does not appreciate abandonment, and will call down fearful punishments on disloyal followers!\n\nKikubaaqudgha's wrath brings forth all the dread powers of necromancy. Victims are wracked with screams of torment, and find their health and powers drained. Further, Kikubaaqudgha's gifts become tainted: the dead rise again as foes, and those that attempt to use necromantic magic to fend off wrath will find it backfiring on them when least expected.\n\nKikubaaqudgha's wrath lasts for a relatively short duration.}}\n\nWhen you abandon Kikubaaqudgha, all living, demonic or holy foes you slay will occasionally be reanimated as a zombie, spectre or simulacrum. This does not increment the [[penance]] counter. Additionally, the following actions will occasionally be taken:\n*Symbol of [[Torment]] is cast at your location, tormenting both you and susceptible foes around you.\n*A random stat between Strength, Intelligence or Dexterity is drained, with higher amounts of drain being more common at higher XP levels.\n*[[Drain]] the player for a significant portion of their max HP (resisted by negative energy resistance).\n**This can be extremely dangerous. Characters with no rN+ who are unfortunate enough to receive HP drain a few times in a row can reach even a single remaining HP point, which is a death sentence for any ex-worshipper.\n\nKiku may also punish you for casting Necromancy spells (5% probability). The spell succeeds, but you'll get a miscast effect anyways. This does not increment the [[penance]] counter.\n\n==Strategy==\nKikubaaqudgha offers three main features: a massive supply of undead allies, protection from torment and mummy death curses, and knowledge of Necromancy. Kiku's quick spell gifts are useful to [[Necromancer]]s and characters learning Necromancy from scratch alike. Torment Protection and the potential for [[Necromutation]] make Kiku good for the extended game, too.\n\nWhen you find Kiku's altar doesn't matter as much - lucky D:1 [[faded altar]]s aren't as good, waiting for a deep overflow altar is less punishing. This is for two reasons: 1. Kiku tends to grant spells well before they can be used reliably, and 2. Unearth Wretches only starts to become impressive with spells like [[Animate Dead]]. By corollary, these facts make Kiku less ''immediately'' helpful than other gods, especially if you didn't start out as a Necromancer.\n\n===Final Gift===\nAt 6*, you get the choice between a pain-branded weapon and the capstone Necromancy spells. This typically happens around the mid-game, and it can be a tricky decision. \n*The pain brand deals absolutely devastating, flat damage; faster weapons like [[Short Blade]]s and [[demon whip]]s work great, even with little weapon skill. But pain only works on the living. This is not a concern immediately, but iffy in [[Zot]] and useless in the demon and undead-infested extended game. Also note that blessing increases enchantment by 2.\n*The spells, on the other hand, are the inverse. Those spells are great for the lategame, but they won't help you one bit when you can't cast them.  It's also entirely possible to luck across the [[Necronomicon]] or other books as you explore. Of these spells, [[Haunt]] and [[Infestation]] are the most likely to be helpful before Zot.\n\nIn the end, the decision comes down to \"Would I rather have something that will help me much later, or something that will help me survive ''right now''?\" Further questions like \"will pain ''actually'' help me?\" can arise, depending on your character.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Unearth Wretches is incredibly powerful: it can create a swarm of allies after a few turns. There's no limit (beyond MP), so don't be afraid to use Wretches multiple times in a fight. And since it costs little piety, use it early and often. Note that UW requires quite a bit of MP and ''at least'' 2 turns of prep time, so it isn't great as an emergency button.\n**[[Death Channel]]'s spectres can be used with any other spell; however [[Animate Dead]] and [[Infestation]] do not stack.\n**Wretches spawn within a 5x5 area of yourself, last for min. 2 turns, and activate any of your Necromancy effects on death.\n***If using Animate Dead, you can cast the spell before or after you summon Wretches.\n***If using Infestation, you can do the following: have Death Channel up, use Wretches twice, cast Infestation on your tile (covering the 5x5 area), then repeat if desired. You don't want to cast Wretches more than twice in a row, or the 1st set can die before you can infest them.\n***Their deaths will also count towards [[Fugue of the Fallen]]'s slaying bonus.\n**Wretches are seen as hostile monsters, so other hostile monsters will usually avoid harming them. They can used as a (short-lived) blocker. Be wary of dangerous interactions, however, such as a [[necromancer (monster)|necromancer]] using your own Wretches against you with their [[Bind Souls]] spell.\n*Undead and [[Tree Form]] characters benefit the most from invoked torment, though that doesn't mean that living characters shouldn't use it at all! Kiku's protection will often reduce and even prevent damage, but living monsters take the full 50%. Plus, your torment-immune undead can mop up what remains.\n*Kiku has no objection towards weapons of [[holy wrath]].\n*Undead minions do not turn hostile when you attack or [[scroll of immolation|immolate]] them.\n\n===Branch Strategy===\nWorshippers are equipped with particularly effective tools for clearing a few branches in the game. The sole fact of worshipping Kikubaaqudgha is no reason to venture into these places without the proper resistances or XL, but it certainly helps.\n\n*'''[[Slime Pits]]''': While [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]] is ineffective against its gooey horrors, it's easy to create undead due to how many slimes there are. Using a [[scroll of immolation]] when combined with the sheer mass of your non-spectre allies and [[The Royal Jelly]]'s allies (potentially after Torment) is strikingly effective.\n\n*'''[[Crypt]]''': Kikubaaqudgha followers will find the torment and death curse protection to be immensely helpful. [[Haunt]] and [[Infestation]] still work against undead enemies, while [[Dispel Undead]] is effective against single undead targets in the Crypt.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Kiku's Torment ability will be replaced with Sign of Ruin, a smite-targeted ability, which debuffs a group of enemies. When the targets receive melee damage, they will suffer draining and will get the [[slow]], [[weak]], or [[blind]] status.}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Kiku's wrath had [[death curse]]s instead of [[drain]]ing the player. Also, the gift list was different.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Kiku's Undead Wretches was stronger (<code>2 + (Necro * 6/27)</code> wretches) and cost less piety, while Torment cost more piety. Also, spell gifts were different; most notably, the second spell gift had 5 spells.\n*In [[0.29]], Kiku was changed to accommodate the Necromancy overhaul and removal of useful [[corpse]]s. Prior to this version:\n**Receive Corpses was the 1* ability instead of Unearth Wretches, which created 1-9 corpses rather than \"live\" monsters.\n**The Torment ability required a corpse to use.\n**Kiku gifted [[Animate Skeleton]] instead of Necrotise at 1*, and could gift [[Pain]] (1*) and [[Excruciating Wounds]] (3*). Gifting logic was changed overall. Most notably, [[Animate Dead]] was guaranteed at 3* to make use of Receive Corpses.\n**The [[pain (brand)]] gift did not work with ranged weapons.\n**If you received partial torment protection, the minimum reduction was 0 instead of 1.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Kiku's 1* and 3* spell gifts guaranteed a corpse ''using'' spell instead of Animate Skeleton and Animate Dead; book logic was also different.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Kiku would gift randart spellbooks and the [[Necronomicon]], instead of gifting spells directly.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Kiku's wrath included [[Necromancy]] [[miscast effect#Necromancy|miscast effects]] instead of [[death curse]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], Kiku's 1* spellbook gift had a guaranteed [[Corpse Rot]] rather than a guaranteed [[Pain]] spell.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Kiku gave a piety-dependent bonus to final HP when casting [[Death's Door]]. Also, Kiku did not grant piety for killing undead creatures, and the torment protection did not reduce damage from [[agony]]. In addition, Kiku worshippers had to [[pray]] over a corpse to invoke the [[Torment]] ability. \n*Prior to [[0.17]], Kiku helped at [[Piety]] level **** to resist the [[Haunt]] inflicted [[sickness]] on the caster (resist rate rose with piety). Kiku worshippers also had to [[pray]] at an [[altar]] to receive the Necronomicon/Pain brand gifts.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], Kiku used Invocations instead of Necromancy;  [[victory dancing]] was required to train the former.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{gods}}\n[[Category:Evil Gods]]"}

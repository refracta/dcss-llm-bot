However, it does provide some useful buffs. So as long as you can handle the berserk by pre-emptively controlling fights, and don't ''always'' use it, this hat can prove to be somewhat useful.\n\nFor non-melee characters, *Rage can be safely ignored, since [[Ranged Weapons]], [[spells]], and other non-melee actions don't activate the berserk. Thus, it becomes an overall great hat. Any MP-related negatives from spirit shield are compensated with a great [[willpower]] boost.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Casters can inscribe their held item with <code>!a</code>, so that you don't accidentally trigger Bearserk.\n*If you try to melee attack with a [[ranged weapon]], you'll fire a projectile instead, which never triggers Bearserk.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the hat didn't cause you to go ''bear''serk.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the hat of the Bear Spririt had evocable berserk (instead of *Rage), [[Negative_energy#Negative_energy_Resistance|rN+]], but no buffs to the berserk status.\n*In [[0.14]] the MR provided was increased from 50 to 80.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Headgear]]"}

{"title":"Melee weapon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Melee_weapon","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n\n'''Melee weapons''' refer to [[weapon]]s which can only attack adjacent to you (with a few exceptions). While [[Ranged Weapons]] have an obvious range advantage, melee weapons have better stats. Melee weapons are divided into several categories, each of which has its own associated [[skill]] and its own particular advantages.\n\n==Weapon attributes==\nThe following is a table of all melee weapons in ''Crawl''. Below is a short explanation of each field: \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n!style=\"text-align: left;\" | Name\n| The name of the item as it appears in Crawl.\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n!style=\"text-align: left;\" | Damage\n| The base amount of damage the weapon does, before various bonuses and adjustments.  \n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n!style=\"text-align: left;\" | Hit\n| To hit modifier for the weapon, before any other adjustments.\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n!style=\"text-align: left;\" | [[Weapon speed|Speed]]\n| This is actually the attack delay in [[aut]]. Every 2 levels of weapon skill lowers the delay by 1 aut. A weapon's minimum delay is usually the lower of {half of its base delay, rounded down} or 7 aut. It is 5 aut for [[rapier]]s, and 10 aut for [[hand crossbow]]s, [[arbalest]]s, and [[triple crossbow]]s. This can be modified by [[brand]] and [[status effect]]s, to a hard minimum delay of 2 aut.\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n!style=\"text-align: left;\" | [[Handedness|One-handed min. size]]\n| Minimum size required to be able to use the weapon with one hand. The order is little, small, medium, large, giant.\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n!style=\"text-align: left;\" | [[Handedness|Two-handed min. size]]\n| Minimum size required to be able to use the weapon with two hands. When the player's size is equal or greater than 'Two-handed min. size', but less than 'One-handed min. size', the weapon cannot be used with a [[shield]].\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n!style=\"text-align: left; white-space: nowrap;\" | Dam Type\n| Slashing, slicing, and chopping weapons will cut [[hydra]] heads. Otherwise has no effect.\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n!style=\"text-align: left;\" | Prob\n| A larger number indicates higher probability of acquiring through scrolls of [[acquirement]].\n|}\n\n==Short Blades==\nAttacks with [[Short Blades]]<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|item-prop.cc|543}}</ref> tend to deal less damage, but they can attack faster. They also get a bonus to [[stab]] damage. Their damage scales with [[Dexterity]] instead of [[Strength]], and they [[cross-train]] with [[Long Blades]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Name || Dmg || Hit || Speed || One-handed min. size || Two-handed min. size || Dam Type || Prob || Notes\n|-\n| [[Dagger]] || 4 || +6 || 10 || Little || Little || Piercing || 10 || More stab damage than other Short Blades\n|-\n| [[Quick blade]] || 4 || +6 || 7 || Little || Little || Piercing  || 2 || Cannot receive [[speed brand]]\n|-\n| [[Short sword]] || 5 || +4 || 10 || Little || Little || Piercing  || 10 ||\n|-\n| [[Rapier]] || 7 || +4 || 12 || Little || Little || Piercing  || 10 || Min delay is 5\n|}\n\n==Long Blades==\n[[Long blades]]<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|item-prop.cc|589}}</ref> are heavier weapons that use [[Dexterity]] instead of [[Strength]] for damage scaling. They cross-train with [[Short Blades]]. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Name || Dam || Hit || Speed || One-handed min. size || Two-handed min. size || Dam Type || Prob || Notes\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| [[Falchion]] || 8 || +2 || 13 || Little || Little || Slicing || 10 ||\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| [[Long sword]] || 10 || +1 || 14 || Little || Little || Slicing || 10 ||\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| [[Scimitar]] || 12 || 0 || 14 || Little || Little || Slicing || 10 ||\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| [[Demon blade]] || 13 || -1 || 13 || Little || Little || Slicing || 2 ||\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| [[Eudemon blade]] || 14 || -2 || 12 || Little || Little || Slicing || - || A demon blade blessed by [[The Shining One]]\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| [[Double sword]] || 15 || -1 || 15 || Medium || Little || Slicing || 2 ||\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| [[Great sword]] || 17 || -3 || 17 || - || Medium || Slicing || 10 ||\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| [[Triple sword]] || 19 || -4 || 18 || - || Medium || Slicing || 2 ||\n|}\n\n==Maces & Flails==\n[[Maces & Flails]]<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|item-prop.cc|457}}</ref> have no unique traits. They generally have higher damage and lower base delay (thus, lower skill to reach mindelay) than other weapons. They cross train [[Axes]] and [[Staves]]. \n\n[[Ogre]]s, [[Troll]]s, and [[Formicid]]s have access to [[giant club]]s and [[giant spiked club]]s, the two most powerful weapon types in the game. However, these require a lot of skill and preclude a shield.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

When attacking, axes strike all other enemies adjacent to you for 70% damage. They cross-train [[Polearms]] and [[Maces & Flails]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

They cross train [[Axes]] and [[Staves]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

[[Quarterstaves]] and [[lajatang]]s offer high damage for their base delay (thus, don't require much skill), but are rarer and two-handed. [[Magical staves]] primarily boost the power of [[spell]]s, but can be used in melee too.\n\nNote that magical staves fight like +0 staves, though with added damage based on your magical skill and [[Evocations]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

{"title":"Variants","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Variants","type":"raw","data":"''Crawl'' has a number of variants changing aspects of gameplay, not the least of which is [[Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup]]. Many of them are still actively developed. This page has a list of variants (of DCSS) which are or were available for play on online servers, along with some interesting features of each. \n\n==BcadrenCrawl==\nBcadrenCrawl offers dual wielding of weapons; a silent spectre species that has a silence aura it can cast through; a goblin species with low stats, high apts, and extra invocations power; some new backgrounds (including [[Demigod]]s reworked as a background); and god reworks including a feature where [[Hepliaklqana]] ancestors differ based on your own species.\n\nMore information [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gNrFq3TNuaUoSYYwBHJG4bprF4zrJwzvipujZh6DFHI here]. Based on [[0.22]]. Available on CPO, CKO, CXC, and [http://xom.montres.org.uk:8080 XOM].\n\n==bcrawl==\nBased off the community driven X-Crawl, the author of bcrawl believes that vanilla development has stagnated, so bcrawl has a number of experimental features intended to shake the game up. The Dungeon and many [[branch]]es are shortened, and instead of random [[trap]]s by exploring, going up stairs has a chance to [[teleport]] you. On the converse, it also does ''not'' include many game-changing streamlinings of current DCSS, such as the removal of [[food]] and [[curse]]s (though all items are identified if you have a [[rune]]).\n\nInstead of global changes, bcrawl mostly features reworks to many backgrounds, species, gods, etc., with many balance changes especially to spells. It also adds six species, an Archaeologist background, and an alternate version of Reaver.\n\nMore information [https://github.com/b-crawl/bcrawl/ here]. Scoring [http://bcrawl.montres.org.uk here]. Based on [[0.22]], but includes many future changes. Available on CPO, CXC, CKO, CUE, and [http://xom.montres.org.uk:8080 XOM]. X-Crawl can also be found on XOM.\n\n==Bloatcrawl==\nBloatcrawl focuses on adding new species and backgrounds, adding over a dozen of each, including backgrounds that start worshipping [[Jiyva]], [[Vehumet]], [[Makhleb]], [[Cheibriados]], [[Qazlal]], [[Ashenzari]], and [[Nemelex]].\n\nMore information [https://github.com/WORLD-CRAWL-ASSOCIATION/bloatcrawl here]. Based on [[0.23]].\n\n===Bloatcrawl2===\nBloatcrawl2 is the sequel of bloatcrawl, featuring even more species and backgrounds (for a total of 69! of each). Additionally, players can choose to add undead characteristics ([[Mummy]], [[Ghoul]], or [[Vampire]]) to any race, as well as alter a few other settings, before the game starts.\n\nMore information [https://github.com/Hellmonk/bloatcrawl2 here]. Based on [[0.25]]. Available on CKO.\n\n==DCSS Circus Animals==\nDCSS-CA reworks many species, and brings back some removed and experimental species such as [[Lava Orc]]s and old Djinn. It has optional new modes for getting experience, such as gaining experience levels upon reaching new floors rather than killing monsters. It restores the unfinished experimental Enchanted Forest and Dwarven Halls branches. It adds difficulty levels and a stamina system where your character can temporarily exert themselves to do more damage, have better spells, or move quickly.\n\nMore information [https://github.com/jeremygurr/dcssca here]. Based on [[0.19]]. Available on [http://xom.montres.org.uk:8080 XOM].\n\n==Gnollcrawl==\nYou cannot gain any experience levels or skills, and every enemy is a [[Gnoll_(monster)|gnoll]]. Gnoll sergeants and shamen sometimes turn up in Zot, and the final boss is [[Grum]].\n\nMore information [https://github.com/Dracunos/gnollcrawl here]. Based on [[0.19]]. Available on [http://xom.montres.org.uk:8080 XOM].\n\n===Other \"all enemies are X\" variants===\ngnollcrawl.tk also offered [[boggart]]crawl, [[orb of fire|OOF]]crawl, and [[lich]]crawl, all of which have similar mechanics.\n\n==Gooncrawl==\nFeatures are added to Gooncrawl based on democratic voting amongst the readers of Something Awful, a long-running Web forum. Gooncrawl undoes many removals unpopular with those readers, such as [[High Elf|High Elves]], [[Death Knight]]s, removed spells, [[wand of hasting|wands of hasting]], and mutagenic [[chunk]]s. It also reworks some species, adds some new features such as new spells, and implements a \"permabuff\" system where spells such as [[Regeneration]] need not be repeatedly recast.\n\nMore information [https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=25055 here]. Scoring [http://gooncrawl.montres.org.uk here]. Based on [[0.22]]. Available on [http://xom.montres.org.uk:8080 XOM].\n\n==Hellcrawl==\nHellcrawl aims to streamline the Crawl experience. It removes things which the author feels are unnecessary, like the Lair, player ghosts, and identification. There are no stairs up; you must continue to descend through the dungeon, and once you have the Orb of Zot you attempt to escape via [[Hell]]. In turn, it reworks some species, gods, and monsters. It also turns out that many things that were removed in Hellcrawl - like physical spellbooks, food, and curses - were eventually removed from Stone Soup, too.\n\nMore information [https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=21527 here]. Based on [[0.19]]. Available on CPO, CKO, LLD, and [http://xom.montres.org.uk:8080 XOM].\n\n==Kimchi==\n\n[https://github.com/kimjoy2002/crawl#design-goals Design goals]: \"Development will be focused on adding content rather than deletion. For adding content, even if a balance problem is seen, the goal is to add it first. Restoring old content is also one of the main goals while maintaining the current system.\" The players can vote on which features they would like to see added or changed.\n\nThis variant brings back [[Pakellas]], [[Fulsome Distillation]] and [[Evaporate]], [[Singularity]], [[rods]], [[disc of storms]], [[mutagenic corpse]]s, and top-tier [[wand]]s. Players have access to more inventory space via a new misc item, a bag. God reworks include numerous improvements for managing and levelling up [[Beogh|orcish allies]]; [[Hepliaklqana]]'s battlemage ancestor can cast [[Fireball]] and [[Fire Storm]]; [[Yredelemnul]], [[Trog]], [[Jiyva]], and [[Zin]] can [[brand]] weapons with thematically appropriate [[ego]]s. Also, there are two new gods: a god of alchemy and a god of reflections. Finally, Kimchi adds homunculus, hydra, meliai, and several other species, four new backgrounds, and a whole bunch of new spells.\n\nThe change log can be found [https://github.com/kimjoy2002/crawl/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md here]. Based on [[0.24]]. Available on CWZ and [http://xom.montres.org.uk:8080 XOM].\n\n==Stoat Soup==\nStoat Soup was started because of dissatisfaction with the removal of [[monster generation|monster spawns]] over time in [[0.21]]; it restores these spawns. It restores the removed [[High Elf]] and [[Mountain Dwarf]] species and adds a new Faerie Dragon species intended to be a straightforward option for spellcasting. It implements an independently developed permabuff system. [[Player ghost]]s in Stoat Soup are not found in vaults, but appear to seek revenge on whatever killed them, potentially helping the current player.\n\nMore information [http://crawl.montres.org.uk/about.html here].

Some mutations are reworked, and there are some other balance changes. \n\nMore information [https://github.com/yrmvgh/yiufcrawl here]. Based on [[0.20]]."}

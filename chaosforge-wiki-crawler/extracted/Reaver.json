{"title":"Reaver","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Reaver","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|Reavers have an assortment of powerful, but highly situational, conjurations to draw upon when their skill in melee is insufficient. They start with a simple weapon of their choice and leather armour.}}\n\n'''Reavers''' are warriors who learn [[Conjurations]] (destructive magic) in order to complement their deadliness in combat.\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Gnoll]], [[Tengu]], [[Barachi]], [[Demonspawn]], [[Draconian]], and [[Hill Orc]] are the recommended species if you pick a Reaver Background.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[weapon of choice]] ([[short sword]], [[hand axe]], [[spear]], [[falchion]] or [[mace]])\n*+0 [[leather armour]]\n\n===Available Spells===\n*[[Kiss of Death]]\n*[[Momentum Strike]]\n*[[Hailstorm]]\n\nReavers start with the [[Kiss of Death]] spell memorised.\n\n==Starting Skills==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Fighting]]: 2\n*Chosen Weapon's Skill: 3\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Spellcasting]]: 2\n*[[Conjurations]]: 3\n\nChoosing Reaver adds 4 to your starting [[Strength]], 5 to [[Intelligence]], and 3 to [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nReavers should be treated as melee warriors, with a little extra power from their set of spells. Their spells have a theme: limited use, but powerful.\n\nReaver is a flexible background. If you've found a set of [[plate armour]], don't be afraid to rely entirely on melee for a while. If you've found a [[Book of Conjurations]], then you have a path towards general spellcasting. Being a \"pure hybrid\" isn't always possible; some characters will spend the rest of the game focusing on melee or magic.\n\n=== Spell Details ===\n[[Kiss of Death]] should be thought of as a consumable, like [[Brigand]]'s darts or [[Gladiator]]'s [[throwing net]]s. It deals extreme damage for its level and ignores [[EV]]. However, it [[drain]]s a good chunk of your max HP (temporarily). You can cure draining by killing monsters. You should use Kiss of Death sparingly, but it can be a strong option against early [[gnoll (monster)|gnolls]], [[adder]]s, and other scary monsters. Past D:4 or so, this spell becomes too weak to deal with dangerous threats. Training 1-2 levels of Necromancy skill, in addition to Conjurations, can be worthwhile.\n\n[[Momentum Strike]], like Kiss of Death, is not a main source of damage. It deals relatively high damage, but if you hit, ''you are prevented from moving'' for a few turns. And if you can't move, you can't cast this spell (e.g. it has a cooldown). Position yourself in a hallway or other advantageous position before casting this spell. Due to its casting limitations, Momentum Strike is closer to a support spell than an actual killing tool.\n\n[[Hailstorm]] doesn't harm the player for using it, but with a range of 2-3, it is a very awkward spell to use. Most characters are limited to 1-2 casts before an enemy gets into melee range. Depending on the character and dungeon loot, it might not be worth it to train Conjurations up to Hailstorm at all.\n\n==History==\n*The Reaver background was reintroduced in [[0.30]], with an entirely new set of spells.\n*Reaver was removed in version [[0.8]]. This version could start with the [[Book of Conjurations]] (Ice) or [[Book of Conjurations (fire+earth)|Book of Conjurations (Fire)]].\n** Ice contained [[Magic Dart]], [[Throw Frost]], [[Mephitic Cloud]], [[Lightning Bolt]], [[Bolt of Cold]], and [[Freezing Cloud]]\n** Fire contained [[Magic Dart]], [[Throw Flame]], [[Stone Arrow]], [[Conjure Flame]], [[Bolt of Magma]], and [[Bolt of Fire]].\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

{"title":"Nameless horror","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Nameless_horror","type":"raw","data":"{{version027}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Nameless horrors''' are monsters that only appear as a result of [[miscast]] [[Summonings]] spells. They are [[durably summoned]] into existence, and their [[HD]] (and thus many of their stats) depend on the severity of the miscast.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Their large HP pools and ability to strip you of your magic make fighting them with spells a difficult proposition at best. Characters with access to direct damage spells that don't involve [[poison]] or [[negative energy]] have the best chances -- nameless horrors are outright immune to [[Hexes]] and can abjure other summons (not to mention the inherent risk of miscasting again and making ''more'' nameless horrors).\n*As durable summons, nameless horrors are worth no [[XP]] and do not drop any loot, so there is no reason you cannot simply run away and leave them for later. Fortunately, they are no faster than the average character. If you can increase your movement speed at all, you can outrun them and leave them for later.\n**Nameless horrors can't fly or use [[door]]s. If you can put some impassable terrain between you and them, you'll be able to safely leave them behind.\n**Consider luring them upstairs to a cleared floor, then breaking away and leaving them where you'll only have to worry about them if you find yourself backtracking.\n\n==History==\n*Nameless horrors were introduced in [[0.25]]."}

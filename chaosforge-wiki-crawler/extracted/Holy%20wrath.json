Using the brand will offend [[Yredelemnul]], but the other [[evil]] gods won't mind.\n\n==Sources==\nHoly wrath can be found on any melee weapon except [[demon blade]]s, [[demon trident]]s, and [[demon whip]]s (which become their blessed counterparts instead). It can not be obtained through a [[scroll of brand weapon]]. It can also be found by:\n*[[The Shining One]], at 6* piety, can bless any weapon, including [[Ranged Weapons]]. This can be done once per game.\n*Any [[eudemon blade]]s, [[trishula]]s, and [[sacred scourge]]s you find will always have holy wrath (and cannot be rebranded without divine blessing). These are often found on [[angel]]s, [[daeva]]s, and [[Mennas]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While holy wrath is weak in most early-game branches (such as [[the Lair]]), it excels in the [[extended game]], when most branches are filled with powerful demons and undead. [[The Crypt]], [[the Tomb]], [[Pandemonium]] and the [[Hell]]s are especially good places to have a weapon of holy wrath.\n*Holy wrath doesn't do anything against \"[[evil]]\" creatures aren't actually undead or demonic, such as [[necromancer (monster)|necromancers]] or [[hell knight]]s.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], undead and demonspawn couldn't wield weapons of holy wrath at all.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], weapons of holy wrath were immune to being [[curse]]d, even from [[Ashenzari]].\n*Prior to [[0.4]], holy wrath only dealt +50% average damage against undead (but had the same damage against demons).\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{brands}}\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

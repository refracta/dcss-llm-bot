{"title":"Death yak","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Death_yak","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n[[Death yak]]s are far tougher than their [[yak]] brethren. They are some of the strongest monsters in [[the Lair]], appearing in packs and hitting hard enough to quickly wipe out players.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Most tricks to take out dangerous monsters won't work well on death yaks; they have high [[willpower]] and [[hit dice]] to shake off most [[status effect]]s, and their melee strength makes it unwise to brute force. The following do work, though:\n**Poison. [[Curare]] darts slow as usual, allowing you to run away from the yak or fight. While [[Mephitic Cloud]] checks HD, a cloud can attempt to confuse multiple times, which can eventually work. \n***Death yaks will happily charge into a [[scroll of poison]]'s clouds, but they'll take lots of damage in the process. If you have [[poison resistance]] (or use a [[potion of resistance]], or worship [[Qazlal]]), [[kiting]] death yaks through the poison clouds is brutally effective. Even if you don't have rPois, they'll be weakened significantly - just make sure you can fight and/or escape afterwards.\n**[[Throwing net]]s and damaging [[evocable]] items function normally. Their usefulness depends on the item; a net can't be thrown at every yak, but it can help you win against a single one. A [[tin of tremorstones]] or [[lightning rod]] is unlikely to kill outright, but it can help soften them up.\n**[[Kiting]]. Death yaks are 10 speed enemies, so [[Spriggan]]s can kite in an explored area with relative safety.\n*Don't try to melee multiple death yaks at once. For melee characters, the usual tactic of [[stair dancing]] works well. Just don't bring more mutton than you can chew. Ranged attacks can work, since death yaks don't have any of their own.\n*If you encounter a pack of death yaks in [[the Dungeon]], they are almost certainly part of a [[vault]] guarding the Lair. They are ''very'' nasty foes for this part of the game, so don't attempt to fight one. But remember that death yaks are 10 speed enemies, so you can walk away.\n**If you're trying to sneak past death yaks, keep note of their \"[[:Category:Herd_flag|herd]]\" behavior; yaks tend to follow each other. If you find a yak in one area, it's unlikely for there to be any yaks in ''another'' area (say, the entrance to the Lair)."}

If it kills the target, or the target is killed within 1.0 turn after, it creates a [[skeleton]] ally.\n\n[[Necromancer]]s begin with this spell in their libraries. [[Kikubaaqudgha]] can gift this spell at 1* of piety.\n\n==Useful Info==\nOther than dealing direct damage, this spell creates [[derived undead]], in the form of skeletons. \n\n[[HD]] of skeletons depends on the [[spellpower]]: <code>minion_hd = mons_hd * (100 + pow) / 300</code>. This means that at the max spellpower skeletons will have 1/2 of their original HD. Skeletons will last for around 27 turns, regardless of spellpower. There is no limit to the amount of skeletons that you can create.\n\nNecrotise has an [[enchantment power]] multiplier of x3.5, which makes it significantly harder to resist than other early-game spells. However, due to the low ''spell power'' cap, it struggles to affect enemies in the mid-game onwards.\n\n==Strategy==\nNecrotise deals decent damage that ignores [[AC]] and [[EV]]. For an XL 1 [[Necromancer]], expect around a 60-80% chance for Necrotise to work (ignoring your own [[spell failure]] rate).\n\nNote that your own skeletons can block Necrotise's line of fire.\n\n==Monster Spell==\nMonsters have access to the [[Pain]] spell, which deals the same damage but doesn't create a skeleton.\n\n==History==\n*Removed in [[0.32]] and replaced by [[Soul Splinter]].\n*Necrotise was introduced in [[0.29]], combining the effect of [[Pain]] (without the self damage) and [[Animate Skeleton]]."}

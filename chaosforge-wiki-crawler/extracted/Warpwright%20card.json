{"title":"Warpwright card","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Warpwright_card","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|The card depicts a heavily engraved door swinging open. The landscape beyond appears upside down.}}\nThe Warpwright card attempts to place a teleport trap near the player. It is completely ineffective in the Abyss. It is often better than a [[Scroll of teleportation]] in an emergency because the player can step on the trap for an instant getaway, rather than waiting for the scroll to trigger.\n\nThe Warpwright card could be found in the following [[Decks|decks]] over the past several versions.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.11]]\n![[0.12]]\n![[0.13]]\n![[0.14]]\n![[0.15]]\n![[0.16]]\n![[0.17]]\n![[0.18]]\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n|----\n|}\n\n==History==\nThe warpwright card was removed in the simplification of decks in [[0.19]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

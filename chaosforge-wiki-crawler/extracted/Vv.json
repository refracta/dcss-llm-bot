{"title":"Vv","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Vv","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Vv the Exile''' is a [[unique]] monster of a unique species. She combines both fire and ice attacks, with a dual-[[brand]]ed melee attack and the spells of the cold [[ironbound frostheart]] and hot [[salamander tyrant]].\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Crypt]]\n*[[The Depths]]: 2-4\n*[[Realm of Zot]]: 1-4\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Vv's elemental spells are highly dangerous and ignore EV, but can only be used in certain situations. Positioning is crucial:\n**[[Creeping Frost]] can only be used against targets adjacent to walls.\n**[[Eruption]] creates lava, and [[Pyroclastic Surge]] can only be used when you're near lava. While Eruption can be used anywhere, it is less likely to create lava in a cramped space (e.g. hallways). Since Pyroclastic Surge gives a 2nd chance for her to use a fire spell, try to avoid lava if possible.\n:Thus, players with great [[cold resistance]] may want to stay near walls and hallways (giving a chance to avoid Pyroclastic Surge). Players with great fire resistance may want to stay away from walls (avoiding Creeping Frost). Being in melee assumes you have both resistances - and anyone but the most well-armoured characters will be devastated, anyway.\n*She cannot [[see invisible]], so [[potions of invisibility]] are highly effective at avoiding her deadly spells.\n*Like many constructs, she is vulnerable to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] and [[Shatter]].\n*A [[scroll of vulnerability]] will greatly boost the success rates of [[Hexes]] and hex [[wand]]s. In particular, [[Anguish]] allows you to rebound her lethal spells for a very fast takedown. As usual, a [[wand of paralysis]] is great at taking down vulnerable enemies.\n\n==History==\n*Vv was introduced in [[0.29]]."}

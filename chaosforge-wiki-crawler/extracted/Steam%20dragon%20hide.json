It may be turned into proper armour by magical means.}}\n\nA '''steam dragon hide''' isn't a particularily impressive armour... In fact, it's almost the same as a lowly [[robe]]. However, it does provide two ranks of [[steam]] resistance, and can be enchanted with a [[scroll of enchant armour]] to turn it into a much more desirable [[steam dragon armour]].\n\nYou may find one after butchering a [[steam dragon]] corpse.\n\n==History==\nSteam dragon hides were removed in [[0.19]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Hide''' || [[File:Steam dragon hide.png]]\n|-\n| '''Armour''' || [[File:Steam dragon armour.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

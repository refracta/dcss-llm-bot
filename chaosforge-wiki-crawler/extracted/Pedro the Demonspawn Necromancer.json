While I did win in the old version, either the game has got harder or I've forgotten too much, probably both. I already considered it a hard game. Finding new stuff makes it fun again. Don't expect to be dazzled with mad skills, I'm just doing a diary for the fun of it.\n\n## Pedro's diary, day 1\n\nI feel like I'm writing my will. If anybody finds this, my half brother Willie can have my book of cantrips.\n\nWhy the Orb of Xot? Who knows? I have this urge to find it and bring it back to the surface. I've had this compulsion for as long as I can remember, although in recent years it's become harder to resist until one day I told my family that I just had to go for it. Mom sad but seemed to expect it, my stepfather managed to look annoyed and relieved at the same time. He's had a lot of practice looking annoyed around me, though, so I guess it wasn't that hard.\n\nI've always been different from the others in my village. Let's just say I've always been a little morbid and leave it at that. Being different probably has something to do with my father, who I never met. Mom wouldn't talk about him, ever. Possibly this quest will lead me to some sort of self discovery crap, I don't know.\n\nSkipping the boring trip to the entrance of the dungeon, and the night I spent resting up, I arrived with only my dagger, robe, spellbook, and a ration. I knew a whopping one spell, it's called Pain. It hurts when I do it, and sometimes it doesn't work. With such crummy equipment the first order of business is... get better stuff!\n\nLucky me, I found a sabre right away but I kept the dagger in my pack. I'd like to get a long blade but I don't expect to find one soon. I also found a ring mail but seeing how I plan to rely on spells a lot I stuck with my robe. I found some stairways going down but didn't investigate until I felt a little more experienced. Which happened pretty soon, actually. I killed some goblins, kobolds, and some sort of an ooze creature and I felt a good deal tougher. That ooze thing hit hard.\n\nAfter exploring every corner of the first floor of the structure, I checked out each of the three staircases leading down. Just for a look. One I really didn't like. There were too many creatures in sight, including a poisonous snake. Interestingly, I got hungry once and ate a chunk of snake. Not only not poisonous, it didn't make me sick like goblin or orc chunks sometimes do. **Never eat kobold unless you don't mind being poisoned.**\n\nSo, anyway, I took one of the other stairways. My method of exploration is to just go at random, picking up all the scrolls and potions and other items I think might be useful. If I see a monster, I stop and think for a sec. Usually I cast pain on it if it hasn't noticed me. Sometimes if I find a monster, say, around a corner, and it's sleeping, I'll try stabbing it. If it's in the open and I'd have to walk up on it, no. I'm afraid that I'll be sneaking up on what looks like a lone monster but is really part of a group. If one wakes up, there's a good chance it'll yell and alert the others. So I hit whatever it is with Pain. If it was a toughy I'd cast Pain some more, but if it's not so bad I'd let it get close and stick it a couple times with the sabre. It worked.\n\nA funny thing happened after I killed a trio of gnollish warriors using my method (being careful to only alert one at a time and heavy on the Pain because gnolls are mean bastards). I grew scales! My skin totally got harder, I can't explain it. I don't feel quite as flexible as I used to be, though. Shortly after that I found a shield. Unlike the ring mail, it doesn't seem to make casting spells any more difficult, so I'm using it.\n\nI also almost died. I came around a corner and this steam dragon was, like, right *there.* I didn't want to run as I figured I'd get fried by its breath. I hit it with Pain several times but it kept resisting. I tried a wand to cast slowing on it but it only had a charge or two left. Chomp chomp and the steam dragon was all like LOL NOOB but I got in a couple more Pains and they did enough damage that it started to run away. I actually killed it by throwing my dagger, lucky shot.\n\nI also ran into a ghost. I managed to kill a phantom without much trouble but when I saw this ghost I knew I had to run. Too bad for me, the best way to run was right past the ghost, to a staircase. So I did. It was the ghost of a hunter minotaur, and while it didn't puncture me with arrows, it did hit me once and half killed me. Even though it was right next to me it didn't follow me down the stairs.\n\nBy then I was five flights underground. I got into a scrap with a hobgoblin and while I was killing it a kobold closed with me. I killed the hob with Pain and a little voice in my head went, \"ding! You are now a level 6 Necromancer\". Then the kobold hit me with a glowing sword and I felt drained. I was like, Thanks a lot, jerk, I think I'll take that sword.\n\nRight around there I ran into some guy named Edmund. I used Pain and drain on him-- drain as in the sword. I memorized Vampiric Draining but haven't used it yet. I could've learned Animate Skeleton but that sounded too wimpy. Could've learned Regeneration, too, but I thought I'd wait and see what other spellbooks turned up before branching off from good old necromancy. Hey, it got me this far.\n\nEdmund must've been guarding the entrance to the Ecumenical Temple. I found this neat altar made of skulls in there. If only people in my village worshiped cool gods like Kikubaaqudgha I would've liked it a lot better there. As it is, I'm starting to like it down here. In just one day I feel smarter than before and a lot tougher.. Think I'll set up camp for the night. Oh, I almost forgot to mention, I found a weapon shop belonging to somebody named Sithrubaaj but they only had weapons I'm not interested in-- no swords at all.\n\n## Pedro's diary, day 2\n\nWell, I'm still here, diary, although there were some close calls.\n\nI still must have been half-asleep when I left the temple, because I forgot to identify my scrolls and potions like I meant to. The temple is nice and quiet, so it's a good place to leave items I don't want to carry or try things out. It's best to try items in a place without monsters. That way if I test a potion and it turns out to be paralysis, it wears off and I don't come to with a giant centipede burrowing into my leg. So, after I'd explored some more I realized what I'd done and headed by to my base.\n\nI'd heard that one of the types of scroll in the dungeon is booby trapped and explodes, so I dropped all my papers and read the scrolls one at a time, away from my stuff. Sure enough, one blew up and burned me half to death. Now that that's out of the way I can be a little less cautious. I happened to have a nice stack of identify scrolls so I checked all the jewelry I'd found and identified some potions, too. One was the one I'd been looking for, it cures mutation, and after that I just identify them by plugging my nose and saying bottoms up. I put the cure potion in my stash of items in the temple-- if I carry it around I could end up losing it. Same thing with most of my scrolls. I just carry the ones I think I might need, like teleportation and blink, if I have them. I didn't find any remove curse scrolls, I don't think. More about that later.\n\nThings started to get hairy pretty quick as I started going deeper into the dungeon. In the shallow parts, about the toughest thing you'd see is an ogre. It wasn't too far past the temple that I started to see hill giants and slime creatures. And centaurs. Man, I hate centaurs. I don't have much of a defense against their arrows except trying to dodge and hide behind my shield at the same time. I've heard that jellies can be a real problem as they ruin your equipment but Pain seems to deal with them just fine.\n\nAnother weird thing happened after I killed an orc wizard. Suddenly I felt hot and ever since then I haven't been as sensitive to cold.\n\nI finally found a proper sword, diary! Well, first I took a falchion off a dead orc priest. It was cursed, but at least I could still cut up critters to eat. Not only that but then I read a scroll to find out what it was and accidentally cursed my shield and couldn't take it off. I looked all over but couldn't find any remove curse scrolls. Then I found a shop and bought a nice, shiny long sword. I got so sick of using that crappy falchion that I used an enchant weapon scroll to remove the curse.\n\nBut the best thing is that I've made heaps of friends here. I finally got good enough at magic to learn my Animate Dead spell, so I've started reviving creatures. When they were alive they were hostile, but once I kill them and bring them back they're nice as can be. They follow me around and try to stay close to me. Mostly they can't because they're slow due to the whole not being alive thing but as I am a good servant, my god (who is the coolest) has granted me the power to summon my buddies no matter if they're out of sight or whatever. Yaks in particular seem to make great pets. Plus with all the hair it's harder to tell that they're not really alive.\n\nMostly I've been using the same old tactics to deal with the locals. Cast Pain to get attention and maybe a couple more times for good measure as they advance on me, then hit them with the old pig sticker. However, what with the hostiles getting tougher, Pain isn't quite as good as it used to be. Still good for giving a giant frog a hotfoot or zotzing a fleeing killer bee, but that's about it. I'm relying a lot more on Vampiric Draining now. Once the mark has thumped me once or twice I give them a case or three of VD. I get well and they get worse. In extreme cases, like those centaurs I was talking about or a cyclops, I've started using regeneration, too. And usually I'll have some friends around to help out. Too many is a crowd, though, and start to get hard to keep track of. I mostly just raise the sturdiest corpses I come across, and if they're quick, like yaks, so much the better. Quality over quantity. I tried raising a bunch of orcs but they didn't last long.\n\nHm, what else happened today? Well, I found the entrance to the Orcish Mines but didn't go in as I'd heard the Lair was a good place to explore. It turns out the lair entrance was much deeper than the mines, but I found it. I've set up another camp here. Oh, and I identified that long sword. Looks like I'll be heading back to the mines sooner than I thought. I found a really nice cloak, too.\n\nSometimes I'll talk to my not alive friends-- usually just stuff like \"get him!\" but sometimes I'll kid around a little. Like Steve, this ex-ogre I hung around with for a while. Just joking, I said \"where do I take a dump around here?\" and to my surprise he tried to talk. Sound like he was trying to say \"shift three\". Shift three whats? Good old Steve, too bad that manticore ripped his guts out.\n\n```\nDungeon Crawl Stone Soup version 0.3.4 (crawl-ref) character file.\nPedro the Reanimator                                                                                \nRace       : Demonspawn         Res.Fire  : . . .

While I did win in the old version, either the game has got harder or I've forgotten too much, probably both. I already considered it a hard game. Finding new stuff makes it fun again. Don't expect to be dazzled with mad skills, I'm just doing a diary for the fun of it.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pedro.27s_diary.2C_day_1\">Pedro's diary, day 1</span></h2>\n<p>I feel like I'm writing my will. If anybody finds this, my half brother Willie can have my book of cantrips.\n</p><p>Why the Orb of Xot? Who knows? I have this urge to find it and bring it back to the surface. I've had this compulsion for as long as I can remember, although in recent years it's become harder to resist until one day I told my family that I just had to go for it. Mom sad but seemed to expect it, my stepfather managed to look annoyed and relieved at the same time. He's had a lot of practice looking annoyed around me, though, so I guess it wasn't that hard.\n</p><p>I've always been different from the others in my village. Let's just say I've always been a little morbid and leave it at that. Being different probably has something to do with my father, who I never met. Mom wouldn't talk about him, ever. Possibly this quest will lead me to some sort of self discovery crap, I don't know.\n</p><p>Skipping the boring trip to the entrance of the dungeon, and the night I spent resting up, I arrived with only my dagger, robe, spellbook, and a ration. I knew a whopping one spell, it's called Pain. It hurts when I do it, and sometimes it doesn't work. With such crummy equipment the first order of business is... get better stuff!\n</p><p>Lucky me, I found a sabre right away but I kept the dagger in my pack. I'd like to get a long blade but I don't expect to find one soon. I also found a ring mail but seeing how I plan to rely on spells a lot I stuck with my robe. I found some stairways going down but didn't investigate until I felt a little more experienced. Which happened pretty soon, actually. I killed some goblins, kobolds, and some sort of an ooze creature and I felt a good deal tougher. That ooze thing hit hard.\n</p><p>After exploring every corner of the first floor of the structure, I checked out each of the three staircases leading down. Just for a look. One I really didn't like. There were too many creatures in sight, including a poisonous snake. Interestingly, I got hungry once and ate a chunk of snake. Not only not poisonous, it didn't make me sick like goblin or orc chunks sometimes do. <b>Never eat kobold unless you don't mind being poisoned.</b>\n</p><p>So, anyway, I took one of the other stairways. My method of exploration is to just go at random, picking up all the scrolls and potions and other items I think might be useful. If I see a monster, I stop and think for a sec. Usually I cast pain on it if it hasn't noticed me. Sometimes if I find a monster, say, around a corner, and it's sleeping, I'll try stabbing it. If it's in the open and I'd have to walk up on it, no. I'm afraid that I'll be sneaking up on what looks like a lone monster but is really part of a group. If one wakes up, there's a good chance it'll yell and alert the others. So I hit whatever it is with Pain. If it was a toughy I'd cast Pain some more, but if it's not so bad I'd let it get close and stick it a couple times with the sabre. It worked.\n</p><p>A funny thing happened after I killed a trio of gnollish warriors using my method (being careful to only alert one at a time and heavy on the Pain because gnolls are mean bastards). I grew scales! My skin totally got harder, I can't explain it. I don't feel quite as flexible as I used to be, though. Shortly after that I found a shield. Unlike the ring mail, it doesn't seem to make casting spells any more difficult, so I'm using it.\n</p><p>I also almost died. I came around a corner and this steam dragon was, like, right <i>there.</i> I didn't want to run as I figured I'd get fried by its breath. I hit it with Pain several times but it kept resisting. I tried a wand to cast slowing on it but it only had a charge or two left. Chomp chomp and the steam dragon was all like LOL NOOB but I got in a couple more Pains and they did enough damage that it started to run away. I actually killed it by throwing my dagger, lucky shot.\n</p><p>I also ran into a ghost. I managed to kill a phantom without much trouble but when I saw this ghost I knew I had to run. Too bad for me, the best way to run was right past the ghost, to a staircase. So I did. It was the ghost of a hunter minotaur, and while it didn't puncture me with arrows, it did hit me once and half killed me. Even though it was right next to me it didn't follow me down the stairs.\n</p><p>By then I was five flights underground. I got into a scrap with a hobgoblin and while I was killing it a kobold closed with me. I killed the hob with Pain and a little voice in my head went, \"ding! You are now a level 6 Necromancer\". Then the kobold hit me with a glowing sword and I felt drained. I was like, Thanks a lot, jerk, I think I'll take that sword.\n</p><p>Right around there I ran into some guy named Edmund. I used Pain and drain on him-- drain as in the sword. I memorized Vampiric Draining but haven't used it yet. I could've learned Animate Skeleton but that sounded too wimpy. Could've learned Regeneration, too, but I thought I'd wait and see what other spellbooks turned up before branching off from good old necromancy. Hey, it got me this far.\n</p><p>Edmund must've been guarding the entrance to the Ecumenical Temple. I found this neat altar made of skulls in there. If only people in my village worshiped cool gods like Kikubaaqudgha I would've liked it a lot better there. As it is, I'm starting to like it down here. In just one day I feel smarter than before and a lot tougher.. Think I'll set up camp for the night. Oh, I almost forgot to mention, I found a weapon shop belonging to somebody named Sithrubaaj but they only had weapons I'm not interested in-- no swords at all.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pedro.27s_diary.2C_day_2\">Pedro's diary, day 2</span></h2>\n<p>Well, I'm still here, diary, although there were some close calls.\n</p><p>I still must have been half-asleep when I left the temple, because I forgot to identify my scrolls and potions like I meant to. The temple is nice and quiet, so it's a good place to leave items I don't want to carry or try things out. It's best to try items in a place without monsters. That way if I test a potion and it turns out to be paralysis, it wears off and I don't come to with a giant centipede burrowing into my leg. So, after I'd explored some more I realized what I'd done and headed by to my base.\n</p><p>I'd heard that one of the types of scroll in the dungeon is booby trapped and explodes, so I dropped all my papers and read the scrolls one at a time, away from my stuff. Sure enough, one blew up and burned me half to death. Now that that's out of the way I can be a little less cautious. I happened to have a nice stack of identify scrolls so I checked all the jewelry I'd found and identified some potions, too. One was the one I'd been looking for, it cures mutation, and after that I just identify them by plugging my nose and saying bottoms up. I put the cure potion in my stash of items in the temple-- if I carry it around I could end up losing it. Same thing with most of my scrolls. I just carry the ones I think I might need, like teleportation and blink, if I have them. I didn't find any remove curse scrolls, I don't think. More about that later.\n</p><p>Things started to get hairy pretty quick as I started going deeper into the dungeon. In the shallow parts, about the toughest thing you'd see is an ogre. It wasn't too far past the temple that I started to see hill giants and slime creatures. And centaurs. Man, I hate centaurs. I don't have much of a defense against their arrows except trying to dodge and hide behind my shield at the same time. I've heard that jellies can be a real problem as they ruin your equipment but Pain seems to deal with them just fine.\n</p><p>Another weird thing happened after I killed an orc wizard. Suddenly I felt hot and ever since then I haven't been as sensitive to cold.\n</p><p>I finally found a proper sword, diary! Well, first I took a falchion off a dead orc priest. It was cursed, but at least I could still cut up critters to eat. Not only that but then I read a scroll to find out what it was and accidentally cursed my shield and couldn't take it off. I looked all over but couldn't find any remove curse scrolls. Then I found a shop and bought a nice, shiny long sword. I got so sick of using that crappy falchion that I used an enchant weapon scroll to remove the curse.\n</p><p>But the best thing is that I've made heaps of friends here. I finally got good enough at magic to learn my Animate Dead spell, so I've started reviving creatures. When they were alive they were hostile, but once I kill them and bring them back they're nice as can be. They follow me around and try to stay close to me. Mostly they can't because they're slow due to the whole not being alive thing but as I am a good servant, my god (who is the coolest) has granted me the power to summon my buddies no matter if they're out of sight or whatever. Yaks in particular seem to make great pets. Plus with all the hair it's harder to tell that they're not really alive.\n</p><p>Mostly I've been using the same old tactics to deal with the locals. Cast Pain to get attention and maybe a couple more times for good measure as they advance on me, then hit them with the old pig sticker. However, what with the hostiles getting tougher, Pain isn't quite as good as it used to be. Still good for giving a giant frog a hotfoot or zotzing a fleeing killer bee, but that's about it. I'm relying a lot more on Vampiric Draining now. Once the mark has thumped me once or twice I give them a case or three of VD. I get well and they get worse. In extreme cases, like those centaurs I was talking about or a cyclops, I've started using regeneration, too. And usually I'll have some friends around to help out. Too many is a crowd, though, and start to get hard to keep track of. I mostly just raise the sturdiest corpses I come across, and if they're quick, like yaks, so much the better. Quality over quantity. I tried raising a bunch of orcs but they didn't last long.\n</p><p>Hm, what else happened today? Well, I found the entrance to the Orcish Mines but didn't go in as I'd heard the Lair was a good place to explore. It turns out the lair entrance was much deeper than the mines, but I found it. I've set up another camp here. Oh, and I identified that long sword. Looks like I'll be heading back to the mines sooner than I thought. I found a really nice cloak, too.\n</p><p>Sometimes I'll talk to my not alive friends-- usually just stuff like \"get him!\" but sometimes I'll kid around a little. Like Steve, this ex-ogre I hung around with for a while. Just joking, I said \"where do I take a dump around here?\" and to my surprise he tried to talk. Sound like he was trying to say \"shift three\". Shift three whats? Good old Steve, too bad that manticore ripped his guts out.\n</p>\n<pre>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup version 0.3.4 (crawl-ref) character file.\nPedro the Reanimator                                                                                \nRace      &#160;: Demonspawn         Res.Fire &#160;: . . .

Notes ==\nI've picked up Crawl again after not playing much at all since before Stone Soup came along. While I did win in the old version, either the game has got harder or I've forgotten too much, probably both. I already considered it a hard game. Finding new stuff makes it fun again. Don't expect to be dazzled with mad skills, I'm just doing a diary for the fun of it.\n== Pedro's diary, day 1 ==\nI feel like I'm writing my will. If anybody finds this, my half brother Willie can have my book of cantrips.\n\nWhy the Orb of Xot? Who knows? I have this urge to find it and bring it back to the surface. I've had this compulsion for as long as I can remember, although in recent years it's become harder to resist until one day I told my family that I just had to go for it. Mom sad but seemed to expect it, my stepfather managed to look annoyed and relieved at the same time. He's had a lot of practice looking annoyed around me, though, so I guess it wasn't that hard.\n\nI've always been different from the others in my village. Let's just say I've always been a little morbid and leave it at that. Being different probably has something to do with my father, who I never met. Mom wouldn't talk about him, ever. Possibly this quest will lead me to some sort of self discovery crap, I don't know.\n\nSkipping the boring trip to the entrance of the dungeon, and the night I spent resting up, I arrived with only my dagger, robe, spellbook, and a ration. I knew a whopping one spell, it's called Pain. It hurts when I do it, and sometimes it doesn't work. With such crummy equipment the first order of business is... get better stuff!\n\nLucky me, I found a sabre right away but I kept the dagger in my pack. I'd like to get a long blade but I don't expect to find one soon. I also found a ring mail but seeing how I plan to rely on spells a lot I stuck with my robe. I found some stairways going down but didn't investigate until I felt a little more experienced. Which happened pretty soon, actually. I killed some goblins, kobolds, and some sort of an ooze creature and I felt a good deal tougher. That ooze thing hit hard.\n\nAfter exploring every corner of the first floor of the structure, I checked out each of the three staircases leading down. Just for a look. One I really didn't like. There were too many creatures in sight, including a poisonous snake. Interestingly, I got hungry once and ate a chunk of snake. Not only not poisonous, it didn't make me sick like goblin or orc chunks sometimes do. '''Never eat kobold unless you don't mind being poisoned.'''\n\nSo, anyway, I took one of the other stairways. My method of exploration is to just go at random, picking up all the scrolls and potions and other items I think might be useful. If I see a monster, I stop and think for a sec. Usually I cast pain on it if it hasn't noticed me. Sometimes if I find a monster, say, around a corner, and it's sleeping, I'll try stabbing it. If it's in the open and I'd have to walk up on it, no. I'm afraid that I'll be sneaking up on what looks like a lone monster but is really part of a group. If one wakes up, there's a good chance it'll yell and alert the others. So I hit whatever it is with Pain. If it was a toughy I'd cast Pain some more, but if it's not so bad I'd let it get close and stick it a couple times with the sabre. It worked.\n\nA funny thing happened after I killed a trio of gnollish warriors using my method (being careful to only alert one at a time and heavy on the Pain because gnolls are mean bastards). I grew scales! My skin totally got harder, I can't explain it. I don't feel quite as flexible as I used to be, though. Shortly after that I found a shield. Unlike the ring mail, it doesn't seem to make casting spells any more difficult, so I'm using it.\n\nI also almost died. I came around a corner and this steam dragon was, like, right ''there.'' I didn't want to run as I figured I'd get fried by its breath. I hit it with Pain several times but it kept resisting. I tried a wand to cast slowing on it but it only had a charge or two left. Chomp chomp and the steam dragon was all like LOL NOOB but I got in a couple more Pains and they did enough damage that it started to run away. I actually killed it by throwing my dagger, lucky shot.\n\nI also ran into a ghost. I managed to kill a phantom without much trouble but when I saw this ghost I knew I had to run. Too bad for me, the best way to run was right past the ghost, to a staircase. So I did. It was the ghost of a hunter minotaur, and while it didn't puncture me with arrows, it did hit me once and half killed me. Even though it was right next to me it didn't follow me down the stairs.\n\nBy then I was five flights underground. I got into a scrap with a hobgoblin and while I was killing it a kobold closed with me. I killed the hob with Pain and a little voice in my head went, \"ding! You are now a level 6 Necromancer\". Then the kobold hit me with a glowing sword and I felt drained. I was like, Thanks a lot, jerk, I think I'll take that sword.\n\nRight around there I ran into some guy named Edmund. I used Pain and drain on him-- drain as in the sword. I memorized Vampiric Draining but haven't used it yet. I could've learned Animate Skeleton but that sounded too wimpy. Could've learned Regeneration, too, but I thought I'd wait and see what other spellbooks turned up before branching off from good old necromancy. Hey, it got me this far.\n\nEdmund must've been guarding the entrance to the Ecumenical Temple. I found this neat altar made of skulls in there. If only people in my village worshiped cool gods like Kikubaaqudgha I would've liked it a lot better there. As it is, I'm starting to like it down here. In just one day I feel smarter than before and a lot tougher.. Think I'll set up camp for the night. Oh, I almost forgot to mention, I found a weapon shop belonging to somebody named Sithrubaaj but they only had weapons I'm not interested in-- no swords at all.\n\n== Pedro's diary, day 2 ==\n\nWell, I'm still here, diary, although there were some close calls.\n\nI still must have been half-asleep when I left the temple, because I forgot to identify my scrolls and potions like I meant to. The temple is nice and quiet, so it's a good place to leave items I don't want to carry or try things out. It's best to try items in a place without monsters. That way if I test a potion and it turns out to be paralysis, it wears off and I don't come to with a giant centipede burrowing into my leg. So, after I'd explored some more I realized what I'd done and headed by to my base.\n\nI'd heard that one of the types of scroll in the dungeon is booby trapped and explodes, so I dropped all my papers and read the scrolls one at a time, away from my stuff. Sure enough, one blew up and burned me half to death. Now that that's out of the way I can be a little less cautious. I happened to have a nice stack of identify scrolls so I checked all the jewelry I'd found and identified some potions, too. One was the one I'd been looking for, it cures mutation, and after that I just identify them by plugging my nose and saying bottoms up. I put the cure potion in my stash of items in the temple-- if I carry it around I could end up losing it. Same thing with most of my scrolls. I just carry the ones I think I might need, like teleportation and blink, if I have them. I didn't find any remove curse scrolls, I don't think. More about that later.\n\nThings started to get hairy pretty quick as I started going deeper into the dungeon. In the shallow parts, about the toughest thing you'd see is an ogre. It wasn't too far past the temple that I started to see hill giants and slime creatures. And centaurs. Man, I hate centaurs. I don't have much of a defense against their arrows except trying to dodge and hide behind my shield at the same time. I've heard that jellies can be a real problem as they ruin your equipment but Pain seems to deal with them just fine.\n\nAnother weird thing happened after I killed an orc wizard. Suddenly I felt hot and ever since then I haven't been as sensitive to cold.\n\nI finally found a proper sword, diary! Well, first I took a falchion off a dead orc priest. It was cursed, but at least I could still cut up critters to eat. Not only that but then I read a scroll to find out what it was and accidentally cursed my shield and couldn't take it off. I looked all over but couldn't find any remove curse scrolls. Then I found a shop and bought a nice, shiny long sword. I got so sick of using that crappy falchion that I used an enchant weapon scroll to remove the curse.\n\nBut the best thing is that I've made heaps of friends here. I finally got good enough at magic to learn my Animate Dead spell, so I've started reviving creatures. When they were alive they were hostile, but once I kill them and bring them back they're nice as can be. They follow me around and try to stay close to me. Mostly they can't because they're slow due to the whole not being alive thing but as I am a good servant, my god (who is the coolest) has granted me the power to summon my buddies no matter if they're out of sight or whatever. Yaks in particular seem to make great pets. Plus with all the hair it's harder to tell that they're not really alive.\n\nMostly I've been using the same old tactics to deal with the locals. Cast Pain to get attention and maybe a couple more times for good measure as they advance on me, then hit them with the old pig sticker. However, what with the hostiles getting tougher, Pain isn't quite as good as it used to be. Still good for giving a giant frog a hotfoot or zotzing a fleeing killer bee, but that's about it. I'm relying a lot more on Vampiric Draining now. Once the mark has thumped me once or twice I give them a case or three of VD. I get well and they get worse. In extreme cases, like those centaurs I was talking about or a cyclops, I've started using regeneration, too. And usually I'll have some friends around to help out. Too many is a crowd, though, and start to get hard to keep track of. I mostly just raise the sturdiest corpses I come across, and if they're quick, like yaks, so much the better. Quality over quantity. I tried raising a bunch of orcs but they didn't last long.\n\nHm, what else happened today? Well, I found the entrance to the Orcish Mines but didn't go in as I'd heard the Lair was a good place to explore. It turns out the lair entrance was much deeper than the mines, but I found it. I've set up another camp here. Oh, and I identified that long sword. Looks like I'll be heading back to the mines sooner than I thought. I found a really nice cloak, too.\n\nSometimes I'll talk to my not alive friends-- usually just stuff like \"get him!\" but sometimes I'll kid around a little. Like Steve, this ex-ogre I hung around with for a while. Just joking, I said \"where do I take a dump around here?\" and to my surprise he tried to talk. Sound like he was trying to say \"shift three\". Shift three whats? Good old Steve, too bad that manticore ripped his guts out.\n\n Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup version 0.3.4 (crawl-ref) character file.\n Pedro the Reanimator                                                                                \n Race       : Demonspawn         Res.Fire  : . . .

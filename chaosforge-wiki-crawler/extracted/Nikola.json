{"title":"Nikola","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Nikola","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Nikola the Mad Inventor''' is a [[unique]] [[Air Magic]] specialist who can be a serious threat to the unprepared. Controlling [[electricity]] is second nature to him, and he always generates with a [[rapier]] of [[electrocution]] (1% chance for the [[Arc Blade]]) as well as a [[cloak]] and pair of [[gloves]].\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Depths]]:1-3\n*[[Elven Halls]]\n*[[The Swamp]]\n*[[Snake Pit]]\n*[[The Shoals]]\n*[[Spider's Nest]]\n*[[The Vaults]]:1-3\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Chain Lightning deals massive damage, enough to one-shot frailer characters. Needless to say, electricity resistance will save your skin now more than ever. Remember that a [[potion of resistance]] can give rElec in a pinch; just make sure you can kill Nikola before it wears off. \n**Even with rElec, he can deal lots of damage per turn. Electric damage ignores 1/2 of your [[AC]], and against Chain Lightning, rElec is only half as effective (net x66% damage).\n**Note that Chain Lightning can only deal max damage if you are in point-blank range. If you are 2-4 tiles away, it deals (at most) x66% damage, and if you are 5-7 tiles away, it's reduced to x44%. You can use ranged attacks and [[curare]] darts to avoid getting into melee range.\n*[[Silence]] or [[phial of floods|waterlogging]] will disable his spells, reducing the threat level significantly.  Of course, silencing also shuts down your spellcasting ability, so this tactic is best used by melee-focused characters. Any character with moderate Evocations can use a [[phial of floods]], however.\n*Surprisingly, he lacks electricity resistance himself. If you have powerful electric attacks, don't be afraid to use them.\n*Nikola has no qualms about frying other monsters. Taking cover behind them isn't safe. Taking him as a servant of [[Yredelemnul]] is also ill-advised.\n\n==Trivia==\nNikola was named in honor of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla Nikola Tesla], an inventor famous for his eccentricity and his work with electricity.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Nikola used an older version of [[Chain Lightning]]; bouncing between targets rather than being strong up close and travelling outwards. This version of Chain Lightning could deal up to '''264''' damage, if it bounced between you and him multiple times.\n*Nikola got access to the Arc Blade in [[0.14]].\n[[Category:Human]]"}

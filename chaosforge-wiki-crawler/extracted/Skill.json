Starting skill levels depend on character [[species]] and [[background]]. As characters earn [[experience]], the XP is spread across different skills, according to the distribution specified on the Skill Screen ('''m'''). Species [[aptitudes]] will make certain skills easier or harder to train. Skill levels are capped at [[27]].\n\nEvery species is rated from -5 to +11 in each skill, with higher scores yielding faster skill progress. Training skills with poor aptitudes is possible, but notably slower.\n\n==Skill Types==\nSkills can be divided into three categories:\n\n===Offense===\n*'''[[Fighting]]:''' Improves melee damage, melee accuracy, and max [[HP]].\n*'''Weapon skills:''' Improve damage, accuracy, and attack speed with a weapon group. Training a weapon skill also gives a bonus to any skills that [[cross-train]] with it.\n**'''Strength-based:''' Damage scales with [[strength]]:\n***'''[[Maces & Flails]]:''' Maces, flails, and whips. The most straightforward weapons. ''(Cross-trains with [[Axes]] and [[Staves]])''\n***'''[[Axes]]:''' Axes. These weapons are able to [[cleave]]. ''(Cross-trains with [[Maces & Flails]] and [[Polearms]])''\n***'''[[Polearms]]:''' Spears, tridents, etc. These weapons are able to [[reach]]. ''(Cross-trains with [[Axes]] and [[Staves]])''\n***'''[[Staves]]:''' Quarterstaves, lajatangs, and magical staves. ''(Cross-trains with [[Maces & Flails]] and [[Polearms]])''\n***'''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' Fighting without a wielded weapon. Most [[auxiliary attacks]] are ''not'' improved.\n***'''[[Throwing]]:'''  [[Stone]]s, [[dart]]s, [[boomerang]]s, [[javelin]]s and [[large rock]]s. Also increases the success chance of [[atropa]] and [[datura]] darts.\n**'''Dexterity-based:''' Damage scales with [[dexterity]]:\n***'''[[Short Blades]]:''' Daggers, short swords, rapiers etc. ''(Cross-trains with [[Long Blades]])''\n***'''[[Long Blades]]:''' Swords. ''(Cross-trains with [[Short Blades]])''\n***'''[[Ranged Weapons]]''': Bows, crossbows, and slings.\n\n===Defense===\n*'''[[Armour (skill)|Armour]]:''' Improves the [[AC]] bonus from wearing armour (more effective with heavier armour). Somewhat reduces the impact of armour [[encumbrance]] penalties.\n*'''[[Dodging]]:''' Improves [[EV]]. More effective with lighter [[armour]] and higher [[dexterity]].\n*'''[[Shields (skill)|Shields]]:''' Improves the [[SH]] bonus from wearing a [[shield]]. Reduces and eliminates the impact of shield [[EV]] and [[spell success]] penalties.\n*'''[[Stealth]]:''' Reduces the likelihood of unaware monsters detecting you, increases the chance of out-of-sight monsters losing track of you, and improves [[stab]]bing damage. More effective with lighter [[armour]] and higher [[dexterity]].\n\n===Magic===\n*'''[[Spellcasting]]:''' Slightly increases the [[spell power]] and [[spell success|success rate]] of any spell you cast, increases your max [[MP]], and grants you extra spell levels to memorize more spells.\n\n*'''[[Spell school]] skills:''' Improve [[spell power]] and [[spell success|success rate]] for all spells of that school. Many spells rely on more than one skill.\n**'''[[Conjurations]]:''' Direct attack magic.\n**'''[[Hexes]]:''' Magic used to weaken enemies.\n**'''[[Summonings]]:''' Spells that temporarily create allies.\n**'''[[Necromancy]]:''' Spells involving manipulation of life, [[negative energy]], and the [[undead]].\n**'''[[Translocations]]:''' Move yourself, enemies, or objects.\n**'''[[Alchemy]]:''' Spells about transmuting matter and inflicting [[poison]].\n**'''[[Fire Magic]]:''' Spells that involve [[fire]].\n**'''[[Air Magic]]:''' Spells that focus on wind, [[cloud]]s, and [[electricity]].\n**'''[[Ice Magic]]:''' Spells that involve [[cold]] and ice.\n**'''[[Earth Magic]]:''' Spells that involve physical damage and manipulation of the earth.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n*'''[[Invocations]]:''' Improves the effectiveness of powers granted by your [[god]], increases your max [[MP]]. Some gods do not require training of this skill.\n*'''[[Evocations]]:''' Improves the effectiveness of using [[wand]]s and [[evocable]]s.\n*'''[[Shapeshifting]]:''' Improves the effectiveness of, and reduces and eventually removes the max [[HP]] penalty from, the use of [[talisman]]s.\n\nThe MP bonus from skills is the higher of your [[Spellcasting]] skill or half of your [[Invocations]] skill.\n\n==The Skill Screen==\nPressing '''m''' will bring up the skill screen, which displays current skill levels and your species' skill [[aptitude]]s. It also allows you to change which skills you'll train and how much.\n\nSkill XP is split between trained skills; the more XP you invest into one skill, the less XP you'll have in the others. You can select which skills to train by either clicking on its name, or pressing the key associated to it. The exact split will depend on the training mode. There are two mode: automatic and manual. You can swap between modes with the '''/''' key.\n\nIn automatic mode, skills that are used more in game will gain a greater share of the XP. Selecting the skill will cycle through three modes:\n*Normal (grey name; + next to the skill): Regular training.\n*Focused (white name; * next to the skill): Selected skill will gain more XP, even if never used.\n*Deselected (dark grey name; - next to the skill): Skill will gain no XP, even if used constantly.\n\nIn manual mode, you select which skills to train directly. XP is split between all selected skills evenly, unless a skill is focused.\n*Normal: Regular training.\n*Focused: Skill will gain twice the share of XP.\n*Deselected: Skill gains no XP.\n\nIn addition, you can set skill targets by pressing '''=''' in the skill menu, then the letter of the skill you want to set a target for, then entering the value to set a target at. Once that skill reaches the skill target, it is deselected. This lets you precisely control how much XP gets put into each skill.\n\nPressing '''!''' will switch between 3 views: training, where you can see how much of your experience is going towards each skill; cost, which compares the experience requirement of raising that skill by 1 level with a level 0 skill at 0 aptitude; and targets, which shows your current skill targets.\n\nNote that you can train all the skills from the very beginning of the game. So be careful not to train skills that don't give an immediate benefit for your character. By default, only skills that are usable are displayed; press '''*''' to access the list of all skills.\n\n==Strategy==\nSkill management is central to strategic play. Allocating your XP to align with your [[aptitudes]], available [[item|equipment]], and playstyle will make or break your character.\n\nManual training is better than automatic. Automatic training will spread XP between many different skills, even if they wouldn't be helpful. For example, it could make your noisy melee brute train [[Stealth]] just because an enemy didn't notice you once. This doesn't mean you have to manage every single facet of skill training though: you could \"manually\" set 4 skills to be trained equally for the entire game, and mostly be fine. \n\n===Skill Micromanagement===\nTechnically, it is best to train only 1 skill at any given time, switching constantly as appropriate (e.g. getting Fighting 0 -> 2 while training nothing else, then Armour 0 -> 2 training nothing else, then Fighting 2 -> 3...). This is because each skill has at least one breakpoint:\n*Weapon Skills: Weapons have a [[minimum delay]] - past minimum delay, training the skill is less effective, as it no longer increases your attack speed. In addition, reaching 1.0 attack delay (after [[shield]], if applicable) can be considered a breakpoint, as it prevents 100% speed enemies from double-striking you.\n*Spell Schools: The skill level where a spell becomes \"comfortable\" to cast is the single most important level for casters. For example, if a 10% failure rate is comfortable to you, then getting [[Fireball]] to a 10% failure rate will add an entire new spell to your repertoire. This comfort point will depend on player and character.\n*Fighting, Spellcasting, Invocations: You can't have fractional HP, MP or spell levels. For example, you gain 1 MP for each 1.0 Spellcasting or each 2.0 Invocations (whichever gives more MP). \n*Shapeshifting: Talismans have a defined minimum and maximum skill. Below the minimum skill you have reduced HP in that form, and no further benefits are gained above maximum skill. \n*All skills: For every ''whole'' level of a skill, the cost of that skill rises, e.g Stealth 2 -> 3 is cheaper than Stealth 3 -> 4. So getting Stealth 2 -> 3 might be more cost-effective than Fighting 0 -> 1, but that same Fighting training might be more cost-effective than Stealth 3 -> 4.\n\nThat being said, managing your skills like this has a relatively minor effect on gameplay. It is more productive to learn combat tactics and when to use consumables. Even if you do care, by the time you reach the late-game, precise skill training basically doesn't matter.\n\n===Example===\nSay you want the following skills:\n*Fighting 3 (for +6 HP)\n*Conjurations 3 (to cast Searing Ray)\n*Dodging 3 (for +1 EV).\n\nNote that these values are not accurate to the game. Dodging 3 won't always give you +1 EV, for instance, and Conjurations 3 usually isn't enough to cast Searing Ray.\n\nFor sake of example, assume each floor gives 3 levels of a skill, that levels of skill don't increase in cost, and that you have even aptitudes in each skill.\n\nIf you trained each skill independently, you'd have the following skills:\n Floor #1 end - Fighting 1 (+2 HP), Conjurations 1, Dodging 1\n Floor #2 end - Fighting 2 (+4 HP), Conjurations 2, Dodging 2\n Floor #3 end - Fighting 3 (+6 HP), Conjurations 3 (Searing Ray castable), Dodging 3 (+1 EV)\n\nIf you trained each skill one-at-a-time:\n Floor #1 end - Conjurations 3 (Searing Ray castable)\n Floor #2 end - Conjurations 3 (Searing Ray castable), Dodging 3 (+1 EV)\n Floor #3 end - Fighting 3 (+6 HP), Conjurations 3 (Searing Ray castable), Dodging 3 (+1 EV)\n\nThe end result is the same. But by training skills one-at-a-time, you get the benefit of having Searing Ray castable 2 floors earlier, and the benefit of having +1 EV a single floor earlier.\n\n==Experience Required==\nThe table below shows how many total [[skill point]]s must be allocated to a skill for it to reach each skill level, from 0. The percentage column shows the amount of experience required to reach a given skill level from 0 as a percentage of the amount of experience required to reach level 27.<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|skills.cc|2312}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

An aptitude of '''n''' means you'll need 2^(-n/4) times as much XP to advance as a character with an aptitude of zero for that skill would.  The resulting multipliers are in the chart below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Aptitude\n|| +11 || +10 || +9 || +8 || +7 || +6 || +5 || +4 || +3 || +2 || +1 || +0 || -1 || -2 || -3 || -4 || -5\n|-\n!

Also, cross-training would increase the aptitude of the cross-trained skills, rather than increasing skill XP directly.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], certain skills cost more or less XP than others. [[Spellcasting]] cost 130% XP; [[Invocations]], [[Evocations]], and [[Stealth]] all cost 80% XP. In 0.12, all species' aptitudes were modified to compensate for this change.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], decimal levels of a skill did not matter. Your equipment's impact on skill was not standardized between levels 0-27. Also, [[Stealth]] had a cost multiplier of 50%.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], the skill system was radically different. Previously, there was no automatic or manual mode. Instead, whenever you earned [[XP]], it would be saved in a pool. Using a skill would divert XP to the skill. If you wanted XP to go into a specific skill, you'd have to repeat useless actions (e.g. casting [[Shock]] at nothing to train [[Air Magic]]) - this was called [[victory dancing]].\n\n'''Added Skills'''\n*[[0.31]] - [[Shapeshifting]], [[Alchemy]]\n*[[0.29]] - [[Ranged Weapons]]\n*[[0.12]] - [[Traps (skill)|Traps]]\n\n'''Removed Skills'''\n*[[0.31]] - [[Transmutations]], [[Poison Magic]] (changed to Shapeshifting and Alchemy)\n*[[0.29]] - [[Bows (skill)|Bows]], [[Crossbows (skill)|Crossbows]], and [[Slings (skill)|Slings]] (merged into Ranged Weapons)\n*[[0.26]] - [[Charms]]\n*[[0.13]] - [[Stabbing]], [[Traps (skill)|Traps]]\n*[[0.12]] - [[Traps & Doors]] (renamed to Traps)\n*[[0.6]] - [[Divinations]]\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Skill titles]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Skills}}"}

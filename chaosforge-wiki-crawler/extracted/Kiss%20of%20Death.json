{"title":"Kiss of Death","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Kiss_of_Death","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n{{AttackSpell\n|name=Kiss of Death\n|formula = 2d(5.5 + 3*Power/10)\n|maxdmg = 2d13 negative\n|maxsp = 25\n|range = 1\n|target = Random\n|tohit = Never misses\n}}\n'''Kiss of Death''' is a level 1 [[Conjurations]]/[[Necromancy]] spell that deals heavy damage (for a level 1 spell) at the cost of HP [[drain]]. This spell can never miss, but it does checks [[AC]]. If the spell succeeds, then you are drained for roughly 13.3% maximum HP - equal to that of [[Ru]]'s Apocalypse. At XL 1-2, this equates to 1-2 max HP.\n\n[[Reaver]]s start with this spell in their libraries. It can also be gifted by [[Kikubaaqudgha]].\n\n==Strategy==\nKiss of Death is vital to Reaver starts. It can be your only option to fight dangerous monsters like [[gnoll (monster)|gnolls]] on D:1 or [[adder]]s on D:2. If the choice is to die fighting or at least try casting this spell, the choice is obvious. Keep in mind that, while it can't miss, this spell can miscast or lowroll 2d1. So like with all consumables in ''Crawl'', it's best to use it early. For Reavers, it can be worthwhile to train 1-2 points of Necromancy to lower spell failure.\n\nIf you find Kiss of Death past D:1-3 or so, it is of limited use, since the spell deals little damage for the amount of draining it causes. One of the few benefits is that it never misses, so it can technically be used to finish off monsters who'd otherwise have a chance to kill you. In terms of damage, this spell is ultimately weaker than [[Stone Arrow]].\n\n==History==\n*This spell was added in [[0.30]]."}

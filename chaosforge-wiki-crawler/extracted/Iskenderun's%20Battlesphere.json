With increasing power, the battlesphere lasts longer and deals more damage per volley.}}\n\n'''Iskenderun's Battlesphere''' is a level 5 [[Conjurations]] spell which conjures a friendly [[battlesphere]] to support your magical attacks. \n\n==Useful Info==\nEach time you cast a [[destructive spell]], the battlesphere will shoot a perfectly accurate, irresistible beam. It is aimed at a random target within its line of fire. The battlesphere cannot fire through you. However, you can fire through the battlesphere.\n\n{{crawlquote|\nDamage formula: 2d(6 + Power/11)<br>\nNumber of charges: 4 + (1d(Power + 10)-1)/10<br>\nMax. spellpower: 100\n}}\n\nBattlespheres have a limited amount of charges. It will dissipate when: it runs out of charges, you enter a different floor, if destroyed by enemy attacks, or if it times out.\n\nYou may only create one battlesphere at a time. Casting it while one already exists will recall it to your location and increase both its duration and number of charges (max 20). Battlespheres are not considered [[summon]]s, and are not blocked by [[Okawaru]] or [[Ru]]'s Sacrifice Love.\n\n\"Destructive spells\" are spells that [[Vehumet]] supports. For a full list of eligible spells, see [[destructive spell]]. The only destructive spells that battlespheres won't support are Iskenderun's Battlesphere (obviously) and [[Spellforged Servitor]]. You can also view the list of eligible spells by looking at this spell's description.\n\nThe [[unrand]] [[sphere of Battle]] will create a battlesphere every time monsters are in sight.\n\n==Strategy==\nIskenderun's Battlesphere deals reasonable damage which never misses and cannot be resisted. It works best with low-level (low MP) spells like [[Magic Dart]], [[Poisonous Vapours]], and [[Stone Arrow]], which let you \"cast\" Battlesphere beams at 1-3 MP. Fairly MP-efficient, and much quieter than the likes of [[Fireball]] or [[Plasma Beam]].\n\nIt is best to summon a battlesphere before enemies are in sight. E.g. if you see a [[sleep]]ing monster, back away, create a battlesphere, then go in. When fighting a monster, you may want to (not always) turn a corner, create a battlesphere, and wait. This way, you are more turn efficient. Technically, it is optimal to constantly keep the battlesphere up during exploration.\n\nYou can fire through the battlesphere, however, monsters can't. With good pathing and a bit of luck, you can put the sphere between yourself and a nasty hexer / banisher / malmutator. Keep in mind that the battlesphere has the [[maintain range]] flag, so it will try to move away from monsters.\n\n==Monster Version==\nBattlespheres created by monsters function identically to your own.\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], battlespheres would only trigger with [[Conjurations]] spells.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Iskenderun's Battlesphere was a [[Conjurations]] / [[Charms]] spell. It was aimed at the target you fired, rather than a random target. It didn't work with non-targetable Conjurations (like [[Static Discharge]]). However, it would trigger with certain non-Conjurations spells.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], this spell could be found in the [[book of Conjurations]] instead of the [[book of Power]].\n*In [[0.18]], The battlesphere supports mephitic cloud, and probably more spells also.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], this was a level 4 spell.\n*Iskenderun's Battlesphere was added in [[0.12]]."}

It was released on Oct. 11th, 2013. \n\n  \nStone Soup 0.13 (20131011) \n\n- - -\n\n0.13 highlights \n\n- - -\n\n* A new race: [Gargoyles][2].\n* A reimagined [Skald][3] background.\n* A thorough rework of the monster set in [Crypt][4].\n* Improvements to many evokable items.\n* A new item: [sack of spiders][5].\n* Massively overhauled layout generators.\n* [Summonings][6] school: per-spell limits and no stair following or pulling.\n* New [Sprint][7] map: linesprint.\nBranches, environment \n\n- - -\n\n* A new Sprint map: \"|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\" by st (otherwise known as linesprint).\n* [Branches][8] now have exactly one exit stair (except [the Dungeon][9], which can, but is not guaranteed, to have more).\n* Many new layouts have been added to most branches, including unique layouts for branches that didn't have them; and numerous tweaks and improvements to existing layouts.\n* [Vaults][10] can now be placed at the centre of some layouts prepared to accept them there.\n* All [portal][11] vaults entrances that time out are now announced.\n* [Temple][12] overflow [altars][13] can now contain multiple altars.\n* New [shop][14] type: gadget shops, which sell evokable items.\n* Mechanical [traps][15] do not spawn outside of vaults.\n* [Zot trap][16] effects are now only a subset of the full set of miscasts, and have some new unique effects - draining of [wand][17] charges and Word of Recall (as per [ironbrand convokers][18]).\nCharacter \n\n- - -\n\n* A new race: [Gargoyles][2], with low natural [HP][19] but an impressive host of resistances and the ability to [fly][20] at XL14.\n* [Sludge elves][21] are no more.\n* The [Skald][3] background gets a reworked [spell book][22] with four new spells: \n  * [Infusion][23] grants additional melee damage costing MP with each strike;\n  * [Song of Slaying][24] grants an incremental slaying bonus with every monster killed (of sufficient threat level);\n  * [Spectral Weapon][25] creates an allied spectral clone of your weapon which strikes enemies in melee when you do.\n  * [Song of Shielding][26] has a similar effect to [spirit shield][27], trading [HP][19] loss for [MP][28] loss.\n* [Priests][29] are no more.\n* The [nausea][30][status effect][31] from eating contaminated [chunks][32] has been removed; contaminated chunks now give less nutrition for characters that can't handle them.\n* [Stabbing][33] skill is no more; stabs now depend upon the average of the character's [stealth][34] and weapon skill.\n* The [Traps][35] skill is no more; all characters detect traps as though they had (XL/3) Traps skill.\n* [Chaos knights][36] start with a +0 [chaos][37] weapon instead of a +2 normal weapon.\n* New tier 2 [demonspawn mutation][38] - \"magic shield\", giving [spirit shield][27] at level one, improved magic regeneration at level two, and regenerating mana in place of health as a function of current magic level at level three.\n* Deaths to [acid][39], self-targetting, and [sticky flame][40] now credit the appropriate monster/spell.\n* [Draining a stat to zero][41] can no longer directly kill the player; instead, further stat drain damages the player. The effects of a stat being at zero (fainting, slow actions, etc.) persist.\n* [Ogre][42][hunters][43] and [artificers][44] now start with a [club][45] instead of a [short sword][46].\nMonsters \n\n- - -\n\n* New/reworked [Crypt][4] monsters: \n  * [Wraiths][47], [shadow wraiths][48], and [eidolons][49] drain speed instead of [XP][50].\n  * [Eidolons][49] deal more melee damage and can cast [Bolt of Draining][51].\n  * [Phantasmal warriors][52] can temporarily reduce their target's [magic resistance][53] and can [blink closer][54] to their foes.\n  * [Flayed ghosts][55] gain a [smite][56]-targeted flaying attack, dealing temporary damage that scales with XP and goes away when the flayed ghost is killed and/or enough time passes.\n  * [Ancient champions][57], formerly a vault-specific monster, are now full randomly-generated monsters, coming with a band of [skeletal warriors][58] 50% of the time.\n  * [Vampire mages][59] cast [Vampiric Draining][60] more often, and have slightly higher [HD][61] and HP; they also come with a band of [vampires][62].\n  * [Rotting hulks][63] are now [plague shamblers][64], capable of inflicting a \"[retching][65]\" [status effect][31] that prevents food consumption; they generate a [cloud][66] of [miasma][67] on death.\n  * [Spectral things][68] move at their full base monster speed.\n  * [Deep dwarf death knights][69] gain slightly better attack power and starting equipment, and now come with a band of [undead][70].\n  * [Flying skulls][71] get a slight HP boost and a larger attack power boost.\n  * [Ghouls][72] inflict [rot][73] half as often.\n  * [Curse skulls][74] are capable of out-of-LOS movement, similar to [wandering mushrooms][75], but preferring to place themselves where a player needs to move the most to actually reach them.\n  * New monster: [revenants][76], possessing a ghostly fireball attack and capable of creating clouds of ghostly flame, which do not harm undead and occasionally summon spectral things.\n  * New monster: [lost souls][77], who sacrifice themselves to heal nearby undead creatures or assume the shape of a nearby killed living creature; they can be summoned by [deep elf death mages][78].\n  * [Necromancers][79] don't come with [necrophages][80], but do come with [simulacra][81].\n  * [Unborn deep dwarves][82] are now just [unborn][83].\n  * New monster: [jiangshi][84], who move in short burts (like [sixfirhies][85]) and possess a [vampiric][86] melee attack.\n* New [forest][87]-themed monsters: \n  * [Spriggan assassins][88] and [spriggan enchanters][89], who attempt to disable the player with [blowguns][90] and [hexes][91] respectively before moving in for the kill.\n  * [Wind drakes][92], who can breathe powerful blasts of wind and [airstrike][93] the player.\n* Other new monsters: \n  * [Tengu reavers][94], skilled with both steel and spells; appearing in the late dungeon and in Vaults.\n  * [Deathcaps][95], summonable by [curse toes][96] - tougher [wandering mushrooms][75] with [Drain Life][97].\n* New unique: [Sojobo][98], king of the tengu.\n* [Jory][99] now spawns normally in the late dungeon, instead of being limited to vaults.\n* Adjustments to some tier 4 demons: \n  * [Orange demons][100]' sting has a 50% chance of inflicting a [Weakness][101] status, which reduces the player's attack damage.\n  * [Blue devils][102] have a swooping attack, where they can immediately move adjacent to the player and attack from up to four tiles away.\n  * [Red devils][103] can now hop backwards from adjacent foes to make use of their now-guaranteed polearms' reaching attacks.\n* Adjustments to the elementals: \n  * [Water elementals][104] have an asphyxiation attack which lasts as long as their target is next to them, and have slightly increased AC and HP.\n  * [Fire elementals][105] (and [fire vortices][106]) deal pure fire damage.\n* Updated spell set for several monsters: \n  * [Draconian shifters][107]:\n  * [Banishment][108] is dropped.\n  * A new monster spell: [Dimension Anchor][109], which temporarily prevents teleportation, blinking, and [Phase Shift][110].\n  * A new monster spell: [Blink Allies Encircling][111], which blinks nearby allies around the target.\n  * [Controlled Blink][112] is replaced with [Blink Away][113] as an emergency spell.\n  * [Spriggan air mages][114]:\n  * Drop [Swiftness][115].\n  * New spell: [Control Winds][116], which manipulates [clouds][66] (including putting out fores fires immediately), and improves allied ranged weapon accuracy.\n  * [Spriggan druids][117]:\n  * Drop [Summon Caniforms][118].\n  * New spells: [Haste Plants][119], which [hastes][120] nearby plant-like enemies, and [Druid's Call][121], which calls wildlife from elsewhere on the level to aid the druid.\n  * [The Enchantress][122]:\n  * [Banishment][108] is banished.\n  * Gains [Dimension Anchor][109] (see draconian shifter entry above), [Strip Resistance][123] (lowers the magic resistance of the target), and [Mass Confusion][124].\n  * [Curse toes][96]:\n  * No more [Summon Undead][125].\n  * [Deep elf summoners][126]:\n  * [Summon Demon][127] replaced with [Summon Vermin][128], which summons [orange rats][129], [spiders][130], and some other things.\n  * [Deep elf priests][131]/[Deep elf high priests][132]:\n  * A new spell \"[Malign Offering][133]\", which steals HP from the target to give to their allies.\n  * [Deep elf mages][134]:\n  * Entirely new spellsets:\n  * [Freeze][135], [Throw Icicle][136], [Summon Ice Beast][137];\n  * [Bolt of Magma][138], [Stone Arrow][139], [Petrify][140];\n  * [Iskenderun's Mystic Blast][141], [Slow][142], [Venom Bolt][143], [Blink][144];\n  * [Flame Tongue][145], [Throw Flame][146], [Sticky Flame][147], [Fireball][148];\n  * [Magic Dart][149], [Force Lance][150], [Iskenderun's Mystic Blast][141], [Iskenderun's Battlesphere][151].\n  * [Deep elf conjurers][152]:\n  * Only one spellset ([Bolt of Fire][153], [Bolt of Cold][154], [Lightning Bolt][155], [Bolt of Draining][51]); the spell set with sticky flame has been removed.\n  * [Gloorx Vloq][156]:\n  * No longer has [Invisibility][157] as an emergency spell.\n* Speed adjustments to several monsters: \n  * Speed 8: [spiny worms][158], [snapping turtles][159], [guardian mummies][160] (all previously speed 9).\n  * Speed 10: [jellies][161] (previously 9).\n* [Shadows][162] can now turn invisible, allowing them to move faster and land a guaranteed stab attack on enemies.\n* The retribution effect for killing an [apis][163] now inflicts [Weakness][101] on the player, instead of healing nearby hostiles.\n* [Giant fireflies][164] can now signal nearby awake monsters in a manner similar to shouting.\n* [Vault wardens][165] can seal stairways in addition to doors.\n* [Zombies][166] no longer appear excessively out of depth in the early dungeon.\n* Orb run monster spawns no longer include weak monsters, and now include [Orb Guardians][167].\n* Monster actions are now taken in order of speed, rather than any given monster taking all of its actions at once.\n* Removed monsters: \n  * [Laboratory rats][168].\n  * [War dogs][169] (replaced by [wolves][170] with essentially matching stats).\n  * [Deep dwarf scions][171], [deep dwarf necromancers][172], and [deep dwarf artificers][173].\n  * [Deep elf soldiers][174].\n  * A large number of vault-specific monsters.\n* Imps and other weak monsters no longer appear in [Pandemonium][175].\n* [Nergalle][176] appears earlier in the dungeon.\n* [Lamia][177] no longer comes with a band of minions.\n* Creatures other than natural creatures can now be [frenzied][178]; this causes them to attack anything in sight. The [berserking][179] effect of frenzy (might and haste effects) is limited to natural creatures.\nSpells \n\n- - -\n\n* New spells: \n  * [Searing Ray][180], a level 2 conjuration replacing [Force Lance][150] in the [Book of Conjurations][181] that deals damage over several consecutive turns.\n  * [Discord][182], a level 8 [Hexes][91] spell that attempts to [frenzy][183] all monsters in sight.\n* [Summon Small Mammals][184] now only ever summons one mammal, and is renamed to [Summon Small Mammal][185] as a consequence.\n* 100% of teleports on the orb run are delays (up from 50%).\n* [Haunt][186] adjustments: \n  * Summons now fixate on their target.\n  * [Flayed ghosts][55] are no longer summoned.\n  * Friendlies are no longer targettable.\n* [Olgreb's Toxic Radiance][187] now [poisons][188] continuously over several turns (and deals impact damage); it also ignores the caster's poison resistance (if any).\n* [Dragon Form][189] is pure [Transmutations][190] (was Tmut/Fire for all but [Draconians][191]).\n* [Force Lance][150] is now level 5 (was level 2), with boosted range and damage to match.\n* [Fulminant Prism][192] now caps at 200 spellpower.\n* [Swiftness][115] can be cast in water; it doesn't operate in water, but it grants the status (which operates as expected when out of the water).\n* [Summonings][6] caps are introduced. This acts on a per-spell basis, each spell has a fixed numerical limit for the number of summons active at any time. Going over this limit means your oldest summons will expire in a very short number of turns. Applies only to non-necromantic non-permanent summons.\n* Temporary summons will no longer follow the player down stairs.\n* Temporary summons expire when the player moves to a different level.\nItems \n\n- - -\n\n* The elemental evocation items have been reworked: \n  * All no longer depend on elemental magic skill or nearby terrain, can summon multiple elementals, and have an XP-based recharge timer.\n  * The [lamp of fire][193] fires up to three trails of flame in a given direction.\n  * The [fan of air elementals][194] is now the [fan of gales][195], and blows back nearby enemies.\n  * The [stone of earth elementals][196] is now the [stone of tremors][197]; it causes rubble to fall from nearby rock, stone, or permarock walls to damage creatures adjacent to them, and has a chance to [shaft][198] creatures;\n  * A new elemental evoker item - the [phial of floods][199]; it generates a wave of water which temporarily leaves a pool of water behind, and summons [water elementals][104].\n* The dependence of armour penalties on strength has been adjusted; there are no longer magic strength numbers for lowest possible penalties.\n* Potions of gain &lt;ability&gt; have been replaced by [potions of beneficial mutation][200], which grant the player a single beneficial mutation.\n* the [Scroll of vorpalise weapon][201] is now called [Scroll of brand weapon][202], and can rebrand weapons that already have a permanent brand affixed.\n* the [Scroll of immolation][203] has been reworked to [Inner Flame][204] everything in [LOS][205].\n* [Lear's chain mail][206] is now [Lear's hauberk][207] - a +27 [chain mail][208] that covers all armour slots other than [shields][209] and [cloaks][210].\n* The [staff of energy][211] eliminates 100% of spell hunger again, and includes the now-gone [staff of channeling][212] as well.\n* The [staff of power][213] scales with your maximum magic power.\n* [Box of beasts][214] has been reworked: \n  * Has a fixed, random number of charges between 5 and 15 inclusive.\n  * 1/3 chance to fail on usage with no bad effects.\n  * When successful, generates a [chimera][215]; a new monster with three heads. Each head can be a different beast, picked from a list which provides better/stronger beasts at higher [Evocations][216] skill. The heads determine the attacks and abilities available to the monster.\n* New \"[sack of spiders][5]\" item: \n  * Fixed charges between 5 and 15 inclusive.\n  * On evoking, creates [webs][217] around you and releases [spiders][218].\n  * Number of webs and type/number of spiders scales with evocations.\n* [Splint mail][219] has been removed; [chain mail][208] is now 8 AC to compensate.\n* [Needles][220] of [sickness][221] have been removed.\n* [Manuals][222] do not need to be read to be activated; they're always on while in inventory.\n* The [rod of striking][223] now functions as a melee weapon - it expends charges to deal additional damage in melee.\n* [Boots][224] of [running][225] have a -1 movement delay (was -2).\n* The [lantern of shadows][226]' rate of shadow spawning scales with evocations, and the resulting shadows now wander instead of following the player.\n* New unrand: the +4 [moon troll leather armour][227] {Spirit MP+5 Regen}.\n* Adjustments to unrands: \n  * [Arga][228] is now a [broad axe][229].\n  * The [shield of the Gong][230] no longer has [guardian spirit][231]; it is otherwise unchanged.\n  * The [knife of Accuracy][232] and [boots of the Assassin][233] are no more.\n  * The [lightning scales][234] are now +6 (was +3).\n* [Hammers][235] do not generate outside of vaults.\nGods \n\n- - -\n\n* [Yredelemnul][236] no longer gifts [rotting hulks][63] / [plague shamblers][64].\n* [Hill orcs][237] encountering an [orc priest][238] for the first time are offered the chance to convert to [Beogh][239] on the spot.\n* [Zin][240]'s Recite no longer paralyses the player; the player can take any action that doesn't involve the mouth while reciting.\nInterface \n\n- - -\n\n* For online play, explore_delay and travel_delay are instananeous by default.\n* Dungeon features with variable-colour tiles now display those colours in tiles (e.g. walls in the Abyss, the Elven Halls, and the Pan disco hall).\n* Examining a monster will display the spells monsters of its type are capable of using.\nTechnical \n\n- - -\n\n* A port to OpenSolaris (Dyson/Illumos).\n* MSVC compilation once again possible (Visual Studio [Express] 2012)\n\n\n[0]:

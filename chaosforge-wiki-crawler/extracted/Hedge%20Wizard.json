Hedge Wizards start with a variety of magical skills and with Magic Dart memorised, from a large library of varied low-level spells. They also get a wizard hat.}}\n\n'''Hedge Wizards''' are magicians who do not specialize in any area of magic, making them a jack of all trades, master of none when compared to more focused spellcasters.\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Human]], [[Deep Elf]], [[Naga]], [[Draconian]], [[Djinni]], and [[Octopode]] are the recommended species if you pick a Hedge Wizard Background.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[robe]]\n*+0 [[hat]]\n*+0 [[dagger]]\n*[[Potion of magic]]\n\n'''Available Spells:'''\n*[[Magic Dart]]\n*[[Blink]]\n*[[Call Imp]]\n*[[Grave Claw]]\n*[[Mephitic Cloud]]\n\nHedge Wizards start with the [[Magic Dart]] spell already memorised, and can memorize [[Slow]] from turn 1.\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Stealth]]: 2\n*[[Spellcasting]]: 3\n*[[Conjurations]]: 2\n*[[Necromancy]]: 1\n*[[Summonings]]: 1\n*[[Translocations]]: 1\n\nChoosing Hedge Wizard adds 2 to your starting [[Strength]], 6 to [[Intelligence]], and 4 to [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nHedge Wizard is one of the most versatile spellcaster backgrounds. What they lack in initial firepower, they more than make up for with their extensive spell library (5 - tied for the most of any background), with access to some very good utility spells. As a downside, Hedge Wizards don't have much focus in any one school. Players looking to simply pulverize things with spells should pick a different background. Perhaps ironically, these utility spells make wizards the most well suited to transition into melee combat.\n\n===Spell Details===\n[[Magic Dart]] is an unimpressive spell; \"unimpressive\" means that you'll have a somewhat rougher time than other mage starts. At least it has great range and never misses.\n\nThe big highlights of Hedge Wizard's book are [[Call Imp]] and [[Mephitic Cloud]]:\n*Call Imp creates a cerulean imp, which fights for you. Since it always wields a [[spear]], it can reach over you to attack from behind. It also does fine on the front lines, too. You can swap places with an imp to avoid [[attacks of opportunity]]. And you can take out all sorts of D:1-4 enemies by continuously re-summoning imps. (You can only have 1 imp on the field at a time.)\n*Mephitic Cloud inflicts [[confusion]] - this prevents enemies from using spells, and gives a 66% chance for enemies to move randomly instead of their normal action. A confused enemy is easy pickings. Imps (and other [[poison]] resistant monsters) are completely immune to the effects of Mephitic Cloud. Note that this spell is very [[noise|loud]], so using it will attract other enemies in the vicinity.\n:Depending on your Intelligence, you'll need ~3-5 levels in each of its three skills (Poison, Air, Conjurations) to have a reasonable failure rate.\n\nThe other spells shouldn't be sneezed at, either. [[Grave Claw]] deals irresistible smite-targeted damage and prevents the target from moving (though you can't use it every fight). [[Blink]] teleports you to a random location in the [[line of sight]], allowing you to escape from melee range.\n\nWhile you initially won't have the spell levels (or casting prowess) to memorize every one of these spells, they are all useful in their own right. Typically, Blink is saved until later -- it isn't as effective in a mundane situation.\n\nIt's best to train spells one at a time: get a spell to reasonable failure rate, then switch to the next spell/skill you have available. Bonus if said skill helps train up other spells that you've found (and want to use).\n\n===Tips and Tricks===\n*The [[Spellcasting]] skill boosts success rates of all of your spells, though at 1/4 effectiveness. You'll want to train it eventually, but it's not a substitute for investing in spell schools (yet).\n*If you come upon an awesome melee weapon early in the dungeon, there's nothing to stop you from becoming a hybrid (a warrior-mage) character, despite your wizardly background. You can consider picking up some [[strength]], especially if you start with less than 8.\n\n==External Links==\n[http://www.ultraviolent4.com/characters/opwz.html 0.21 guide for playing an Octopode Wizard by Ultraviolent4]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], Hedge Wizards did not have 1 in [[Necromancy]] and has 1 in [[Conjurations]] instead of 2. They also had [[Slow]] and [[Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot]] instead of [[Grave Claw]].\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Hedge Wizards started with [[Conjure Flame]] instead of [[Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot]].\n*In [[0.29]], Wizard's abbreviation was changed from Wz to HW. Also, most backgrounds were buffed; all Mage backgrounds gained a [[potion of magic]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Hedge Wizards started with the [[Book of Minor Magic]]. Wizards received no changes in their starting spells.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Hedge Wizards were called '''Wizards'''. They had the highest starting [[intelligence]] bonus and didn't start with a [[dagger]]. Their starting [[intelligence]] was reduced from +10 to +6, [[strength]] was increased from -1 to +2, [[dexterity]] was increased from +3 to +4. \n*Prior to [[0.14]], wizards started with 20 [[gold]].\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

{"title":"Fighter flag","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fighter_flag","type":"raw","data":"{{stub}}\n\nMonsters with this flag are considered to be skilled fighters. This monster flag is used to characterize monster behaviour. At the moment, the only application of this flag is when a fighter loses line of sight from a player. While normally intelligent creatures with a ranged attack will attempt to regain line of sight, fighters will not (except [[centaur warrior]]s and [[yaktaur captain]]s).\n\nSource: http://git.develz.org/?p=crawl.git;a=blob;f=crawl-ref/source/mon-behv.cc#l81\n\n[[Category:Fighter]]\n[[Category:Monster attributes]]\n[[Category:Monster flags]]"}

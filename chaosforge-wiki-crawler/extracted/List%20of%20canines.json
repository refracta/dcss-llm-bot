{"title":"List of canines","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_canines","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n'''Canines''' are common scavengers and hunters found all throughout ''Crawl''. While they are among the weaker monsters you'll find, they are all faster than the average adventurer and usually run in packs. Their keen noses give them immunity to [[blind]]ing and the ability to [[see invisible]].\n\nCanines can mostly be found in [[the Dungeon]] and [[the Lair]] (especially in the hound-themed Lair ending), though a couple varieties can be found in more exotic locations. Some can be summoned with the spell [[Call Canine Familiar]].\n\n==Canine Types==\n{{monsterlink|Jackal}} - Low-level scavengers that inhabit the early Dungeon. Individually weak, but a pack can bring down a newbie adventurer if they catch them out in the open.\n\n{{monsterlink|Hound}} - Swift, solitary dogs found in the earlier portions of the Dungeon.\n\n{{monsterlink|Wolf}} - Exceptionally fast pack hunters found in wild places, as well as in the company of [[Grum]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Warg}} - Huge, bestial wolves who live in the [[Orcish Mines]] with their [[list of orcs|orcish]] masters. Resistant to [[poison]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Hell hound}} - [[Demon]]ic, [[fire]]-breathing dogs found mostly in and around the [[Hell]]s. Occasionally appear elsewhere, such as in [[Volcano]]es or with [[Azrael]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Raiju}} - [[Abyss]]al wolves that can [[Blinkbolt|transform themselves into bolts of lightning]] and lunge through prey.\n\n{{monsterlink|Doom hound}} - Grim hunting hounds of [[Tartarus]], their [[Doom Howl|unearthly howls]] call down deathly hunters on trespassers.\n\n==Retired Canines==\n{{monsterlink|War dog}} - War-trained dogs with painful bites and a pack mentality. Found both in the Lair and in the company of [[Grum]] before their removal in [[0.13]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Spirit wolf}} - Semi-corporeal beasts that called vast packs to hunt those who enter their woods.  Considered for inclusion in [[0.14]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], canines were able to [[Blood scent|track the smell of blood]].\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

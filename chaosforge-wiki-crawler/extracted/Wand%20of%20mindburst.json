If it overcomes their willpower, it 'blows their mind' in a violently literal fashion, dealing damage that bypasses their armour entirely. It is useless against mindless creatures.}}\n\nA '''wand of mindburst''' deals significant chunks of untyped damage to a single monster, assuming it isn't [[monster intelligence|mindless]]. This effect must overcome the target's [[willpower]], but it ignores [[AC]] and always hits. Mindburst is significantly harder to resist than other willpower-related wand effects, making it useful against a large variety of early- and mid-game opponents. \n\nPlayers will deal <code>3d(8.75 + 3.5 * [[Evocations]]/4)</code> damage with this wand.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|zap-data.h|1143}}<br>Specifically, you'll deal <code>3d(5 + pow/4)</code> damage, for pow = <code>15 + 3.5 * Evocations</code> ({{source ref|0.30.0|evoke.cc|177}}). If you have the [[MP-Powered Wands]] mutation, then your \"pow\" gains a +33% boost.</ref> \n\nMonsters will deal <code>1d(12 + (30 + [[HD]])/4)</code> damage with this wand.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|zap-data.h|1145}}</ref>\n\nPlayers use mindburst with an [[enchantment power]] multiplier of x2.5,<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|zap-data.h|1144}}</ref> which makes it much harder to resist than other wands. See the [[Willpower#Resisting enchantments|Willpower]] article for more details.\n\n==Strategy==\n*This wand can be particularly effective at taking out low-HD, high-threat monsters such as [[boggart]]s and [[Sonja]]. \n*Mindburst is also effective at killing low-level players. If an early opponent happens to have one on hand, you'll likely want to escape immediately; multiple zaps of a wand of mindburst can very quickly become lethal.\n\n==Trivia==\nA monster killed in this manner will explode, spraying blood splatters around the area without leaving a [[corpse]] ([[list of dragons|dragons]] are immune to this effect, and may or may not leave a corpse as normal). Followers of [[Gozag Ym Sagoz]] will receive a spray of single [[gold]] coins on several nearby tiles instead of a shower of blood.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], monsters no longer deal x67% damage with this wand. Instead, mindburst's damage formula (when used by monsters) was reduced. Overall, damage is slightly higher than it was in 0.28.\n*In [[0.28]], monsters deal x67% damage with this wand. It was supposed to work this way since [[0.4]], but was broken due to a bug.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], this wand was called the '''wand of disintegration'''. Also, it could affect [[:Category: Brainless intelligence|mindless]] creatures.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], it could disintegrate [[Wall#Rock|rock walls]] and obstacles in the dungeon ([[door]]s, [[iron grate]]s, [[tree]]s, orcish idols, and most kinds of [[statue]]s).\n*Prior to [[0.15]], [[orange crystal statue]]s and [[silver statue]]s could be destroyed instantly through use of a wand of disintegration.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], zapped creatures were simply reduced to nothingness.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{wands}}"}

{"title":"Blade trap","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Blade_trap","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}{{flavour|A massive scythe-like blade hidden in a slit, with a counterweight that acts as a pendulum.}}\n\n[[File:Blade trap.png]]\n\nA '''blade trap''' is a mechanical [[trap]] which, when stepped on, causes a huge blade to swing up and slice you, causing 48-76 physical damage to you if it hits (monsters take only 10-38 damage). It is the most powerful of all the mechanical traps, and well worth being cautious around. Unlike other mechanical traps, blade traps don't use ammunition and cannot be destroyed.\n\n==History==\n*All mechanical traps were removed in [[0.27]].\n\n[[Category:Traps]]"}

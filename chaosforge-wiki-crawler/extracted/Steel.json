Ammo with this brand deals 30% more damage.\n\nAlthough it lacks any special abilities, steel ammo is a good choice for general use. However, it is less effective than [[silver]] when attacking vulnerable enemies. It is a rare find outside of [[god]] gifts and certain high-level monsters.\n\nNote that while steel is a material in real life, in ''Crawl'', it and [[silver]] are implemented as brands, so you can't have a [[poisoned]] steel javelin or a silver [[exploding]] tomahawk.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.24]], steel was merged with the [[silver]] brand.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], this brand could be found on [[sling bullet]]s and [[bolt]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], steel ammunition would [[mulch]] 10% as often as normal.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], steel ammunition weighed 300% as much as normal.\n*Prior to [[0.9.0]], steel ammunition dealt 50% more damage.\n*The steel brand was added in [[0.6.0]].\n\n{{brands}}\n\n[[category:brands]]"}

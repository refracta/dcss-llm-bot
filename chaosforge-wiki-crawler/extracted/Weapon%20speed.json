For every 2 levels in the corresponding weapon [[skill]], your attack delay is reduced by 1 [[aut]] (ie. 0.1 [[decaAut]]), until it reaches the minimum delay.\n\nMost weapons have minimum attack delays of 5, 6, or 7 aut. The minimum delay is the smaller of (base delay / 2) and 7, with a few exceptions:\n*[[Rapier]]s and [[quick blade]]s, which reach 5 to match other [[Short Blades]].\n*Crossbows ([[hand crossbow]]s, [[arbalest]]s, [[triple crossbow]]s), which have a mindelay of 10.\n*[[Stone]]s, [[dart]]s, and [[boomerang]]s, which are capped at 7.\n\n[[Unarmed Combat]] works differently. For every 5.4 skill levels, unarmed attack delay is reduced by 1 aut. Therefore, Unarmed Combat starts at 10 delay and reaches 5 delay at skill 27.\n\n===Modifiers===\nSome factors may further alter weapons' speed:\n* [[Speed (brand)|Speed]]-branded weapons, which reduce the attack delay of a weapon by 33% at all skill levels.\n* [[Heavy]]-branded weapons, which increase attack delay by 50% at all skill levels.\n* [[Haste]] or [[Berserk]] multiplies all delays by 66%.\n* [[Finesse]] halves all attack delays. Does not stack with haste/berserk.\n* If you are wearing a shield you may suffer some penalties. See [[Shields#Shield_penalties|Shields]].\n* [[Ranged weapon]]s are also encumbered by [[body armour]]. See [[Ranged Weapons#Armour penalty|Ranged Weapons]].\n\nDelays are rounded randomly in a weighted manner (if delay = 3.4, there is a 40% for 4 aut and 60% for 3 aut).\n\n==List of weapon delays==\n===[[Short Blades]]===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Using ctrl+direction to swing at nothing a few times should give you a pretty good indication of your attack delay.\n\nThe former two commands display the ''average'' attack speed, to the nearest aut. If your attack delay is not an integer, it'll semi-randomly round up and down.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Melee weapon]]\n*[[Attack speed]]\nSee individual weapon articles for more information about a given weapon.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.17]], [[unarmed combat]] was penalized by armour.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], [[ranged weapon]]s used a completely different delay formula: <code>Base delay - Weapon Skill*4*Average Stat/250</code>.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the [[speed_(brand)|speed]] brand halved your attack delay rounding up, and decreased pre-AC damage by 10%.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Finesse had no effect on non-[[blowgun]] throwing weapons.\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]\n[[Category:Weapons]]"}

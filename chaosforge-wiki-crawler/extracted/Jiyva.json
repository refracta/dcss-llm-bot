Followers are expected to support the spread and satiation of their fellow slimes by allowing them to consume items, and are forbidden from harming any slimes. Especially favoured followers will become as shapeless as their god, mutating wildly.Jiyva will gradually fill the dungeon with jellies, which will rapidly consume nearby items as well as slowly consuming items from elsewhere in the dungeon. As they spread slime across more of the dungeon, Jiyva will grant followers increasingly rapid health and magic regeneration, and will begin mutating them to better reflect Jiyva's image. Followers will later become able to call forth acidic ooze from the walls of the dungeon, and to turn monsters to slime with a touch. |\n\nAs Jiyva is the amorphous god, its name is also shapeless and will be slightly different in each game: Jiyva Juub, Jiyva Jichodgh, Jiyva Jojaun...\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Racial Restrictions](#Racial_Restrictions)\n- [2 Appreciates](#Appreciates)\n- [3 Deprecates](#Deprecates)\n- [4 Altar](#Altar)\n- [5 Given Abilities](#Given_Abilities)\n- [6 Gifts](#Gifts)\n- [7 Punishments](#Punishments)\n- [8 Strategy](#Strategy)\n  - [8.1 Tips & Tricks](#Tips_.26_Tricks)\n- [9 History](#History)\n\n## Racial Restrictions\n\n[Demigods](/Demigod \"Demigod\") cannot worship Jiyva (or any other god). Also, characters who sacrificed love under [Ru](/Ru \"Ru\") cannot join Jiyva.\n\n## Appreciates\n\n- Exploring areas, other than the [Slime Pits](/Slime_Pits \"Slime Pits\"). Piety is gained faster than other exploration-based gods.\n\n## Deprecates\n\n- Inactivity: You lose 1 piety per 340 turns, on average (1/17 chance every 20 turns).\n\n## Altar\n\nUnlike most altars, Jiyva's isn't guaranteed to be found in the [Ecumenical Temple](/Ecumenical_Temple \"Ecumenical Temple\") or [the Dungeon](/The_Dungeon \"The Dungeon\"). It is possible for the altar to be found at these locations, but only very rarely, and generally as part of a slime-related [vault](/Vault \"Vault\"). The most common location for an easily accessible altar is in [Lair](/Lair \"Lair\") levels 4 to 5, next to the entrance to [the Slime Pits](/The_Slime_Pits \"The Slime Pits\"), where it has an approximate 66.6% chance of appearing. It occasionally spawns in the [Sewer](/Sewer \"Sewer\") (which itself, may not appear in your game). And like any god, Jiyva altars can be randomly generated in [the Abyss](/The_Abyss \"The Abyss\") or revealed from a [faded altar](/Faded_altar \"Faded altar\").\n\nThere is a guaranteed altar in the main vault in the final level of [the Slime Pits](/The_Slime_Pits \"The Slime Pits\"), as well as a chance for further altars to show up on the earlier levels. However, killing [the Royal Jelly](/The_Royal_Jelly \"The Royal Jelly\") without worshipping (or receiving penance from) Jiyva will immediately cause all altars to vanish. You'd have killed its last major worshipper -- and [Dissolution](/Dissolution \"Dissolution\") alone can not sustain a god.\n\n## Given Abilities\n\n**[Piety level -](/Piety \"Piety\")**: \"Squelcher\"\n\n- All [slime](/List_of_jellies \"List of jellies\") and [eyeball](/List_of_eyeballs \"List of eyeballs\") monsters turn neutral. (Passive)\n- Jiyva protects you from the effects of slime-covered walls unless you are undergoing [penance](/Penance \"Penance\"). (Passive)\n- If there are no slimes on the current floor, Jiyva will spawn a [jelly](/Jelly \"Jelly\") after some time has passed. (Passive)\n- Slimes will now eat items they find on the floor; regular [jellies](/Jelly \"Jelly\") will split after consuming enough items. [Artefacts](/Artefact \"Artefact\"), [miscellaneous evocables](/Evocable \"Evocable\") (like the [box of beasts](/Box_of_beasts \"Box of beasts\") and [condenser vane](/Condenser_vane \"Condenser vane\")), and the [figurine of a ziggurat](/Figurine_of_a_ziggurat \"Figurine of a ziggurat\") are inedible. (Passive)\n- Jiyva prevents you from hurting slimes. Slimes will absorb piercing and non-piercing attacks that hit them, preventing you from using slimes as cover.\n\n**[Piety level \\*](/Piety \"Piety\")**: \"Ooze\"\n\n- **Regeneration**: You regenerate health and MP quicker, even under [Inhibited Regeneration](/Inhibited_Regeneration \"Inhibited Regeneration\"). At 1\\* piety, you gain +0.80 HP/turn and +0.25 MP/turn, which scales to +1.6 HP/turn and +0.5 MP/turn at 6\\* piety.\n\n**[Piety level \\*\\*](/Piety \"Piety\")**: \"Jelly\"\n\n- You are shielded from [corrosive](/Corrosive \"Corrosive\") effects (rCorr). (Passive)\n\n**[Piety level \\*\\*\\*](/Piety \"Piety\")**: \"Slime Creature\"\n\n- **Oozemancy**: Temporarily turns nearby walls within 4 tiles into acidic, slime-covered walls. These walls inflict acidic damage on enemies. Unlike [Frozen Ramparts](/Frozen_Ramparts \"Frozen Ramparts\"), you can move while sustaining these walls. (3 MP, 8-12 piety)\n\n**[Piety level \\*\\*\\*\\*](/Piety \"Piety\")**: \"Dissolving \\[Species]\"\n\n- **Slimify**: Coats your weapon with slime for a few turns, which turns the next enemy you hit with it into a slime and fully heals it. This only works against monsters with [natural](/Natural \"Natural\") holiness or that are [undead](/Undead \"Undead\") and not [insubstantial](/Insubstantial \"Insubstantial\") (i.e. not [ghosts](/Undead#Ghosts_and_Wraiths \"Undead\")). Natural monsters turn into slimes based on their HD (stronger monsters make stronger slimes), and [derived undead](/Derived_undead \"Derived undead\") simply turn neutral. In any case, the effect ends after it has converted one monster. Monsters converted in this way do not grant experience. (5 MP, 10-15 Piety)\n\n**[Piety level \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*](/Piety \"Piety\")**: \"Blob\"\n\n- **Jelly Expulsion:** Hits that take 25% or more of your maximum [HP](/HP \"HP\") (including [torment](/Torment \"Torment\")) will generate friendly, high-end jellies, similar to the effect of [The Royal Jelly](/The_Royal_Jelly \"The Royal Jelly\"). The number of summoned jellies is dependent on the severity of the damage. (Passive)\n\n**[Piety level \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*](/Piety \"Piety\")**: \"Royal Jelly\"\n\n- **Unlock the Slime Pits vaults**: The walls that block access to the slimy [rune](/Rune \"Rune\") and other goodies will be removed. (Passive)\n\n## Gifts\n\n**[Piety level \\*\\*\\*](/Piety \"Piety\") - Gain random mutations**: Jiyva gives mutations as gifts, including rare mutations unique to Jiyva. Firstly, already present mutations have a 25% per-level chance of losing a level, with [bad mutations](/Bad_mutation \"Bad mutation\") having a doubled chance. Then, 4 mutation levels are given out, which will tend to give maximum level mutations. This occurs only if you can safely mutate: [mummies](/Mummies \"Mummies\"), [ghouls](/Ghoul \"Ghoul\"), or [Death Form](/Death_Form \"Death Form\") characters are not eligible.\n\nFor a list of Jiyva exclusive mutations, see [Jiyva mutations](/Jiyva_mutations \"Jiyva mutations\").\n\n## Punishments\n\n|   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| - | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|   | Jiyva does not appreciate abandonment, and will call down fearful punishments on disloyal followers!Jiyva's vengeance is swift and gurgling. All slimes turn against those who offend Jiyva, and Jiyva ensures a plentiful supply of further slimes. Victims, too, will find their own bodies becoming unstable; regularly transmuting into strange forms and acquiring debilitating mutations, as well as having any gifts of slime mutations stripped away from them.Jiyva's wrath lasts for a relatively short duration. |\n\nUpon abandonment, all slimes will immediately turn hostile, and Jiyva will occasionally punish you with one of the following forms of [divine retribution](/Divine_retribution \"Divine retribution\"):\n\n- You receive a few [bad mutations](/Bad_mutation \"Bad mutation\"). These mutations bypass all forms of mutation resistance except for [Zin](/Zin \"Zin\")'s protection.\n- [Polymorphs](/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") you into a [bat](/Bat_Form \"Bat Form\"), [fungus](/Fungus_Form \"Fungus Form\"), [pig](/Pig_Form \"Pig Form\"), [tree](/Tree_Form \"Tree Form\"), or [wisp](/Wisp_Form \"Wisp Form\").\n- Floods you with [mutagenic radiation](/Glow \"Glow\").\n- Sends a number of [durably summoned](/Durably_summoned \"Durably summoned\") high level slimes and eyeballs to attack you.\n\n## Strategy\n\nJiyva is best suited for characters that can play fast and loose, whenever from innate strength or boosted regeneration. Everything Jiyva offers will support that playstyle, from saving more items to spamming Slimify and Oozemancy. Both offensive abilities allow you to take on much more than your character can chew -- Slimify is a one-hit kill on almost everything in the game. Piety is gained rapidly, and hoarding 6\\* of piety serves no use, so use those abilities while you can.\n\nAlong with some extremely strong regeneration, it may seem like the slime god is best suited for the early game. However, altars to Jiyva will rarely appear in the Dungeon, and while common in the Lair, aren't guaranteed, either. Even then, early worship means losing out on a variety of items. Meanwhile, high level PCs tend to acquire two things: lots of bad mutations, and lots of items. Jiyva gives many chances to clear bad mutations (and gain new, positive ones), and losing a [scroll of blinking](/Scroll_of_blinking \"Scroll of blinking\") when you have five is much more manageable than if you don't have any at all.\n\n### Tips & Tricks\n\n- If Jiyva does not spawn in the [Temple](/Temple \"Temple\"), you can start by worshipping [Elyvilon](/Elyvilon \"Elyvilon\"), [The Shining One](/The_Shining_One \"The Shining One\") or [Ignis](/Ignis \"Ignis\"). Since Jiyva is chaotic, but not evil, you will not face retribution for converting from the former two.\n- Although you can (and will) freely mutate and eventually filter out the bad ones, don't expect to become a superhero. Jiyva will change your mutations unpredictably, and you may get [horns](/Horns \"Horns\"), [antennae](/Antennae \"Antennae\"), a [beak](/Beak \"Beak\"), [claws](/Claws \"Claws\"), [talons](/Talons \"Talons\"), or [hooves](/Hooves \"Hooves\") which may restrict your choice of armour. If you're a race who ignores most equipment slots (e.g. [ogre](/Ogre \"Ogre\"), [troll](/Troll \"Troll\"), [felid](/Felid \"Felid\"), [octopode](/Octopode \"Octopode\")), these are very welcome.\n- Eye monsters summoned by [Mnoleg](/Mnoleg \"Mnoleg\") or [Pan lords](/Pan_lord \"Pan lord\") will be neutral.\n- High rates of magic regeneration and the allure of mutations such as [Wild Magic](/Wild_Magic_\\(mutation\\) \"Wild Magic (mutation)\") may make Jiyva tempting for spellcasting characters. However, many offensive spells with a large area of effect, such as [Iskenderun's Mystic Blast](/Iskenderun%27s_Mystic_Blast \"Iskenderun's Mystic Blast\"), [Ozocubu's Refrigeration](/Ozocubu%27s_Refrigeration \"Ozocubu's Refrigeration\") or [Chain Lightning](/Chain_Lightning \"Chain Lightning\"), among others, risk enraging Jiyva due to slain jellies caught in collateral damage. Magic-focused characters wishing to worship Jiyva should favour more subtle types of spells, such as those offered by [Summonings](/Summonings \"Summonings\"), [Hexes](/Hexes \"Hexes\"), [Translocations](/Translocations \"Translocations\"), [Necromancy](/Necromancy \"Necromancy\") or [Transmutations](/Transmutations \"Transmutations\"). [Ignition](/Ignition \"Ignition\") is also a good choice, as one of the rare mass destruction spells that will always spare allies.\n\n## History\n\n- Prior to [0.32](/0.32 \"0.32\"), Jiyva gave penance for attacking slimes instead of preventing you from harming them. Also, Jiyva could pacify slime-shaped [shapeshifters](/Shapeshifter_\\(monster\\) \"Shapeshifter (monster)\").\n\n- Prior to [0.31](/0.31 \"0.31\"), monsters hit with Slimify were not fully healed.\n\n- Prior to [0.30](/0.30 \"0.30\"), jellies could eat [miscellaneous evocables](/Evocable \"Evocable\") (as they were not once-per-game at the time).\n\n- Prior to [0.29](/0.29 \"0.29\"), the Jiyva altar at the front of Slime had an approximate 50% of appearing (based on [vault](/Vault \"Vault\") weightings) rather than 66% (for any of the vaults).\n\n- In [0.28](/0.28 \"0.28\"), Jiyva was overhauled. Prior to this version:\n\n  - Jiyva worshippers gained piety by having jellies eat items, which recovered HP and MP (instead of a flat regeneration buff). These jellies could be summoned at 1\\* of piety.\n  - Jiyva gifted mutations more often, but not in bursts. Net mutations/time remained similar, though the logic meant that high level muts were far less common.\n  - Slimify cost 8-12 piety, and Oozemancy was not implemented.\n  - Passive rCorr was unlocked at 3\\*, and slime spawning at 6\\*.\n  - Jiyva could cure bad mutations as an invocable action, instead of favouring the removal of bad mutations with gifts.\n  - Jiyva could shuffle your [attributes](/Attributes \"Attributes\").\n\n- Prior to [0.27](/0.27 \"0.27\"), Slimify produced [death oozes](/Death_ooze \"Death ooze\") when affecting the [undead](/Undead \"Undead\").\n\n- Prior to [0.26](/0.26 \"0.26\"), Jiyva's slimes would [feed](/Food \"Food\") you when eating items.\n\n- Prior to [0.24](/0.24 \"0.24\"), Jiyva's Slimify ability didn't work properly on derived undead, and Torment damage would not trigger the slime-spawning ability.\n\n- Prior to [0.19](/0.19 \"0.19\"), Jiyva's jelly prayer paralysis was removed. Additionally, the Slime Pits were found on Lair:6-8 before the branch was shortened.\n\n- Prior to [0.14](/0.14 \"0.14\"), Jiyva's abilities were based off of your [Invocations](/Invocations \"Invocations\") skill.\n\n| [Gods](/God \"God\") |

Followers are expected to support the spread and satiation of their fellow slimes by allowing them to consume items, and are forbidden from harming any slimes. Especially favoured followers will become as shapeless as their god, mutating wildly.\n<p>Jiyva will gradually fill the dungeon with jellies, which will rapidly consume nearby items as well as slowly consuming items from elsewhere in the dungeon. As they spread slime across more of the dungeon, Jiyva will grant followers increasingly rapid health and magic regeneration, and will begin mutating them to better reflect Jiyva's image. Followers will later become able to call forth acidic ooze from the walls of the dungeon, and to turn monsters to slime with a touch.\n</p>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>As Jiyva is the amorphous god, its name is also shapeless and will be slightly different in each game: Jiyva Juub, Jiyva Jichodgh, Jiyva Jojaun...\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><div class=\"toctitle\"><h2>Contents</h2></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Racial_Restrictions\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Racial Restrictions</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Appreciates\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Appreciates</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Deprecates\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Deprecates</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Altar\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Altar</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Given_Abilities\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Given Abilities</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Gifts\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gifts</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Punishments\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Punishments</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Strategy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Strategy</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Tips_.26_Tricks\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tips &amp; Tricks</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#History\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Racial_Restrictions\">Racial Restrictions</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/Demigod\" title=\"Demigod\">Demigods</a> cannot worship Jiyva (or any other god).

Everything Jiyva offers will support that playstyle, from saving more items to spamming Slimify and Oozemancy. Both offensive abilities allow you to take on much more than your character can chew -- Slimify is a one-hit kill on almost everything in the game. Piety is gained rapidly, and hoarding 6* of piety serves no use, so use those abilities while you can.\n</p><p>Along with some extremely strong regeneration, it may seem like the slime god is best suited for the early game. However, altars to Jiyva will rarely appear in the Dungeon, and while common in the Lair, aren't guaranteed, either. Even then, early worship means losing out on a variety of items. Meanwhile, high level PCs tend to acquire two things: lots of bad mutations, and lots of items. Jiyva gives many chances to clear bad mutations (and gain new, positive ones), and losing a <a href=\"/Scroll_of_blinking\" title=\"Scroll of blinking\">scroll of blinking</a> when you have five is much more manageable than if you don't have any at all.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tips_.26_Tricks\">Tips &amp; Tricks</span></h3>\n<ul><li>If Jiyva does not spawn in the <a href=\"/Temple\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Temple\">Temple</a>, you can start by worshipping <a href=\"/Elyvilon\" title=\"Elyvilon\">Elyvilon</a>, <a href=\"/The_Shining_One\" title=\"The Shining One\">The Shining One</a> or <a href=\"/Ignis\" title=\"Ignis\">Ignis</a>. Since Jiyva is chaotic, but not evil, you will not face retribution for converting from the former two.</li>\n<li>Although you can (and will) freely mutate and eventually filter out the bad ones, don't expect to become a superhero. Jiyva will change your mutations unpredictably, and you may get <a href=\"/Horns\" title=\"Horns\">horns</a>, <a href=\"/Antennae\" title=\"Antennae\">antennae</a>, a <a href=\"/Beak\" title=\"Beak\">beak</a>, <a href=\"/Claws\" title=\"Claws\">claws</a>, <a href=\"/Talons\" title=\"Talons\">talons</a>, or <a href=\"/Hooves\" title=\"Hooves\">hooves</a> which may restrict your choice of armour. If you're a race who ignores most equipment slots (e.g. <a href=\"/Ogre\" title=\"Ogre\">ogre</a>, <a href=\"/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">troll</a>, <a href=\"/Felid\" title=\"Felid\">felid</a>, <a href=\"/Octopode\" title=\"Octopode\">octopode</a>), these are very welcome.</li>\n<li>Eye monsters summoned by <a href=\"/Mnoleg\" title=\"Mnoleg\">Mnoleg</a> or <a href=\"/Pan_lord\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pan lord\">Pan lords</a> will be neutral.</li>\n<li>High rates of magic regeneration and the allure of mutations such as <a href=\"/Wild_Magic_(mutation)\" title=\"Wild Magic (mutation)\">Wild Magic</a> may make Jiyva tempting for spellcasting characters. However, many offensive spells with a large area of effect, such as <a href=\"/Iskenderun%27s_Mystic_Blast\" title=\"Iskenderun&#39;s Mystic Blast\">Iskenderun's Mystic Blast</a>, <a href=\"/Ozocubu%27s_Refrigeration\" title=\"Ozocubu&#39;s Refrigeration\">Ozocubu's Refrigeration</a> or <a href=\"/Chain_Lightning\" title=\"Chain Lightning\">Chain Lightning</a>, among others, risk enraging Jiyva due to slain jellies caught in collateral damage.

altar.png]] Slime for the Slime God!''\n{{flavour|Jiyva is the ancient deity of the slimes. Followers are expected to support the spread and satiation of their fellow slimes by allowing them to consume items, and are forbidden from harming any slimes. Especially favoured followers will become as shapeless as their god, mutating wildly.\n\nJiyva will gradually fill the dungeon with jellies, which will rapidly consume nearby items as well as slowly consuming items from elsewhere in the dungeon. As they spread slime across more of the dungeon, Jiyva will grant followers increasingly rapid health and magic regeneration, and will begin mutating them to better reflect Jiyva's image. Followers will later become able to call forth acidic ooze from the walls of the dungeon, and to turn monsters to slime with a touch.}}\n\nAs Jiyva is the amorphous god, its name is also shapeless and will be slightly different in each game: Jiyva Juub, Jiyva Jichodgh, Jiyva Jojaun...\n\n==Racial Restrictions==\n[[Demigod]]s cannot worship Jiyva (or any other god). Also, characters who sacrificed love under [[Ru]] cannot join Jiyva.\n\n==Appreciates==\n*Exploring areas, other than the [[Slime Pits]]. Piety is gained faster than other exploration-based gods.\n\n==Deprecates==\n*Inactivity: You lose 1 piety per 340 turns, on average (1/17 chance every 20 turns).\n\n==Altar==\nUnlike most altars, Jiyva's isn't guaranteed to be found in the [[Ecumenical Temple]] or [[the Dungeon]]. It is possible for the altar to be found at these locations, but only very rarely, and generally as part of a slime-related [[vault]]. The most common location for an easily accessible altar is in [[Lair]] levels 4 to 5, next to the entrance to [[the Slime Pits]], where it has an approximate 66.6% chance of appearing. It occasionally spawns in the [[Sewer]] (which itself, may not appear in your game). And like any god, Jiyva altars can be randomly generated in [[the Abyss]] or revealed from a [[faded altar]].\n\nThere is a guaranteed altar in the main vault in the final level of [[the Slime Pits]], as well as a chance for further altars to show up on the earlier levels. However, killing [[the Royal Jelly]] without worshipping (or receiving penance from) Jiyva will immediately cause all altars to vanish. You'd have killed its last major worshipper -- and [[Dissolution]] alone can not sustain a god.\n\n==Given Abilities==\n'''[[Piety|Piety level -]]''': \"Squelcher\"\n*All [[List of jellies|slime]] and [[List of eyeballs|eyeball]] monsters turn neutral. (Passive)\n*Jiyva protects you from the effects of slime-covered walls unless you are undergoing [[penance]]. (Passive)\n*If there are no slimes on the current floor, Jiyva will spawn a [[jelly]] after some time has passed. (Passive)\n*Slimes will now eat items they find on the floor; regular [[jelly|jellies]] will split after consuming enough items. [[Artefact]]s, [[evocable|miscellaneous evocables]] (like the [[box of beasts]] and [[condenser vane]]), and the [[figurine of a ziggurat]] are inedible. (Passive)\n*Jiyva prevents you from hurting slimes. Slimes will absorb piercing and non-piercing attacks that hit them, preventing you from using slimes as cover.\n'''[[Piety|Piety level *]]''': \"Ooze\"\n*'''Regeneration''': You regenerate health and MP quicker, even under [[Inhibited Regeneration]]. At 1* piety, you gain +0.80 HP/turn and +0.25 MP/turn, which scales to +1.6 HP/turn and +0.5 MP/turn at 6* piety.\n'''[[Piety|Piety level **]]''': \"Jelly\"\n*You are shielded from [[corrosive]] effects (rCorr). (Passive)\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ***]]''': \"Slime Creature\"\n*'''Oozemancy''': Temporarily turns nearby walls within 4 tiles into acidic, slime-covered walls. These walls inflict acidic damage on enemies. Unlike [[Frozen Ramparts]], you can move while sustaining these walls. (3 MP, 8-12 piety)\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ****]]''': \"Dissolving [Species]\"\n*'''Slimify''': Coats your weapon with slime for a few turns, which turns the next enemy you hit with it into a slime and fully heals it. This only works against monsters with [[natural]] holiness or that are [[undead]] and not [[insubstantial]] (i.e. not [[Undead#Ghosts and Wraiths|ghosts]]). Natural monsters turn into slimes based on their HD (stronger monsters make stronger slimes), and [[derived undead]] simply turn neutral. In any case, the effect ends after it has converted one monster. Monsters converted in this way do not grant experience. (5 MP, 10-15 Piety)\n'''[[Piety|Piety level *****]]''': \"Blob\"\n*'''Jelly Expulsion:''' Hits that take 25% or more of your maximum [[HP]] (including [[torment]]) will generate friendly, high-end jellies, similar to the effect of [[The Royal Jelly]]. The number of summoned jellies is dependent on the severity of the damage. (Passive)\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ******]]''': \"Royal Jelly\"\n*'''Unlock the Slime Pits vaults''': The walls that block access to the slimy [[rune]] and other goodies will be removed. (Passive)\n\n==Gifts==\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ***]] - Gain random mutations''': \nJiyva gives mutations as gifts, including rare mutations unique to Jiyva. Firstly, already present mutations have a 25% per-level chance of losing a level, with [[bad mutation]]s having a doubled chance. Then, 4 mutation levels are given out, which will tend to give maximum level mutations. This occurs only if you can safely mutate: [[mummies]], [[ghoul]]s, or [[Death Form]] characters are not eligible.\n\nFor a list of Jiyva exclusive mutations, see [[Jiyva mutations]].\n\n==Punishments==\n{{flavour|Jiyva does not appreciate abandonment, and will call down fearful punishments on disloyal followers!\n\nJiyva's vengeance is swift and gurgling. All slimes turn against those who offend Jiyva, and Jiyva ensures a plentiful supply of further slimes. Victims, too, will find their own bodies becoming unstable; regularly transmuting into strange forms and acquiring debilitating mutations, as well as having any gifts of slime mutations stripped away from them.\n\nJiyva's wrath lasts for a relatively short duration.}}\n\nUpon abandonment, all slimes will immediately turn hostile, and Jiyva will occasionally punish you with one of the following forms of [[divine retribution]]:\n\n*You receive a few [[bad mutation]]s. These mutations bypass all forms of mutation resistance except for [[Zin]]'s protection.\n*[[Polymorph]]s you into a [[Bat Form|bat]], [[Fungus Form|fungus]], [[Pig Form|pig]], [[Tree Form|tree]], or [[Wisp Form|wisp]].\n*Floods you with [[Glow|mutagenic radiation]].\n*Sends a number of [[durably summoned]] high level slimes and eyeballs to attack you.\n\n==Strategy==\nJiyva is best suited for characters that can play fast and loose, whenever from innate strength or boosted regeneration. Everything Jiyva offers will support that playstyle, from saving more items to spamming Slimify and Oozemancy. Both offensive abilities allow you to take on much more than your character can chew -- Slimify is a one-hit kill on almost everything in the game. Piety is gained rapidly, and hoarding 6* of piety serves no use, so use those abilities while you can.\n\nAlong with some extremely strong regeneration, it may seem like the slime god is best suited for the early game. However, altars to Jiyva will rarely appear in the Dungeon, and while common in the Lair, aren't guaranteed, either. Even then, early worship means losing out on a variety of items. Meanwhile, high level PCs tend to acquire two things: lots of bad mutations, and lots of items. Jiyva gives many chances to clear bad mutations (and gain new, positive ones), and losing a [[scroll of blinking]] when you have five is much more manageable than if you don't have any at all.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*If Jiyva does not spawn in the [[Temple]], you can start by worshipping [[Elyvilon]], [[The Shining One]] or [[Ignis]]. Since Jiyva is chaotic, but not evil, you will not face retribution for converting from the former two.\n*Although you can (and will) freely mutate and eventually filter out the bad ones, don't expect to become a superhero. Jiyva will change your mutations unpredictably, and you may get [[horns]], [[antennae]], a [[beak]], [[claws]], [[talons]], or [[hooves]] which may restrict your choice of armour. If you're a race who ignores most equipment slots (e.g. [[ogre]], [[troll]], [[felid]], [[octopode]]), these are very welcome.\n*Eye monsters summoned by [[Mnoleg]] or [[Pan lord]]s will be neutral.\n*High rates of magic regeneration and the allure of mutations such as [[Wild Magic (mutation)|Wild Magic]] may make Jiyva tempting for spellcasting characters. However, many offensive spells with a large area of effect, such as [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]], [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]] or [[Chain Lightning]], among others, risk enraging Jiyva due to slain jellies caught in collateral damage. Magic-focused characters wishing to worship Jiyva should favour more subtle types of spells, such as those offered by [[Summonings]], [[Hexes]], [[Translocations]], [[Necromancy]] or [[Transmutations]]. [[Ignition]] is also a good choice, as one of the rare mass destruction spells that will always spare allies.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], Jiyva gave penance for attacking slimes instead of preventing you from harming them. Also, Jiyva could pacify slime-shaped [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifters]].\n*Prior to [[0.31]], monsters hit with Slimify were not fully healed.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], jellies could eat [[evocable|miscellaneous evocables]] (as they were not once-per-game at the time).\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the Jiyva altar at the front of Slime had an approximate 50% of appearing (based on [[vault]] weightings) rather than 66% (for any of the vaults).\n*In [[0.28]], Jiyva was overhauled. Prior to this version:\n**Jiyva worshippers gained piety by having jellies eat items, which recovered HP and MP (instead of a flat regeneration buff). These jellies could be summoned at 1* of piety.\n**Jiyva gifted mutations more often, but not in bursts. Net mutations/time remained similar, though the logic meant that high level muts were far less common.\n**Slimify cost 8-12 piety, and Oozemancy was not implemented.\n**Passive rCorr was unlocked at 3*, and slime spawning at 6*. \n**Jiyva could cure bad mutations as an invocable action, instead of favouring the removal of bad mutations with gifts.\n**Jiyva could shuffle your [[attributes]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Slimify produced [[death ooze]]s when affecting the [[undead]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Jiyva's slimes would [[food|feed]] you when eating items.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], Jiyva's Slimify ability didn't work properly on derived undead, and Torment damage would not trigger the slime-spawning ability.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Jiyva's jelly prayer paralysis was removed. Additionally, the Slime Pits were found on Lair:6-8 before the branch was shortened.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Jiyva's abilities were based off of your [[Invocations]] skill.\n\n{{gods}}\n[[Category:Chaotic Gods]]"}

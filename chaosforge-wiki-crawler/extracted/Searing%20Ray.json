Once fired, the caster gains a '''Ray''' [[status effect|status]]. For 3 turns, every turn ''[[wait]]ed'' (with '''s''' or '''.''') will fire another searing ray, which costs only 1 [[MP]]. Thus a \"full cast\" is 5 MP. Channeled rays will target the monster you targeted; if the target is invalid, or if you aimed at the ground (with '''f .'''), it will travel across the last beam path.\n\nBeing moved by any effect (an [[elephant]]'s trampling attack, the [[Primal Wave]] spell, an unintentional [[blink]], etc.) ends the channel, as does [[Silence]]. [[Paralysis]], [[confusion]], [[sleep]], and full [[petrification]] will pause channeling.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]]. Searing Ray dealt <code>3d(3+Power/12)</code> damage.\n*Autofight with this spell became smarter in [[0.27]].\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Searing Ray grew more powerful with each additional ray, and only the last one was [[penetration|penetrating]]. The spell was unable to follow a specific target, and would always follow the same path.\n*Searing Ray was added in [[0.13]]."}

{"title":"Hill Orc","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hill_Orc","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n''This page is about the player [[species]]. For the monster, see [[Orc]].''\n{{flavour|Hill Orcs are Orcs from the upper world who, jealous of the riches which their cousins (the Cave Orcs) possess below the ground, descend in search of plunder and adventure.\n\nHill Orcs are more robust than Humans. Their forte is brute-force fighting, and they are skilled at using most hand weapons (particularly axes, with which they are experts), though they are not particularly good at using missile weapons. Hill Orcs are passable users of most types of magic and are particularly skilled with Fire.\n\nMany Orcs feel superior to all other species and beings, and they have formed a religion around that idea. Only Orcs can worship Beogh, the Orc god. They can join Beogh even without an altar whenever an orc priest is in sight.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*Hill Orcs are the only species capable of worshipping [[Beogh]]. Hill Orcs that can see a conscious [[orc priest]] or [[orc high priest]] are offered the chance to convert to Beogh on the spot.\n\nHill Orcs have a base [[Strength]] of 10, [[Intelligence]] of 8 and [[Dexterity]] of 6 (before Background modifiers) and have normal base [[magic points]].\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Warriors:''' [[Fighter]], [[Monk]]\n*'''Zealots:''' [[Berserker]], [[Abyssal Knight]], [[Cinder Acolyte]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Fire Elementalist]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[strength]] every 5th level.\n*10% more [[hit points]] than average.\n*+3 [[willpower]] per level.\n\n==Starting Skills and Equipment==\nHill Orcs receive all the skills and equipment listed for their background.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Beginner}}\n\nHill Orcs are easy to play, due to their high HP and good aptitudes for melee skills. They have excellent skill in [[Invocations]], making them better at using certain [[god]]s' abilities. Also, Hill Orcs are alright at magic, with decent aptitudes in a variety of spell schools.\n\n===Compared to Minotaur===\nMelee Hill Orcs are very similar to [[Minotaur]]s. Their differences are listed below:\n*Minotaurs deal somewhat more damage in combat, due to having [[Horns]]. This can make a difference, especially in the early Dungeon.\n*Minotaurs have better defensive aptitudes ([[Armour]], [[Dodging]], [[Shields]]). Hill Orcs are better at Invocations.\n*Minotaurs are worse at Axes, but better at other weapon skills.\n*Minotaurs are terrible at all magic schools.\n\nOverall, the differences are slight. For a \"pure\" melee build, Minotaur edges out. But they are both strong species; games are rarely lost because you picked one over the other. (It's worth noting that [[Trog]], one of the most popular 'melee gods', doesn't rely on the Invocations skill at all.)\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Hill Orc}}\n\n==History==\n*Hill orcs were removed in [[0.32]]. In their place, [[Mountain Dwarf|Mountain Dwarves]] were reinstated as a playable species, and [[Beogh]] was made available to worship for all species.\n*Prior to the changes to [[ration]]s in [[0.21]], Hill Orcs would always start with [[meat ration]]s instead of [[bread ration]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Hill Orcs had the innate [[Saprovore|Saprovore 1]] mutation.\n*In [[0.10]], Hill Orcs received several aptitude changes to accommodate the removal of [[Mountain Dwarves]]. It is this version where they gained the +3 Invocations aptitude (+2 before the global Invocations buff was removed), a positive Fire Magic aptitude, and marginally better spellcasting stats.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], Hill Orcs received only +2 [[MR]] per level.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], Hill Orcs received +3 [[magic resistance]] points per level.\n\n{{species}}"}

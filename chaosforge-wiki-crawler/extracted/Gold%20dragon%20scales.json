It is much heavier than most dragon scale armours, and grants its wearer resistance to poison, fire and cold.}}\n\n'''Gold dragon scales''' are one of the heaviest body armours in the game, tied with [[crystal plate armour]]. While these scales offer less AC than crystal plate, it offers a resistance to [[fire]], [[cold]], and [[poison]]. Since the [[encumbrance]] is so high, casting, dodging, and stealth are very difficult.\n\nThis item has a 33% chance to generate when you slay a [[golden dragon]]. The [[unique]] troll [[Parghit]] always wears a highly enchanted set of gold dragon scales.\n\n==Desirability==\nWith 3 resistances and excellent AC, a set of gold dragon scales is a strong choice for any high-[[strength]] melee brute. However, the chances of finding one before [[Depths]] or [[Zot]] are very low. You can get +10 [[plate armour]] or so well before then, which will generally outperform a +0 GDS. You could wait to enchant your gear, but the time spent waiting for GDS is time that your [[scrolls of enchant armour]] are doing nothing.\n\nIf you do get one in a timely manner, though, it's very good for heavy melee characters. Parghit's scales, for instance, are often well worth using. Dodgers, casters, and ranged weapon users will find these too heavy to effectively use, at least for a 3 rune game.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|this item will be called '''golden dragon scales'''.}}\n*Prior to [[0.19]], this armour was named golden dragon armour and was crafted by using a [[scroll of enchant armour]] on a [[gold dragon hide]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], this armour's encumbrance rating was 25.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], this armour's encumbrance rating was [[27]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

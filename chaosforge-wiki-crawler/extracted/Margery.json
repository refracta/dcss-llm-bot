{"title":"Margery","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Margery","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Margery the Dragonslayer''' is a [[unique]] [[fire elementalist]], usually accompanied by a few [[hell knight]]s, a [[hellephant]] or [[searing wretch]], and a [[deep elf high priest]] or a [[deep elf death mage]]. She wears a suit of [[fire dragon scales|fire]], [[shadow dragon scales|shadow]], or [[storm dragon scales]].\n\n[[Maggie]] is another unique who is a younger version of Margery. Margery and Maggie are mutually exclusive; if one appears in a game, the other will not.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Depths]]:3-4\n*[[The Vaults]]:2-5\n*[[The Crypt]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*As both Margery and her associates will be pelting you with [[Fire Magic]] as long as you're in sight, [[fire resistance]] is a must. Her Fireballs can brutalize the unprepared.\n*If you're capable of dealing [[cold]] damage, use it on her. She never has cold resistance, and sometimes her armour makes her vulnerable to it.\n*If you encounter hell knights in either the Depths, the Vaults, or the Crypt, there's a very good chance that Margery is close by, especially if you also see a hellephant, a searing wretch, and/or a deep elf high priest or death mage. Separate individuals from the pack as best you can, and escape if it seems like you'll have to tackle them all at once.\n*Be sure to examine the equipment of Margery's pack. Hell knights often carry excellent weaponry, and Margery herself has a small chance of generating holding a somewhat pre-enchanted [[Wyrmbane]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Margery was only accompanied by hell knights, and there were two more hell knights in her band.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], she could spawn with [[acid dragon scales|acid]] or [[swamp dragon scales]], rather than shadow or storm. She also did not have a chance of spawning with Wyrmbane.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], she did not generate with dragon armour.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

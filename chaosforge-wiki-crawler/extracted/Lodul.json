{"title":"Lodul","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lodul","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}{{list of|ogres}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Lodul the Thundrous''' is a [[unique]] [[ogre (monster)|ogre]] with the same [[Call Down Lightning]] of an [[ironbound thunderhulk]], albeit not as strong. He spawns with a pack of [[ogre]]s and a fair sum of [[gold]].\n\n==Location==\n*[[Dungeon]]: 10-14\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*See [[ironbound thunderhulk]], except that he lacks [[blink]], making it easier to get up past his effective range.\n*You aren't likely to have a source of antimagic at this point in the game, and both [[Silence]] and the [[phial of floods]] don't work against mechanical magic. A [[potion of resistance]] at least can lower the damage.\n*His [[willpower]] matches that of a [[two-headed ogre]]. A [[wand of polymorph]] most likely will create a non-threatening monster with his 6 HD.\n\n==History==\n*Lodul was introduced in [[0.29]]."}

{"title":"Bloated husk","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bloated_husk","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Bloated husks''' are decaying gas-filled corpses that float surprisingly quickly through the waters of [[the Swamp]]. When destroyed, or when they get close enough, they will explode noisily in a 2-tile radius for 8d8 damage.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Taking them out with ranged attacks or [[spell]]s is obviously recommended to avoid their explosion.\n**[[Javelin]]s or a [[wand of acid]] are particularly effective, even at low skill. With the right arrangement, you can explode other monsters instead of yourself!\n**Be aware that unlike most other [[lurking horror|self]]-[[creeping inferno|destructing]] [[ballistomycete spore|foes]], bloated husks can actually take some damage before going down.\n*Husks aren't particularly dangerous on their own, and high-bulk characters have even less to fear. However, beware of the loud [[noise]] attracting other monsters!\n\n==History==\nBloated husks were added in [[0.26]]."}

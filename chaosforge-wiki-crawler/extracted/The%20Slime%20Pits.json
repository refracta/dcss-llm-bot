{"title":"The Slime Pits","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/The_Slime_Pits","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|The Slime Pits are the amorphous realm of acids, jellies and slimes. Even the walls drip with painful acid. Any trace of intelligent beings has long been dissolved. Still, there are rumours of great treasures deep down, hidden safely away in secret chambers without any entrance.\n\nThis branch is unnaturally silent: sounds travel farther here.\n\nThe entrance to this branch can be found between levels 4 and 5 of the Lair of Beasts.\n\nThis branch is 5 levels deep.\n\nThis branch contains the slimy rune of Zot.}}\n\n[[File:Slime entry.png]]'''The Slime Pits''' are a 5-floor [[branch]] full of amorphous horrors. Most of this branch consists of nothing but ooze, but the final floor has a guaranteed treasure [[vault]] and the slimy [[rune of Zot]]. To retrieve the treasures, you must defeat their [[the Royal Jelly|boss]].\n\nStairs to the Slime Pits can be found between [[the Lair]]: 4-5. While the entrance is found in the Lair, it is much more dangerous than the 2 other branches that can be found there ([[Swamp]], [[Shoals]], [[Snake Pit]] or [[Spider's Nest]]), and should be attempted later in the game.\n\n==Layout==\nSuperficially, the layout of the Slime Pits resembles the [[Orcish Mines]]: each floor is either a single large irregular chamber or several smaller chambers connected only by [[stairs]]. Like the Orcish Mines, you can use a [[wand of digging]] to connect separate chambers together, easing travel. Outside of Slime:5, no items generate here.\n\nThe Slime Pits are filled with [[Wall#Slime Covered Rock|slime covered rock]], which inflict the [[corrosion]] status on adjacent players. This wears off the moment you move away from the walls.\n\n===Slime:5===\nSlime:5 is made out of one out of various [[vault]]s. The original vault is a singular, central chamber, but there is a small variety of posisble layouts. \n\nThis floor always contains the boss of the Slime Pits, [[the Royal Jelly]]. Killing it will open up the translucent walls of the treasure vaults, allowing you to go inside. The walls will also disappear if you worship [[Jiyva]] and reach 6* piety - though, when worshipping Jiyva, the slimes will eat a huge portion of the loot. ([[Haste]], [[Apportation]], [[Swiftness]], etc. are recommended.)\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe branch is home to high level jelly monsters - these are fast and can inflict immense damage. [[Acid blob]]s rapidly corrode you. [[Azure jellies]] have strong cold attacks. [[Quicksilver ooze]]s have [[antimagic]] attacks and can [[engulf]] you, and [[rockslime]]s can [[trample]] you. You'll also find [[shining eye]]s that induce numerous [[bad mutations]]. You'll also find masses of [[slime creature]]s, weak alone, but they come in large groups, and among the stronger jellies.\n\nThe wide open floors and caustic walls make it impossible to effectively bottleneck opponents. Expect to be swarmed by all sorts of jellies, especially if you rush in too quickly. [[Stair dancing]] is a strong tactic.\n\nMost jellies resist [[poison]], [[acid]], and nothing else - the major exceptions are [[rockslime]]s (who resist fire and electricity). Also, jellies have poor [[AC]] and [[EV]]. Low-accuracy, high-damage spells like [[Iron Shot]] or [[Starburst]] are quite effective. Note that [[Shatter]] doesn't do much against slimes (except for rockslimes).\n\n==Strategy==\n''See also: [[The Royal Jelly#Strategy|The Royal Jelly]]''\n\nSlime is significantly more difficult than the other Lair branches, so unless you're doing a [[speedrun]], there's little reason to go in right away. You have the liberty to explore other branches (such as [[the Vaults]]:1-4) before entering. This branch is often done as the [[rune lock|3rd rune]], though it can also be done purely for the loot on Slime:5.\n\nRegardless of anything, it is recommended to have some way of defeating the Royal Jelly before attempting this branch - see [[the Royal Jelly#Strategy|the Royal Jelly]] for more info. You'll also want a few resistances (see below).\n\n===Useful Traits===\nIt's much safer to explore here after acquiring:\n*[[Corrosion resistance]] ([[ring of resist corrosion]], [[acid dragon scales]], etc.)\n*High [[willpower]], to prevent getting [[confused]] by [[golden eye]]s and [[great orbs of eyes]].\n*[[Cold]] resistance, for azure jellies.\n\n==Monsters==\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Golden eye}} || {{monsterlink|Shining eye}} || {{monsterlink|Eye of devastation}} || {{monsterlink|Glass eye}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Glowing orange brain}} || {{monsterlink|Great orb of eyes}} || {{monsterlink|Jelly}} || {{monsterlink|Slime creature}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Quicksilver ooze}} || {{monsterlink|Azure jelly}} || {{monsterlink|Acid blob}} || {{monsterlink|Rockslime}}\n|}\n\n===Uniques===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Dissolution}}\n| {{monsterlink|Donald}}\n| {{monsterlink|The Royal Jelly}}\n|}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], new Slime:5 [[vaults|layouts]] were introduced. Many don't have the corridors of the original Slime:5 vault, making certain strategies against [[the Royal Jelly]] more difficult.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the slime covered walls would inflict acid damage, rather than just corroding you.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], you could find [[death ooze]]s and [[eyes of draining]], instead of [[rockslime]]s and [[quicksilver ooze]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the Slime Pits had six floors. Some jelly creatures were capable of eating items on the floor. Also, killing the Royal Jelly turned walls into translucent rock, so the player needed some way to get in.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], there were an amulet of resist mutation, and an amulet of resist corrosion that were both useful for exploring Slime Pits. The later was changed into a ring.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Slime:6 prevented [[Teleport control]].\n*In [[0.13]], [[spiny worm]]s could be found here. They were removed in [[0.14]].\n*Prior to [[0.7]], the walls of the Slime Pits did not inflict acid damage.\n\n{{branches}}"}

{"title":"Ballistomycete","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ballistomycete","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nA [[ballistomycete]] is a plant-type monster, capable of spawning explosive [[ballistomycete spore]]s. These spores home in on nearby enemies.\n\nThey don't generate anywhere in the Dungeon, though [[Fedhas]] worshippers can summon them with the Grow Ballistomycete ability.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Confusion is a very strong effect: it prevents spellcasting, allows [[stab]]s, and greatly lowers melee [[to-hit]]. A ballistomycete colony or two can take out most early game threats on its own, and help take out later ones. \n*Spores aren't mindful of what they hit. Don't be next to a spore when it explodes, or you'll take a huge chunk of damage and be confused. You can't '''[[t]]'''ell the spores to do anything, so don't bother.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.24]], ballistomycetes could reproduce via [[ballistomycete spore]]s. Followers of [[Fedhas Madash]] could upgrade ballistomycetes to hyperactive ballistomycetes using the Evolution ablility. Hyperactive ballistomycetes would repeatedly cause explosions of spores before eventually dying, leaving more ballistomycetes in their wake.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], ballistomycete colonies could spawn naturally in the Dungeon, instead of being exclusive to followers of Fedhas.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], destroying a colony of ballistomycetes would give you about 500 experience."}

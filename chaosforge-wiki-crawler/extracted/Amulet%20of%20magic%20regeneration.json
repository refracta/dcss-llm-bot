In order to function, it must first attune itself to the wearer's body with full reserves of magic.}}\n\nAn '''amulet of magic regeneration''' increases its wearer's [[MP]] regeneration rate by a flat +0.4 MP/turn. This amulet has no effect until worn with full MP, at which point it will \"attune\" itself to you until removed.\n\n==Strategy==\nAn amulet of magic regeneration is quite welcome for casters, especially those without a source of extra MP. The amulet makes it less likely for you to run out of MP during combat, allowing you to fight longer. \n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*If you have [[spirit shield]] from a non-amulet source, having this amulet can help. An [[amulet of regeneration]] is better for defense, though.\n*For turn-count [[speedrun]]s and [[high score]] runs that rely on spells, MP regen is often the best amulet to use.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], this amulet gave only +0.25 MP/turn.\n*The amulet of magic regeneration was added in [[0.18]]. This amulet was useless for followers of [[Pakellas]], who don't regenerate MP.\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

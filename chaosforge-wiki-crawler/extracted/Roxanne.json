{"title":"Roxanne","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Roxanne","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Roxanne, Geomancer Emeritus''' is a [[unique]] [[statue]] who casts powerful [[Earth Magic]] and uses an irresistible [[blink]] spell to keep you within her attack range. In addition, she resists all elements and has a fair amount of [[AC]]. She's harmless from a distance, though, and her spells can be affected by [[Silence]] and [[antimagic]].\n\nShe always carries a (possibly [[randart]]) [[granite talisman]].\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:14-15\n*The [[Elven Halls]]\n*[[The Swamp]]\n*[[The Snake Pit]]\n*[[The Shoals]]\n*The [[Spider's Nest]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The furthest she can attack is range 4. As long as you're at least 5 spaces away, you're safe until Blink Other Close pulls you in. Therefore, you can wear her down with irresistible long range attacks, like [[Ranged Weapons]], [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]], or [[Orb of Destruction]].\n**A [[potion of lignification]] makes you immune to blink. So you can stay at edge of [[LOS]], enter Tree Form, then wear her down with ranged attacks. Note that it might take multiple potions to beat her. [[Formicid]]s are naturally immune to blink, due to their [[stasis]], so don't need Tree Form. -Tele [[artefact]]s are another way to prevent Blink Other Close.\n*If you do get affected by her Blink Other Close spell, '''''don't panic'''''. Attempting to flee on foot is very likely to fail. To retreat safely, read a [[scroll of fog]] to block her [[line of sight]] long enough for you to escape, or simply [[blink]] or [[teleport]] away if that's not an option.\n*[[Silence]] will completely disable her spellcasting, making her harmless so long as the silence lasts. If you're a melee fighter, you can use a scroll of silence, then use [[might]] and/or [[haste]] to make sure she dies before it runs out.\n*Other things that are good against Roxanne include:\n**Swarming her with [[summon]]s or other [[allies]]. Blink Other Close only affects one target, so having summons makes it much less likely for you to get pulled in. [[Mana viper]]s are especially effective.\n**She can't see [[invisible]], so that's a good way to reduce damage. [[Repulsion]] works against all of her attack spells. [[Reflection]] is by no means reliable, but it can make killing her faster.\n**One of the few elements she is not resistant to is [[acid]]. A [[wand of acid]] can seriously lower AC while dealing good damage.\n*Last but not least, remember that you don't have to kill everything right away. This is true of any dangerous monster, but especially true of a stationary one. Don't be afraid to run away; she'll be there when you come back, if you even feel that killing her later is necessary.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Roxanne would drop a [[spellbook]] with the [[Statue Form]] spell (and other Earth spells) instead of a granite talisman.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Roxanne and other [[statue]]s couldn't regenerate [[HP]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], Roxanne's Blink Other Close spell could be blocked by your [[magic resistance]].\n*Roxanne was added in [[0.5]]."}

{"title":"Arc Blade","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Arc_Blade","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|A blade somehow crafted from pure electricity. It arcs wildly between the wielder and their foes as it strikes.\n\nIt occasionally unleashes powerful arcs of lightning upon striking a foe. These may arc to other adjacent creatures (including the wielder, but dealing reduced damage to them) before grounding out.}}\n\n[[File:Arc_blade.png]] '''''the +8 arc blade'''''\n\n+8 [[rapier]]<br>\n33.3% chance: Casts [[Static Discharge]] at <code>99 + 2d(100)/2</code> [[spellpower]], average 150.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-func.h|988}}</ref> (Average damage <code>1 + 1d15.5</code>, or 9.25, per proc)<br>\n{{Electricity resistance}}\n\n==Desirability==\nAgainst single targets, the '''arc blade'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|1346}}</ref> has roughly the same damage as a normal rapier of [[electrocution]] (slightly weaker), making it a good weapon in its own right. Compared to a normal weapon of electrocution, Static Discharge will damage creatures adjacent to the target, making it particularly effective against groups.\n*When in a hallway, Static Discharge can hit multiple enemies at once.\n*When fighting multiple adjacent enemies, Static Discharge will create a separate 'arc' for each enemy. For example, when you're adjacent to two enemies, each enemy has a chance to be hit twice per Static Discharge.\nUnfortunately, the discharges can hit you, dealing slight damage (greatly reduced by the rElec the blade provides). Also, since the arc blade deals electric damage, you may want a different weapon against those resistant/immune to electricity.\n\nThe arc blade has an anti-synergy with most [[allies]], as they are not exempt from the discharges. The game will prompt you whenever an ally could be hit.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Static Discharge was stronger (the arc blade dealt <code>2 + 1d21.75</code> per proc).\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Static Discharge was slightly stronger on cast (the arc blade dealt <code>2 + 1d(22.5)</code> per proc), but the arcs would reduce in power.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], the arc blade would cast Static Discharge multiple times, but at much lower spellpower, <code>75 + 2d(75)/2</code>. The weapon's enchantment was +4.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], it was a [[cutlass]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], it was a +3, +5 weapon.\n*The arc blade was introduced in [[0.14]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[category:unrands]]\n[[category:short blades]]"}

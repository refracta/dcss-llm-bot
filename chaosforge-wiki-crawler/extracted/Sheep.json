Dungeon sheep are nevertheless far more murderous than their surface brethren. It looks quite flammable.}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nA step below the common [[yak]], '''sheep''' are pack monsters that don't hit too hard and are about as tough as an [[iguana]]. They should not be remotely threatening when you first encounter them (usually in [[the Lair]]) unless you're already injured.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Sticky Flame]] cast on one sheep will spread to adjacent sheep. Hilarity ensues.\n\n===Variant sheep===\n[[File:Black sheep.png]] Very occasionally, you may find a '''black sheep''' among a herd of its normal-colored fellows. Other than its colour, it is no different from ordinary sheep.\n\n{{flavour|On first glace, this sheep has merely a different pigmentation, but you are not so easily swayed by looks. With your luck, there's a sheep in a wolf's hide hiding inside, _then_ covered by another layer of sheep skin to better decieve you.\n\nOr, maybe, it's just a sheep after all.}}\n\n==History==\n*Sheep were replaced with [[dream sheep]] in [[0.19]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], sheep would occasionally leave [[animal skin]]s behind when butchered.\n*Sheep fires were added in [[0.8]]."}

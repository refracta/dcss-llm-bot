{"title":"Nergalle","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Nergalle","type":"raw","data":"{{version|025}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Nergalle the Soulbinder''' is a [[unique]] [[orc]] [[necromancer]]. Although capable of inflicting [[negative energy]] damage and [[draining]] you, her biggest threat lies in the [[spectral orc]]s she constantly summons and [[haste]]s.\n\nIf you are a worshiper of [[Beogh]], it is possible to convert Nergalle to your cause.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:10-12\n*[[The Lair]]:1-4\n*The [[Orcish Mines]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The threat level of her spectral orcs varies tremendously based on what gets summoned; a spectral [[orc warrior]] may not be too threatening, but a spectral [[orc warlord]] can be devastating. It may be a hassle, but examine her summons to know just how afraid you should be.\n*Nergalle is actually one of the better orc allies you can acquire through Beogh. She has a decent direct damage spell, regularly surrounds enemies with powerful summoned allies, and hastes your other allies. Try not to let her die.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Nergalle will get [[Vanquished Vanguard]] instead of Summon Spectral Orcs.}}\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Nergalle could cast [[Death's Door]], rendering her incapable of dying for several turns.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Nergalle could not appear in [[the Lair]].\n*Prior to [[0.8]], she could not summon spectral orcs and simply pelted you with spells.\n\n[[Category:Orc]]"}

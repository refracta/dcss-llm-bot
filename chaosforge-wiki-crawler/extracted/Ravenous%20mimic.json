They have significantly greater durability and damage output than their punier counterparts, especially as their attacks [[constrict]] and [[poison]] you, keeping you in place and dealing damage over time. Fortunately, they still can't compete with any high-level character, and are only a real threat to pure casters with low defense. They are only found in the later portions of the game.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Heavy melee characters should be able to just plow through them, especially if they have poison resistance.\n*Item mimics are slower than most characters, making [[kite|kiting]] them possible for the squishier spellcasters. Unfortunately, this does not apply to feature mimics.\n*[[Blink]]ing or [[teleport]]ing away can help you escape constriction if you're in a jam.\n\n==History==\nRavenous mimics were added in [[0.11]], and removed in [[0.16]]."}

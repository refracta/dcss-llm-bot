They come in a wide variety of flavors, each of which has its own unique powers that are unaffected by [[Silence]]. They can be found in the mad wizard's laboratory [[vault]], which is occasionally located in the deeper sections of [[the Dungeon]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: left\"\n!

As soon as you open the door to the room in the back, expect a flood of Mephitic Cloud spells to hit you and all the rats present, as well as several shifting rats to blink past you. With some good area of effect spells, you can clear the room very quickly. Just make sure to have poison resistance or [[clarity]] to avoid an embarrassing, confused death.\n\nBe sure to kill the mutated rats from range, as they have the mutation-branded attack of [[Mnoleg]] and [[pulsating lump]]s, as opposed to the ranged spell of [[neqoxec]]s and [[cacodemon]]s.\n\n==History==\nLaboratory rats were removed in [[0.13]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete_monsters]]"}

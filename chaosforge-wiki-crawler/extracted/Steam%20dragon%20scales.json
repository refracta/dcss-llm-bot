Unlike the scales of some larger dragons, it does not provide its wearer with much protection (beyond a resistance to scalding steam), but it is extremely light and supple.}}\n\n'''Steam dragon scales''' are the lightest of the dragon scale armours, having an encumbrance rating of 0 (the same as a [[robe]]). They also provide rSteam.\n\nThis item has a 33% chance to generate when you slay a [[steam dragon]].\n\n==Desirability==\nA direct upgrade over plain [[robe]]s, [[leather armour]], and [[ring mail]]. With 0 encumbrance, they can be appealing to casters and [[ranged weapon]] users.\n\nHowever, most characters will prefer a slightly heavier armour, such as [[troll leather armour]], [[acid dragon scales]], or [[swamp dragon scales]]. These armours provide better protection for a negligible increase to encumbrance. Even the lowest strength characters, such as [[Deep Elf]] and [[Spriggan]] casters, may want to upgrade. Note, however, that [[steam dragon]]s are found earlier than [[troll]]s and the [[acid dragon scales|other]] [[swamp dragon scales|dragons]].\n\nNote that steam resistance is virtually useless, since steam damage is so rare. There are only 2 common enemies (steam dragons, [[merfolk aquamancer]]s) who deal steam damage. [[Fire resistance]] provides innate steam resistance, anyway.\n\n==History==\n* Steam dragon armour was renamed to steam dragon scales in [[0.19]], which also removed [[steam dragon hide]]s.\n* Prior to version [[0.10]], Steam dragon armour had 4 base AC instead of 5.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Steam dragon scales''' || [[File:Steam dragon armour.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Body armour]]\n[[Category:Dragon scales]]"}

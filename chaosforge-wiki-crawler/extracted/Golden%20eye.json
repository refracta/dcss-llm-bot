{"title":"Golden eye","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Golden_eye","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{list of | eyeballs}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Golden eyes''' are fast, constantly-blinking pack enemies that do no damage, but try to [[confusion|confuse]] you with their gaze if they can overcome your [[willpower]]. They can be found in [[the Slime Pits]], [[Abyss]], and can be summoned by a few enemies through the [[Summon Eyeballs]] spell.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Having at least Will+++ or [[clarity]] will render them harmless.\n*[[Wand of iceblast|Wands of iceblast]] and [[Fireball]] are excellent for bypassing their annoying [[EV]] at range, but mind the [[noise]].\n*[[Airstrike]] will usually one-shot them, given their low HP, lack of AC, and flight.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.18]], golden eyes couldn't [[see invisible]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], they were immune to magic."}

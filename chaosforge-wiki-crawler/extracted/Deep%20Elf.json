{"title":"Deep Elf","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Deep_Elf","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n''This page deals with the player race; for those deep elves met as monsters, see [[List of deep elves]].''\n{{flavour|The Deep Elves are a species of Elves who long ago fled the overworld to live in darkness underground. There, they developed their mental powers, evolving a natural gift for all forms of magic, and adapted physically to their new environment, becoming weaker and losing all colouration. They are poor at melee combat and physical defense, although they are capable at using bows in ranged combat.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*'''[[Mana Regeneration]]:''' Deep Elves have double the normal mana regeneration rate.\nDeep Elves have a base [[Strength]] of 5, [[Intelligence]] of 12 and [[Dexterity]] of 10 (before Background modifiers). They have two extra base [[magic points]].\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Mages:''' [[Hedge Wizard]], [[Conjurer]], [[Summoner]], [[Necromancer]], [[Fire Elementalist]], [[Ice Elementalist]], [[Air Elementalist]], [[Earth Elementalist]], [[Alchemist]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[intelligence]] every 4th level.\n*20% less [[hit points]] than average.\n*+4 [[willpower]] per level.\n\n==Starting Equipment and Skills==\nDeep Elves receive all the skills and equipment listed for their background.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Easy}}\n\nDeep Elves are archetypical \"mage\" characters - great at all types of magic, but frail. Not complicated, but still moderately difficult to play. Being fragile isn't great in a permadeath game, since this can turn bad situations into perilous ones. So while their magic aptitude is strong in its own right, a prospective Deep Elf should remain vigilant.\n\nThey also have a great [[Ranged Weapons]] aptitude, the best in the game (tied with [[Kobold]]), which allows them to be decent [[Hunter]]s or [[Hexslinger]]s.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Deep Elf}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], Deep Elves did not have the [[Mana Regeneration]] mutation, and their [[Air Magic]] aptitude was +0.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Deep Elves' [[Bows]] aptitude was only +1.\n\n{{species}}\n\n[[Category:Elf]]"}

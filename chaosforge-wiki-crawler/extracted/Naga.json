{"title":"Naga","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Naga","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''This article covers the player [[species]]. For the monster, see [[Naga (monster)]]. For a list of all monstrous nagas, see [[List of nagas]].''\n{{flavour|Nagas are a hybrid species: Human from the waist up with a large snake tail instead of legs.\n\nThey are reasonably good at most things and advance in experience levels slightly slower than Humans. They are naturally resistant to poisons, can see invisible creatures, and have tough skin, but their tails are relatively slow and cannot move them around as quickly as can other creatures' legs (this only affects their movement rate; all other actions are at normal speed). Like Armataurs, their body shape also prevents them from gaining full protection from body armour. A Naga's biggest forte is stealth: Nagas are very good at moving unnoticed. Their tails eventually grow strong enough to constrict their foes in combat.\n\nNagas can spit poison; the accuracy and damage of this poison increases with the Naga's experience level.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*Nagas are hybrid creatures, with a snake-like lower body but medium torso:\n**'''[[Bad mutations#Deformed|Deformed]]''': Nagas gain only half the base AC from [[body armour]].\n**Nagas get an [[EV]] and [[Dodging]] penalty, due to their size.\n**Nagas can equip [[barding]]s, but cannot wear [[boots]].\n**Nagas are large enough to move and attack normally while standing in [[shallow water]].\n*A Naga's serpentine skin is tough (Nagas gain additional [[AC]] as they grow).\n*'''[[Spit Poison]]''': Nagas can spit poison as an attack, with a cooldown.\n*'''[[Good mutations#Poison Resistance|Poison Resistance]]''': Nagas innately resist [[poison]].\n*'''[[Acute Vision]]''': Nagas can [[see invisible]].\n*'''[[Slow (mutation)|Slow 2]]''': Nagas move very slowly. They move 4 aut slower than average, taking a total of 1.4 turns per movement. (Equivalent to a monster at 71.4% speed.)\n\nNaga have a base [[Strength]] of 10, [[Intelligence]] of 8 and [[Dexterity]] of 6 (before Background modifiers). They have average base [[magic points]].\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Zealots:''' [[Berserker]]\n*'''Adventurers:''' [[Shapeshifter]]\n*'''Warrior-mages:''' [[Warper]], [[Enchanter]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Hedge Wizard]], [[Fire Elementalist]], [[Ice Elementalist]], [[Alchemist]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 to a random [[stat]] every 4th level.\n*20% more [[HP]] than average.\n*+5 [[willpower]] per level.\n*+1 [[AC]] every third level\n*Gain the ability to [[Constriction|constrict]] foes at level 13.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Hard}}\n\nNagas move slowly, which makes it impossible to escape most opponents by retreating. Also, being large (low EV) and deformed (AC penalty), they have poor defenses. Scales and [[barding]]s will eventually boost your AC, but these don't kick in until later in the game. To get by the early game, make the most of your Poison Spit and Stealth. Don't be afraid to burn consumables against any dangerous encounter.\n\nOnce a Naga survives long enough to come into their own, however, they acquire an excellent array of useful perks, including: high HP / good AC, auxiliary [[constriction]], and nice resistances (rPois, good willpower, see invisible). The slow movement speed will blight them the entire game, but survival becomes much less of a struggle.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Naga}}\n\n==Strategy==\nDespite their slow speed and large size, Nagas have a +5 Stealth aptitude, the highest in the game (outside of [[Gnoll]]s). Use it. Stealth is quite useful - if not required - in order to avoid fights with dangerous enemies like [[orc priest]]s or [[ogre]]s. \n\nThey can use Stealth offensively, but it's risky. It's not because they are spotted more often - each tile moved has the same detection chance, no matter how fast you move. It's because slow speed makes retreating (from a failed stab attempt) difficult. For many Nagas, high stealth is more of an avoidance tool than an offensive one.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*[[Serpent talisman|Serpent]], [[dragon-blood talisman|Dragon]], [[granite talisman|Statue]], and [[storm talisman|Storm]] forms will negate the Slow 2 mutation, causing nagas to move at normal speed. Remember that this comes with the same costs and benefits as the form itself, and that it takes 5 turns to shift into or out of a form.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Tasonir's Melee Naga Guide]] (0.18)\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Nagas were less encumbered by [[shield]]s, and moved slowly in shallow water, like the other [[Size#Large|large]] species.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Nagas had a -2 [[Shields]] aptitude. This was buffed due to the nerf to large-size shield wearing in 0.28.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Nagas had [[Slow Metabolism]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Nagas did not have innate slow metabolism, but slow movement caused less hunger per [[aut]] than normal-speed movement.\n*In [[0.12]], the global hidden [[Stealth (skill)|Stealth]] XP buff (80% XP cost) was removed; Nagas were the only species to not get their aptitude raised in compensation.\n*In [[0.10]] only, Nagas had Constriction from level 1. They also gained constriction this version.\n\n[[Category:Naga]]\n\n{{species}}"}

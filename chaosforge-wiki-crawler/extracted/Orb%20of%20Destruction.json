A smart and agile person may move out of its path, causing it to miss its target. It cannot be avoided by Dodging skill, and is able to make sharp turns to hit adjacent targets.}}\nCreates an Orb of Destruction in a specified direction. It occupies a tile on the dungeon and has 300% speed (move delay 3.33). Attacks do not have an effect on an orb, except for another OOD collision, which will disintegrate both of them. If both colliding orbs have traveled 2 or more tiles, it will create a damaging and massively loud 3x3 explosion. Orbs can collide even if they are travelling in the same direction.\n\nOrbs have a specified \"angle\" and \"position\", and are not limited to the 8 dungeon directions. The orb hits when it reaches the target's tile, irrespective of the 2 variables. When casting the spell, the angle will be offset by a random amount. This might make it hit dungeon walls and dissipate harmlessly, so this spell is not entirely accurate in a hallway. With higher spellpower, the orb will be offset by a smaller amount.\n\nOrbs will softly home towards a target (less than 45 degrees/tile). They will not turn sharply, except for a special rule. If you are adjacent to an OOD and move to another adjacent square, you'll trigger an \"en passant\" and the orb will trigger anyway.\n\nThe orb cannot be evaded by using [[EV]], but it can be [[SH|blocked]] or [[reflection|reflected]] with [[SH]]. Its damage output is also reduced by being too close:\n*Range 1: 30% damage\n*Range 2: 60%\n*Range 3: 90%\n*Range 4+: 100%\nCreatures killed by this spell are typically blown apart into gory chunks, although any [[list of dragons|dragon]] capable of leaving scales (which excludes [[troll (monster)|trolls]]) will not explode when it dies.\n\nOrbs are unable to pass through allies \"you can fire through\", such as [[Fedhas]] plants or [[Hepliaklqana]] ancestor; the orb will collide and deal no damage to them.\n\n===Monster Version===\nOrb of Destruction is similar between players and monsters. However, ''your'' orb will dissipate the turn after it leaves your [[line of sight]], but an enemy's orb will continue to move around until it hits something.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==Strategy==\nOrb of Destruction is a spell that can win you the game. It is a moderately powerful, irresistible attack spell that ignores EV. Against most enemies in the game, you can fire an OOD at range 7, retreat 1 tile, fire another OOD, then repeat until you kill them (or until they get too close). Monsters will never intentionally try to dodge the orbs.\n\nHowever, orbs are fiddly. It's unreliable in a corridor, and weak against adjacent enemies. In a tight hallway, you should use a different spell. [[Bombard]] combos well - it's a short range spell that works in corridors. Note that there's some redundancy between the two, as both spells fill a similar niche (irresistible attack spell). If you're low on [[spell level]]s, you may want to use one over the other. \n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n* Watch out when firing multiple orbs in a row, especially when [[haste]]d, due to orb collisions. When hasted, you should fire an orb, then back up (or wait a turn), then fire another orb.\n\n* Great spell for [[stair dancing]]. When going upstairs, the orb gets to move for 2.5 turns before you finish going up. You can fire an OOD at an enemy 4-5 tiles away, climb up, and it'll usually hit.\n\n* Each cast of OOD creates a trail of short-lived purple [[cloud]]s behind it. These are harmless, but can get in the way of any cloud spells you may wish to cast.\n\n* Orb of Destruction isn't terribly loud... unless two orbs collide. Should this occur, be prepared for a swarm of curious enemies making a bee-line for you. This is an excellent technique for attracting half a dungeon level, or a dangerous unique, to one area of the dungeon. \n\n* When launching an orb in wide hallways, situate yourself on the wall opposite from the one your target is nearest:\n    Example 1:                  Example 2:                         \n         ###########                 ###########\n         .@....M....                 ......M....\n         ...........                 .@.........\n         ###########                 ###########\n    Bad: Risks hitting wall.    Better: Much less risk.\n\n* Fast characters (namely [[spriggan]]s) can kill enemies from partially outside [[line of sight]] with this spell. The enemy needs to be in LOS the turn before it is hit. You also need LOS on the turn you cast in order to actually aim it, though you can fire blindly in a straight direction.\n\n* Try not to randomly [[blink]] once you've fired an orb; else the orb [[YASD|could hit you]] instead.\n\n==Defending Against IOODs==\n*Moving out of the way is the simplest way to avoid orbs of destruction, though the orbs' ability to home in on you makes this more difficult than it sounds. The orb's swerving means you can't just move diagonal once its adjacent to you. Walk perpendicular to the orb's path and start moving early, as you'll need some space to pull this off. In tight quarters without much empty space to maneuver in, ducking behind cover, such as around a corner or behind another monster, can also be effective.\n\n*[[Summon]]ed creatures, undead thralls, or [[wand of charming|temporary allies]] can take the hit for you. Switch positions with your minion before the orb hits. You can even create a [[Fulminant Prism]] and it'll block the hit.\n\n*[[Blink]]ing at the last possible moment has a decent chance of putting you out of the orb's current trajectory, and if there's a wall behind you, the orb will be destroyed. Controlled blinking with a [[scroll of blinking]] is significantly safer, but teleporting usually takes too long (unless it's via a teleport trap).\n\n*Firing your own orb at the caster will usually result in the orbs colliding and exploding violently. A bit expensive and dangerous in close quarters, but effective.\n\n*Characters with high [[SH]] will occasionally block orbs, negating them entirely. This isn't something to rely upon, but it's nice when it happens.\n\n*Being adjacent to the caster reduces the orb's damage tremendously.\n\n*Note that you can never run faster than the orb. It has move delay of 3.33; even a hasted spriggan has a move delay of 4. Your only options are to block it or get out of the way.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], enemy OODs were influenced by [[random energy]].\n*In [[0.28]], Orbs of Destruction were penalized more for short range. The power formula was also changed, making the spell a bit weaker.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], Orb of Destruction could destroy dungeon features like doors, statues, or rock walls.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Orb of Destruction was available in the [[Book of Annihilations]]."}

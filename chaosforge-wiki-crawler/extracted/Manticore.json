{"title":"Manticore","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Manticore","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Manticores''' are natural beasts that can fling volleys of spikes at you from afar, inflicting the [[Barbs]] status effect. When barbed, the act of moving deals damage. Although keeping a distance is easy, retreating from a manticore is painful. They can be found in the mid-[[Dungeon]], [[the Shoals]], or summoned by the [[Monstrous Menagerie]] spell.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Manticores hurt. Throw Barbs deals 2d13 damage plus the Barbs status, and manticores can do up to 50 damage in melee. Heavily armoured bruisers can generally take them toe-to-toe, but frailer characters should be more careful.\n*The Barbs status deals a minor amount of damage per turn moving. While running away may be painful, repositioning a tile or two can be worth it.\n**Barbs will wear off as you remain in your position, which includes time spent swinging weapons, casting spells, etc.\n*Manticores have lousy [[willpower]], so all sorts of [[Hexes]] and [[Evocations]] can work well. [[Confusion]] or [[paralysis]] will stop them from throwing barbs.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.15]], manticores didn't move as fast as the player, and had a finite number of spike volleys.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], manticores had lower HD and attack damage, and the spikes of a manticore didn't inflict the [[Barbs]] [[status effect]]. The player wasn't able to summon manticores with the [[Monstrous Menagerie]] spell."}

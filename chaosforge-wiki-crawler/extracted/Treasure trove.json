Sir Richard F. Burton, 1885. |\n\n[![Treasure trove portal.png](/images/5/5b/Treasure_trove_portal.png)](/File:Treasure_trove_portal.png) A **treasure trove** is a small [portal](/Portal \"Portal\"), filled with likely character relevant loot. A trove can spawn a single time almost anywhere, but it has a cost to be opened. Troves do not decay over time, but like many portals, can only be entered once before being sealed forever.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Useful Info](#Useful_Info)\n\n  - [1.1 Cost](#Cost)\n  - [1.2 Contents](#Contents)\n\n- [2 Strategy](#Strategy)\n  - [2.1 Tips and Tricks](#Tips_and_Tricks)\n\n- [3 History](#History)\n\n- [4 References](#References)\n\n## Useful Info\n\n### Cost\n\nTo unlock a treasure trove, you must meet its demands:\n\n- There is a 5% chance that it will ask for all your [piety](/Piety \"Piety\"). You won't be excommunicated, but it will reset your piety as if you had just converted (about 15/200). This is never generated if you are a [demigod](/Demigod \"Demigod\"), are otherwise atheist, or you worship [Ashenzari](/Ashenzari \"Ashenzari\"), [Gozag](/Gozag \"Gozag\"), [Uskayaw](/Uskayaw \"Uskayaw\"), or [Yredelemnul](/Yredelemnul \"Yredelemnul\").\n\n- Otherwise, there is a 1/3 chance that it will ask for an item available in a [shop](/Shop \"Shop\"). This will often be an [artefact](/Artefact \"Artefact\"), but may be a high-value mundane item. Unless the item itself is incredibly useful, these troves are effectively just asking for [gold](/Gold \"Gold\").\n\n- Otherwise, it will ask for an item or stack of items. Troves won't ask for items you can't use, with the exception of the [horn of Geryon](/Horn_of_Geryon \"Horn of Geryon\"), so other items become more likely. There are a number of possibilities, each individual item type being equally probable:[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1)\n\n  - **Armour (20% chance overall)**: It will ask for [gold](/Gold_dragon_scales \"Gold dragon scales\"), [storm](/Storm_dragon_scales \"Storm dragon scales\"), [shadow](/Shadow_dragon_scales \"Shadow dragon scales\"), [fire](/Fire_dragon_scales \"Fire dragon scales\"), or [ice dragon scales](/Ice_dragon_scales \"Ice dragon scales\"). The armour must be sufficiently enchanted as well; gold scales requests can range from +2 to +3, storm and shadow can range from +2 to +4, while fire and ice can range from +2 to +6.\n  - **Weapon (15% chance overall)**: It will ask for a [demon trident](/Demon_trident \"Demon trident\"), [demon whip](/Demon_whip \"Demon whip\"), or [demon blade](/Demon_blade \"Demon blade\"), with required enchantments ranging from +4 to +8.\n  - **Potions (25% chance overall)**: It may ask for 8+2d3 [potions of heal wounds](/Potions_of_heal_wounds \"Potions of heal wounds\"), 12+2d4 [potions of curing](/Potions_of_curing \"Potions of curing\"), 3+1d3+1d2 [potions of haste](/Potions_of_haste \"Potions of haste\"), or 2+1d3 [potions of resistance](/Potions_of_resistance \"Potions of resistance\").\n  - **Scrolls (25% chance overall)**: It will ask for 2+2d3 [scrolls of blinking](/Scrolls_of_blinking \"Scrolls of blinking\"), [fog](/Scroll_of_fog \"Scroll of fog\"), or [fear](/Scroll_of_fear \"Scroll of fear\"), 10+1d3+1d4 [scrolls of teleportation](/Scrolls_of_teleportation \"Scrolls of teleportation\"), or 1-2 [scrolls of acquirement](/Scrolls_of_acquirement \"Scrolls of acquirement\").\n  - **Miscellaneous items (15% chance overall):** It will ask for the abyssal [rune](/Rune \"Rune\"), the slimy rune, or the [horn of Geryon](/Horn_of_Geryon \"Horn of Geryon\"). The runes will not be taken from you, but the horn will.\n\nFor items with enchantments, the trove asks for minimums; a +6 demon whip will fulfil a +4 demon whip trove. Item [egos](/Ego \"Ego\") are ignored, and even [artefacts](/Artefact \"Artefact\") can be accepted. No other item type is accepted, even if they are 'superior'. For example, a +6 [eudemon blade](/Eudemon_blade \"Eudemon blade\") does not substitute a +6 demon blade. The item being given must be unequipped in order for it to be accepted, to prevent accidental sacrifices.\n\nThe cost of a trove has no bearing on the quality or type of items you will find inside.\n\n### Contents\n\nMost trove [vaults](/Vault \"Vault\") have 15-16 items, tailored for your character using [acquirement](/Acquirement \"Acquirement\") code. These items will always be usable and not forbidden by your [god](/God \"God\"). Many troves have a 'theme', like [armour](/Armour \"Armour\") or [jewellery](/Jewellery \"Jewellery\"). While items are tailored on your skills, an unarmed fighter could still find a [weapon](/Weapon \"Weapon\") trove (though are 33% as likely to), and melee fighters can enter a book trove (where they will find plenty of [manuals](/Manual \"Manual\")).\n\nAll layouts are perfectly safe; they never contain monsters or hazards.\n\n## Strategy\n\nFirst, remember that like other portals, you can only enter the treasure trove \\*once\\*. Do not go in with a full or nearly full inventory, or you'll have to leave stuff inside.\n\nMuch like scrolls of acquirement, a treasure trove's yield can run all the way from near-worthless to jaw-droppingly awesome. More often than not, though, it's worth opening a treasure trove if you find one. Odds are that there will be something in there you want.\n\nWhen it comes to jewellery, you do have some control over what a treasure trove will generate. The code prefers to give you [amulets](/Amulet \"Amulet\") and [rings](/Ring \"Ring\") you haven't identified yet, so if there are still several items left unidentified, it may be worthwhile to go to any jewellery shops you have access to and buy any garbage items you haven't identified yet. Spending a little money on an unidentified [ring of flight](/Ring_of_flight \"Ring of flight\") might improve your odds of getting that [ring of willpower](/Ring_of_willpower \"Ring of willpower\") you needed.\n\nIf you don't have enough of a particular consumable item to open a treasure trove, you will eventually be able to find what you're missing by exploring [Pandemonium](/Pandemonium \"Pandemonium\") or clearing [Ziggurats](/Ziggurat \"Ziggurat\") for long enough. But by the time you're ready to farm in either realm, you most likely won't need the items in a trove anymore.\n\n### Tips and Tricks\n\n- Remember to take demon weapons, dragon scales, and other \"rare\" items out of portal levels like [Ice Caves](/Ice_Cave \"Ice Cave\") -- they are likely to spawn much earlier than usual there.\n- Don't forget that pressing **Ctrl**+**F** will let you search for specific items you've already come across. This can save you a tremendous amount of time backtracking.\n- If you don't especially need them, you can stash a few [scrolls of enchant weapon](/Scrolls_of_enchant_weapon \"Scrolls of enchant weapon\") and [scrolls of enchant armour](/Scrolls_of_enchant_armour \"Scrolls of enchant armour\") to maximize the chance of manufacturing the required item.\n\n## History\n\n- Prior to [0.31](/0.31 \"0.31\"), a few rare trove types had hostile monsters. There was a trove with roaming [shining eyes](/Shining_eye \"Shining eye\"), and another with a [ynoxinul](/Ynoxinul \"Ynoxinul\") locked behind an [iron grate](/Iron_grate \"Iron grate\") (who could summon monsters past the grate).\n- In [0.25](/0.25 \"0.25\"), scrolls of fog and fear were added as trove fees.\n- Prior to [0.24](/0.24 \"0.24\"), troves could ask for 12+3d4 [scrolls of identify](/Scrolls_of_identify \"Scrolls of identify\").\n- Troves that take all your piety were added in [0.16](/0.16 \"0.16\"). Also, troves asking for the [horn of Geryon](/Horn_of_Geryon \"Horn of Geryon\") didn't take it away from the player previously.\n- Prior to [0.8](/0.8 \"0.8\"), troves worked differently: instead of always asking for an item and being untimed, they began with a very long timer (around 10000 turns). When attempting to enter, the player would be prompted to pay one of two amounts of gold: a large amount (usually around 2000-4000 gold) to enter the trove now, or a small amount (around 200 or so) to 'fix' the portal. The latter choice would make the trove untimed, but it would then require a specific item to enter, much as troves do now; the player would not know the item required until after they had chosen to fix the portal. The choice was removed because it was always optimal to pay to enter if you could.\n- Troves were introduced in [0.6](/0.6 \"0.6\").\n\n## References\n\n1.

You won't be excommunicated, but it will reset your piety as if you had just converted (about 15/200). This is never generated if you are a <a href=\"/Demigod\" title=\"Demigod\">demigod</a>, are otherwise atheist, or you worship <a href=\"/Ashenzari\" title=\"Ashenzari\">Ashenzari</a>, <a href=\"/Gozag\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gozag\">Gozag</a>, <a href=\"/Uskayaw\" title=\"Uskayaw\">Uskayaw</a>, or <a href=\"/Yredelemnul\" title=\"Yredelemnul\">Yredelemnul</a>.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, there is a 1/3 chance that it will ask for an item available in a <a href=\"/Shop\" title=\"Shop\">shop</a>. This will often be an <a href=\"/Artefact\" title=\"Artefact\">artefact</a>, but may be a high-value mundane item. Unless the item itself is incredibly useful, these troves are effectively just asking for <a href=\"/Gold\" title=\"Gold\">gold</a>.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, it will ask for an item or stack of items. Troves won't ask for items you can't use, with the exception of the <a href=\"/Horn_of_Geryon\" title=\"Horn of Geryon\">horn of Geryon</a>, so other items become more likely. There are a number of possibilities, each individual item type being equally probable:<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n<ul><li><b>Armour (20% chance overall)</b>: It will ask for <a href=\"/Gold_dragon_scales\" title=\"Gold dragon scales\">gold</a>, <a href=\"/Storm_dragon_scales\" title=\"Storm dragon scales\">storm</a>, <a href=\"/Shadow_dragon_scales\" title=\"Shadow dragon scales\">shadow</a>, <a href=\"/Fire_dragon_scales\" title=\"Fire dragon scales\">fire</a>, or <a href=\"/Ice_dragon_scales\" title=\"Ice dragon scales\">ice dragon scales</a>. The armour must be sufficiently enchanted as well; gold scales requests can range from +2 to +3, storm and shadow can range from +2 to +4, while fire and ice can range from +2 to +6.</li>\n<li><b>Weapon (15% chance overall)</b>: It will ask for a <a href=\"/Demon_trident\" title=\"Demon trident\">demon trident</a>, <a href=\"/Demon_whip\" title=\"Demon whip\">demon whip</a>, or <a href=\"/Demon_blade\" title=\"Demon blade\">demon blade</a>, with required enchantments ranging from +4 to +8.</li>\n<li><b>Potions (25% chance overall)</b>: It may ask for 8+2d3 <a href=\"/Potions_of_heal_wounds\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Potions of heal wounds\">potions of heal wounds</a>, 12+2d4 <a href=\"/Potions_of_curing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Potions of curing\">potions of curing</a>, 3+1d3+1d2 <a href=\"/Potions_of_haste\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Potions of haste\">potions of haste</a>, or 2+1d3 <a href=\"/Potions_of_resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Potions of resistance\">potions of resistance</a>.</li>\n<li><b>Scrolls (25% chance overall)</b>: It will ask for 2+2d3 <a href=\"/Scrolls_of_blinking\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scrolls of blinking\">scrolls of blinking</a>, <a href=\"/Scroll_of_fog\" title=\"Scroll of fog\">fog</a>, or <a href=\"/Scroll_of_fear\" title=\"Scroll of fear\">fear</a>, 10+1d3+1d4 <a href=\"/Scrolls_of_teleportation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scrolls of teleportation\">scrolls of teleportation</a>, or 1-2 <a href=\"/Scrolls_of_acquirement\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scrolls of acquirement\">scrolls of acquirement</a>.</li>\n<li><b>Miscellaneous items (15% chance overall):</b> It will ask for the abyssal <a href=\"/Rune\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rune\">rune</a>, the slimy rune, or the <a href=\"/Horn_of_Geryon\" title=\"Horn of Geryon\">horn of Geryon</a>. The runes will not be taken from you, but the horn will.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>For items with enchantments, the trove asks for minimums; a +6 demon whip will fulfil a +4 demon whip trove. Item <a href=\"/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">egos</a> are ignored, and even  <a href=\"/Artefact\" title=\"Artefact\">artefacts</a> can be accepted. No other item type is accepted, even if they are 'superior'. For example, a +6 <a href=\"/Eudemon_blade\" title=\"Eudemon blade\">eudemon blade</a> does not substitute a +6 demon blade. The item being given must be unequipped in order for it to be accepted, to prevent accidental sacrifices.\n</p><p>The cost of a trove has no bearing on the quality or type of items you will find inside.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contents\">Contents</span></h3>\n<p>Most trove <a href=\"/Vault\" title=\"Vault\">vaults</a> have 15-16 items, tailored for your character using <a href=\"/Acquirement\" title=\"Acquirement\">acquirement</a> code. These items will always be usable and not forbidden by your <a href=\"/God\" title=\"God\">god</a>. Many troves have a 'theme', like <a href=\"/Armour\" title=\"Armour\">armour</a> or <a href=\"/Jewellery\" title=\"Jewellery\">jewellery</a>. While items are tailored on your skills, an unarmed fighter could still find a <a href=\"/Weapon\" title=\"Weapon\">weapon</a> trove (though are 33% as likely to), and melee fighters can enter a book trove (where they will find plenty of <a href=\"/Manual\" title=\"Manual\">manuals</a>). \n</p><p>All layouts are perfectly safe; they never contain monsters or hazards.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Strategy\">Strategy</span></h2>\n<p>First, remember that like other portals, you can only enter the treasure trove *once*. Do not go in with a full or nearly full inventory, or you'll have to leave stuff inside.\n</p><p>Much like scrolls of acquirement, a treasure trove's yield can run all the way from near-worthless to jaw-droppingly awesome. More often than not, though, it's worth opening a treasure trove if you find one. Odds are that there will be something in there you want.\n</p><p>When it comes to jewellery, you do have some control over what a treasure trove will generate. The code prefers to give you <a href=\"/Amulet\" title=\"Amulet\">amulets</a> and <a href=\"/Ring\" title=\"Ring\">rings</a> you haven't identified yet, so if there are still several items left unidentified, it may be worthwhile to go to any jewellery shops you have access to and buy any garbage items you haven't identified yet. Spending a little money on an unidentified <a href=\"/Ring_of_flight\" title=\"Ring of flight\">ring of flight</a> might improve your odds of getting that <a href=\"/Ring_of_willpower\" title=\"Ring of willpower\">ring of willpower</a> you needed.\n</p><p>If you don't have enough of a particular consumable item to open a treasure trove, you will eventually be able to find what you're missing by exploring <a href=\"/Pandemonium\" title=\"Pandemonium\">Pandemonium</a> or clearing <a href=\"/Ziggurat\" title=\"Ziggurat\">Ziggurats</a> for long enough. But by the time you're ready to farm in either realm, you most likely won't need the items in a trove anymore.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tips_and_Tricks\">Tips and Tricks</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Remember to take demon weapons, dragon scales, and other \"rare\" items out of portal levels like <a href=\"/Ice_Cave\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ice Cave\">Ice Caves</a> -- they are likely to spawn much earlier than usual there.</li>\n<li>Don't forget that pressing <b>Ctrl</b>+<b>F</b> will let you search for specific items you've already come across. This can save you a tremendous amount of time backtracking.</li>\n<li>If you don't especially need them, you can stash a few <a href=\"/Scrolls_of_enchant_weapon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scrolls of enchant weapon\">scrolls of enchant weapon</a> and <a href=\"/Scrolls_of_enchant_armour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scrolls of enchant armour\">scrolls of enchant armour</a> to maximize the chance of manufacturing the required item.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Prior to <a href=\"/0.31\" title=\"0.31\">0.31</a>, a few rare trove types had hostile monsters. There was a trove with roaming <a href=\"/Shining_eye\" title=\"Shining eye\">shining eyes</a>, and another with a <a href=\"/Ynoxinul\" title=\"Ynoxinul\">ynoxinul</a> locked behind an <a href=\"/Iron_grate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Iron grate\">iron grate</a> (who could summon monsters past the grate).</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/0.25\" title=\"0.25\">0.25</a>, scrolls of fog and fear were added as trove fees.</li>\n<li>Prior to <a href=\"/0.24\" title=\"0.24\">0.24</a>, troves could ask for 12+3d4 <a href=\"/Scrolls_of_identify\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scrolls of identify\">scrolls of identify</a>.</li>\n<li>Troves that take all your piety were added in <a href=\"/0.16\" title=\"0.16\">0.16</a>. Also, troves asking for the <a href=\"/Horn_of_Geryon\" title=\"Horn of Geryon\">horn of Geryon</a> didn't take it away from the player previously.</li>\n<li>Prior to <a href=\"/0.8\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"0.8\">0.8</a>, troves worked differently: instead of always asking for an item and being untimed, they began with a very long timer (around 10000 turns).  When attempting to enter, the player would be prompted to pay one of two amounts of gold: a large amount (usually around 2000-4000 gold) to enter the trove now, or a small amount (around 200 or so) to 'fix' the portal.  The latter choice would make the trove untimed, but it would then require a specific item to enter, much as troves do now; the player would not know the item required until after they had chosen to fix the portal.  The choice was removed because it was always optimal to pay to enter if you could.</li>\n<li>Troves were introduced in <a href=\"/0.6\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"0.6\">0.6</a>.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span

upon a time, an enterprising thief and wizard created a system of portals leading into the secret treasure troves and chambers of the rich.

He had expected to find naught save outer gloom in this robbers' den, and he was surprised to see the whole room filled with bales of all manner stuffs, and heaped up from sole to ceiling with camel-loads of silks and brocades and embroidered cloths and mounds on mounds of vari-colored carpetings; besides which he espied coins golden and silvern without measure or account, some piled upon the ground and others bound in leathern bags and sacks. Seeing these goods and moneys in such abundance, Ali Baba determined in his mind that not during a few years only but for many generations thieves must have stored their gains and spoils in this place.”<br>\n-_The Arabian Nights_. trans. Sir Richard F. Burton, 1885.}}\n\n[[File:Treasure trove portal.png]] A '''treasure trove''' is a small [[portal]], filled with likely character relevant loot. A trove can spawn a single time almost anywhere, but it has a cost to be opened. Troves do not decay over time, but like many portals, can only be entered once before being sealed forever.\n\n==Useful Info==\n===Cost===\nTo unlock a treasure trove, you must meet its demands:\n\n*There is a 5% chance that it will ask for all your [[piety]]. You won't be excommunicated, but it will reset your piety as if you had just converted (about 15/200). This is never generated if you are a [[demigod]], are otherwise atheist, or you worship [[Ashenzari]], [[Gozag]], [[Uskayaw]], or [[Yredelemnul]].\n*Otherwise, there is a 1/3 chance that it will ask for an item available in a [[shop]]. This will often be an [[artefact]], but may be a high-value mundane item. Unless the item itself is incredibly useful, these troves are effectively just asking for [[gold]].\n*Otherwise, it will ask for an item or stack of items. Troves won't ask for items you can't use, with the exception of the [[horn of Geryon]], so other items become more likely. There are a number of possibilities, each individual item type being equally probable:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|dat/des/portals/trove.des|98}}</ref>\n**'''Armour (20% chance overall)''': It will ask for [[gold dragon scales|gold]], [[storm dragon scales|storm]], [[shadow dragon scales|shadow]], [[fire dragon scales|fire]], or [[ice dragon scales]]. The armour must be sufficiently enchanted as well; gold scales requests can range from +2 to +3, storm and shadow can range from +2 to +4, while fire and ice can range from +2 to +6.\n**'''Weapon (15% chance overall)''': It will ask for a [[demon trident]], [[demon whip]], or [[demon blade]], with required enchantments ranging from +4 to +8.\n**'''Potions (25% chance overall)''': It may ask for 8+2d3 [[potions of heal wounds]], 12+2d4 [[potions of curing]], 3+1d3+1d2 [[potions of haste]], or 2+1d3 [[potions of resistance]].\n**'''Scrolls (25% chance overall)''': It will ask for 2+2d3 [[scrolls of blinking]], [[scroll of fog|fog]], or [[scroll of fear|fear]], 10+1d3+1d4 [[scrolls of teleportation]], or 1-2 [[scrolls of acquirement]].\n**'''Miscellaneous items (15% chance overall):''' It will ask for the abyssal [[rune]], the slimy rune, or the [[horn of Geryon]]. The runes will not be taken from you, but the horn will.\n\nFor items with enchantments, the trove asks for minimums; a +6 demon whip will fulfil a +4 demon whip trove. Item [[ego]]s are ignored, and even  [[artefact]]s can be accepted. No other item type is accepted, even if they are 'superior'. For example, a +6 [[eudemon blade]] does not substitute a +6 demon blade. The item being given must be unequipped in order for it to be accepted, to prevent accidental sacrifices.\n\nThe cost of a trove has no bearing on the quality or type of items you will find inside.\n\n===Contents===\nMost trove [[vault]]s have 15-16 items, tailored for your character using [[acquirement]] code. These items will always be usable and not forbidden by your [[god]]. Many troves have a 'theme', like [[armour]] or [[jewellery]]. While items are tailored on your skills, an unarmed fighter could still find a [[weapon]] trove (though are 33% as likely to), and melee fighters can enter a book trove (where they will find plenty of [[manual]]s). \n\nAll layouts are perfectly safe; they never contain monsters or hazards.\n==Strategy==\nFirst, remember that like other portals, you can only enter the treasure trove *once*. Do not go in with a full or nearly full inventory, or you'll have to leave stuff inside.\n\nMuch like scrolls of acquirement, a treasure trove's yield can run all the way from near-worthless to jaw-droppingly awesome. More often than not, though, it's worth opening a treasure trove if you find one. Odds are that there will be something in there you want.\n\nWhen it comes to jewellery, you do have some control over what a treasure trove will generate. The code prefers to give you [[amulet]]s and [[ring]]s you haven't identified yet, so if there are still several items left unidentified, it may be worthwhile to go to any jewellery shops you have access to and buy any garbage items you haven't identified yet. Spending a little money on an unidentified [[ring of flight]] might improve your odds of getting that [[ring of willpower]] you needed.\n\nIf you don't have enough of a particular consumable item to open a treasure trove, you will eventually be able to find what you're missing by exploring [[Pandemonium]] or clearing [[Ziggurat]]s for long enough. But by the time you're ready to farm in either realm, you most likely won't need the items in a trove anymore.\n\n===Tips and Tricks===\n*Remember to take demon weapons, dragon scales, and other \"rare\" items out of portal levels like [[Ice Cave]]s -- they are likely to spawn much earlier than usual there.\n*Don't forget that pressing '''Ctrl'''+'''F''' will let you search for specific items you've already come across. This can save you a tremendous amount of time backtracking.\n*If you don't especially need them, you can stash a few [[scrolls of enchant weapon]] and [[scrolls of enchant armour]] to maximize the chance of manufacturing the required item.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], a few rare trove types had hostile monsters. There was a trove with roaming [[shining eye]]s, and another with a [[ynoxinul]] locked behind an [[iron grate]] (who could summon monsters past the grate).\n*In [[0.25]], scrolls of fog and fear were added as trove fees.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], troves could ask for 12+3d4 [[scrolls of identify]].\n*Troves that take all your piety were added in [[0.16]]. Also, troves asking for the [[horn of Geryon]] didn't take it away from the player previously.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], troves worked differently: instead of always asking for an item and being untimed, they began with a very long timer (around 10000 turns).  When attempting to enter, the player would be prompted to pay one of two amounts of gold: a large amount (usually around 2000-4000 gold) to enter the trove now, or a small amount (around 200 or so) to 'fix' the portal.  The latter choice would make the trove untimed, but it would then require a specific item to enter, much as troves do now; the player would not know the item required until after they had chosen to fix the portal.  The choice was removed because it was always optimal to pay to enter if you could.\n*Troves were introduced in [[0.6]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Portals}}\n\n[[Category:Portals]]"}

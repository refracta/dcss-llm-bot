This allows the descent of staircases and the retrieval of items lying on the ground, for example, but does not deprive the wearer of the benefits of levitation.}}\n\nAn '''amulet of controlled flight''' allows the wearer to pick up items from the ground and go up and down stairs while [[levitate|levitating]] by providing the [[Control Flight|control flight]] [[intrinsic]]. Essentially, it turns [[Levitation]] into [[fly]]ing.\n\n==History==\n*Amulets of controlled flight were removed in [[0.11]], though the [[amulet of the Air]] still had one as its base type.\n**In [[0.12]], the amulet of the Air also lost controlled flight.\n[[Category:Amulets]]\n[[Category:Obsolete items]]"}

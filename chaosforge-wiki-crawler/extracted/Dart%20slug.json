{"title":"Dart slug","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dart_slug","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of|gastropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Dart slugs''' are a common nuisance on the earliest [[Dungeon]] floors. They have a moderately strong ranged attack (for a D:1 enemy), but are slow and otherwise unremarkable.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*For low HP species at XL 1, dart slugs can be big threats; they have a ranged attack that can two-shot frailer combos. If you find a [[sleep]]ing slug, try to avoid waking it up.\n*Dart slugs get a chance to fire every ~1.4 turns. If you blindly charge in, you can take a few max roll Slug Darts and promptly die. But, like any monster with ranged attacks, dart slugs cannot fire when they are outside of your [[line of sight]].\n**For melee characters, you can duck around a corner, and wait for them to come. That way, you won't get shot during the approach.\n**Dart slugs are slow. If you have an attack with full-screen range ([[Magic Dart]], [[Ranged Weapons]]...), and sufficiently clear space, you can [[kite]] them. Keep the slug at the edge of your line of sight at all times - if the slug deals too much damage, retreat, which forces it outside LOS.\n**Slugs can't open [[door]]s, so walking back and shutting a door is a valid escape option.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], their Slug Dart dealt 2d4 damage, but they fired less often.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], dart slugs could [[cling]] to walls.\n*Dart slugs came into life in version [[0.18]]."}

You can repair this damage by [[healing]] yourself while already at full HP. [[Undead]] characters are unaffected.\n\n==History==\nPotions of decay were removed from the game in [[0.17]].\n\nPrior to [[0.12]], the loss of max HP occurred over time through the rot [[status effect]]. Also, the potion was useful when coupled with [[Evaporate]], an obsolete spell that allowed you to turn potions into harmful [[cloud]]s. Potions of decay would create clouds of extremely powerful [[miasma]].\n\nThe following methods for generating potions of decay have been removed in recent versions:\n*[[mummy (monster)|Mummy]] death curses could convert other potions (Unknown version)\n*Casting [[Sublimation of Blood]] on a [[potion of blood]] (Unknown version)\n*Casting [[Fulsome Distillation]] on any rot-inducing [[corpse]] (Removed in 0.12)"}

Melee brutes can appreciate this armour for its amazing AC, and clarity is somewhat useful. While a fully enchanted set of crystal plate or [[gold dragon scales]] will give more AC, using the OCPA saves those [[scrolls of enchant armour]] for other purposes.\n\nCasters may ''want'' to wear this armour for its high AC and Archmagi... but for most of the game, it's too heavy to be practical. In a 3-rune game, most characters will be stuck casting low-level spells; even [[extended]] characters can have a rough time casting in it. Only a few fortunate hybrid characters with very high stats ([[Demigod]]s or followers of [[Cheibriados]], perhaps) will be able to take full advantage of what it offers.\n\n[[Ziggurat]] divers have the casting ability and [[Armour skill]] to cast with the OCPA. Due to the massive amount of loot, you'll ''eventually'' find this artefact, along with [[strength]] and [[wizardry]] gear. Note that, if you do enough zigs, you might also find a randart +20 crystal plate armour (which'll beat this one).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the orange crystal plate armour had [[sustain abilities]].\n*The orange crystal plate armour was added in [[0.15]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

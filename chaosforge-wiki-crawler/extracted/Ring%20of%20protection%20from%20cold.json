{"title":"Ring of protection from cold","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ring_of_protection_from_cold","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{item\n |itemtype = Jewellery\n |name = Ring of protection from cold\n |cost = ?\n}}\n{{flavour|A ring that provides protection from cold.}}\n\nA '''ring of protection from cold''' protects its wearer from cold-based attacks, providing one level of [[cold]] resistance (rC+).\n\n==Strategy==\n*Cold resistance is often useful and occasionally critical, although a character will usually have enough time to swap a [[ring]] when confronted with a cold-using monster. Whether you regularly swap this ring or keep it on all the time depends greatly on your character's other equipment and your own playing style.\n*In general, cold resistance is a lower priority than [[fire resistance]] in the late game due to the threat of [[orbs of fire]], though various cold themed enemies are scattered throughout the Dungeon's branches.\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

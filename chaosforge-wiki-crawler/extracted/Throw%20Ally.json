{"title":"Throw Ally","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Throw_Ally","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|Throws a nearby ally at the monster's foe, doing minimal damage and landing the thrown monster nearby.}}\n\n'''Throw Ally''' is a monster-only spell which launches a friendly [[monster]] at an opponent. In effect, the cast causes an adjacent monster to blink adjacent to the victim, dealing unavoidable damage to the target in the process. The thrown ally is not [[reflection|reflectable]], [[Repel Missiles|deflectable]], or [[Shield_(stat)|blockable]] by the target.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nIron giants can throw '''any''' adjacent, allied monster of any size<sup>1</sup>, and, yes, that means: [[iron dragon]]s, [[Hell Sentinel]]s, [[juggernaut]]s, and even other fellow iron giants. Polyphemus can only throw [[yak]]s, [[death yak]]s, and [[catoblepas|catoblepae]]. Robin can only throw [[goblin]]s and [[hobgoblin]]s.   \n\nThe maximum damage incurred depends on the thrower's [[HD]]: 2*HD - 1. Thus, possible damage is 1d35, 1d31, 1d3, respectively, less the player's [[AC]].\n\nThe throwing monster will always select the ally that is farthest away from the target. Thus, if it is part of a mob and has just come into the player's [[LOS]], the monster being thrown at the player will very likely be one the player has not yet seen.\n \n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Throw Ally was known as Goblin Toss.\n*Added in [[0.16]].\n\n==Footnotes==\n<sup>1</sup>The ally to be thrown must not be [[constricted]]. Otherwise, the only things iron giants cannot throw are avatars (which are linked to a conjurer) and projectiles: that is, [[Battlesphere]]s, [[Spectral weapon]]s, [[Orb of destruction|Orbs of destruction]], [[Ball lightning]], [[Spatial vortex|Spatial vortices]]. (A [[dancing weapon]] is not a Spectral weapon and ''is'' throwable.)\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

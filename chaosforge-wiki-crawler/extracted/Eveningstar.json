A balanced mace with a long shaft and a metal head covered in lethal spikes.\n\n----\n\n“It is said to have been the favourite weapon of the Norman priest, who, objecting to the shedding of blood, had no scruple about the dashing out of\nbrains.”\n\n-T. M. Allison, “The Flail and Kindred Tools (from a historical and literary standpoint)”, _Archaeologia Aeliana_, Third Series, vol. IV. 1908.}}\n{{crawlquote|This weapon falls into the [[Maces & Flails]] category. It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\nNot only is an '''eveningstar''' the opposite of a morningstar, it's also a superior weapon. They have the highest base damage of any one-handed weapon, around the level of [[demon whip]]s for overall damage/turn. Unfortunately, they are quite rare.\n\n==Strategy==\n===Compared to demon whips===\nThe differences between eveningstars and [[demon whip]]s are small. A +9 [[brand]]ed eveningstar is enough to win you the game, as is a +9 branded demon whip. Generally, the weapon you get ''first'' should be the one that you use. (The weapon you get first can benefit first from [[scrolls of enchant weapon]]).\n\nThere are cases where specific comparison is warranted. Against a 0 AC opponent, a +0 demon whip is roughly 2.6% stronger than a +0 eveningstar. The demon whip attacks faster, so it is penalized more by [[AC]], and conversely benefits more from [[slaying]] and [[auxiliary attack]]s. Characters with lots of auxiliary attacks, like [[Vine Stalker]]s and monstrous [[Demonspawn]] will prefer a demon whip. Otherwise, it is mostly even, slightly favored towards the eveningstar. This analysis is independent of a character's [[strength]] or skill.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Eveningstar1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Eveningstar2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Eveningstar3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]s\n|-\n| '''[[Sceptre of Torment]]''' || [[File:Sceptre_of_torment.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Sceptre of Asmodeus]]''' || [[File:Sceptre of asmodeus.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.23]], the unrandart [[sceptre of Torment]] was a [[staff]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], eveningstars had only 14 base damage.\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

While +6 slay and Will++ are excellent properties, the berserkitis makes it a risky piece of gear. \n\n[[Undead]] players, [[Formicid]]s, and those with [[clarity]] are unaffected by *Rage, which allows getting full advantage of Bloodlust's other properties. [[Ranged weapon]] users greatly appreciate this amulet too - ranged weapons benefit from slaying, but don't trigger the berserk. Casters, in a similar vein, can use this amulet for the Will++; the -3 intelligence penalty is too small to matter.\n\nEven if you're a melee character who is affected by berserk, it can be a niche swapout. Swap it in whenever berserk is helpful, such as before taking on a [[ghost vault]]). Do note that it takes 5 turns to put on an amulet (and another 5 turns to remove one).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the amulet only forced berserk on 5% of melee attacks, but had evocable berserk.\n*Prior to the removal of [[curse]]s in [[0.27]], this item would curse on equip.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], this amulet's base type was an [[amulet of rage]].\n*Prior to [[0.20]], the amulet only gave +3 slaying and +40 magic resistance.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the amulet had a +2 strength buff was removed and only a -2 intelligence malus.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], the forced berserk chances were decreased from 9% to 5%.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the amulet had a stealth penalty of -20.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the amulet only gave 30 MR.\n*In [[0.12]] the odds of the amulet causing berserk were changed.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Amulets]]"}

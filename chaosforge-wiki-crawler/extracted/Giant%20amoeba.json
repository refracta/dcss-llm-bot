Their only noteworthy trait is that they actually leave an edible [[corpse]] when defeated (if you have [[poison]] resistance and don't mind eating contaminated [[chunk]]s). They can be found in or near [[the Slime Pits]], and occasionally in the lower parts of [[the Dungeon]] and [[the Vaults]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nNone needed, unless it appears unusually early.  Be grateful.\n==History==\nGiant amoebas were removed in [[0.14]]\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

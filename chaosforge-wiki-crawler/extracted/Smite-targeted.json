{"title":"Smite-targeted","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Smite-targeted","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Smite-targeted''' is a term used for spells and abilities that can target any entity in [[line of sight]], like the titular [[Smiting]] spell, regardless of obstacles in the way. Specifically, they are spells with the ''target'' or ''grid'' [[spell flags]]. They are not interrupted by monsters or certain dungeon features like [[iron grate]]s. However, transparent [[wall]]s block line of fire for the purpose of attacking.\n\nMost spells with smite-targeting cannot miss; this is a property of each individual spell, rather than the targeting mode itself. For example, [[Portal Projectile]] doesn't suddenly make your [[ranged weapons]] perfectly accurate.\n\n==Sources==\nThese player usable [[spell]]s and actions are smite-targeted.\n*[[Airstrike]]\n*[[Haunt]]\n*[[Inner Flame]]\n*[[Momentum Strike]] (range 4)\n*[[Ranged combat]] during [[Portal Projectile]]\n*[[Poisonous Vapours]]\n*[[Yara's Violent Unravelling]]\n*[[Apportation]] (targets an object rather than a creature; objects can't pass through walls)\n\nThese spells have similar targeting rules, but can target any grid square, not just those that contain a creature.\n*[[Fire Storm]] (range 5)\n*[[Freezing Cloud]] (range 5)\n*[[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] (needs dungeon feature/stone monster)\n\n===Monster Sources===\nA noncomprehensive list of monster spells with smite-targeting:\n*[[Airstrike]]\n*[[Call Down Damnation]]\n*[[Resonance Strike]]\n*[[Smiting]]\n*[[Waterstrike]]\n\n==Strategy==\nMonsters with smite-targeted spells are very dangerous, able to hit you while other enemies are in your way. Most enemy spells are made more dangerous by ignoring your [[EV]] and [[SH]]. [[Smiting]] itself is a notorious killer of early characters. [[Penetration|Penetrating]] attacks or your own area-of-effect or smite-targeted attacks can get rid of pesky enemies.\n\nYour own smite-targeted attacks can help when dealing with weak but supportive monsters, such as [[boggart]]s or [[moths of wrath]]."}

{"title":"Serpent of Hell (Tartarus)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Serpent_of_Hell_(Tartarus)","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | dragons}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe '''Serpent of Hell''' is a [[unique]] dragon whose elemental affinity varies based on which branch of [[Hell]] you encounter it in. When faced in [[Tartarus]], the Serpent is capable of breathing [[negative energy]], vile [[miasma]], and [[acid]] at you.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Visiting Tartarus without rN++ or better is just asking for aggravating and disabling levels of [[draining]], and that applies while facing the Serpent of Hell. Even with a full three ranks however, the Serpent's Miasma blasts will still damage, [[poison]], and [[slow]] you unless you are immune to poison or miasma. As this simply isn't available to most characters, try to take out this unique fast, and try not to stand around in miasma if you don't have to.\n**If you happen to be carrying one, a [[scarf]] of [[cloud immunity]] will render you immune to miasma.\n*You'll also want [[Acid#Corrosion Resistance|rCorr]] here, as this version of the Serpent of Hell is one of the few sources of acid damage in the hells.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|this Serpent of Hell will get [[Ghostly Fireball]] and [[Poison Arrow]] instead of Bolt of Draining and Corrosive Bolt.}}\n*In [[0.16]], it got a third breath attack in [[Corrosive Bolt]]."}

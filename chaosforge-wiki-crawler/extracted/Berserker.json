They enter the Dungeon with a weapon of their choice, and dressed in animal skins.}}\n'''Berserkers''' are savage warriors who worship [[Trog|Trog the Wrathful]]. Like other gods, Trog offers further powers and gifts to those who prove worthy. Berserkers can thus be seen as a kind of holy warrior, albeit of a faith that values carnage for its own sake rather than a devotion to good (or evil, for that matter). They are forbidden to learn or use spells.\n\nBerserkers start with 35 [[piety]], giving them immediate access to the [[berserk]] ability from turn 1.\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Hill Orc]], [[Minotaur]], [[Merfolk]], [[Gargoyle]], [[Armataur]], and [[Oni]] are the recommended races if you pick a Berserker background.\n\n==Racial Restrictions==\n[[Demigod]]s may not become Berserkers (or any other religious background). \n\nWhile [[Formicid]]s, [[Ghoul]]s, and [[Mummy|Mummies]] are not banned from being Berserkers, they cannot go berserk, robbing them of one of this background's main benefits. [[Vampire]]s also face difficulty as Berserkers, as they cannot go berserk if they are bloodless.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[weapon of choice]] ([[short sword]], [[mace]], [[hand axe]], [[falchion]] or [[spear]], or [[unarmed]])\n*+0 [[animal skin]]\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Fighting]]: 3\n*Starting Weapon's Skill: 3\n*[[Armour]]: 2\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n\nChoosing Berserker adds 9 to your starting [[Strength]], and 4 to your starting [[Dexterity]], but reduces your starting [[Intelligence]] by 1.\n\n==Strategy==\nImmediate access to [[Trog]]'s [[berserk]] ability makes berserker one of the strongest backgrounds in the game, as long as you are careful with when you berserk.\n\nIronically, Berserkers actually need to be played with ''more'' restraint than other warrior backgrounds. With their berserk ability, they may seem much more powerful than plain old [[Fighter]]s, but many a careless Berserker has perished because they ran out of rage (and got [[slow|exhausted]]) while still surrounded by enemies. Remember that Trog may extend your berserk rage with every kill - when fighting a really tough monster, it may be worth sparing a turn whacking a weak monster next to it. Once you score enough piety to summon allies, they too can block for you if you get caught exhausted.\n\nNovice players might want to pick [[Troll]] for species, as they have [[claws]], high HP, and [[regeneration]], which makes them more forgiving to new players. More advanced players may prefer other species; they will have to go berserk more carefully, but (unlike Trolls) will have the aptitudes to make the most of Trog's weapon gifts.\n\n==History==\n*Berserkers were unchanged in [[0.29]], where most other backgrounds got buffed.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Berserkers started with 20 [[gold]].\n\nFor additional context on Berserker's gameplay changes, see [[Trog#History|Trog's History]] section.\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

It covers opponents in ice, slowing down their movement somewhat.}}\n[[File:Dagger_of_chilly_death.png]] '''''the +9 dagger of Chilly Death'''''<br>\n\n+9 [[dagger]]\n\n[[Freezing]] brand<br>\nMay [[Frozen|flash-freeze]] the target on a successful hit<br>\nrF-<br>\nrC++<br>\nrPois<br>\n+40 MR\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''dagger of Chilly Death''''s biggest failing is its [[fire]] vulnerability, which can render it very dangerous to wield in certain situations. If you can overcome that, however, you wind up with a curious weapon. Its base weapon is not very effective for straight combat, and although its enchantment level is very high, you'll likely get better damage with a well-enchanted [[rapier]] or [[quickblade]] with a [[pain]] or [[electrocution]] brand, particularly at higher skill and [[slaying]] levels. You may wish to occasionally swap it in for its resistances ([[cold]], [[poison]], and [[magic resistance]]), especially for combat casters. As a stabbing tool, it's effective, but not that much more than any other dagger.\n\nIts [[Frozen|flash-freeze]] effect is less useful than it might be on a ranged weapon, simply because it's very short lived and by the time you can strike the enemy, you're already in melee range and the enemy won't be moving anyway. It ''is'' very effective for creating an escape opportunity, however; once the target's frozen, you can use that brief slow effect to create a gap and race up a stairway to someplace safe.\n\n==History==\n*This unrand artifact was removed in [[0.20]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], it had a +5, +7 enchantment bonus and could not freeze targets.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], it only provided +20 MR.\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Short blades]]"}

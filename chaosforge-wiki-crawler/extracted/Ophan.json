{"title":"Ophan","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ophan","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{list of | holy monsters}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ophanim''' are moderately powerful [[holy]] monsters with 6-tile [[Aura#Halo|halo aura]]s that attack solely using their two spells. As soon as they notice you, they cast [[Holy Flames]] to trap you in a ring of [[Cloud#Blessed_fire|holy fire]] (thankfully, the center tile is left unaffected). They then proceed to hammer you with Bolt of Fire. They are very rare, only appearing in holy-themed [[Pandemonium]] or [[Ziggurat]] floors and sometimes in [[The Abyss]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Get out of the ring of holy fire as soon as you can, preferably with a [[Blink]]. Undead characters should be wary as areas can soon be saturated with rings of holy fire.\n**Or just stay in the ring and use your ranged weapons and spells. The clouds will dissipate after some time.\n\n==Trivia==\nThe Ophanim (Hebrew for \"wheels\") are a class of celestial beings found in the Book of Enoch, where they guard the throne of God without sleeping, along with the Cherubim and Seraphim. The wheels seen in Ezekiel's vision of the chariot are believed to also be Ophanim.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|ophans will gain an aura that [[mark]]s the player while in [[line of sight]].}}\n*Prior to [[0.16]], ophanim had 7-tile halos."}

Its primary use is to give your allies commands (such as giving them a target to attack or telling them to hold their position), but you can also use it to shout, attracting attention to the tile you are currently standing on.\n*Pressing '''T''' is the command to take off [[armour]].\n*Pressing '''CTRL-T''' sets your travel speed to your slowest ally. However, in many web browsers, this instead causes a new Tab to pop up. You can get around this by pressing '''*''' (which substitutes for Ctrl) before you press '''t'''.\n**CTRL-T only affects autotravel speed. Fast species shouldnâ€™t worry about losing their speed, or having to toggle CTRL-T over and over in every battle.\n\n==Symbols==\nWhile playing in console mode:\n*'''t''' represents crabs, turtles, and crocodilians.\n*'''T''' represents [[List of trolls | troll]]-type monsters.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], '''Ctrl-T''' was a command for adding and editing macros.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], '''Ctrl-T''' was a command for switching between monster glyphs and weapon glyphs (console-only).\n*Prior to [[0.15]], '''Ctrl-T''' changed item pickup behaviour of player allies.\n\n{{alphabet}}\n\n[[Category:Commands]]\n[[Category:Symbols]]"}

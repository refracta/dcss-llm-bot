{"title":"Spriggan berserker","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spriggan_berserker","type":"raw","data":"{{version|026}}\n{{list of|spriggans}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Spriggan berkserkers''' are miniscule attackers, dressed in [[animal skin]]s and wielding hefty [[brand]]ed one handed weapons. While they aren't terribly strong or well armed, they have [[spriggan]]ly speed and the ability to go [[berserk]] on top of that, allowing for rapid, surprisingly powerful hits. Don't leave them half-dead, as they will use [[Trog]]'s Brothers In Arms ability when injured.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nUnlike most spriggans, you should try to avoid melee with an enraged berserker. They have good evasion but little durability, so try to take them out at range with high-accuracy attacks. In addition to their natural [[willpower]] their resistance to enchantments can soar if they utilize Trog's Hand; cast any [[Hexes]] early in the battle.\n\n[[Category:Spriggan]]"}

{"title":"Bog body","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bog_body","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Bog bodies''' are amphibious [[undead]] found in [[the Swamp]] with a cold touch-based attack that deals an additional 10-29 cold damage, as well as a few spells. They can swim, but slowly.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you don't have great cold resistance, try not to stay in/above water near a bog body. Bolt of Cold will create [[freezing vapour]]s when passing over water, increasing the damage you'll take.\n*The extra cold damage in melee is very likely to trigger unless you have a lot of AC, given the attack's base damage of 20.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.26]], their touch attack was merged with the main attack, which increased the chance to deal additional cold damage. Also, their HD was increased from 6 to 10, making their spells more powerful.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], followers of [[Fedhas Madash]] could instantly destroy them with the Fungal Bloom ability.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], you could meet several '''decayed bog bodies''' in the [[Ossuary]]. They were less durable and had [[Throw Frost]] instead of [[Bolt of Cold]]. Decayed bog bodies were replaced with less dangerous [[Mummy (monster)#Variant Mummy|bog mummies]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], bog bodies would randomly start rotting.\n*Bog bodies were added in [[0.11]], replacing [[bog mummies]]."}

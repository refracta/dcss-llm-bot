{"title":"Creeping inferno","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Creeping_inferno","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Creeping infernos''' are fragile entities that explode into [[Fire Storm]]s (8d8.25 damage) when killed. They are found naturally in [[Gehenna]], or created by [[stoker]]s.\n\nThey move like [[lurking horror]]s. Every turn, if a creeping inferno is in your [[line of sight]], it can only move if <code>distance <= 1d(LOS_range + 1) - 1</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-act.cc|579}}</ref> So when encountered at the edge of LOS, it is likely to not move, but the closer you get, the more likely it is to charge at you.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Just about any attack, such as [[javelin]]s or any number of [[spell]]s, will take one out. \n\n==History==\n*Creeping infernos were added in [[0.28]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

This shows up as an extra 0.5 MP/turn on the character sheet, but you may notice some variance in the actual regeneration.<br>\nIncreases maximum MP by 4<br>\n[[electricity|rElec]]<br>\nDoubles all [[magical contamination]] while worn<br>\nCauses heavy [[magical contamination]] when removed<br>\n[[Chaotic]]\n\n==Desirablility==\nSources of electricity resistance are rare, and the increased MP regeneration is always useful for casters, especially ones that haven't found a source of [[channeling]]. Otherwise, most characters will find an [[amulet of magic regeneration]] providing extra MP without the increase to your magical contamination and while allowing you to wear headgear that provides [[intelligence]], [[magic resistance]], or [[see invisible]].\n\nThis hat synergizes reasonably well with [[guardian spirit]], so [[Vine Stalker]]s and [[Demonspawn]] with the Mana Shield mutation may find this hat beneficial to survivability.\n\n==History==\n*Maxwell's etheric cage was removed in version [[0.25]]\n*Prior to version [[0.18]], Maxwell's Etheric Cage did not double contamination.\n*Maxwell's etheric cage was introduced in version [[0.17]].\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Headgear]]"}

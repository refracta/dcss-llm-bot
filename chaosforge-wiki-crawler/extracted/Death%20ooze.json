They are thankfully rare, appearing only in [[the Slime Pits]] or near [[Jiyva]] altars.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The death ooze is one of the most unpleasant sources of rot in the game, second only to [[death drake]]s. They're too fast for most characters to outrun and they have decent magic resistance to go along with their full set of undead resistances. Fortunately they have little actual durability, and killing them from a distance is usually not too difficult. They are susceptible to [[Dispel Undead]], but standard [[Conjuration]] spells also work. If you have to enter melee with them, killing them quickly should avoid unnecessary rot. Weapons of [[holy wrath]] work especially well, but are by no means necessary.\n*Death oozes are one of the possible creatures generated when you attack [[the Royal Jelly]]. Although taking rot damage is generally to be avoided, characters without [[cold]] resistance should worry more about the [[azure jellies]], which can deal very heavy cold damage.\n*By the time you see them, you are likely to have generated a large stock of [[potion of curing|potions of curing]], which you can use to cure the rot with little cost.\n\n==History==\n*Death oozes were removed in [[0.27]]."}

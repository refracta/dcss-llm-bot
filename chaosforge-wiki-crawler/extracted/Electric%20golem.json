{"title":"Electric golem","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Electric_golem","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|constructs}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Electric golems''' are one of the more dangerous monsters in [[the Realm of Zot]]. They move as fast as [[spriggan]]s and [[Blink]] constantly while shooting lightning or annihilating you in melee. They're much more resistant to [[electricity]] and [[poison]] than they are to [[fire]] and [[cold]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Electricity]] resistance and decent [[AC]] are mandatory for survival. If you lack rElec, quaff a [[potion of resistance]] while fighting an electric golem. If you can't kill it before the potion wears off (or if you don't have any potions), [[teleport]] away.\n**Don't even attempt [[Zot:5]] unless you have electricity resistance (though you should have found at least ''something'' by the time you get there).\n*Even if you do have rElec, don't let an electric golem catch you where it can [[multizap]] you. Fight them with either open space or metal walls behind you, and be prepared to move if it blinks to a more dangerous angle.\n*Electric golems have high EV, so you may wish to use unavoidable spells like [[Fireball]] or [[Airstrike]].\n**While electric golems cannot be affected by [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] like other [[list of constructs#Golems|golems]] can, they aren't immune to shrapnel (in fact, their low AC makes it rather effective). [[Earth Elementalist]]s can use surrounding walls to damage them with [[LRD]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.13]], [[fly]]ing would reduce damage from their electicity-branded melee attacks."}

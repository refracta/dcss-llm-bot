The first objective is to go through the changelog below and incorporate all the changes into appropriate wiki articles. ~~Cross out~~ the lines in the changelog once the updates have been done, or if they don't require any changes. If you think a page is up to date, make sure to add [Template:version014](/Template:Version014 \"Template:Version014\") (i.e. {{version014}}) to the page.\n2. The second objective is to go through [Category:Crystal Ball Articles](/Category:Crystal_Ball_Articles \"Category:Crystal Ball Articles\"), update the history section of the pages in there, and remove the crystal ball category (unless they refer to 0.15 or trunk material). There may be some sentences that need to be changed from future to past tense.\n\n### Contributors\n\n- [Flun](/index.php?title=User:Flun\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"User:Flun (page does not exist)\")\n- [CommanderC](/User:CommanderC \"User:CommanderC\")\n- [Derrek](/User:Derrek \"User:Derrek\")\n- [Sildraith](/User:Sildraith \"User:Sildraith\")\n- [MoogleDan](/User:MoogleDan \"User:MoogleDan\")\n- [DC\\_Malleus](/User:DC_Malleus \"User:DC Malleus\")\n- *Add name here*\n\n## 0.14 Changelog\n\n### Stone Soup 0.14 (20140409)\n\n***\n\n- ~~The lower half of D is now a new branch, the Depths.~~\n- ~~Two new species: Formicids and Vine Stalkers.~~\n- ~~~~\n  ~~A new deity: Dithmenos the Shadowed.~~\n- Greatly revised monster sets in the Lair branches.\n- Greatly revised summoning spell sets.\n\n### Branches, environment\n\n***\n\n- ~~The main Dungeon is now fifteen levels.~~\n- ~~~~\n  ~~A new branch: the Depths; entered from the end of Dungeon, it is five levels long and contains the entrance to the Realm of Zot.~~\n- ~~The Vaults are now entered from D:13-14 and need a rune to enter.~~\n- Abyssal stairs appear more frequently, and are fixed with depth.\n- ~~Ziggurats require only three runes to enter; an entrance is guaranteed in Depths, but still spawn as normal in Pan.~~\n- ~~Portals are no longer closed when carrying the Orb of Zot.~~\n- ~~~~\n  ~~The Horn of Geryon is no longer necessary for entering Hell branches.~~\n- Labyrinths contain more enemies, and the minotaur is normally awake.\n- More Ziggurat enemy sets.\n- ~~Crypt endings now contain some pieces of thematic loot: draining and/or pain and/or vampiric weapons, rings of positive energy and amulets of warding, one of several unrands, the Necronomicon, or evokers/staves.~~\n- ~~Easy ice cave portals now appear only in D, Lair, and Orc; hard ice cave portals appear in Elf and rotating Lair branches.~~\n- ~~Portal timers have been generally shortened and made more consistent with each other; additionally, the shorter timer started upon first seeing them has been removed.~~\n- ~~The layout of the last level of the Vaults has been changed, with all four subsections being open at each corner.~~\n- ~~Gadget shops and wand shops have been merged; the resulting gadget shops now also sell rods.~~\n- The price of items in shops has been recalibrated.\n- ~~Pandemonium exits occur more frequently as the player obtains runes from Pandemonium.~~\n\n### Character\n\n***\n\n- ~~New species:~~\n\n  - ~~Formicids possess four strong arms to use large weapons together with shields, in addition to strong natural digging abilities and a permanent stasis effect.~~\n  - ~~Vine stalkers regenerate quickly, but cannot heal with wands or potions; they possess innate spirit shield and an anti-magic bite.~~\n\n- ~~Felids have an innate jump attack ability, allowing them to jump over other monsters and attack their target in a single turn.~~\n\n- ~~Felids can use wands.~~\n\n- ~~Demonspawns' negative energy facet has the second level of rN replaced by \"black mark,\" which gives melee attacks a chance to heal the player and apply a bad status to the victim.~~\n\n- ~~The first two levels of the slow healing mutation only affect rates of healing when enemies are in sight (half and no healing for those levels respectively). Stat regeneration and the third level of the mutation are unchanged.~~\n\n- ~~Fast/slow movement mutations no longer occur randomly.~~\n\n- Recommended backgrounds and species have been adjusted; in particular, backgrounds can recommend species that don't necessarily recommend that background and vice versa (e.g. CK -> Tr may be recommended whereas Tr -> CK is not).\n\n- ~~Poison damage is now deterministic.~~\n\n- ~~The antennae mutation gives invisible monster indicators for every invisible enemy in LOS.~~\n\n- ~~Merfolk can now be mesmerised by mermaids and sirens.~~\n\n- ~~Artificers, Wanderers, Assassins, and Venom Mages no longer start with knowledge of potions and scrolls they don't possess.~~\n\n- ~~Fighters and Gladiators start with higher-tier weapons.~~\n\n- ~~Fighters start with a potion of might.~~\n\n- ~~Demonspawn icemail now restores all at once, instead of gradually, and is not disrupted by casting fire spells.~~\n\n### Monsters\n\n***\n\n- ~~Guardian serpents no longer have Teleport Other; instead they get Blink Allies Encircle.~~\n\n- ~~Lom Lobon can now cast Tornado.~~\n\n- ~~The plain \"dragon\" is now known as \"fire dragon\".~~\n\n- ~~Dragons, drakes, crabs, and acid blobs no longer flee at low health.~~\n\n- ~~Jellies once again split.~~\n\n- ~~Monsters are subject to summon caps.~~\n\n- ~~Summoned creatures are dismissed upon the death of their summoner.~~\n\n- ~~Word of Recall is now subject to a breath timer, and can be interrupted by causing a breath timeout (with e.g. curare).~~\n\n- ~~Minotaurs appearing naturally outside of labyrinths now come with equipment.~~\n\n- ~~Abominations don't heal naturally; those created from spells can heal by melding further with crawling corpses and macabre masses.~~\n\n- ~~New enemies:~~\n\n  - ~~Fauns, who hex the player before attacking from afar, and their larger brethren satyrs, who can empower their nearby allies.~~\n  - ~~- Wind drakes, who can breathe powerful blasts of wind and airstrike the player.- Thorn lotuses, plants adrift on the water that pepper the player with thorns fired from afar.- Thorn hunters, who fire volleys of thorns and create briar patches to impede their foes' movements.- Dryads, who turn the forest against you by casting Awaken Forest like spriggan druids and summoning snaplasher vines that pull their enemies around.- Water nymphs, who passively form a pool of water around themselves and strike down the player with said water.- Shambling mangroves, slow-moving, tough plants home to a nest of ravens or wasps.- Raiju, which can attack by transforming themselves into a bolt of lightning.- Worldbinders, abyssal enemies which summon low tier enemies from other branches.- Shock serpents, who build up electrical energy for a static discharge;- Mana vipers, snakes with an antimagic bite;- Naga sharpshooters, who snipe at the player with Portal Projectile;- Naga ritualists, who can amplify poison in enemies and also cast Olgreb's Toxic Radiance;- Salamander mystics, with Bolt of Magma, Haste Other, a single-target version of Ignite Poison, and Iskenderun's Mystic Blast;- Salamander firebrands, whose attacks cause a ring of flames to appear around the target.~~\n    ~~Octopode crushers, who can throw both the victims they constrict as well as icicles.~~\n\n- ~~A new set of enemies based on demonspawn, appearing in Pan.~~\n  - ~~- Base types:- monstrous (auxiliary attacks and more HP);- gelid (rC++ and icemail - bonus AC which dissipates on fire damage);- infernal (rF++ and fire attacks);- putrid (rPois, gains HP on nearby kills);- torturous (augmentation, powered by pain, and spines).- Classes:- blood saint (Legendary Destruction, which casts random powerful conjurations, and Ephemeral Infusion, which temporarily heals nearby allies);- chaos champions (Chaotic Reflection, which inflicts a random hex-like effect on itself and the target, and Random Bolt as per the rod of destruction);- warmongers (Grand Avatar, essentially a hybrid battlesphere and spectral weapon which triggers on sufficiently damaging attacks of nearby allies, and Sap Magic, a hex which hinders spellcasting success progressively as spells are cast);- corrupters (Plane Rend, which summons high tier enemies from other branches, and Corrupt Body, which inflicts a small set of temporary mutations);~~\n    ~~black suns (Black Mark, which empowers nearby allies with various draining attacks that heal on hit, and previously existing spells Bolt of Draining, Malign Offering, and Dispel Undead).~~\n\n- Adjustments to lair branch enemies:\n\n  - ~~Spriggan druids' Druid's Call now calls 2-3 creatures out of LOS nearby and does not invisibly might creatures; instead, nearby creatures are healed and frenzied on their death.

They can now also cast Iskenderun's Mystic Blast and will summon two clones of themselves at 50% HP as a one-time effect.~~\n  - ~~Giant orange brains get Mass Confusion instead of Confusion.~~\n  - Spriggans in general now merely have fast movement speed instead of fast speed in general, more damage and less EV.\n  - ~~Spriggan air mages have Haste (replacing Shock).~~\n  - ~~- Deep elf

Arrow and Bolt of Magma respectively, and generate with mace-type weapons.- Metal gargoyles are now war gargoyles - fast and with the ability to fire metal fragments at targets.- Crystal golems are

felid ex-familiar with minor spellcasting abilities;~~\n  - ~~Vashnia, leader of a squad of naga sharpshooters with translocational ability to match.~~\n\n- ~~Moths of suppression, rock worms, lava fish, lemures, jellyfish, grey rats, spiny worms, giant amoebae, deep dwarf berserkers, agate snails, giant centipedes, rotting devils, clay golems, and stone golems are no more.~~\n\n- ~~Ball lightnings are no longer permanently confused, instead seeking out targets like giant spores.~~\n\n- ~~Killer Klowns have a different set of possible damage brands: strong poison, pain, drain speed, fire, cold, electric, and anti-magic.~~\n\n- ~~Flying enemies are no longer immune to throwing nets.~~\n\n- ~~- Geryon can fly once again.- Antaeus gains Flash Freeze, an ice conjuration which impedes the target's movement for three turns.~~\n  ~~Player ghosts can retain and cast dazzling spray, which has a chance to cause a confusion effect against the player.~~\n\n- ~~All pandemonium lords now see invisible~~.\n\n- ~~The Enchantress now appears as a normal unique in the Depths.~~\n\n- ~~Josephine has a new spell set - Ghostly Fireball, Dispel Undead, Vampiric Draining, and Animate Dead - and rN+++.~~\n\n- ~~~~\n  ~~Lamia has been de-throned.~~\n\n### Spells\n\n***\n\n- ~~Resisting an enchantment now displays a message showing how difficult in general the target will be to enchant, rather than how well or how poorly they fared on that particular resistance roll.~~\n\n- ~~New spells:~~\n\n  - ~~Summon Lightning Spire (L4 Summoning/Air), which places a lightning spire up to two squares away from the player; it replaces Summon Scorpions in the book of Callings.~~\n  - ~~Summon Guardian Golem (L4 Summoning/Charms), which creates a golem that protects the player with Injury

Mass Abjuration in the Grand Grimoire.~~\n  - ~~Spellforged Servitor (L7 Conjuration/Summoning), which summons a servitor with a subset of the player's most destructive conjurations; it replaces Fireball in the book of Wizardry.~~\n  - ~~Glaciate (L9 Ice/Conjurations), which fires a great blast of ice in a cone, turning slain monsters into blocks of ice and Flash Freezing the survivors; it replaces Ice Storm in the Book of Annihilations.~~\n  - ~~Dragon's Call (L9 Summoning), which for its duration of effect summons dragons near targets at the end of LOS (at the full spell cost per

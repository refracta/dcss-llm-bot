Unlike [[Arga]], however, it's two-handed, and only a few species ([[Troll]]s, [[Ogre]]s, and [[Formicid]]s) can wield it.\n\nWhile it has a low enchantment level, the +7 strength and speed brand easily make up for it. If you're willing to sacrifice the shield slot, and have the strength to use giant clubs, Skullcrusher is one of the strongest weapons out there. Only a [[randart]] giant ([[giant spiked club|spiked]]) club has a chance to surpass it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Skullcrusher had a +0, +5 enchantment level, and only granted +5 strength.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

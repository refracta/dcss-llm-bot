{"title":"List of deep elves","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_deep_elves","type":"raw","data":"{{version|027}}\n''This page is about the various deep elf [[monster]]s.  For the player species, see [[deep elf]].''\n\nThe '''deep elves''' are a race of xenophobic subterranean beings with powerful magic, but most possess only mediocre martial prowess (though there are a few notable exceptions). They populate the [[Elven Halls]], and can occasionally be found in the other [[Dungeon branches]], especially in [[the Vaults]].\n\n==Deep Elf Types==\n{{monsterlink|Deep elf archer}} - Deep elf [[Arcane Marksman|arcane marksmen]] armed with nasty [[hexes]] and [[Repel Missiles]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep elf pyromancer}} - Incendiary mages that focus on [[Fire Magic]] in combat.\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep elf zephyrmancer}} - Mages that harness the power of [[Lightning Bolt|lightning]] to strike down their foes.\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep elf knight}} - Swift fighter-mages who pelt you with mid-level [[Conjuration]]s and [[haste]]d blows of the blade or bow.\n\n===Elite Deep Elves===\nThese powerful elves are most commonly found in great numbers in the treasure vault on Elf:3; outside there, they are uncommon, but often lead other elves.\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep elf blademaster}} - Ravenous blenders that mysteriously resemble elves, they are absolutely vicious with their twin [[short blades]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep elf master archer}} - Even without magic, they're the deadliest archers you can find.\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep elf annihilator}} - Expert combat casters known for one-shotting careless adventurers.\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep elf death mage}} - Spooky elves who rapidly drain you with [[Bolt of Draining]] and raise the dead.\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep elf demonologist}} - Masters in the art of calling up horrors from dark places (and sending nosy adventurers back in exchange).\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep elf elementalist}} - Powerful casters with spells from all four elemental schools of magic.\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep elf sorcerer}} - Yet another deep elf caster, hurling [[damnation]] and [[Corrosive Bolt]]s before casting you into [[the Abyss]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep elf high priest}} - Elite deep elven priests capable of healing and empowering their allies in addition to their powerful smite-targeted abilities.\n\n===Unique Elves===\n{{monsterlink|Dowan}} '''and''' {{monsterlink|Duvessa}} - Twin elves who appear early on; he specializes in magic, she in swords.

Why a mere elf would be wearing a Santa hat is beyond us.\n\n[[category:Elf]]\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

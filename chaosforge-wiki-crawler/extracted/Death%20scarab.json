{"title":"Death scarab","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Death_scarab","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Death scarabs''' are debilitating undead pests that assault intruders in packs, afflicting their foes with [[slow]] and [[vampiric|healing themselves with each bite]]. Groups of death scarabs can be found throughout [[the Tomb]] or in Tomb-themed rune vaults in the [[Spider's  Nest]], and they may be summoned by [[royal mummy|royal mummies]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*On their own, death scarabs are unlikely to kill a character capable of reaching the Tomb, but they make the Tomb's other inhabitants significantly more dangerous. Their [[Slow]] attacks magnify the number of enemy actions, and their erratic swarming behavior often blocks attacks against more serious foes.\n**When possible, kill them at range before they get a chance to affect you, and give yourself time to recover after a fight so you don't find yourself getting [[torment]]ed while slow and injured.\n*Their undead nature makes them immune to [[poison]]. They lack any [[fire]] or [[cold]] resistance, however, making [[Freezing Cloud]] and [[Fireball]] excellent (if noisy) methods for defeating them from a distance.\n*You can rise your own army of death scarabs with [[Infestation]]. Infestation works on any undead, demonic, or nonliving creatures that other Necromancy would fail on, including enemy death scarabs (\"The death scarab's many legs skitter faintly\"). Infestation still works on any undead, demonic, etc. creatures, where other spells would fail.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], you could make death scarab [[zombie]]s and [[simulacra]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], death scarabs used to trail clouds of [[miasma]], but were somewhat less tough. \n*Death scarabs were added in [[0.16]]."}

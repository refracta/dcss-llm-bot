For the evocable item, see [[phantom mirror]].''\n{{flavour|Creates a phantom copy of a creature. The copy will be somewhat fragile, but otherwise almost indistinguishable from the original.}}\n\n'''Phantom Mirror''' is a monster-only spell which summons a copy of any monster in the caster's line of sight. This duplicate will have 35% of the original's [[HP]], but will otherwise be indistinguishable from the original. All decoys will disappear when the source creature or the caster is slain. The spell has a 50% chance to swap the position of the original with its phantom in order to prevent you from knowing which is real.\n\nWhen low on HP, a [[rakshasa]] can create two copies of itself using this spell. These emergency clones will have 50% of the original's HP.\n\n{{monsters with spell|Phantom Mirror}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.24]], clones of other monsters would have 286% HP, and clones of a rakshasa would have 200% HP. This was a bug.\n*In [[0.16]], [[phantom mirror|an item]] with the same name as this spell was added.\n*Phantom Mirror was introduced in [[0.14]], replacing [[Rakshasa Summon]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

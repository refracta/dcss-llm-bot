{"title":"Fire crab","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fire_crab","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Fire crabs''' are fairly durable crustaceans with fiery melee attacks and the ability to flood their surroundings with [[cloud]]s of flame. Fortunately, they are only found in the deeper sections of [[the Dungeon]], [[the Depths]], and [[the Vaults]]. You can also find them in a volcano-themed [[Lair]] end-vault and in actual [[volcano]]es, wading through lava.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Fire resistance]] can significantly reduce their damage output.\n*Don't expect running away to do you much good. Even if you can escape the clouds in a step, they'll be likely to blast you with new clouds. Kill them quick to take the fire out at the source!\n*They have moderately low willpower. [[Wand]]s can work at disabling them, though it may take a few tries.\n*They are vulnerable to [[poison]], so poison in general is effective. Waiting for poison to tick down can be dangerous without rF+, however.\n\n==History==\n*Fire crabs can travel through [[lava]] since [[0.31]]."}

Like Wizards, the Conjurer starts with the Magic Dart spell, in their case from a library of destructive conjurations.}}\n'''Conjurers''' are offensive spellcasters who specialize in violent and volatile non-elemental [[Conjurations]]. Relative to other magical backgrounds, they begin the game with a great Conjurations skill, and the most Intelligence of any background.\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Deep Elf]], [[Naga]], [[Tengu]], [[Draconian]], [[Djinni]], and [[Demigod]] are the recommended species if you pick a Conjurer Background.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[robe]]\n*[[Potion of magic]]\n\n'''Available Spells:'''\n*[[Magic Dart]]\n*[[Searing Ray]]\n*[[Fulminant Prism]]\n*[[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]]\n\nConjurers start with the [[Magic Dart]] spell already memorised.\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Stealth]]: 2\n*[[Spellcasting]]: 2\n*[[Conjurations]]: 4\n\nChoosing Conjurer adds 10 to your starting [[Intelligence]], 3 to your starting [[Dexterity]], but reduces starting [[Strength]] by 1.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe Conjurer starting book contains a variety of pure [[Conjurations]] attack spells. Once they get to [[XL]] 2, Conjurers receive a variety of strong, reliable, and irresistible spells to inflict damage on their foes. This puts them in stark contrast to elementalists and Alchemists, who may face enemies that resist their spells.\n\nThe Conjurations skill is very flexible; contributing to the power and failure of many elemental spells, if/when you get them.\n\n===Spell Details===\nConjurers have access to [[Searing Ray]] at XL2, a strong overall spell, if a bit plain. It can be recast for only 1 MP by waiting (pressing '.', also automatically done with autofight). Their starting spell, [[Magic Dart]] is somewhat weaker. Magic Dart has a few benefits; it never misses and has a full-screen range.\n\nBoth [[Fulminant Prism]] and [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] are very useful, though you should generally get Prism first (since it deals more damage). Prism creates a stationary summon; after 2 turns, it explodes in a 3Ã—3 area. Against a 100% speed monster, you should put a prism one space ahead - but not in the direct path of - the monster. That way, you don't get hurt and the monster does.\n\nIskenderun's Mystic Blast is a support spell great for knocking enemies back, or damaging multiple enemies. Surrounded? Say no more; it's just as potent as, and more reliable than, [[Blink]] for this purpose.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Conjurers also started with [[Dazzling Flash]].\n*In 0.29, most backgrounds were buffed; all Mage backgrounds gained a [[potion of magic]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Conjurers started with the [[Book of Conjurations]], which had the spells Conjurers do now.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], their starting [[stat]]s were +6 Int / +4 Dex / +2 Str. They were swapped with the newly named [[Hedge Wizard]].\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the [[Book of Conjurations]] had [[Dazzling Spray]] instead of [[Dazzling Flash]] and also contained [[Force Lance]].\n*Prior to [[0.20]], the Book of Conjurations had [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere]] instead of Force Lance.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], they started with 20 gold and 1 Spellcasting instead of 2.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], their starting spell book included a variety of Ice/Air elemental spells, plus [[Magic Dart]].\n*Prior to [[0.9]], Conjurers could pick between a Fire/Earth and Ice/Air book; Conjurers now receive the latter, with the notable addition of [[Mephitic Cloud]].\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

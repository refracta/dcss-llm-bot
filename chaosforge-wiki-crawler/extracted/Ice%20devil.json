{"title":"Ice devil","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ice_devil","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ice devils''' are [[cold]]-themed [[tier-4 demon]]s. For a low-level character, they are a tough melee opponent (16 + 7-23 cold damage). They can be found in [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], in and around [[Ice cave]]s, or created by [[Summon Demon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*When guarding the entrance to an Ice cave, or spawned by Summon Demon, they can appear dangerously early. While other monsters around mid-Dungeon can hit harder, ice devils have fairly good defenses, which makes it tough to win a melee fight.\n*Having cold resistance will take much of the sting out of their melee attacks.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.18]], ice devils were [[tier-3 demon]]s and were stronger.\n*Ice devils were once considered [[tier-2 demon]]s.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

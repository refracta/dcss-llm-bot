Like with other miscellaneous evocables, only 1 gravitambourine (or phial of floods) will spawn in a given game.\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe radius of the gravitambourine's effect increases with [[Evocations]] skill, as well as its collision damage. The radius starts at 2, increasing to radius 3 above 9.5 Evocations, and radius 4 above 23.2 Evocations.\n\n==Strategy==\nIts damage may be rather mediocre, but Gell's gravitambourine is a powerful escape evoker, particularly at moderate to high Evocations, as it can be used to reliably remove monsters from melee range and hold them away from you for several turns, while you can dispatch them from a distance or escape.\n\nIf you are surrounded by monsters near a [[staircase]], you can activate this item before taking the stairs to guarantee that enemies won't follow you to the other floor.\n\n==History==\n*Added in [[0.32]]. Alternates with the [[phial of floods]].\n\n{{Evocables}}"}

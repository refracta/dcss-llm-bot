It is especially effective against shape-changing creatures.}}\n\nA '''wand of polymorph''' will attempt to permanently transform one monster into another, or temporarily transform the player.\n\n==Useful Info==\nUnless resisted by [[willpower]], a targeted monster will evaporate and instantly reform as another random creature; this will drop all of their equipment (though their new form will pick it back up, if able), heal them significantly, and clear any ongoing [[status effect]]s. Their new form will be one out of three monsters of the same [[holiness]]. This is displayed when targeting the wand, and is designated for every individual monster. Polymorph has no effect on the [[undead]] or [[nonliving]], but [[demon]]s are still affected.\n\nNormal casters lose their spells when polymorphed, and polymorph will never turn a monster into an \"actual\" spellcaster. The new form will gain \"innate\" abilities of their new form, like a [[dragon]]'s breath, but not spells with the wizard (like [[orc wizard]]s) or divine (like [[spriggan berserker]]s) [[spell slot flags]]. Note that most demons' spells are considered innate abilities, so the new form will have its respective spells. Uniques retain their name, but not their spells.\n\nFollowers of [[Zin]] incur piety loss and [[penance]] if they zap this wand.\n\n===Special===\n*When targeting a player, it temporarily transforms them into a [[bad form]]. While some of these have useful traits, you'll most likely become something more or less helpless in combat.\n*When targeting an [[ugly thing]] or [[very ugly thing]], it causes them to change colour with 100% success.\n*When targeting a [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]] or [[glowing shapeshifter]], it causes them to change form with 100% success.\n\n==Strategy==\nUse with caution. While this wand ''can'' turn dangerous monsters into creatures that are easier to deal with, it can also turn them into even ''worse'' monsters.\n\n===Good targets===\n*{{monsterlink|Electric eel}}: They'll turn into a less dangerous flying or water-capable creature.\n*{{monsterlink|Hornet}}: Despite how dangerous they are, hornets have fairly low HD and [[willpower]].\n* {{brown|c}} [[File:Centaur (monster).png]] '''[[Centaur (monster)|Centaur]]''': Low HD and Willpower means they will most of the time be turned into a creature incapable of using their notoriously lethal bows.\n*{{monsterlink|Boggart}} (and other low-HD summoners): Although fragile, summoners can bring lethal reinforcements into play. Fortunately, they have low enough HD that the polymorph results are usually pretty pathetic.\n*{{monsterlink|Orc wizard}} and {{monsterlink|Orc priest}}: Usually you'll have better ways to deal with these guys, but polymorph tends to make them into something less dangerous.\n*{{monsterlink|Anaconda}}: They have moderately high HD, but low willpower, and whatever they polymorph into is at least likely to be something you can more easily escape from.\n*{{monsterlink|Unseen horror}}: If you can get them in a corridor to line up the shot, this is a good way to make them visible. Despite their name and glyph, they are natural monsters and have only modest HD, making polymorph pretty safe.\n*{{monsterlink|Moth of wrath}} and {{monsterlink|Death drake}}: They have ''very'' low will and HD for enemies often found around [[Zot]]; berserked monsters and [[miasma]] are almost certainly more dangerous than the end result.\n*{{monsterlink|Ice beast}} (or other elementally-attuned monsters): If you're fighting something that resists all of your spells, turn it into something you can actually fight.\n*{{monsterlink|Sigmund}} (and other well-armed [[unique]]s): If he turns into anything but a humanoid, his branded scythe, spells, and wands will be useless.\n\n===Bad targets===\n*{{monsterlink|Hydra}}: High HD, meaning there's a reasonable chance you could get a [[dragon]]. Most characters can run away from hydras (and should if they lack a means to kill them).\n*{{monsterlink|Death yak}}: Also high HD, and has unusually high willpower as well.\n*{{monsterlink|Ghost moth}}: High will means that it's better to just kill them.\n*{{monsterlink|Gastronok}}: He has HD 20. This means he can become a [[titan]]. You don't want to fight Gastronok the titan.\n\n===Self targeting===\nRemember that you are also a valid target for polymorph, and you ignore your own willpower. This is usually dubious: there's 5 [[bad form]]s, so at least one can actively harm you.\n\nBut in the early game, you may have few other options. Most forms can help an early game character out:\n* [[Tree Form]] - High AC, relatively strong [[Unarmed Combat]], poison resistance. Can't move or teleport, melds armour.\n* [[Fungus Form]] - [[Confusing]] Unarmed attacks, poison resistance. Can't move when monsters are visible, melds all equipment.\n* [[Bat Form]] & [[Pig Form]] - Fast movement. Melds all equipment, melds rings, and prevents spellcasting.\n* [[Wisp Form]] - Many resistances. Melds all equipment.\nE.g. when next to a dangerous melee enemy on D:4 or so, 4 of the 5 forms can help you (Tree & Fungus increase combat ability, Bat & Pig let you run).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], wands of polymorph could change monsters into any eligible monster of the same holiness. Though it heavily favored forms of similar [[HD]], monsters with few options could get weird results, like [[Grinder]] turning into a [[hellephant]]. Therefore, there was no indication of what a monster might turn into.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], wands of polymorph could have at most 24 charges.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], [[unique]]s would retain their spells post-polymorph if they became an intelligent form that could speak.\n*Wands of polymorph was added in [[0.12]], replacing the very similar [[wand of polymorph other]]. The latter would inflict permanent [[bad mutations]] on you instead of temporary bad forms. You also could not target yourself.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Polymorph]]\n\n{{wands}}"}

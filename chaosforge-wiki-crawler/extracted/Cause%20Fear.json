{"title":"Cause Fear","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cause_Fear","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Cause Fear''' is a level 4 [[Hexes]] spell which attempts to panic all monsters in your [[line of sight]], causing them to run away from your current position.\n\n[[Hexslinger]]s start with this spell available. Reading a [[scroll of fear]] has the same effect as casting Cause Fear with maximum power.\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe '''Fear''' status (fleeing) causes vulnerable monsters to run away, unwilling to attack you. Monsters will be able to use abilities tagged with the escape flag, such as [[Blink]].\n\nMonsters will lose the fear status under the following conditions:\n*They are hit by an attack.\n*They are unable to move away from you for more than 1 turn (\"Cornered, <monster> turns to fight!\").\n*The duration runs out.\n\nThe following monsters are immune to fear:\n*[[Undead]], [[nonliving]], and [[:Category:Plant holiness|plant holiness]] monsters.\n*Monsters that are [[berserk]] or under [[frenzy]]\n\nIn order for the spell to inflict the fear status, it must beat the enemy's [[willpower]]. Like other \"mass enchantments\", Cause Fear has an enchantment power multiplier of 3/2.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|beam.cc|1792}}</ref> See the [[Willpower#Resisting enchantments|Willpower]] article for more details.\n\nThe [[scroll of fear]] casts Cause Fear at 200 post-multiplier spellpower (equates to 96 enchantment power).\n\n==Strategy==\nDespite its numerous conditions, Cause Fear is a powerful spell. It is good at crowd-control: even if you don't scare everything, fear can be used to thin out a group, making it easier to both escape and fight it.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Can be used with dangerous clouds, such as from a [[scroll of poison]] or [[Freezing Cloud]], to inflict severe damage at a safe distance.\n*Against the monster Cause Fear, you can break sight in order to end the spell. In the [[Shoals]], a [[wand of flame]] or [[Fire Magic]] can create steam clouds, which block LOS. You could also use a [[scroll of fog]], use ranged attacks like [[javelin]]s, or just run away.\n\n==Monster Version==\nThe monster version of Cause Fear makes the player unable to move toward the caster. If the caster closes to melee range, the player will still be able to engage them in melee, but may sometimes \"flinch away in fear\" (33% chance<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|melee-attack.cc|282}}</ref>), causing the attack to miss. Depending on how well you can fight from a distance and what areas of the floor this cuts you off from, this may or may not be a problem. Fear also prevents the player from going [[berserk]].\n\nHigh willpower can prevent this spell from affecting you, and [[clarity]] confers immunity to this spell. Leaving the monster's [[line of sight]] will immediately end the spell's effects.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], fleeing monsters would not recklessly run into harmful [[cloud]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the spell couldn't affect demonic and holy monsters.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the [[scroll of blinking]] and [[scroll of teleport]] were valid escape options. Also, fleeing monsters would use \"emergency\" flag spells rather than \"escape\" flag ones. This caused [[black bear]]s and [[polar bear]]s to be practically immune to fear; they would immediately [[berserk]] when inflicted with fear, which ended the fear.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Cause Fear only penalized moving toward the caster. Attacks against the caster were unaffected.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

{"title":"Mulch","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mulch","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n'''Mulch''' is a term for ammo destruction in Crawl. Every time you fire or throw a unit of ammo, there is a chance that that unit will be mulched. The odds of this happening depends on the particular item used.\n*[[Stone]]s: 100%\n*Poisoned [[Dart]]s: 8.33%\n*[[Javelin]]s, [[Boomerang]]s: 5%\n*[[Large rock]]s: 4%\n*[[Throwing net]]s: Special. Nets corrode when creatures struggle out of them. The more a creature struggles, the less likely it is to recover the net, until it is destroyed.\n\nBrands also can affect mulch rates:\n*[[Dispersal_(brand)|Dispersal]] [[Dart]]s: 100%.\n*Other [[Dart]]s: 16.67%\n\nWhen boomerangs, javelins, or large rocks mulch, they deal an extra +33% damage.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], there was no bonus damage on mulch.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], [[ranged weapon]]s had their own ammo: [[sling bullet]]s, [[arrow]]s, and [[bolt]]s mulched 12.5% of the time. [[Stone]]s also mulched only 12.5% of the time.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], [[Exploding]] ammo existed, which always mulched.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], steel ammo had a decreased mulch rate. Large rock mulch rate was increased in this version.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], enchantment bonuses were available on ammo, decreasing mulch rates.\n*Prior to [[0.5]], enchantment bonus did not increase a unit of ammo's odds of survival.\n\n\n[[Category:Game_mechanics]]"}

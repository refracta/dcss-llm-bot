{"title":"Deep elf knight","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Deep_elf_knight","type":"raw","data":"{{version027}}\n{{list of | deep elves}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Deep elf knights''' are the toughest of the [[list of deep elves|deep elf]] fighter-mages. Like many of their peers, they generate with long or short blades, light armour, and occasionally a bow or a buckler. Unlike their peers, they have nearly as much durability as an [[orc knight]], but their offensive capabilities are only slightly improved. They are most commonly found in the [[Elven Halls]] and near the entrance to [[the Vaults]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While by no means harmless, you usually have more to worry about from the various pure-caster deep elf types.\n*Be careful of them if they generate with a good weapon: a deep elf knight with a good [[long sword]] of [[flaming]] or [[electrocution]] can ruin your day.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], deep elf knights could have one of two possible spell sets:\n**[[Stone Arrow]] (3d18), [[Force Lance]] (3d14), and [[Haste]]\n**[[Throw Icicle]] (3d20), [[Haste]], and [[Invisibility]]\n*Prior to [[0.25]], their first spell set had [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] instead of [[Force Lance]].\n\n[[category:Elf]]"}

{"title":"Explore mode","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Explore_mode","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Explore mode''' is a special mode to ''Crawl''; whenever you would normally die, you can choose to come back to life, with no limit. Explore mode games don't count as proper games, and are thus not [[score]]d. Explore mode can be entered using the '''+''' key, unless it has been disabled.\n\nBy default, explore mode is available on both offline games and online servers. The [[rcfile|configuration option]] ''explore_mode'' can be used to start new games in explore mode, or disallow entering the mode at all.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Wizard mode]], a more robust cheating/debug mode.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], players (without admin access) couldn't use explore mode on online servers.\n*Explore mode was added to Crawl in [[0.16]].\n*Explore mode is also included in a few other roguelikes, most notably NetHack. Its purpose was to give players some form of cheating mode without having to use wizmode. Wizmode requires admin access on certain UNIX systems, and in Crawl, it could be used to crash online servers."}

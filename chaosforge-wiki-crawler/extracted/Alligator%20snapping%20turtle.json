{"title":"Alligator snapping turtle","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Alligator_snapping_turtle","type":"raw","data":"{{version024}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Alligator snapping turtles''' are one of the beefiest threats faced in [[the Shoals]]. These brutes hit as hard as [[kraken]]s (though thankfully without the multiple limbs) and have a [[reaching]] attack, making them especially deadly if you're distracted by a pack of [[harpy|harpies]] or [[merfolk (monster)|merfolk]]. Fortunately, they move slowly on land, and they are not resistant to any elements or [[poison]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Don't mistake them for regular snapping turtles. While snapping turtles are dangerous enough, these things are even worse.\n*Remember that it's easy to run from slow enemies. There's no sense in dying in melee to something you can easily [[kite]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], they could [[Withdrawn|retreat]] inside their shells at low HP."}

The caster becomes highly evasive and gains a poisonous bite, but gains vulnerability to poison. \n\nWhile transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded, and casting spells becomes slightly more difficult.}}\n\n'''Spider Form''' is a level 3 [[Poison Magic|Poison]]/[[Transmutations|Transmutation]] spell that transforms the user into a spider-like creature.\n\n[[Transmuter]]s start with this spell in their library.\n\n==Useful Info==\nCasting this spell gives you Spider Form for a spellpower-dependent duration. You'll gain the following:\n\n'''Combat'''\n*'''Innate AC:''' 2\n*'''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' 5 base damage, with an added [[venom]] brand.\n*'''Stat Bonus:''' +5 [[dexterity]]\n\n'''Resistances'''\n*[[Poison resistance|Poison vulnerability (rPois-)]]\n*Immune to [[web]]s.\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n*'''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' All [[armour]], [[weapon]] and [[shield]].\n*Cannot [[throw]] items.\n*Makes [[spell]]s harder to cast (increases [[Spell Success#Modifiers|raw spell failure]] rate by +10%).\n\n'''Other'''\n*'''[[Size#Tiny|Tiny]]'''-sized, increasing your [[EV]].\n*Suppresses many [[mutation]]s. Species [[movement delay]] set to 1.0.\n\nLike all form changing spells, [[mummies]], [[ghoul]]s, and bloodless [[vampire]]s cannot use this spell.\n\nThe duration of the transformation is <code>8 + 2d<power></code> turns, capped at 60.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|form-data.h|78}}</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\nSpider Form gives access to [[venom]]-branded attacks. A [[dagger]] of venom is a strong weapon up into [[Lair]], and spider fangs are even better. Once enemies are extremely poisoned (3 poison drops in Tiles), you can back off, letting the toxins do their work. It also gives a bonus to [[EV]].\n\nHowever, Spider Form has several downsides:\n*The evasion bonus is helpful, but be aware that when monsters ''do'' manage to land a hit, you'll have very low [[AC]] to reduce it.\n*While [[Octopodes]] and [[Felid]]s don't have much AC to begin with, both species still lose ''something'' with spider form. Octopodes lose their constriction. Felids lose their fast movement speed.\n*rPois- is a liability against adders and the like, unless you happen to have poison immunity.\n*You can't throw things like [[dart]]s in Spider Form.\nBy the time you enter [[Lair]] - a branch with many poisonous enemies, and many enemies with rPois - Spider Form starts to get weak. Even if you ignored all the poison, the lack of any AC or [[SH]] becomes very noticeable. Transmuters will want to upgrade to [[Ice Form]], or stick to base unarmed combat.\n\nWith that being said, it can be great in the early Dungeon. Transmuters can afford 1-2 levels of Poison Magic in order to get the spell running. Even at 30% + failure, this spell is reasonable to use - all you need is 1 successful cast in order to transform.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

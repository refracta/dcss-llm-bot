The selected square must be visible, monster-free, and cannot be behind a [[Wall#Translucent_Rock|translucent wall]]. You must be able to stand on the tile, though you can blink into dangerous [[cloud]]s if you want. The scroll is consumed when read, though it can be canceled if already [[scroll of identify|identified]].\n\n==Strategy==\nScrolls of blinking are one of, if not the, strongest escape tools in the game. Using 1 scroll can get you out of attack range, allowing you to make a quick escape. Using 1-2 scrolls, when combined with other consumables, will bail you out of almost any situation. \n\nDue to their strength and reliability, these scrolls should be conserved whenever possible. If you can use another consumable earlier in a fight, then you won't have to waste a precious scroll. At the same time, don't hesitate to burn a blink scroll if it's your only reliable way to survive.\n\nNote that scrolls of blinking are not infallible. The following things will interfere with their use:\n\n*Being unable to read scrolls: being [[silence]]d, [[confused]], [[berserk]], [[brainless]] (0 Int), or having [[No Unsafe Scrolls]].\n*Being unable to translocate: [[Dimension Anchor|-Tele]], [[Tree Form]]. Note that [[Blink (status)|-Blink]] does ''not'' prevent this scroll from working (it only stops the [[Blink]] spell).\n*Attempting to blink while [[constriction|constricted]] may fail. Blinking treats the number of escape attempts as 1 higher, so it has better odds than simply moving, but it's not guaranteed.\n*Not having [[LOS]] to a proper escape route. Using [[fog]] can interfere with sight. Being in a dangerous area, like [[the Tomb]], may not have a safe area to begin with.\n*Try not to blink into an unexplored area. A squad of [[yaktaur]]s waiting behind an unexplored corner will have a free turn to shoot at you if you land right next to them.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], scrolls of blinking induced magical contamination. In addition, using one in [[Zot]] or while holding the [[orb of Zot]] caused an uncontrolled blink instead.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], scrolls of blinking functioned normally while in Zot.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], reading a scroll of blinking caused no magic contamination and would always escape from constriction.\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

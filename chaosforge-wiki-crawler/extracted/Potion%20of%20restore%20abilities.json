It also allows to use a breath weapon again, cancelling the delay.}}\n\n[[Quaff]]ing a '''potion of restore abilities''' immediately heals all [[stat]] damage your character is currently suffering from, restoring your stats to their maximal values. This can be used to avoid the [[stat zero|negative effects]] of having a stat below 1. It also has a secondary effect, immediately ending the cool down period for any [[breath weapon]]s you may have used. In spite of the [[potion]]'s name, this has no effect on your character's [[ability|abilities]], nor does it restore [[rot]]ted [[HP]]s.\n{{crawlquote|''You feel refreshed.''}}\n\n==Limitations==\nStats modified by the following sources are ''unaffected'' by the potion:\n*a [[potion of cure mutation]] which eliminated a stat gain\n*an [[Good mutations#Improved Attributes|Improved Attributes]] mutation\n*a [[bad mutations#Reduced Attributes|Reduced Attributes]] mutation\n*the [[Shuffle#Shuffle Card|Shuffle]] card\n*[[Jiyva]]'s stat shuffling\n*[[Zin]]'s [[Zin#Given Abilities|Cure all mutations]] ability\n*wearing or wielding equipment that reduces or improves your stats\n\nFuture stat loss due to the [[bad mutations#Deterioration|Deterioration]] mutation will continue.\n\n==History==\n*This item was removed in [[0.17]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], eating a [[royal jelly (item)|royal jelly]] had the same effect as a potion of restore abilities."}

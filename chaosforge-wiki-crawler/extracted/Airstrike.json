The spell uses [[smite-targeting]], able to target anything in your [[line of sight]] with perfect accuracy. For every empty tile adjacent to your target, the damage increases. Empty tiles are devoid of creatures (including the caster) or walls.\n\n[[Air Elementalist]]s start with this spell in their libraries.\n\n==Strategy==\nAirstrike is a useful spell for its smite-targeted, irresistible damage. [[Air Elementalist]]s can use it to kill electric-resistant enemies like [[sky beast]]s (among other things). Summoners can use Airstrike to attack behind their summons.\n\nMost of this spell's damage comes from the empty space bonus. At moderate levels of power, Airstrike deals 2d5 base damage, but 2d21 damage with 8 empty spaces - a huge boost. Since the empty space bonus is unaffected by spell power, even a low power Airstrike will deal good damage. Don't be afraid to snipe weaker enemies in a cramped space, but take advantage of empty space as much as possible.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*If there's little/no open space around the opponent, Shock and Static Discharge will be more efficient to cast.\n*Airstrike's targeter will treat any unknown space as solid, to avoid leaking information (as a wall/monster ''could'' be there). If the space is empty, though, you'll still get the space bonus.\n\n==Monster Version==\nThis spell is known by a number of opponents, who can hit you from any distance. Like the player spell, each empty tile adds +2 to the die roll.\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Airstrike dealt <code>5 + M + Md[2 + (power)/7]/M</code> damage, for M = empty tiles, 3 minimum. This meant the empty space bonus  was significantly weaker, for both players and monsters.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Airstrike dealt 50% bonus damage to [[flying]] targets.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Airstrike damage did not vary based on the empty space around the target. The old formula was :<code>8 + 1d(2 + power/7)</code>\n*Prior to [[0.22]], some enemies could resist wind damage, including [[Tornado]].\n*In [[0.20]], the Airstrike damage formula was given a much-wanted simplification. The old formula was:\n:<code>7 + 1d(1d4 1 + (1d(power) - 1)/6) + (1d(power) - 1)/7)</code>"}

{"title":"Rod","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Rod","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\nA '''rod''' is a magical cudgel, similar to a [[wand]] or [[magical staff]], but with some key differences.\n\n==Useful Info==\nRods are equivalent to [[club]]s in melee (including use of [[Maces & Flails]] skill). \n\nWhen wielded, a rod can be e'''v'''oked for a variety of magical effects. Unlike spells, rods have their own MP pool. It replenishes and depletes independently from your MP. [[Evocations]] skill increases the strength of cast spells, as well as the MP regeneration rate.\n\nRods are displayed as a <code>+X rod of <name> (Y/Z)</code>.\n* +X is [[enchant]]ment of the rod. This increases a rods melee damage, as well as its MP recharge rate. A base +0 rod recharges at ~ 0.04 MP/turn, and each +1 adds +0.01 MP/turn. [[Evocations]] also increases recharge rate, by 0.057 MP/turn per level.\n* <name> is the type of rod, which determines the spells the rod can cast.\n* Y is the current MP of the rod, and Z is the maximum MP of the rod.\n\nA [[scroll of recharging]] will add +1d2 to enchantment and maximum mana. The [[Deep Dwarf]] recharging ability works in the same way. Rods have a limit of +9 enchantment and 17 max MP.\n\n[[Spell power]] is solely based on Evocations skill; each spell cast by a rod has a power of <code>5 + 3 * Evocations</code>.\n\n===Hunger cost===\nHunger reduction works differently from spells. Rod spells have the same base hunger cost as a spell of its level, but this is reduced by 10 × Evocations, instead of [[Intelligence]] × Spellcasting. Additionally, spell hunger from rods cannot be fully eliminated; there will always be a hunger cost of at least 5.\n\nThe reported hunger cost can be decoded to the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Reported cost !! Per-casting cost\n|-\n| #...... || 5-20\n|-\n| ##..... || 21-60\n|-\n| ###.... || 61-120\n|-\n| ####... || 121-200\n|-\n| #####.. || 201-300\n|-\n| ######. || 301-420\n|-\n| ####### || 420+\n|}\n\nFor reference, a flesh chunk gives 1,000 nutrition, and meat ration gives 5,000.\n\n==List of rods==\n''See also: [[List of rods]], for both rods and their spells''\n\n* [[Rod of clouds]]\n* [[Rod of ignition]]\n* [[Rod of inaccuracy]]\n* [[Iron rod]]\n* [[Rod of shadows]]\n\n===Removed rods===\n* [[Rod of destruction]] - removed in [[0.18]]\n* [[Rod of the swarm]] - removed in [[0.18]]\n* [[Rod of striking]] - removed in [[0.16]]\n* [[Rod of demonology]] - removed in [[0.14]]\n* [[Rod of fiery destruction]] - removed in [[0.14]], replaced with rod of ignition\n* [[Rod of frigid destruction]] - removed in [[0.14]]\n* [[Rod of venom]] - removed in [[0.14]]\n* [[Rod of warding]] - removed in [[0.14]]\n* [[Rod of Summoning]] - removed in [[0.12]], replaced with rod of the swarm\n* [[Rod of smiting]] - removed in [[0.11]]\n* [[Rod of discovery]] - removed in [[0.8]]\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Rods are generally ineffectual as melee weapons. While a +9 rod may seem as an appealing weapon, it only hits as hard as a club. \n*Maxing out rods may require more scrolls of recharging than you have on hand, and you may wish to save some of those for useful wands. Nonetheless, it helps to at least tune useful rods up so that their max MP is an even multiple of the cost of the most frequently used spell.\n*Most rods found laying around in the dungeon have mediocre or even negative recharge rates, but a rod generated by a [[scroll of acquirement]] will usually have a high recharge rate. So long as Evocations higher than all your other magic skills, you have 80% chance to get a rod you don't already own if you request a staff. [[Trog]] worshipers who select a staff from an [[acquirement]] will either receive a rod or a [[staff of energy]].\n\n==Comparison to Spellcasting==\nRods do have advantages over regular spellcasting, but they also have several shortcomings.\n\n===Advantages===\n* Rods rely entirely on [[Evocations]]. Heavy [[body armour]], [[shields]], and low intelligence will not penalize casting. Many species are bad at magic, but at least competent at Evocations.\n* Rods are not subject to the [[Spell Power#Formula|spellpower stepdown]], so it is easier to train rods past 50 spellpower.\n* Rods do not drain your own MP, leaving it free for other things.\n* Rods can be used while [[silence]]d.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n* Rods are independent of your stats. High-stat races such as elves and [[Demigod]]s enjoy no advantage in spell power, failure rate, or hunger costs when using them.\n* Rods must be wielded. This significantly decreases tactical flexibility in using rods, is annoying for weapon-wielders and can prove a real danger if the rod should end up [[curse]]d somehow.\n* Rods are ultimately capped at 86 power (at Evocations 27). This has a significant impact on higher-level spells like [[Iron Shot]].\n* The hunger cost of rod use can be significant for some races. [[Spriggan]]s in particular may want to use rods sparingly.\n** Rod hunger can never be entirely eliminated. While the 5 nutrition minimum is generally ignorable, the minimum costs for level 5 and 6 spells (80 and 280, respectively) from rods are not.\n* Rods have a fairly small pool of mana, capped at 17, which can limit the usefulness of spells that you will want to cast repeatedly, such as [[Abjuration]].\n* Rods have a somewhat limited selection of spells, and you must obtain the relevant rods first.\n* Rods take up space in your inventory, whereas spells do not.\n\n===Images===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n| [[File:Rod00.png]] || [[File:Rod01.png]] || [[File:Rod02.png]] || [[File:Rod03.png]] || [[File:Rod04.png]]\n|-\n| [[File:Rod05.png]] || [[File:Rod06.png]] || [[File:Rod07.png]] || [[File:Rod08.png]] || [[File:Rod09.png]]\n|}\n\n==See Also==\n*[[List of rods]]\n*[[Magical staff]]\n*[[Wands]]\n\n==History==\n*All rod items were removed in [[0.20]].

{"title":"Centaur","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Centaur","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n''This page is about the obsolete player [[species]]. For the monster, see [[Centaur (monster)]]. For a list of all monstrous centaurs, see [[List of centaurs]].''\n{{flavour|The Centaurs are another species of hybrid creatures: horses with Human torsos. They usually live in forests, surviving by hunting.\n\nCentaurs can move very quickly on their four legs, and are excellent with bows and other missile weapons; they are also reasonable at fighting in general while being slow learners at specific weapon skills. They advance quite slowly in experience levels and are rather sub-par at using magic. Like Nagas, they receive reduced protection from the body armour they wear.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*Centaurs are hybrids, half-horse and half-man:\n**'''[[Deformed]]''': Centaurs only gain half the base AC from [[body armour]].\n**Centaurs get an [[EV]] and [[Dodging]] penalty, due to their size.\n**Centaurs can equip [[centaur barding]]s, but not [[boots]].\n**Centaurs are large enough to attack normally while standing in [[shallow water]] (though they still move slowly through it).\n**Centaurs require less skill to use [[shields]] effectively than other [[Size#medium|medium-sized]] races.\n*'''[[Tough Skin]] 3''': Centaurs have extremely tough skin (AC +3).\n*'''[[Hooves]] 3''': Centaurs have a kick [[auxiliary attack]]. Hooves reduce [[stealth]] by -20 if you aren't [[flying]].\n*'''[[Fast]] 2''': Centaurs cover ground very quickly during [[movement]]. (0.7 [[decaAut]] per tile, equal to 14.2 monster \"speed\"; slightly slower than [[centaur (monster)|monster centaurs]]).\n\nCentaurs have a base [[Strength]] of 10, [[Intelligence]] of 7 and [[Dexterity]] of 4 (before [[background]] modifiers).\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Warriors:''' [[Fighter]], [[Gladiator]], [[Hunter]]\n*'''Warrior-mages:''' [[Warper]], [[Arcane Marksman]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[strength]] or [[dexterity]] (equal chance) every 4th level.\n*10% more [[HP]] than average.\n*10% less [[MP]] than average.\n*+3 [[magic resistance]] per level.\n\n==Starting Skills and Equipment==\nCentaurs start with the skills and equipment listed for their background.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Moderate}}\n\nDue to having high [[HP]] and fast [[move speed]], Centaurs are a very forgiving species. Speed allows Centaurs to [[kite]] most targets, disengage from many bad fights, reposition favorably, and avoid being surrounded. High HP, especially when compared to the other fast species ([[Spriggan]]s and [[Felid]]s), means that you're less likely to die from [[orc priest]]s and the like. They have an amazing [[Bows (skill)|Bows]] aptitude, but any sort of ranged attack can work well too.\n\nCentaurs are not without their problems (poor defensive aptitudes, low stealth, [[Deformed]] mutation), but the benefits far outweigh the cons. The innate +3 AC from [[Tough Skin]] counteracts Deformed; Centaurs only get a net AC loss when wearing heavier armours. Plus, they can wear [[centaur barding]]s, which give more AC than boots - assuming you find one.\n\nThey are considered \"Intermediate\" because it's considered difficult for a completely new player to understand ''Crawl'''s [[action|speed system]] (and take advantage of kiting) from scratch. It's not because they are weak; Centaurs are one of the strongest species overall, arguably easier than \"Simple\" species like [[Draconian]] and [[Ghoul]].\n\n{{obsolete_species_aptitudes|Centaur}}\n\n==Trivia==\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur Centaurs] are originally creatures from Greek mythology. \n\n==History==\n*Playable centaurs were removed in [[0.26]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], centaurs were [[Herbivorous]], gaining more nutrition from vegetarian foods and less from meat-based foods. They also had [[Fast Metabolism]] 1, causing them to [[hunger]] more quickly. As a result, they started with one more [[bread ration]] than most species.\n\n{{species}} [[Category:Obsolete species]]"}

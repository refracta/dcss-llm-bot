{"title":"Polyphemus","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Polyphemus","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{list of | giants}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Polyphemus the Watchful Shepherd''' is a [[unique]] [[cyclops]] who has somehow managed to tame a pack of [[death yak]]s and [[catoblepas|catoblepae]]. He prefers to pelt you with [[large rock]]s and members of his herd before moving in to attack you in melee. He may be found in [[the Shoals]].\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Shoals]]:2-4\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Unlike normal cyclopes, Polyphemus does '''not''' move slowly. Polyphemus himself is significantly more dangerous than a normal cyclops (on par with an [[ettin]] or [[stone giant]]), but he can usually be [[kite]]d safely, provided you don't get slowed by water.\n*The main danger comes from his herd. A catoblepas' petrification breath can prove extremely deadly here if it allows them to surround you.\n*A catoblepas' petrification breath can also affect Polyphemus. If you manage to get him hit while evading the cloud yourself you will be able to easily pick him off.\n*His herd cannot travel through the deep water of the Shoals. Watch out for thrown yaks!\n*If you do have to deal with him and his herd up close, be careful not to let them surround you out in the open. Use stair dancing to limit the number of opponents able to attack you at once.\n\n==Trivia==\nPolyphemus is a reference to the shepherd cyclops who tried to kill Odysseus in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odyssey the Odyssey].\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.17]], Polyphemus gained the ability to throw members of his herd at you, but his damage was decreased a bit.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], Polyphemus only had death yaks in his herd and was significantly weaker."}

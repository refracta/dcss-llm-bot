{"title":"Attack type","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Attack_type","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Attack type''' determines what special properties a [[melee]] attack has.  Most monster attack types have no special properties, aside from what text is used when the attack is made.\n\nDifferent attacks can generate different levels of [[noise]]â€”for instance, \"tail-slaps\" generate twice as much noise as \"stings\". However, the amount of damage done by the attack is a larger factor, and no melee attack is ever louder than a [[shout]].\n\n==Special effects==\n* AT_CHERUB ([[:Category:Cherub type|monster list]]) randomly transformed into AT_HIT, AT_PECK, AT_BITE, or AT_GORE.\n* AT_CLAW ([[:Category:Claw type|monster list]]) severs [[hydra]] heads.\n* AT_CONSTRICT ([[:Category:Constrict type|monster list]]) [[constrict]]s the defender, causing extra damage and trapping the opponent.\n* AT_TRAMPLE ([[:Category:Trample type|monster list]]) can [[trample]] the defender, pushing it back one square.\n* AT_RANDOM ([[:Category:Random type|monster list]]) randomly transformed into AT_HIT or AT_GORE.\n* AT_REACH_STING ([[:Category:Reach sting type|monster list]]) has [[reaching]].\n* AT_SPORE ([[:Category:Spore type|monster list]]) makes certain [[attack flavour]]s (AF_CONFUSE and AF_SLEEP) ineffective against [[unbreathing]] creatures. E.g. a monster with AT_SPORE ''and'' AF_CONFUSE cannot confuse unbreathing creatures.\n\n[[Category:Attack types]]"}

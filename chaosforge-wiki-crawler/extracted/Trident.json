This chase, in which the fish is pursued and struck with barbed spears, or a sort of long shafted trident, called a waster, is much practised at the mouth of the Esk, and in the other salmon rivers of Scotland.\"<br>\n-Sir Walter Scott, _Guy Mannering_, ch. XXVI. 1815.}}\n{{crawlquote|This weapon falls into the [[Polearms]] category. It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''trident''' is a polearm, being a significant upgrade over the [[spear]].\n\n==Strategy==\nTridents are a good weapon for the early game. They are reasonably common from dungeon enemies. Of the [[Fighter]] and [[Gladiator]] starting weapons, tridents are the strongest against single targets, due to their [[reaching]].\n\nIn general, Polearms are great if you have some means of creating distance. Characters with fast [[movement]] speed, [[summon]]s, or other [[allies]] can benefit the most from Polearms, though tridents aren't a terrible melee weapon on their own.\n\nUnfortunately, tridents are the best one-handed polearm until you have access to a [[demon trident]] (or [[trishula]]).\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Trident1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Trident2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Trident3.png]]\n|-\n! ||  [[Unrandart]]\n|-\n| '''[[Trident of the Octopus King]]''' || [[File:Trident of the octopus king.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.12]], its accuracy was lowered to +1, and tridents became one-handed.\n*Like most polearms, tridents had their base damage lowered by one to compensate for the introduction of [[reaching]] on all polearms in [[0.10]].\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Polearms]]"}

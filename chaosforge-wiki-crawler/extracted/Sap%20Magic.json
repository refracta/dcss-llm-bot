{"title":"Sap Magic","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sap_Magic","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|Taints a targeted creature's ability to cast spells. Casting a spell while afflicted with this condition causes the target to lose access to their magic, briefly preventing them from casting any further spells.}}\n\n'''Sap Magic''' is a monsters-only spell. Against players, it inflicts the {{Yellow|Sap}} status for 20-30 turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|beam.cc|3660}}</ref> When you have this status, successfully casting any spell gives you the {{Red|-Cast}} status for 3-5 turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-cast.cc|1018}}</ref> Getting hit by Sap Magic multiple times will extend its duration (max. 50 turns). You can cure both Sap and -Cast with a [[potion of cancellation]].\n\nMonsters with [[Spell slot flags#Wizard flag|wizardly]] spells can be affected by Sap Magic too. They receive an [[antimagic]] penalty, which could make them falter when they try to cast spells.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==Strategy==\n\nBeing in Sap status essentially means that you will be in a cycle of only being able to cast one spell every ~4 turns, until that status times out or you use a potion of cancellation. Thus, if you are primarily a spellcaster:\n*Make that one, periodic spell count. If you kill or escape from all [[demonspawn warmonger]]s in [[LOS]], use a potion of cancellation.\n*If you can't do that, have a robust plan to escape from pursuing enemies until the status wears off.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the Sap status had a 50% chance to increase your spell failure penalty each time when you cast a spell. There were three levels:\n**{{Yellow|-Wiz}}: spell failure rate increased by 12%;\n**{{LightRed|-Wiz}}: spell failure rate increased by 24%;\n**{{Red|-Wiz}}: spell failure rate increased by 36%.\n**Also, the spell had a 30% chance to have no effect when cast, despite being otherwise irresistible.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

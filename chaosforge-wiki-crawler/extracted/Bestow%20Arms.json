{"title":"Bestow Arms","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bestow_Arms","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{flavour|Temporarily grants numerous nearby allies a magical weapon from within the armoury, so long as the souls holding it together remain intact.}}\n\n'''Bestow Arms''' is a monster-only spell that temporarily grants copies of a random summoned weapon to 5-7 nearby allies. These tend to be top-tier items, with good [[brand]]s and [[enchantment]] (from +4 to +9), with a slight bias towards polearms, but also including launchers.\n\nPossible weapons:\n*[[bardiche]]\n*[[glaive]]\n*[[demon trident]]\n*[[eveningstar]]\n*[[double sword]]\n*[[quick blade]]\n*[[longbow]]\n*[[triple crossbow]]\n*[[hand cannon]]\n\nThese weapons will be branded with either [[flame]], [[freezing]], [[speed (brand)|speed]], [[vampiric]], [[chaos]], or [[distortion]]. Note that even ranged weapons can get any brand from this list, including vampiric or distortion, which normally don't appear on such weapons.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nWorshippers of [[Yred]] have a special use for this spell. If you manage to bind soul of a monster that wields a weapon created by Bestow Arms, the weapon will become permanent. A bound [[yaktaur captain]] with a triple crossbow of distortion can be an amazing ally!\n\n==History==\n*This spell was added in [[0.32]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

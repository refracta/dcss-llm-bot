{"title":"Butterfly","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Butterfly","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Butterflies''' are harmless flying monsters that are fragile, but difficult to hit. They most often appear when using a [[scroll of butterflies]], but \"hostile\" butterflies can be encountered throughout the Dungeon and [[the Lair]]. Butterflies wander around aimlessly, as if they were [[confuse]]d. They offer no [[XP]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*A scroll of butterflies can be used to block line of fire and distract attackers. Butterflies are [[ev]]asive, though, so projectiles may pass through the butterflies and hit you.\n*[[Polymorph]]ing a butterfly can turn it into something worth XP, but so little that it's probably not worth the wand charge.\n*Hostile butterflies will also block line of fire, so killing it will let your shots (and enemies') pass through. If you absolutely need one dead fast, [[Magic Dart]] or any EV-ignoring will kill it without fail.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], butterflies had 15 EV and 10 willpower.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], butterflies had 25 EV.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the spell [[Summon Butterflies]] existed.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], reading a [[scroll of random uselessness]] could summon butterflies.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], [[evil gods]] accepted butterfly kills for the purposes of raising [[piety]].\n\nThey used to leave [[corpse]]s and even skeletons, which could be raised as undead. This created amusing [[zombie]]s that were incredibly fast but lacked any means of attack."}

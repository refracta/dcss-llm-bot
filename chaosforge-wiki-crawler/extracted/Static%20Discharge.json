Arcs will hit a creature adjacent to the previous target, repeating up to <code>1d(2 + pow/25)</code> times.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-damage.cc|2586}}</ref> Each individual arc can only hit a creature once. However, a creature can be hit by multiple ''different'' arcs at once. E.g. if there are 2 monsters adjacent to the caster, up to 2 arcs can be created, so each monster can be hit twice.\n\nIf an arc hits the caster, its damage is halved. This spell does not affect electricity-immune targets; any arcs aimed at immune creatures will immediately ground out.\n\nThe [[Arc Blade]] uses a particularly high-powered version of this spell for its special effect.\n\n==Strategy==\nStatic Discharge is a decent attacking spell for its level. It's most helpful against crowds of monsters, as such crowds allow for multiple arcs to bounce through them. Because it ignores AC and EV, it's also good against monsters with high defenses, such as [[orc warrior]]s and [[killer bee]]s.\n\nExercise caution against crowds, though -- much like [[axes]], having more targets for Static Discharge means you'll also be taking more attacks. Unlike axes, Static Discharge can also hit monsters behind the target. When used in a hallway, you can hit 2 monsters while only being hit back by one (but for less damage than if both were adjacent to you).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Static Discharge arcs dealt <code>1d(2 + pow/15)</code> to the player, even if a monster was casting the spell.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Static Discharge dealt <code>2 + 1d(3 + pow/8)</code> damage, hit up to <code>1d(2 + pow/20)</code> targets, and had a power cap of 100. rElec monsters were fully immune to this spell.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], this spell dealt <code>2 + 1d(5 + Power/10 + (1d(Power)-1)/10)</code> damage. The number of targets an arc could hit wasn't predetermined before cast; the power was reduced for each arc of the spell, and power determined the chance of making a new arc.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], this spell was a level 3 spell.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], [[insubstantial wisp]]s could cast this spell.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], this spell would deal less damage to levitating or flying targets.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], Static Discharge was a level 4 spell.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

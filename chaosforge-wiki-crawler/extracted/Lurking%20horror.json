{"title":"Lurking horror","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lurking_horror","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Lurking horrors''' are orbs of potent [[negative energy]] which are simultaneously attracted to and repulsed by you. On contact with a creature, or on death, it will [[torment]] everything it can see. They can be found in [[the Abyss]] and certain Abyss-themed [[vault]]s.\n\nEvery turn, if a lurking horror is in your [[line of sight]], it can only move if <code>distance <= 1d(LOS_range + 1) - 1</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-act.cc|579}}</ref> So when encountered at the edge of LOS, it is likely to not move, but the closer you get, the more likely it is to charge at you. \n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Characters with torment resistance can simply ignore them. Anyone else can attempt to leave them behind, as the shifting nature of the Abyss may cut off their ability to pursue you. However, if you have to turn around due to a dead end or a dangerous opponent you wish to flee, you'll almost certainly have to deal with the thing.\n*If you can damage it beyond your line of sight, you can kill it safely. [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] and [[Fireball]] can accomplish this if cast around a blind corner, as can a [[wand of iceblast]]. Be aware that most spells of this sort are noisy and may attract other forms of unwanted attention.\n**If there are no corners nearby, you can limit your line of sight with a [[scroll of fog]]. Remember that you can cast spells and zap wands through opaque clouds using '''Shift-<Direction>'''.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], lurking horror movement was updated and made simpler. Previously, lurking horrors, in addition to distance, were more likely to move when there was more open space.\n*Lurking horrors were added in [[0.12]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

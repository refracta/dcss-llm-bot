{"title":"Endoplasm","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Endoplasm","type":"raw","data":"{{version027}}\n{{list of | jellies}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Endoplasms''' are puddles of creeping, animated filth. Barely more durable than [[rat]]s or [[frilled lizard]]s, they are most notable for being able to [[Freeze]] their foes.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & tricks==\n*Endoplasms are fragile and practically defenseless; even the naturally cold-vulnerable [[Djinn]] can usually kill them before they can pose any sort of threat.\n*Freeze doesn't miss and ignores armour; don't engage endoplasms in melee if you have 5 or fewer HP remaining.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], endoplasms were known as '''oozes'''; they were slightly stronger, but did not know Freeze."}

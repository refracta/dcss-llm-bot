Unfortunately, they are rare weapons, require two hands to wield, and a whopping 24 Polearms skill to reach minimum delay.\n\nAs a chopping weapon, it'll cut off [[hydra]] heads. It is also too large for [[kobold]]s and [[spriggan]]s to use at all.\n\n==Strategy==\nOther than [[Trog]] and [[Okawaru]] gifts, bardiches can occasionally be found in the [[Elven_Halls#Elf:2 - The Hall of Blades|Hall of Blades]], or in the [[Pandemonium]] (from [[list of demonspawn|demonspawn]] opponents).\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Bardiche1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Bardiche2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Bardiche3.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the bardiche's mindelay was reached at 26 skill (base delay of 20)\n*Prior to [[0.10]], bardiches lacked innate reaching.\n\n{{weapons}}\n\n[[Category:Polearms]]"}

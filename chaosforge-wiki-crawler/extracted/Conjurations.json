{"title":"Conjurations","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Conjurations","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n'''Conjurations''' indicates a character's skill at controlling damage-dealing spells of various types. While some spells are pure Conjurations (e.g. [[Magic Dart]]), most damage-dealing spells combine this skill with an elemental school or other skill (e.g. [[Stone Arrow]], [[Hailstorm]]).\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n{{spell table by level|Conjuration}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{spell sources|Conjuration|Book of Annihilations,Book of Conjurations,Book of Dangerous Friends,Book of Power,Book of Spectacle,Book of the Spheres}}\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Conjurer]]\n\n==History==\n*[[0.28]] Added [[Flame Wave]].

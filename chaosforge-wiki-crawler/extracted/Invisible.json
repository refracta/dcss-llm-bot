It functions differently depending on whether it affects a player or a monster.\n\n==Player Version==\nIf a monster does not have see invisible, you get the following bonuses against them:\n\n'''Combat'''\n* Attackers have their [[to-hit]] (accuracy) reduced against you, and there's a chance to target the wrong tile entirely. \n** Melee to-hit is reduced by -35%. Ranged attack to-hit is reduced by -50%.\n* You can make low-tier [[stab]]s. (See the [[Stabbing#Stabbing Odds|Stabbing]] article for details)\n* Enemy [[SH]] is divided by 3.\n\n'''Detection'''\n* Sleeping / wandering monsters are less likely to [[Stealth#Detection|notice you]]. \n* Monsters are less likely to use certain spells or abilities against you.\n* Monsters don't know your exact position. See below for details.\n\n'''Guessing your Position'''<br>\nGenerally, monsters that can't see you will act like they are [[confused]], without the chance of always moving \"correctly\". However, they have a chance of guessing your position:\n* Seeking monsters will randomly target a nearby tile when the player is within two tiles.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-behv.cc|38}}</ref>\n* Monsters have a 33% chance to guess the player's tile if the player is right next to them.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-behv.cc|217}}</ref>\n** Monsters of [[monster intelligence|human intelligence]] have an extra 8% chance to guess the player's position.\n** [[Ashenzari]] penance improves the chance of guessing by 50%.\n\nInvisibility has no effect if:\n*You are in [[water]] and not [[flying]] above it.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|player.cc|7174}}</ref>\n*If you are [[backlit]] (inflicted by [[Corona]], hit by [[Sticky Flame]], inside a [[halo]], or if [[magical contamination]] is above 5000).\n\n===Sources===\nYou can become invisible by: \n*quaffing a [[potion of invisibility]].\n*using the [[Evoke Invisibility]] ability granted by a [[scarf]] of invisibility or certain [[artefact]]s (attempting to use this ability, succeed or fail, will [[drain]] you).\n*[[Dithmenos]]' [[Shadow Form]] turns you into a shadow, granting intrinsic invisibility.\n\nRegardless of source, player invisibility lasts for <code>15 + 1d([[spell power]])</code> turns (max: 100 turns).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|potion.cc|500}}</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\nAlmost every character benefits tremendously from being invisible. Many difficult enemies can not see invisible, from most monsters in the [[Spider's Nest]], [[Swamp]], and [[Shoals]], to [[list of draconians|draconians]] and [[death cob]]s in [[Zot]], to [[hellion]]s and [[tormentor]]s in [[extended]]. [[Ghost moth]]s, themselves invisible, are a pertinent threat to all visible casters. [[Stealth]]y [[stab]]bers benefit most - it greatly enhances your effective stealth and your damage output in melee.\n\nDespite the benefits, there are a few downsides to invisibility:\n*The list of monsters capable of seeing invisible is unfortunately rather large (see [[:Category:See invisible]]), making the status effect completely useless against them. By the time you get a reliable means of invisibility, more and more monsters won't care.\n*Every method of turning invisible has its own quirks:\n**Potions are reliable, but are rare and come in limited quantity.\n**[[Invisibility (ego)|Evocable invisibility]] is a renewable source of invisibility. But finding a source isn't guaranteed. And, even with [[Evocations]] training, the [[drain]] is a very significant cost.\n**Shadow Form requires significant [[Invocations]] training to be reliable, carries a significant MP and [[piety]] cost, drains you when activated, further drains you when you take damage, all the while reducing your damage output and spellpower.\n\nAs you progress, and as more monsters gain SInv), invisibility shifts from \"a buff that can kill most things outright\" to \"a defense against common/weak monsters\". Being invisible won't help one bit against an [[orb of fire]], but it'll make nearby draconians less likely to hit you.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Note that monsters will remember your old position. Therefore, you should move a few tiles after becoming invisible. That way, monsters are much less likely to target the right tile.\n*[[Dazzling Flash]] or a [[wand of light]] (if it has generated) replicate invisibility. These effects [[blind]] opponents; a blind opponent treats you as invisible, even if they have see invisible. However, the former can fail, and the latter has a limited number of uses.\n\n==Monster Version==\nInvisible monsters are very dangerous to a player who cannot see invisible. If you cannot see invisible, then in melee with invisible monsters:\n*Your [[shields|block]] rolls are divided by three.\n*You suffer a -10 penalty to your [[EV]] against their melee attacks\n*You suffer a -6 penalty to your melee to-hit number against invisible monsters.\n\nOn top of that, invisible monsters cannot be seen either within your [[line of sight]] or on the map, and if you actually manage to guess which tile they're in and attack them, you receive significantly less information than normal (the monster is referred to as \"something\" rather than by its actual name).\n\n===Sources===\n====Permanently invisible====\nThese monsters are permanently, inherently invisible:\n*{{monsterlink|Unseen horror}}\n*{{monsterlink|Ghost moth}}\n*{{monsterlink|Shadow wraith}}\n*{{monsterlink|Lorocyproca}}\n\n====Casters of invisibility====\nSome spellcasting monsters can make themselves invisible:\n<div style=\"column-width:400px\">\n*{{monsterlink|Orc wizard}}\n*{{LightCyan|I}} [[File:Sky beast.png]] '''[[Sky beast]]''' (by inherent ability, not a spell)\n*{{Magenta|p}} [[File:Shadow.png]] '''[[Shadow]]''' (by inherent ability, not a spell)\n<!--Formatted this way to keep the text in the same line-->\n*{{monsterlink|Ogre mage}}\n*{{monsterlink|Deep elf knight}}\n*{{Red|V}} [[File:Vampire (monster).png]] '''[[Vampire (monster)|Vampire]]'''\n*{{monsterlink|Vampire knight}}\n*{{monsterlink|Vampire mage}}\n*{{monsterlink|Boggart}}\n*{{White|p}} [[File:Necromancer (monster).png]] '''[[Necromancer (monster)|Necromancer]]'''\n*{{Magenta|p}} [[File:Wizard (monster).png]] '''[[Wizard (monster)|Wizard]]'''\n*{{monsterlink|Draconian knight}}\n*{{monsterlink|Lich}}\n*{{monsterlink|Ancient lich}}\n*{{monsterlink|Sigmund}}\n*{{monsterlink|Blork the orc}}\n*{{monsterlink|Psyche}}\n*{{monsterlink|Erica}}\n*{{monsterlink|Maurice}}\n*{{monsterlink|Erolcha}}\n*{{monsterlink|Kirke}}\n*{{monsterlink|Ilsuiw}}\n*{{monsterlink|Boris}}\n*{{monsterlink|The Enchantress}}\n*{{monsterlink|Pandemonium lord}} (7.5% chance)\n</div>\nThis effect has a finite duration, but the monster can always recast it after it has run out.\n\n====Potion users====\nMonsters who know how to use potions may use [[potions of invisibility]] to make themselves invisible. This effect has a finite duration, but the monster may be able to reapply the effect by quaffing another potion (if it has one).\n\n==Detecting invisible monsters==\n===See invisible===\nIf you have the [[see invisible]] [[intrinsic]], invisible monsters gain no benefits against you. You can acquire this in the following ways:\n*Having the [[Acute Vision]] [[mutation]]. [[Spriggan]]s, [[vampire]]s, [[naga]]s, [[felid]]s, and [[palentonga]]s all have this mutation naturally.\n*Having rank 3 of the [[Antennae]] mutation. [[Formicid]]s start with this, and [[demonspawn]] may develop it as they grow.\n*Wearing a [[ring]], [[Armour#headgear|headgear]], or [[artefact]] with the see invisible [[ego]]\n*Having rank 3 of [[Jiyva]]'s [[Eyeballs]] mutation.\n\n===Backlighting===\nUnder some circumstances, a target may become backlit (also known as [[glow]]ing). This renders its invisibility ineffective, and actually makes it easier to hit than normal. Backlighting occurs whenever:\n*An invisible target is affected by the [[Corona]] status (must overcome [[willpower]]).\n*An invisible, corporeal target (i.e. one that is not [[insubstantial]]) is covered with [[Sticky Flame]]s, unless it's standing in water (which immediately extinguishes the flames).\n*An invisible creature enters a [[halo]].\n*The player suffers from significant amounts of [[magical contamination]] (yellow or worse).\n\n===Invisible monsters revealed as a disturbance===\nAll invisible monsters will occasionally leave disturbances while invisible, represented by a white humanoid outline if playing in tiles or by the {{White|{}} glyph if playing in console. If you attack a square and the monster does not move from that square, the monster will be revealed as a disturbance until it moves (the only invisible monsters likely to shift position without you moving first are [[unseen horror]]s).\n\nAll corporeal invisible monsters create disturbances when passing through an opaque [[cloud]] (e.g. fog, steam), revealing their position (but not any further information). Do note that this only applies to monsters -- invisible players are not revealed in clouds. Anything the player can do to create clouds when an invisible creature is near will aid him in determining that creature's location:\n*Reading a [[scroll of fog]] or bleeding smoke (granted to followers of [[Dithmenos]] or characters wearing the [[cloak of the Thief]]).\n*Using [[Fire Magic]] in and over water, creating [[steam]] clouds.\n*Using Ice Magic in and over lava, creating steam clouds.\n*Invoking [[Wu Jian]]'s Heavenly Storm ability.\n\nAdditionally, any invisible creature, including the player, standing or swimming (e.g. not [[fly]]ing) in liquid ([[shallow water]], [[deep water]], and [[lava]]) is always visible as a disturbance.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], [[chaos]] attacks could give invisibility.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], [[Invisibility]] was a spell available to players, which was one of the main ways of getting this status. The status would also give [[magic contamination]] over time, and many more late-game monsters had access to SInv.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the [[wand of random effects]] could turn you or monsters invisible. Replaced with a [[piece from Xom's chessboard]], which only targets monsters.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the [[invisibility (ego)|invisibility ego]] did not drain its user when used.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], the [[submerging]] mechanic existed. [[:Category:Submerges|Certain monsters]] had an ability to render themselves ''effectively'' invisible by hiding in [[deep water]], [[lava]], or even [[Trapdoor spider|under the floor]].\n*Prior to [[0.20]], invisibility increased the player's [[hunger]] rate by 5.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], invisibility reduced the combat accuracy by 5 for the player and monsters if they couldn't see invisible themselves. \n*Prior to [[0.16]], the [[sense invisible]] intrinsic existed, which was an upgrade to [[see invisible]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], invisible monsters were immune to the effects of [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]\n[[Category:Invisible monsters|*]]\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

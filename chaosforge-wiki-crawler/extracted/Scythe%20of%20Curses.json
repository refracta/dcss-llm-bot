These effects coupled with the weapon's excellent enchantment bonuses can devastate living opponents. Unfortunately, the scythe of Curses is of limited use against [[undead]], [[demon]]ic, or [[nonliving]] foes, and has a terrible base weapon. Only consider it if you already have very high skill in [[Polearms]] and are regularly facing opponents which will actually be affected by the death curses.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], base [[scythe]]s lost their unique stats. This weapon retains those stats, except that it gained +1 accuracy between versions.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the scythe couldn't inflict death curses on [[plants]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the scythe of Curses would [[curse]] on equip rather than [[drain]] the user on unequip.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the scythe of Curses inflicted [[Necromancy]] [[miscast effect]]s when striking monsters and would periodically curse random pieces of equipment in the wielder's inventory.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Polearms]]"}

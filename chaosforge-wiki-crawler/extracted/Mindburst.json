If it overcomes the target's willpower, it 'blows their mind' in a violently literal fashion, dealing damage that bypasses their armour entirely. It is useless against mindless creatures.}}\n\n'''Mindburst''' is a monster-only spell. If it overcomes a [[willpower]] check, it deals moderate physical damage. It does nothing against creatures that are [[mindless]].\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nPlayers (and other monsters) can replicate the spell with a [[wand of mindburst]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], this spell was known as '''Disintegration''' and it could affect mindless creatures.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], wands of disintegration could be used to break rock [[wall]]s.\n*Disintegrate used to be a level 6 [[Transmutations]] player spell which had the additional application of working as a miniature [[Dig]] spell or [[statue]] killer. Used against rock or wax [[wall]]s, iron grates, or many [[statue]]s (including the deadly [[orange crystal statue]]), the tile would be cleared out. Used against monsters, it would cause severe damage (unless the target's [[magic resistance]] negated the spell).\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

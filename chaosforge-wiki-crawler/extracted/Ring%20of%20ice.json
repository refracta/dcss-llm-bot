It grants resistance to cold and enhances ice magic, but causes vulnerability to heat.}}\n\nA [[ring of ice]] is a [[ring]] that enhances the [[spell power|power]] of [[ice magic]] spells. Additionally, it provides one level of [[cold resistance]] (rC+) and one negative level of [[fire resistance]] (rF-).\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*A ring of ice can serve as a poor man's [[ring of protection from cold]] in a pinch, particularly if you should encounter an [[Ice Cave]] mini branch.\n*You don't want to be vulnerable to any element for too long, since you (the player) can always forget about it. Even if you use [[Ice Magic]], you'll want a source of [[fire resistance]] to counteract the vulnerability. \n:If you don't have a way to negate rF-, Ice specialists can still find this ring useful - just remember to remove it against fiery enemies.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.19]], rings of ice acted as a negative [[Fire Magic]] enhancer.\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

This includes even some cross-plane effects, although notably not Banishment.}}\n\n'''Dimension Anchor''' is a monster-only spell that attempts to temporarily afflict you with the {{Red|-Tele}} [[status effect]], preventing you from [[blink]]ing or [[teleport]]ing. (The spell has no effect on behavior of [[Passage of Golubria]] portals.) The spell can be resisted with [[willpower]]. \nAttempting to blink or teleport results in the following message:\n{{crawlquote|You cannot teleport because you are locked down by Dimension Anchor.}}\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you have one, quaffing a [[potion of cancellation]] will end the status effect.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the same effect could occur as a result of a [[Translocations]] [[miscast]]. Also, [[pandemonium lord]]s couldn't cast this spell.\n*This spell was added in [[0.13]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

{"title":"Orc slaying","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Orc_slaying","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\nThe '''orc slaying''' [[brand]] causes a weapon to deal +75% bonus damage on average on attacks against any kind of [[orc]]. Wielding an orc slaying weapon will give your character the desire to slay orcs, or, if you are a [[hill orc]], make your character feel suicidal; either way, this identifies it.\n\nOrc slaying is only normally found on [[randart]]s. Mundane orc slaying weapons can appear during [[Beogh]]'s wrath, but only in the form of hostile [[dancing weapon]]s which disappear when killed. Using an orc slaying weapon while worshiping Beogh is not penalized, but it does greatly reduce the odds of the subdued orc converting to your cause.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*This brand works best on a high-damage weapon, since the damage is multiplicative.\n*Although a godsend for players about to enter the [[Orcish Mines]], you can probably find better weapons for the rest of the game.\n\n==History==\nThis brand was removed in [[0.13]].\n\nPrior to [[0.4]], it could also be found on mundane weapons.\n\n{{brands}}\n[[Category:Brands]]\n[[Category:Orc]]"}

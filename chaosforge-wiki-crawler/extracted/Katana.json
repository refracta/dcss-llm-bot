It can be used with one hand, or more effectively with two (i.e. when not using a shield), and it is better for the dexterous.}}\n\nThe '''katana''' is a one-and-a-half handed [[Long Blades|Long Blade]] with excellent base stats. It provides the same damage as a [[demon blade]], but has better accuracy and more importantly, a better minimum delay.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.10]], Bloodbane was converted from a katana to a demon blade, and the unrand [[Autumn Katana]] was introduced to replace it as the sole remaining katana. The Autumn Katana actually has slightly better base stats than mundane katanas did: 14 damage, +3 accuracy, 12 base delay.\n\nIn [[0.9]], they were mostly removed from the game, with the unrand [[Bloodbane]] being the only one remaining.\n\nKatanas could be randomly generated up until [[0.8]] with a generation probability similar to that of a [[quick blade]] or an [[executioner's axe]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || [[Unrandart]] Katana\n|-\n| '''[[Autumn Katana]]''' || [[File:Autumn_katana.png]]\n|}\n\n{{weapons}}\n\n[[Category:Long blades]]\n[[Category:Obsolete items]]"}

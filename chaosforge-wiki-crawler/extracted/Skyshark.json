{"title":"Skyshark","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Skyshark","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Skysharks''' are fast and deadly denizens of the [[Lair]] and [[Shoals]]. They can also be found in the company of [[Norris]]. Skysharks get more dangerous after they taste [[blood]]: at first they get the [[Might]] status (+50% damage) for 10-20 [[decaaut|turns]], and then they can go [[berserk]], also for the same duration.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If a skyshark can't taste blood, it can't go berserk. [[Undead]] species, [[Djinn]], and [[Gargoyle]]s don't have blood, so are immune to bloodzerk. For living species, a [[potion of lignification]] will turn you into a bloodless tree, and gives hefty [[AC]] to boot. [[Statue Form]], [[Storm Form]] and [[Death Form]] will turn you bloodless, though by the time you have these forms you should be able to take on one with ease.\n*They don't have any resistances, and their [[willpower]] is relatively low. You can disable them from a distance using hex [[wands]], [[curare]] [[dart]]s, etc.\n**Skysharks will happily charge into [[scroll of poison|poisonous]] or [[Freezing Cloud|freezing]] clouds, but will take heavy damage in the process. If you have [[poison resistance]], you can [[kite]] the skyshark through the poisonous clouds to kill it.\n**Skysharks are good targets for [[Mephitic Cloud]]. Watch out, though, since a [[confused]] skyshark can become enraged if it hits another monster (even if you don't have blood yourself).\n**Skysharks are [[cold-blooded]] and will be [[slow]]ed by [[cold]] attacks.\n\n==History==\n*Skysharks have been added in [[0.30]]."}

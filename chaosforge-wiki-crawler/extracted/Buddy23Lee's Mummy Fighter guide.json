Read at your own risk and alter to fit your play style as necessary!\n\n***Version [0.14](/0.14 \"0.14\")**: This article **may not be** up to date for the [latest stable release](/0.32 \"0.32\") of Crawl.*\n\nWith their limitless ability to [channel magical energy](/Channel_energy \"Channel energy\") and a permanent [hunger-free spellcasting](/Spell_Hunger \"Spell Hunger\"), [![Mummy.png](/images/7/70/Mummy.png)](/File:Mummy.png) [mummies](/Mummy \"Mummy\") are known as worthwhile [spellcasters](/Wizard \"Wizard\"), but fewer take the time to pair their unique abilities with the pursuits of a [melee fighter](/Fighter \"Fighter\"). In this walkthrough, we take a look at those potentials and find what remarkable warriors these undead characters can actually become.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Getting started](#Getting_started)\n  - [1.1 Getting started](#Getting_started_2)\n\n- [2 Extra-conservative gameplay](#Extra-conservative_gameplay)\n\n  - [2.1 Triple visitation](#Triple_visitation)\n  - [2.2 Noise can be your friend](#Noise_can_be_your_friend)\n  - [2.3 Pathway of (un)life](#Pathway_of_.28un.29life)\n    - [2.3.1 Extra-conservative gameplay](#Extra-conservative_gameplay_2)\n\n- [3 God selection](#God_selection)\n  - [3.1 God selection](#God_selection_2)\n\n- [4 Transition to mid-game](#Transition_to_mid-game)\n  - [4.1 Branch hopping](#Branch_hopping)\n    - [4.1.1 Transition to mid-game](#Transition_to_mid-game_2)\n\n- [5 Transition to late game](#Transition_to_late_game)\n\n  - [5.1 Skills](#Skills)\n  - [5.2 Items](#Items)\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe only meaningful decision to make when starting out with a mummy fighter is [weapon selection](/Weapon_selection \"Weapon selection\"). Normally, at least a bit of leeway can be given to one’s personal preferences and playstyle, but in the early game, your mummy will be especially weak, so he’ll need every advantage he can get.\n\nOne of those advantages is keeping a [shield](/Shield \"Shield\"), at least for a substantial chunk of the game, to help make up for a lack of immediate healing abilities (more blocking = less hit points to worry about healing). With that in mind, [axes](/Axes \"Axes\") and [polearms](/Polearms \"Polearms\") should generally be avoided, as both of their one-handed options are generally inferior to our other possibilities. Essentially, it comes down to [long blades](/Long_blades \"Long blades\") and [maces & flails](/Maces_%26_flails \"Maces & flails\"). In terms of speed and damage, both of their most powerful one-handed options are comparable (the [bastard sword](/Bastard_sword \"Bastard sword\") and [eveningstar](/Eveningstar \"Eveningstar\"), respectively) but that bastard sword still uses 30% more [dexterity](/Dexterity \"Dexterity\") than the bulky eveningstar. Since your mummy will only be marginal in dexterity but pretty good on [strength](/Strength \"Strength\"), it leaves maces & flails as the superlative selection.\n\nRemember, even if you find a [great mace](/Great_mace \"Great mace\") or the like early on, wielding it will often lead to your demise as you’ll be giving up that extra layer of protection without a shield and your low maces & flails skill will mean you’ll be attacking slowly with it. Save the two-handed options for later.\n\n#### Getting started\n\n- ‘Maces & flails’ is the most compatible weapon type for a mummy fighter\n- Focus your ‘maces & flails’ skill so you can skillfully use increasingly heavier weapons\n\n## Extra-conservative gameplay\n\nIt’s already a maxim in dungeon crawl to avoid danger when possible, and this (unsurprisingly) rings all the more true for your mummy fighter, particularly in the [early game](/Early_Game_Character_Building \"Early Game Character Building\").\n\nYour success is going to be predicated on [item](/Item \"Item\") acquirement and [skill](/Skill \"Skill\") progression rather than [spells](/Spells \"Spells\") and innate [abilities](/Abilities \"Abilities\"). As such, and for the time being, you need to play as if you were more of an [assassin](/Assassin \"Assassin\") than a fighter. That is, luring enemies to you, facing them one-on-one, and avoiding groups when possible. Perhaps this is clichéd advice that you already practice, but there are some general strategies that might be a waste of [food](/Food \"Food\") for a mortal character to constantly practice, but are never uneconomical for your timeless mummy.\n\n### Triple visitation [![Stairs down.png](/images/f/f2/Stairs_down.png)](/File:Stairs_down.png) [![Stairs down.png](/images/f/f2/Stairs_down.png)](/File:Stairs_down.png) [![Stairs down.png](/images/f/f2/Stairs_down.png)](/File:Stairs_down.png)\n\n[Triple visitation](/Escaping_from_\\(and_avoiding\\)_trouble#Triple_visitation \"Escaping from (and avoiding) trouble\") means not only finding all three [downstairs](/Stairs \"Stairs\"), as most do, but using all three to separately journey down and take a peak around before fully engaging the new level. This isn’t always a practical strategy for other characters, primarily when they are facing a tough food shortage. Obviously, your mummy is impervious to this plight, and should make a general habit of this tactic. Individual and weak enemies can certainly be brought back upstairs and finished off under controlled conditions.\n\nGetting comfortable with this tactic makes portals and branch beginnings feel a bit more harrowing than they normally would, as you’ll obviously have only one entry point.\n\n### Noise can be your friend\n\nContrary to the advice of some, [noise](/Noise \"Noise\") can sometimes be your friend. Each time you first travel downstairs, particularly if there are no monsters in your line-of-sight, give a [shout](/T \"T\") and see what shouts, croaks, or moans back at you. Not only does this give you some idea of what might be out there and from which staircase you might begin your exploration, but it also awakens nearby [sleeping](/Sleep \"Sleep\") groups of [monsters](/Monsters \"Monsters\"), many of whom might wander off from their group and be faced one-on-one, either immediately or further in.\n\n### Pathway of (un)life\n\nNormally [auto-explore](/O \"O\") is a good practice, particularly when you have a vulnerable character who might be ‘one-shot’ killed with just one wrong step. While it’s true that underneath all that armor you're still just a desiccated [corpse](/Corpse \"Corpse\") held together by wrappings, you're also not a flimsy spellcaster, so insta-death isn’t a usual concern.\n\nWhat is a concern however, is finding a good safe place to undertake your slow but otherwise free [healing](/Healing \"Healing\") when you need it. As you also know, few immediate places are better than at the top of those upstairs you’ve established. As such, before you consider doing any algorithmically-based searching, I would suggest you manually map out a connection between those three upstairs. Once again, this might be a waste of food for any other character, but your mummy can never have too much access to what functions as a free healing oasis.\n\n#### Extra-conservative gameplay\n\n- **Triple visitation** – once you’ve cleared a level, visit the next one using each of the three downstairs before deciding which one you want to start further exploration from.\n- **Shout** – Each time you go downstairs and are not immediately threatened by monsters, shout and see what shouts back. You can always scurry back upstairs if you awaken something unmanageable.\n- **Pathway of (un)life** – once you do decide where to enter the next level, immediately connect the three upstairs together on your map. Three stairs are better than one.\n\n## God selection\n\nAssuming something terrible (and often fire-related) doesn’t happen first, careful gameplay should most often bring your mummy into contact with the [altars](/Altars \"Altars\") of one or more [gods](/Gods \"Gods\"). Thus, you must decide which deity you wish to give your allegiance, at least for the time being.\n\nBeing the reviled [undead](/Undead \"Undead\") character you are, you already have limited options. A couple prayers to [Fedhas Madash](/Fedhas_Madash \"Fedhas Madash\") and you’d probably end up a pile of dirt!\n\nIf you find an early altar to a god you particularly enjoy, consider using it. After all, even if it doesn’t work out, you can easily get another mummy fighter to dungeon level 2 or 3. However, assuming you don’t, or are particularly mindful of longevity, there is one generally superior option.\n\nReturning again to what was mentioned regarding your mummies reliance on items and skills, no god will provide you a better boon for both than [Okawaru](/Okawaru \"Okawaru\"). [Trog](/Trog \"Trog\") might make a close second, but assuming you haven’t found a good weapon and body armor just lying around, you’re going to need an immediate combat boost to help you strip both off forthcoming monsters. Normally, Trog provides this with his gift of rage, but not for your lifeless ass. Obviously, this gap can’t be bridged with [potions](/Potions \"Potions\") either.\n\nAdmittedly, being devoted to a deity means you are now somewhat tied to a ‘piety clock’ rather than ‘food clock’, and as such time now does have some bearing upon you, but for the most part this is manageable. While food isn’t always regularly assured in Dungeon Crawl, you will never lack for monsters to kill or corpses to sacrifice.\n\nPerhaps the only perceptible investment with Okawaru is the [invocations](/Invocations \"Invocations\") skill to make your *finesse* ability reliable, but remember that this requires no more than a few levels and only needs to happen at or beyond the fifth star of piety.\n\n#### God selection\n\n- If you find an early altar to [Ashenzari](/Ashenzari \"Ashenzari\"), [Cheibriados](/Cheibriados \"Cheibriados\"), [Xom](/Xom \"Xom\"), [Makhleb](/Makhleb \"Makhleb\"), [Nemelex Xobeh](/Nemelex_Xobeh \"Nemelex Xobeh\"), [Trog](/Trog \"Trog\"), or [Yredelemnul](/Yredelemnul \"Yredelemnul\") and and you enjoy worshiping them, you should consider doing so.\n- If you reach the [temple](/Temple \"Temple\") first, or want what is arguably the best god for you mummy fighter, worship [![Okawaru altar.png](/images/a/a6/Okawaru_altar.png)](/File:Okawaru_altar.png) [Okawaru](/Okawaru \"Okawaru\").\n- If you do worship Okawaru, make sure you get a few levels of invocations skill to make your *finesse* ability reliable.\n- Remember that the gods dislike inactivity, so if you do choose to worship one, kiss goodbye either your ability to [scum](/Scumming \"Scumming\") or finding any favor with that god.\n\n## Transition to mid-game\n\nUnless you score some lucky item finds which bolster you early on, avoid [orc warriors](/Orc_warrior \"Orc warrior\"), most [uniques](/Unique_monster \"Unique monster\"), and other similar problems until you’ve earned your *heroism* ability. Along with a requisitely high enough [experience level](/Experience_level \"Experience level\"), this boon will permit you to slay most of these problems even with mediocre gear. Thus, your first priority once you get *heroism* is to seek out orc warriors with their choice gear and forcibly remove it from them. Although it might take a few, you’re ultimately aiming for [![Plate1.png](/images/6/63/Plate1.png)](/File:Plate1.png) [plate armor](/Plate_armor \"Plate armor\") and a [![Morningstar1.png](/images/f/f2/Morningstar1.png)](/File:Morningstar1.png) [morningstar](/Morningstar \"Morningstar\"), provided you don’t find any nice [artifacts](/Artifacts \"Artifacts\") or particularly enchanted items prior to.\n\nOne other item to particularly keep an eye out for is an [amulet of faith](/Amulet_of_faith \"Amulet of faith\"). While these can easily be double-edged devices, there are fewer [amulets](/Amulet \"Amulet\") that are useful to a mummy than most other characters. Certainly [rage](/Amulet_of_rage \"Amulet of rage\") and [gourmand](/Amulet_of_the_gourmand \"Amulet of the gourmand\") are out of the question, but even [warding](/Amulet_of_warding \"Amulet of warding\") and [resist mutation](/Amulet_of_resist_mutation \"Amulet of resist mutation\") are not going to be particularly useful, at least during this part of the game.\n\nWhat’s important is the weapon and armor gifts that Okawaru is presumably going to shower upon you, and the amulet of faith makes those occur 33% faster. Getting better gear in most other equipable item slots is likely well worth this use of your amulet slot.\n\n### Branch hopping [![Orc entry.png](/images/3/30/Orc_entry.png)](/File:Orc_entry.png) [![Lair entry.png](/images/b/b8/Lair_entry.png)](/File:Lair_entry.png) [![Vaults entry.png](/images/c/c5/Vaults_entry.png)](/File:Vaults_entry.png)\n\nSometimes making the journey from one [branch](/Branch \"Branch\") to another can burn through a fair amount of food, especially if you make these trips regularly. Since this is not an issue for your mummy you should be particularly liberal in undertaking these expeditions. Whenever your danger sense alerts you that things are getting rough, and particularly if you encounter a decent unique, back out and take your game somewhere else. There will always be other branches available, and when there isn’t, you’ve reached the [late game](/Late_Game_Character_Building \"Late Game Character Building\")!\n\n#### Transition to mid-game\n\n- Gain the *heroism* ability and use it to slay an orc warrior to get plate armor and a morningstar, if you don’t have them already.\n- Consider the use of an amulet of faith to speed up piety gain and increase the frequency of Okawaru’s gifts\n- Branch hop as needed between the early and middle game branches, as listed in the [walkthrough](/Walkthrough \"Walkthrough\"), especially if you run into a dangerous unique monster.\n\n## Transition to late game\n\nIf you’ve reached the late game you arguably don’t need a guide, at least not one particularly specific to your mummy fighter; you will be much more well-rounded by this point. Nonetheless, reaching that point requires, yet again, items and skills.\n\n### Skills\n\nIn terms of skills, you should have reached level 16 maces & flails long ago, or at least stopped training it no sooner than that level, presuming you haven’t made a transition to a heavier and slower two-handed weapon. If your shield is magical enough to warrant keeping, train your [shields](/Shields \"Shields\") skill to level 15, unless you have a [large shield](/Large_shield \"Large shield\"), which requires skill level 25.\n\nOnce those are finished, bring both your [fighting](/Fighting \"Fighting\") and [armour skill](/Armour_skill \"Armour skill\") to a high level. Also strongly consider working on a [ranged attack](/Ranged_attack \"Ranged attack\") skill. If you keep you shield on, you should probably consider between [throwing](/Throwing \"Throwing\"), [slings](/Slings \"Slings\"), and [evocations](/Evocations \"Evocations\") for [wand](/Wand \"Wand\") zapping.\n\n### Items\n\nWith enough time, there is a good chance that Okawaru will gift you either an[![Eveningstar1.png](/images/3/3a/Eveningstar1.png)](/File:Eveningstar1.png) [eveningstar](/Eveningstar \"Eveningstar\"), [![Crystal plate.png](/images/3/35/Crystal_plate.png)](/File:Crystal_plate.png) [crystal plate armor](/Crystal_plate_armor \"Crystal plate armor\"), or both. Presuming you’re keeping your shield around, these are the excellent and desired replacements for your plate armor and morningstar. [Dragon armors](/Dragon_armor \"Dragon armor\") are certainly worthy as well, and you should keep any extras in your inventory or stash for all those needed [resistances](/Resistances \"Resistances\") (most certainly including fire-resistance).\n\nObviously, there are many other viable options and assortments as well, just try to keep your [guaranteed damage reduction](/Guaranteed_damage_reduction \"Guaranteed damage reduction\") in mind, you're still a slow-healing mummy after all...\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<meta

In terms of speed and damage, both of their most powerful one-handed options are comparable (the <a href=\"/Bastard_sword\" title=\"Bastard sword\">bastard sword</a> and <a href=\"/Eveningstar\" title=\"Eveningstar\">eveningstar</a>, respectively) but that bastard sword still uses 30% more <a href=\"/Dexterity\" title=\"Dexterity\">dexterity</a> than the bulky eveningstar. Since your mummy will only be marginal in dexterity but pretty good on <a href=\"/Strength\" title=\"Strength\">strength</a>, it leaves maces &amp; flails as the superlative selection.\n</p><p>Remember, even if you find a <a href=\"/Great_mace\" title=\"Great mace\">great mace</a> or the like early on, wielding it will often lead to your demise as you’ll be giving up that extra layer of protection without a shield and your low maces &amp; flails skill will mean you’ll be attacking slowly with it. Save the two-handed options for later.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Getting_started_2\">Getting started</span></h4>\n<ul><li> ‘Maces &amp; flails’ is the most compatible weapon type for a mummy fighter</li>\n<li> Focus your ‘maces &amp; flails’ skill so you can skillfully use increasingly heavier weapons</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Extra-conservative_gameplay\">Extra-conservative gameplay</span></h2>\n<p>It’s already a maxim in dungeon crawl to avoid danger when possible, and this (unsurprisingly) rings all the more true for your mummy fighter, particularly in the <a href=\"/Early_Game_Character_Building\" title=\"Early Game Character Building\">early game</a>. \n</p><p>Your success is going to be predicated on <a href=\"/Item\" title=\"Item\">item</a> acquirement and <a href=\"/Skill\" title=\"Skill\">skill</a> progression rather than <a href=\"/Spells\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spells\">spells</a> and innate <a href=\"/Abilities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Abilities\">abilities</a>. As such, and for the time being, you need to play as if you were more of an <a href=\"/Assassin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Assassin\">assassin</a> than a fighter. That is, luring enemies to you, facing them one-on-one, and avoiding groups when possible. Perhaps this is clichéd advice that you already practice, but there are some general strategies that might be a waste of <a href=\"/Food\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Food\">food</a> for a mortal character to constantly practice, but are never uneconomical for your timeless mummy.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Triple_visitation\">Triple visitation <a href=\"/File:Stairs_down.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Stairs down.png\" src=\"/images/f/f2/Stairs_down.png\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" /></a> <a href=\"/File:Stairs_down.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Stairs down.png\" src=\"/images/f/f2/Stairs_down.png\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" /></a> <a href=\"/File:Stairs_down.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Stairs down.png\" src=\"/images/f/f2/Stairs_down.png\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" /></a></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/Escaping_from_(and_avoiding)_trouble#Triple_visitation\" title=\"Escaping from (and avoiding) trouble\">Triple visitation</a> means not only finding all three <a href=\"/Stairs\" title=\"Stairs\">downstairs</a>, as most do, but using all three to separately journey down and take a peak around before fully engaging the new level. This isn’t always a practical strategy for other characters, primarily when they are facing a tough food shortage. Obviously, your mummy is impervious to this plight, and should make a general habit of this tactic. Individual and weak enemies can certainly be brought back upstairs and finished off under controlled conditions. \n</p><p>Getting comfortable with this tactic makes portals and branch beginnings feel a bit more harrowing than they normally would, as you’ll obviously have only one entry point.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Noise_can_be_your_friend\">Noise can be your friend</span></h3>\n<p>Contrary to the advice of some, <a href=\"/Noise\" title=\"Noise\">noise</a> can sometimes be your friend. Each time you first travel downstairs, particularly if there are no monsters in your line-of-sight, give a <a href=\"/T\" title=\"T\">shout</a> and see what shouts, croaks, or moans back at you. Not only does this give you some idea of what might be out there and from which staircase you might begin your exploration, but it also awakens nearby <a href=\"/Sleep\" title=\"Sleep\">sleeping</a> groups of <a href=\"/Monsters\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Monsters\">monsters</a>, many of whom might wander off from their group and be faced one-on-one, either immediately or further in.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pathway_of_.28un.29life\">Pathway of (un)life</span></h3>\n<p>Normally <a href=\"/O\" title=\"O\">auto-explore</a> is a good practice, particularly when you have a vulnerable character who might be ‘one-shot’ killed with just one wrong step. While it’s true that underneath all that armor you're still just a desiccated <a href=\"/Corpse\" title=\"Corpse\">corpse</a> held together by wrappings, you're also not a flimsy spellcaster, so insta-death isn’t a usual concern.\n</p><p>What is a concern however, is finding a good safe place to undertake your slow but otherwise free <a href=\"/Healing\" title=\"Healing\">healing</a> when you need it. As you also know, few immediate places are better than at the top of those upstairs you’ve established. As such, before you consider doing any algorithmically-based searching, I would suggest you manually map out a connection between those three upstairs. Once again, this might be a waste of food for any other character, but your mummy can never have too much access to what functions as a free healing oasis.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Extra-conservative_gameplay_2\">Extra-conservative gameplay</span></h4>\n<ul><li> <b>Triple visitation</b> – once you’ve cleared a level, visit the next one using each of the three downstairs before deciding which one you want to start further exploration from.</li>\n<li> <b>Shout</b> – Each time you go downstairs and are not immediately threatened by monsters, shout and see what shouts back. You can always scurry back upstairs if you awaken something unmanageable.</li>\n<li> <b>Pathway of (un)life</b> – once you do decide where to enter the next level, immediately connect the three upstairs together on your map. Three stairs are better than one.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"God_selection\">God selection</span></h2>\n<p>Assuming something terrible (and often fire-related) doesn’t happen first, careful gameplay should most often bring your mummy into contact with the <a href=\"/Altars\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Altars\">altars</a> of one or more <a href=\"/Gods\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gods\">gods</a>. Thus, you must decide which deity you wish to give your allegiance, at least for the time being. \n</p><p>Being the reviled <a href=\"/Undead\" title=\"Undead\">undead</a> character you are, you already have limited options. A couple prayers to <a href=\"/Fedhas_Madash\" title=\"Fedhas Madash\">Fedhas Madash</a> and you’d probably end up a pile of dirt!\n</p><p>If you find an early altar to a god you particularly enjoy, consider using it. After all, even if it doesn’t work out, you can easily get another mummy fighter to dungeon level 2 or 3. However, assuming you don’t, or are particularly mindful of longevity, there is one generally superior option.\n</p><p>Returning again to what was mentioned regarding your mummies reliance on items and skills, no god will provide you a better boon for both than <a href=\"/Okawaru\" title=\"Okawaru\">Okawaru</a>. <a href=\"/Trog\" title=\"Trog\">Trog</a> might make a close second, but assuming you haven’t found a good weapon and body armor just lying around, you’re going to need an immediate combat boost to help you strip both off forthcoming monsters. Normally, Trog provides this with his gift of rage, but not for your lifeless ass. Obviously, this gap can’t be bridged with <a href=\"/Potions\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Potions\">potions</a> either.\n</p><p>Admittedly, being devoted to a deity means you are now somewhat tied to a ‘piety clock’ rather than ‘food clock’, and as such time now does have some bearing upon you, but for the most part this is manageable. While food isn’t always regularly assured in Dungeon Crawl, you will never lack for monsters to kill or corpses to sacrifice.\n</p><p>Perhaps the only perceptible investment with Okawaru is the <a href=\"/Invocations\" title=\"Invocations\">invocations</a> skill to make your <i>finesse</i> ability reliable, but remember that this requires no more than a few levels and only needs to happen at or beyond the fifth star of piety.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"God_selection_2\">God selection</span></h4>\n<ul><li> If you find an early altar to <a href=\"/Ashenzari\" title=\"Ashenzari\">Ashenzari</a>, <a href=\"/Cheibriados\" title=\"Cheibriados\">Cheibriados</a>, <a href=\"/Xom\" title=\"Xom\">Xom</a>, <a href=\"/Makhleb\" title=\"Makhleb\">Makhleb</a>, <a href=\"/Nemelex_Xobeh\" title=\"Nemelex Xobeh\">Nemelex Xobeh</a>, <a href=\"/Trog\" title=\"Trog\">Trog</a>, or <a href=\"/Yredelemnul\" title=\"Yredelemnul\">Yredelemnul</a> and and you enjoy worshiping them, you should consider doing so.</li>\n<li> If you reach the <a href=\"/Temple\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Temple\">temple</a> first, or want what is arguably the best god for you mummy fighter, worship <a href=\"/File:Okawaru_altar.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Okawaru altar.png\" src=\"/images/a/a6/Okawaru_altar.png\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" /></a> <a href=\"/Okawaru\" title=\"Okawaru\">Okawaru</a>.</li>\n<li> If you do worship Okawaru, make sure you get a few levels of invocations skill to make your <i>finesse</i> ability reliable.</li>\n<li> Remember that the gods dislike inactivity, so if you do choose to worship one, kiss goodbye either your ability to <a href=\"/Scumming\" title=\"Scumming\">scum</a> or finding any favor with that god.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transition_to_mid-game\">Transition to mid-game</span></h2>\n<p>Unless you score some lucky item finds which bolster you early on, avoid <a href=\"/Orc_warrior\" title=\"Orc warrior\">orc warriors</a>, most <a href=\"/Unique_monster\" title=\"Unique monster\">uniques</a>, and other similar problems until you’ve earned your <i>heroism</i> ability. Along with a requisitely high enough <a href=\"/Experience_level\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Experience level\">experience level</a>, this boon will permit you to slay most of these problems even with mediocre gear. Thus, your first priority once you get <i>heroism</i> is to seek out orc warriors with their choice gear and forcibly remove it from them. Although it might take a few, you’re ultimately aiming for <a href=\"/File:Plate1.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Plate1.png\" src=\"/images/6/63/Plate1.png\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" /></a> <a href=\"/Plate_armor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Plate armor\">plate armor</a> and a <a href=\"/File:Morningstar1.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Morningstar1.png\" src=\"/images/f/f2/Morningstar1.png\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" /></a> <a href=\"/Morningstar\" title=\"Morningstar\">morningstar</a>, provided you don’t find any nice <a href=\"/Artifacts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Artifacts\">artifacts</a> or particularly enchanted items prior to.\n</p><p>One other item to particularly keep an eye out for is an <a href=\"/Amulet_of_faith\" title=\"Amulet of faith\">amulet of faith</a>. While these can easily be double-edged devices, there are fewer <a href=\"/Amulet\" title=\"Amulet\">amulets</a> that are useful to a mummy than most other characters. Certainly <a href=\"/Amulet_of_rage\" title=\"Amulet of rage\">rage</a> and <a href=\"/Amulet_of_the_gourmand\" title=\"Amulet of the gourmand\">gourmand</a> are out of the question, but even <a href=\"/Amulet_of_warding\" title=\"Amulet of warding\">warding</a> and <a href=\"/Amulet_of_resist_mutation\" title=\"Amulet of resist mutation\">resist mutation</a> are not going to be particularly useful, at least during this part of the game.\n</p><p>What’s important is the weapon and armor gifts that Okawaru is presumably going to shower upon you, and the amulet of faith makes those occur 33% faster. Getting better gear in most other equipable item slots is likely well worth this use of your amulet slot.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Branch_hopping\">Branch hopping <a href=\"/File:Orc_entry.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Orc entry.png\" src=\"/images/3/30/Orc_entry.png\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" /></a> <a href=\"/File:Lair_entry.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Lair entry.png\" src=\"/images/b/b8/Lair_entry.png\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" /></a> <a href=\"/File:Vaults_entry.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Vaults entry.png\" src=\"/images/c/c5/Vaults_entry.png\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" /></a></span></h3>\n<p>Sometimes making the journey from one <a href=\"/Branch\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Branch\">branch</a> to another can burn through a fair amount of food, especially if you make these trips regularly. Since this is not an issue for your mummy you should be particularly liberal in undertaking these expeditions. Whenever your danger sense alerts you that things are getting rough, and particularly if you encounter a decent unique, back out and take your game somewhere else. There will always be other branches available, and when there isn’t, you’ve reached the <a href=\"/Late_Game_Character_Building\" title=\"Late Game Character Building\">late game</a>!\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transition_to_mid-game_2\">Transition to mid-game</span></h4>\n<ul><li> Gain the <i>heroism</i> ability and use it to slay an orc warrior to get plate armor and a morningstar, if you don’t have them already.</li>\n<li> Consider the use of an amulet of faith to speed up piety gain and increase the frequency of Okawaru’s gifts</li>\n<li> Branch hop as needed between the early and middle game branches, as listed in the <a href=\"/Walkthrough\" title=\"Walkthrough\">walkthrough</a>, especially if you run into a dangerous unique monster.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transition_to_late_game\">Transition to late game</span></h2>\n<p>If you’ve reached the late game you arguably don’t need a guide, at least not one particularly specific to your mummy fighter; you will be much more well-rounded by this point. Nonetheless, reaching that point requires, yet again, items and skills. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Skills\">Skills</span></h3>\n<p>In terms of skills, you should have reached level 16 maces &amp; flails long ago, or at least stopped training it no sooner than that level, presuming you haven’t made a transition to a heavier and slower two-handed weapon. If your shield is magical enough to warrant keeping, train your <a href=\"/Shields\" title=\"Shields\">shields</a> skill to level 15, unless you have a <a href=\"/Large_shield\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Large shield\">large shield</a>, which requires skill level 25.\n</p><p>Once those are finished, bring both your <a href=\"/Fighting\" title=\"Fighting\">fighting</a> and <a href=\"/Armour_skill\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Armour skill\">armour skill</a> to a high level. Also strongly consider working on a <a href=\"/Ranged_attack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ranged attack\">ranged attack</a> skill. If you keep you shield on, you should probably consider between <a href=\"/Throwing\" title=\"Throwing\">throwing</a>, <a href=\"/Slings\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Slings\">slings</a>, and <a href=\"/Evocations\" title=\"Evocations\">evocations</a> for <a href=\"/Wand\" title=\"Wand\">wand</a> zapping.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Items\">Items</span></h3>\n<p>With enough time, there is a good chance that Okawaru will gift you either an<a href=\"/File:Eveningstar1.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Eveningstar1.png\" src=\"/images/3/3a/Eveningstar1.png\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" /></a>  <a href=\"/Eveningstar\" title=\"Eveningstar\">eveningstar</a>, <a href=\"/File:Crystal_plate.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Crystal plate.png\" src=\"/images/3/35/Crystal_plate.png\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" /></a> <a href=\"/Crystal_plate_armor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crystal plate armor\">crystal plate armor</a>, or both. Presuming you’re keeping your shield around, these are the excellent and desired replacements for your plate armor and morningstar. <a href=\"/Dragon_armor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dragon armor\">Dragon armors</a> are certainly worthy as well, and you should keep any extras in your inventory or stash for all those needed <a href=\"/Resistances\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Resistances\">resistances</a> (most certainly including fire-resistance).\n</p><p>Obviously, there are many other viable options and assortments as well, just try to keep your <a

guide}}\n{{version014}}\n\nWith their limitless ability to [[Channel energy|channel magical energy]] and a permanent [[Spell Hunger|hunger-free spellcasting]], [[File:Mummy.png]] [[Mummy|mummies]] are known as worthwhile [[Wizard|spellcasters]], but fewer take the time to pair their unique abilities with the pursuits of a [[Fighter|melee fighter]]. In this walkthrough, we take a look at those potentials and find what remarkable warriors these undead characters can actually become.\n\n==Getting started==\n\nThe only meaningful decision to make when starting out with a mummy fighter is [[weapon selection]]. Normally, at least a bit of leeway can be given to one’s personal preferences and playstyle, but in the early game, your mummy will be especially weak, so he’ll need every advantage he can get.\n\nOne of those advantages is keeping a [[shield]], at least for a substantial chunk of the game, to help make up for a lack of immediate healing abilities (more blocking = less hit points to worry about healing). With that in mind, [[axes]] and [[polearms]] should generally be avoided, as both of their one-handed options are generally inferior to our other possibilities. Essentially, it comes down to [[long blades]] and [[maces & flails]]. In terms of speed and damage, both of their most powerful one-handed options are comparable (the [[bastard sword]] and [[eveningstar]], respectively) but that bastard sword still uses 30% more [[dexterity]] than the bulky eveningstar. Since your mummy will only be marginal in dexterity but pretty good on [[strength]], it leaves maces & flails as the superlative selection.\n\nRemember, even if you find a [[great mace]] or the like early on, wielding it will often lead to your demise as you’ll be giving up that extra layer of protection without a shield and your low maces & flails skill will mean you’ll be attacking slowly with it. Save the two-handed options for later.\n\n====Getting started====\n\n* ‘Maces & flails’ is the most compatible weapon type for a mummy fighter\n* Focus your ‘maces & flails’ skill so you can skillfully use increasingly heavier weapons\n\n==Extra-conservative gameplay==\n\nIt’s already a maxim in dungeon crawl to avoid danger when possible, and this (unsurprisingly) rings all the more true for your mummy fighter, particularly in the [[Early Game Character Building|early game]]. \n\nYour success is going to be predicated on [[item]] acquirement and [[skill]] progression rather than [[spells]] and innate [[abilities]]. As such, and for the time being, you need to play as if you were more of an [[assassin]] than a fighter. That is, luring enemies to you, facing them one-on-one, and avoiding groups when possible. Perhaps this is clichéd advice that you already practice, but there are some general strategies that might be a waste of [[food]] for a mortal character to constantly practice, but are never uneconomical for your timeless mummy.\n\n===Triple visitation [[File:Stairs down.png]] [[File:Stairs down.png]] [[File:Stairs down.png]]===\n\n[[Escaping from (and avoiding) trouble#Triple_visitation|Triple visitation]] means not only finding all three [[Stairs|downstairs]], as most do, but using all three to separately journey down and take a peak around before fully engaging the new level. This isn’t always a practical strategy for other characters, primarily when they are facing a tough food shortage. Obviously, your mummy is impervious to this plight, and should make a general habit of this tactic. Individual and weak enemies can certainly be brought back upstairs and finished off under controlled conditions. \n\nGetting comfortable with this tactic makes portals and branch beginnings feel a bit more harrowing than they normally would, as you’ll obviously have only one entry point.\n\n===Noise can be your friend===\n\nContrary to the advice of some, [[noise]] can sometimes be your friend. Each time you first travel downstairs, particularly if there are no monsters in your line-of-sight, give a [[T|shout]] and see what shouts, croaks, or moans back at you. Not only does this give you some idea of what might be out there and from which staircase you might begin your exploration, but it also awakens nearby [[Sleep|sleeping]] groups of [[monsters]], many of whom might wander off from their group and be faced one-on-one, either immediately or further in.\n\n===Pathway of (un)life===\n\nNormally [[O|auto-explore]] is a good practice, particularly when you have a vulnerable character who might be ‘one-shot’ killed with just one wrong step. While it’s true that underneath all that armor you're still just a desiccated [[corpse]] held together by wrappings, you're also not a flimsy spellcaster, so insta-death isn’t a usual concern.\n\nWhat is a concern however, is finding a good safe place to undertake your slow but otherwise free [[healing]] when you need it. As you also know, few immediate places are better than at the top of those upstairs you’ve established. As such, before you consider doing any algorithmically-based searching, I would suggest you manually map out a connection between those three upstairs. Once again, this might be a waste of food for any other character, but your mummy can never have too much access to what functions as a free healing oasis.\n\n====Extra-conservative gameplay====\n\n* '''Triple visitation''' – once you’ve cleared a level, visit the next one using each of the three downstairs before deciding which one you want to start further exploration from.\n* '''Shout''' – Each time you go downstairs and are not immediately threatened by monsters, shout and see what shouts back. You can always scurry back upstairs if you awaken something unmanageable.\n* '''Pathway of (un)life''' – once you do decide where to enter the next level, immediately connect the three upstairs together on your map. Three stairs are better than one.\n\n==God selection==\n\nAssuming something terrible (and often fire-related) doesn’t happen first, careful gameplay should most often bring your mummy into contact with the [[altars]] of one or more [[gods]]. Thus, you must decide which deity you wish to give your allegiance, at least for the time being. \n\nBeing the reviled [[undead]] character you are, you already have limited options. A couple prayers to [[Fedhas Madash]] and you’d probably end up a pile of dirt!\n\nIf you find an early altar to a god you particularly enjoy, consider using it. After all, even if it doesn’t work out, you can easily get another mummy fighter to dungeon level 2 or 3. However, assuming you don’t, or are particularly mindful of longevity, there is one generally superior option.\n\nReturning again to what was mentioned regarding your mummies reliance on items and skills, no god will provide you a better boon for both than [[Okawaru]]. [[Trog]] might make a close second, but assuming you haven’t found a good weapon and body armor just lying around, you’re going to need an immediate combat boost to help you strip both off forthcoming monsters. Normally, Trog provides this with his gift of rage, but not for your lifeless ass. Obviously, this gap can’t be bridged with [[potions]] either.\n\nAdmittedly, being devoted to a deity means you are now somewhat tied to a ‘piety clock’ rather than ‘food clock’, and as such time now does have some bearing upon you, but for the most part this is manageable. While food isn’t always regularly assured in Dungeon Crawl, you will never lack for monsters to kill or corpses to sacrifice.\n\nPerhaps the only perceptible investment with Okawaru is the [[invocations]] skill to make your ''finesse'' ability reliable, but remember that this requires no more than a few levels and only needs to happen at or beyond the fifth star of piety.\n\n====God selection====\n\n* If you find an early altar to [[Ashenzari]], [[Cheibriados]], [[Xom]], [[Makhleb]], [[Nemelex Xobeh]], [[Trog]], or [[Yredelemnul]] and and you enjoy worshiping them, you should consider doing so.\n* If you reach the [[temple]] first, or want what is arguably the best god for you mummy fighter, worship [[File:Okawaru altar.png]] [[Okawaru]].\n* If you do worship Okawaru, make sure you get a few levels of invocations skill to make your ''finesse'' ability reliable.\n* Remember that the gods dislike inactivity, so if you do choose to worship one, kiss goodbye either your ability to [[Scumming|scum]] or finding any favor with that god.\n\n==Transition to mid-game==\n\nUnless you score some lucky item finds which bolster you early on, avoid [[Orc warrior|orc warriors]], most [[Unique monster|uniques]], and other similar problems until you’ve earned your ''heroism'' ability. Along with a requisitely high enough [[experience level]], this boon will permit you to slay most of these problems even with mediocre gear. Thus, your first priority once you get ''heroism'' is to seek out orc warriors with their choice gear and forcibly remove it from them. Although it might take a few, you’re ultimately aiming for [[File:Plate1.png]] [[plate armor]] and a [[File:Morningstar1.png]] [[morningstar]], provided you don’t find any nice [[artifacts]] or particularly enchanted items prior to.\n\nOne other item to particularly keep an eye out for is an [[amulet of faith]]. While these can easily be double-edged devices, there are fewer [[Amulet|amulets]] that are useful to a mummy than most other characters. Certainly [[Amulet of rage|rage]] and [[Amulet of the gourmand|gourmand]] are out of the question, but even [[Amulet of warding|warding]] and [[Amulet of resist mutation|resist mutation]] are not going to be particularly useful, at least during this part of the game.\n\nWhat’s important is the weapon and armor gifts that Okawaru is presumably going to shower upon you, and the amulet of faith makes those occur 33% faster. Getting better gear in most other equipable item slots is likely well worth this use of your amulet slot.\n\n===Branch hopping [[File:Orc entry.png]] [[File:Lair entry.png]] [[File:Vaults entry.png]]===\n\nSometimes making the journey from one [[branch]] to another can burn through a fair amount of food, especially if you make these trips regularly. Since this is not an issue for your mummy you should be particularly liberal in undertaking these expeditions. Whenever your danger sense alerts you that things are getting rough, and particularly if you encounter a decent unique, back out and take your game somewhere else. There will always be other branches available, and when there isn’t, you’ve reached the [[Late Game Character Building|late game]]!\n\n====Transition to mid-game====\n\n* Gain the ''heroism'' ability and use it to slay an orc warrior to get plate armor and a morningstar, if you don’t have them already.\n* Consider the use of an amulet of faith to speed up piety gain and increase the frequency of Okawaru’s gifts\n* Branch hop as needed between the early and middle game branches, as listed in the [[walkthrough]], especially if you run into a dangerous unique monster.\n\n==Transition to late game==\n\nIf you’ve reached the late game you arguably don’t need a guide, at least not one particularly specific to your mummy fighter; you will be much more well-rounded by this point. Nonetheless, reaching that point requires, yet again, items and skills. \n\n===Skills===\n\nIn terms of skills, you should have reached level 16 maces & flails long ago, or at least stopped training it no sooner than that level, presuming you haven’t made a transition to a heavier and slower two-handed weapon. If your shield is magical enough to warrant keeping, train your [[shields]] skill to level 15, unless you have a [[large shield]], which requires skill level 25.\n\nOnce those are finished, bring both your [[fighting]] and [[armour skill]] to a high level. Also strongly consider working on a [[ranged attack]] skill. If you keep you shield on, you should probably consider between [[throwing]], [[slings]], and [[evocations]] for [[wand]] zapping.\n\n===Items===\n\nWith enough time, there is a good chance that Okawaru will gift you either an[[File:Eveningstar1.png]]  [[eveningstar]], [[File:Crystal plate.png]] [[crystal plate armor]], or both. Presuming you’re keeping your shield around, these are the excellent and desired replacements for your plate armor and morningstar. [[Dragon armor|Dragon armors]] are certainly worthy as well, and you should keep any extras in your inventory or stash for all those needed [[resistances]] (most certainly including fire-resistance).\n\nObviously, there are many other viable options and assortments as well, just try to keep your [[guaranteed damage reduction]] in mind, you're still a slow-healing mummy after all..."}

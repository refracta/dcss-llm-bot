{"title":"Amulet of resist slowing","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Amulet_of_resist_slowing","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\nThe '''amulet of resist slowing''' prevents the player from receiving the [[slow]] status effect. In addition, it extended the duration of [[haste]] effects (it resists you from slowing down from hasted speed).\n\n==Desirability==\nFor most characters, it's better than nothing. For casters, its around on par with an [[amulet of clarity]]. Any character can appreciate the extension of haste, though you'll likely prefer an amulet of conservation or resist mutation by the lategame.\n\nA godsend for [[Berserker]]s, since it prevents the slow after berserking. You'll still have to worry about [[paralysis]], at least if [[Trog]] piety isn't high enough.\n\n==History==\n*The amulet of resist slowing was replaced with the [[amulet of stasis]] in [[0.6]].\n*In very ancient versions of Crawl, these were known as '''amulets of maintain speed'''."}

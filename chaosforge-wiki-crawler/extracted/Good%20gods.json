{"title":"Good gods","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Good_gods","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n\nThere are three [[good gods]] in ''Dungeon Crawl'''s pantheon who are allied together in the fight against (so-called) [[evil]]: [[Zin]] the Law-Giver, [[the Shining One]], and [[Elyvilon]] the Healer.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe good gods, being allies, have several features in common:\n*Codes of conduct to which followers must abide, including hatred for [[evil]].\n**[[Demonspawn]] and the [[undead]] ([[Mummies]], [[Ghoul]]s, [[Vampire]]s, players in [[Death Form]]) are not allowed to worship good gods.\n*No [[divine retribution]] for leaving their religion or converting to another god, unless it is [[evil]]. [[Penance]] is still incurred, but the god simply does not act upon it.\n**When switching between good gods, you will still receive \"penance\", but half of your original [[piety]] is retained.\n*Several defensive and protective powers granted to their followers, able to be trained with [[Invocations]].\n*Good gods may intervene to save your life on an otherwise fatal blow, even while under penance.\n\n==Code of Conduct==\nThe good gods share a code of conduct. Common elements across all three are:\n*No [[Necromancy]] or [[evil]] spells. \n**Entering [[Death Form]] causes instant excommunication.\n*No [[unholy]] items.\n**Wielding unholy weapons is fine, but actually attacking with one is not allowed. This allows you to take advantage of non-combat benefits provided by unholy [[artefact]] weapons safely. Wearing unholy armour, however, is immediately frowned upon.\n**Accidental use of unidentified forbidden items will be forgiven. This includes [[scrolls of torment]] for all three and [[potions of mutation]] (while under 6*) or [[lignification]] for Zin.\n*No harming non-hostile [[neutral]] or allied beings.\n**[[Inner Flame]] explosions created by the player will anger the good gods if it hits an ally.\n**Confused allies hitting each other will incur penance to the player if one is killed. One should be cautious if enemies with [[Mass Confusion]] are present.\n\n==Additional requirements==\nEach god has additional requirements based on their likes and dislikes:\n\n*[[Zin]] hates [[chaotic|chaos]] and thus [[mutation]]s and [[talisman|forms]], but rewards selfless donations of [[gold]] and the slaying of chaotic creatures. It also takes a [[tithe]] automatically whenever followers pick up gold.\n*[[The Shining One]] demands honourable combat, so prevents [[stab]]bing. You'll also gain a [[halo]], preventing you from going [[invisible]].\n*[[Elyvilon]] preaches a creed of pacifism and allows you to [[pacify]] monsters instead of killing them. Slaying enemy creatures instead of sparing them will not cause penance, but also not grant piety (even for evil ones).\n\nSee each god's page for more details.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], all three gods hated [[cannibalism]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], [[:Category:Holy holiness|holy monsters]] would often become friendly and allow the player to pass in peace if you worshiped a good god. This chance was based on your piety.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], switching between good gods would not incur penance. Therefore, players would switch to Elyvilon, who had the weakest wrath, if they wanted to worship an evil/chaotic god.\n\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Good Gods]]"}

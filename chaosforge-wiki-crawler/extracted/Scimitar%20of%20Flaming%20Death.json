Occasionally its heat leaks out, covering opponents in magical flame.}}\n[[File:Scimitar_of_flaming_death.png]] '''''the +6 scimitar of Flaming Death'''''<br>\n\n+6 [[scimitar]]\n\n[[Flaming]] brand<br>\nOccasionally inflicts [[Sticky Flame]] on targets.<br>\nrF++<br>\nrC-<br>\nrPois<br>\nMR+\n\n==Desirability==\nThe big brother of the [[Dagger of Chilly Death]], this weapon is quite decent in the early- to mid-game if you manage to find it. It's especially useful in the [[Lair]], since it kills [[hydra]]s with ease, protects against the numerous sources of poison, and protects you from the one ranged threat there, [[fire drake]]s. In the late game you may wish to switch to something more powerful, particularly if you don't have a way to overcome the rank of [[cold]] vulnerability, but its solid defensive traits, decent damage output, occasionally useful brand, and damage-and-accuracy boosting [[Sticky Flame]] effect can be quite effective in most situations.\n\n==History==\n*This unrand artifact was removed in [[0.20]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], this weapon's enchantment level was +7, +5. It didn't inflict sticky flame.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], it only provided +20 MR.\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Long blades]]"}

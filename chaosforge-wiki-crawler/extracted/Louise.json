{"title":"Louise","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Louise","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Louise the Corrupted''' is a heavily-armed [[unique]] spellcaster notorious for sending characters to [[the Abyss]] far earlier than they'd like. She's usually armed with a decent weapon, [[tower shield]], and armour, making her less fragile than the average unique caster.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:14-15\n*The [[Elven Halls]]\n*[[The Swamp]]\n*[[The Snake Pit]]\n*[[The Shoals]]\n*The [[Spider's Nest]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Getting hit by Banishment without the proper gear is an almost certain death sentence for low-level characters. If you spot Louise and are within easy reach of some [[stairs]], consider making a tactical retreat back to your [[stash]] for whatever [[willpower]]-bolstering gear you have available.\n*She can only banish you as long as you're in her line of effect, so summons can be very useful for blocking it.\n*Louise cannot [[see invisible]]. Use this to greatly reduce the chance of her using magic against you.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Louise had the [[Sting]] spell.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

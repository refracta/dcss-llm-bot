{"title":"Wizard (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wizard_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{monster info|wizard}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Wizards''' are spell casters who can roast you with [[Fireball]]s or [[banish]] you into [[the Abyss]]. Fortunately, they are flimsy. You can find them in the late [[Dungeon]], [[the Vaults]], [[the Depths]], and Lom Lobon's [[Pandemonium]] floor.\n\n{{monster spells|wizard}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Wizards can deal high damage, but they aren't too [[ev]]asive, cannot [[see invisible]], and don't have much [[willpower]]. \n*[[Banishment]] requires line of fire, and can be defeated by high enough [[willpower]] of your own. Fire resistance is helpful to defend against [[Fireball]]s, too.\n*Wizards are... wizards. They can't do much when [[silence]]d or [[waterlog]]ged.\n\n==Variant Wizards==\n[[File:Hell_wizard_75.png]] You may encounter a '''mad acolyte of Lugonu''' when approaching certain [[rune]] vaults in [[the Abyss]]. These variant wizards always spawn wielding [[distortion]]-[[brand]]ed weapons and can cast [[Smiting]], [[Malign Gateway]], [[Blink]], [[Blink Other]], and [[Invisibility]].\n\n{{flavour|A devoted follower of Lugonu, driven mad by years of living in the Abyss.\n\n----\n\n\"And when you look long into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you.\"\n\n-Friedrich Nietzche, \"Beyond Good and Evil\", 1886}}\n\nA permanently [[silence]]d '''terrified wizard''' can often be found caged in one of [[Trog]]'s possible altar vaults. It usually dies from Trog's wrath too fast for you to kill, but if you have a [[wand of digging]], you can free and kill this mute wizard for about 600 XP.\n\n{{flavour|A wild-eyed wizard whose tongue has been cut out, frantically mumbling and waving its arms but unable to cast a single spell.}}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], wizards were split into [[occultist]]s and [[arcanist]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], they could have one of three possible spell sets:\n**[[Bolt of Cold]] (3d18), [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] (3d28), [[Slow]], and [[Haste]]\n**[[Force Lance]] (3d14), [[Fireball]] (3d19), [[Paralyze]], and [[Blink]]\n**[[Stone Arrow]] (3d17), [[Lightning Bolt]] (3d17), [[Banishment]], and [[Invisibility]]\n*Prior to [[0.25]], wizards could have [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] instead of [[Force Lance]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], they could cast [[Bolt of Fire]], [[Confuse]], [[Magic Dart]], [[Throw Flame]], [[Sting]], and [[Venom Bolt]]. Also, wizards had five spell sets instead of three.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], wizards could cast [[Teleport Self]] and [[Teleport Other]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], you could meet more variant wizards in the game. A '''crazed wizard''' was guarding a [[Hell]] entrance on the last floor of [[the Lair]]. This monster was identical to a standard wizard, but had [[HD]] 13 instead of 10. A '''mad wizard''' capable of casting [[Polymorph Other]] could be found near a room full of [[laboratory rat]]s.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

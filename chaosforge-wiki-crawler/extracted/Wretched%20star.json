{"title":"Wretched star","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wretched_star","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Wretched stars''' are the chaos-spewing embodiments of [[Lugonu]]'s realm, inflicting temporary (transient) [[bad mutations]] on everything nearby. These [[mutations]] will go away on their own after you have killed a few monsters. They also occasionally blast you with non-elemental [[Conjurations]]. In addition to the Abyss, they can be found in [[Lehudib's Moon Base]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Unlike [[Malmutate]], [[Corrupting Pulse]] doesn't require a line of fire. It affects all nearby opponents, so you cannot hide from the spell behind allies or other monsters.\n*Make sure to check your mutations. Melee characters should watch out for a sudden [[Berserk (mutation)|Berserkitis]], while any character should beware of [[No Unsafe Scrolls]] and [[No Unsafe Potions]].\n*The waves of bad mutations affect your allies too, reducing their speed, AC, and damage output. \n*Undead will suffer temporary stat drain instead of mutations, with a coinflip chance of nothing happening. They should hence be careful of [[stat zero]].\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]] only, wretched stars cast [[Corrupting Pulse]] less often, and it only gave 1 transient mutation. These changes were made as the Abyss no longer gave XP. These changes were reverted in [[0.29]], as the Abyss gave XP again.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], wretched stars had [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] instead of [[Force Lance]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], wretched stars' Corrupting Pulse mutated everyone in [[LOS]], even their allies.\n*Wretched stars were added in [[0.12]]."}

Transforms the user into an undying offense against life itself.\n\nFoes struck by user's melee weapons or hands are weakened, slowed, and drained, and they can heal themselves by tormenting foes nearby. (Shapeshifting skill increases the effectiveness of the latter.) The user also resists cold and is immune to poison, miasma, negative energy, and torment.\n\nThe user also gains some of the more dubious benefits of having an undead body. They are vulnerable to holy damage and Dispel Undead, and cannot consume potions.}}\n\n[[File:talisman of death.png]] A '''talisman of death''' ('''death talisman''') is a [[talisman]] that changes you into '''Death Form'''.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen e'''V'''oked, a talisman of death turns you into Death Form, which lasts until you end the form. Entering or exiting a form takes 5 turns.\n\nDeath Form has the following effects:\n\n'''Combat Bonuses'''\n* '''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' 9 base damage.\n* All melee attacks (including weapons) inflict [[drain]], [[slow]], and [[weak]]ness for 3-6 turns. [[Nonliving]] monsters are completely immune, but [[demon]]s, [[undead]], etc. can be slowed and weakened.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|melee-attack.cc|678}}</ref>\n* '''Siphon Essence:''' Active ability (20 MP). Inflicts [[torment]] to susceptible enemies within 2 tiles, then heals you for 100% of damage dealt, with a cap of <code>(19 + 3 * Shapeshifting) / 2</code> (50 at max skill).<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|ability.cc|2497}}</ref>\n\n'''Resistances'''\n* [[Willpower]]+\n* Standard '''[[undead]]''' resistances:\n** [[Cold resistance|rC+]]\n** Immunity to [[poison]] and [[miasma]].\n** [[Life protection|rN+++]] and immune to [[torment]]\n** Cannot be [[mutate]]d. Receive [[stat drain]] if you would be mutated.\n** Cannot be [[polymorph]]ed.\n** Vulnerable to [[holy]], [[holy wrath]], and [[Dispel Undead]].\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n* '''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' None.\n* Cannot drink [[potion]]s.\n* Cannot use certain forms of [[Necromancy]] ([[Sublimation of Blood]], [[Borgnjor's Revivification]], [[Death's Door]]). The holy wrath brand will not function on weapons you wield.\n\nDeath Form keeps most [[mutation]]s, does not change your [[size]], and gives no innate bonus to HP / [[AC]].\n\nDeath Form has a minimum [[Shapeshifting]] skill of 23, below which you get an [[Talisman#Skill|HP penalty]]. Maximum skill is 27, which is the cap on Shapeshifting itself.\n\n[[Vampire]]s cannot use this item, even when alive, as they are already undead.\n\n==Strategy==\nDeath Form is most useful in the [[extended game]]. Not having access to potions is a hefty penalty, but Death Form gives immunity to two important things: [[torment]] and [[mutation]]. If you don't plan on going into extended, Death Form generally isn't worth the XP investment.\n\nCompared to other forms, Death Form is an oddity. It doesn't give many combat bonuses, but it does let you keep all your equipment. Also, while Death Form has less damage, it is strong in 1v1 fights, as the melee debuffs are powerful. Overall, it can have some use before extended, though you'll be missing out on the raw power of Storm Form.\n\n==History==\n*Talismans of death were introduced in [[0.31]], along with talismans themselves. It replaces the level 8 [[Necromancy]]/[[Transmutation]] spell, [[Necromutation]] (lichform).\n:Previously, lich form gave +6 AC, 5 base unarmed combat damage with a [[draining]] branded attack and a [[spell enhancer]] for [[Necromancy]], but it did not weaken/slow enemies on hit or have the Siphon Essence ability.\n*Early versions of Siphon Essence worked on undead and demonic monsters.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Forms}}"}

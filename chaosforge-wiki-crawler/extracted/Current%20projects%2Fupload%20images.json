{"title":"Current projects/upload images","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Current_projects/upload_images","type":"raw","data":"== Description == \n\nThis project page is meant to organize the uploading of all monster images to the new wiki and keep track of our progress.\n\nYou can access the images to upload here: [http://git.develz.org/?p=crawl.git;a=tree;f=crawl-ref/source/rltiles/mon Monster tiles directory]\n\n== Missing Images ==\nCheck out [[Special:WantedFiles]] to see a list of images that are wanted on various articles.\n\nAlso, make sure to check [[Special:UnusedFiles]] before uploading a new image to see if there already is one, but not named correctly.\n\n\n== Status of the bot ==\nThe script [[Current projects/upload images/upload-images.pl]] can be used, but its functionality is still very basic. --[[User:CommanderC|CommanderC]] 01:12, 9 January 2013 (CET)\n\n\n== How to use the bot ==\n*Create an account with bot permissions. \n*Install a [http://www.perl.org perl interpreter] and the [http://search.cpan.org/~exobuzz/MediaWiki-API-0.39/ MediaWiki::API] perl module.\n*Download the source code of the current stable version of crawl: [https://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/downloads]. Get the ''no-deps'' version which is smaller, and extract it.\n*Download the source code of the bot: [[Current projects/upload images/upload-images.pl]]\n*Open the script with a text editor and change the values of the variables $username and $password. You can also change the amount of time it waits between uploads, but don't set it too low. By default, it will wait 60 seconds.\n*The script only requires one argument, the path of the directory that contains the images. For example:\n perl upload-images.pl crawl/crawl-ref/source/rltiles/mon"}

However, as it is a barding, only [[Naga]]s and [[Armataur]]s can wear it. \n\nNagas with these scales will move below average speed (1.2 move delay), but that's still a significant improvement. It allows you to reposition without as many attacks, and lets you retreat a few more tiles before being attacked. The addition of [[Swiftness]] will allow them to finally move faster than average.\n\nArmataurs, meanwhile, get to permanently move at above-average speed. This is a large benefit - fast speed means you can [[kite]] enemies, avoid [[attacks of opportunity]], and retreat easier.\n\nFollowers of [[Cheibriados]] should avoid this item, as that god forbids hasty items like this.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], only nagas could wear the lightning scales.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], this artefact always reduced movement delay by 2, but only had a +3 enchantment bonus to AC.\n*The lightning scales were added in [[0.10]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Barding]]"}

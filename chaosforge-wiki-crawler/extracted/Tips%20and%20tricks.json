{"title":"Tips and tricks","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tips_and_tricks","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\nThis is a collection of random tips and tricks for those who are starting to play ''Dungeon Crawl''.\n\n==General==\n*Don't forget that ''Dungeon Crawl'' is a turn-based game; monsters won't act until after you do. If the situation grows dire, stop and think about every aspect before picking a solution and making your move. Indeed, you can even save your game and leave the computer to do something else, then come back later -- some time to calm down and think can often let you salvage a situation that originally looked hopeless. You may have a brilliant idea that you wouldn't have had in the heat of the moment! \n**Note that \"remembering stuff\" costs no game time; this includes looking through your inventory ('i' command), your spells ('z' command followed by '?'), your abilities ('a' command), your maps of the dungeon ('X' command), and using 'ctrl+f' to search for (but not travel to) known items in the dungeon. Note that within the 'X' command, you can use '[' and ']' to switch levels -- to descend into a branch, put the cursor on its entry stair before using ']'.\n*You do not have to fight and kill all monsters ''now'' (or ever). In roguelike games such as ''Dungeon Crawl'', there is no guarantee that you'll be able to overcome all the challenges you meet, and escaping or ignoring some monsters or branches for the moment is a perfectly valid strategy. Remember, your goal is to survive.\n*While it's best to [[Specialization|specialize]] early on and invest all your XP into a couple of skills to ensure you've got some reliable means of surviving, as the game progresses you should diversify your skills to ensure you can meet any challenge. \n**Melee fighters might want to learn [[Spellcasting]] and dabble in magic, even if its just with [[Evocations]].\n**Spellcasters will want to invest some XP into [[Fighting]], [[Dodging]], and perhaps [[Armour]] and/or [[Shields]]. \n**Don't forget about [[Invocations]] and [[Evocations]] either, depending on your god choice or equipment.\n*Early game [[potion]] and [[scroll]] identification is straightforward for a couple of common items; [[potions of curing]] and [[scrolls of identify]] are the most common of their type. However, the next most common scroll, the [[scroll of teleportation]], could be troublesome in an uncleared level. You can view item rarity with the '''\\''' key (- to see unidentified items).\n*Knowing which dungeon branches you should tackle, and in what order, will make your game smooth and your progress quick. See the [[Walkthrough]] for more information.\n*If you haven't won yet, stick with the basic 3 rune game. As you gain skill, start exploring the optional endgame branches.\n\n==Monsters==\n*Do your best to learn every monster's strengths and weaknesses, behaviour, and pattern of attack. All such information can be found right here on this [[Main Page|wiki]]! Another resource are the Knowledge Bots available in Crawl servers, IRC or the official ''Crawl'' [http://crawl.develz.org/info/index.php website].\n*Whenever possible, fight in corridors that are one tile wide to avoid being surrounded by monsters. If there isn't a convenient corridor, you can use a [[wand of digging]] to create one. If you use ranged abilities or spells and miss your first target, you even have a chance of hitting the monsters lined up behind it! Doorways are another option, although intelligent monsters will move past you to give their companions a shot at mauling you.\n*If neither are available, you can fight on a staircase leading to the previous level. When a monster moves next to you, it will follow you if you go upstairs: you can break up groups of monsters and kill them one by one this way.\n*To \"pull\" single monsters while avoiding their neighbours, shoot them with missiles (such as [[stone]]s) or with a single target spell like [[Magic Dart]]. Yelling (tt) should only be used when you want to wake all nearby creatures, including nearby ones out of sight. Keep in mind that many monsters may make noise if they either get hit or spot you, possibly waking up other monsters nearby.\n*Some monsters avoid known [[trap]]s; you can therefore take shelter behind a trap and kill these creatures with missiles or spells. Likewise, many monsters avoid damaging areas such as [[cloud]]s of miasma or noxious fumes created by spells like [[Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot]] and [[Mephitic Cloud]]. On the other hand, mindless and high [[HD|level]] monsters will walk into traps and clouds to get to you; you can exploit this advantage by standing next to a [[condenser vane|cloud of flame]], for example, and letting a zombie toast itself trying to get to you.\n*Known teleport [[trap]]s and [[shaft]]s can become an emergency means of escape. Step on them to escape a horde of enemies, or trick a tough monster into stepping on them to get rid of them for a while.\n\n==Items==\n*Many items can be identified by trying them out. You can read tips about identifying items this way [[Identification|here]]. Also, when looking at inventory or stack lists, notice the color items are displayed in, as this can tell you things your character knows but the player might not:\n;{{DarkGrey|Dark Grey}}: Item is currently unusable\n;{{LightGrey|Light Grey}}: Item is unidentified, or is a standard identified item\n;{{Blue|Blue}}: Item is unidentified and magical\n;{{LightGreen|Bright Green}}: Item is equipped\n;{{White|White}}: Item is a [[randart|random]] [[artefact]]\n;{{LightRed|Bright Red}}: Item is generally harmful to use\n;{{Red|Red}}: Item is hated by your [[god]]\n;{{LightMagenta|Purple}}: Item is potentially dangerous to use (will warn you if you try to use it)\n;{{Yellow|Yellow}}: Item is beneficial\n;{{LightCyan|Light Blue}}: Item is highly beneficial, or an [[unrand]] artefact\n*You won't be able to carry every worthwhile item you come across, since you're limited to 52 types of items in your inventory. Keep in mind that you can use (ctrl+f) to look for items if you're not sure exactly where you left them. Some players might want to create a centralized [[stash]] at a known location.\n*A [[scroll of blinking]] is the most reliable means of escape for characters early on. Use them wisely to avoid death.\n*A [[scroll of teleportation]] can also be used to escape, but is riskier - especially if you're on a level you haven't fully explored. It beats a guaranteed chance of death; but as it takes some time to activate, make sure its not guaranteed next turn.\n\n==Spells==\n*[[Mephitic Cloud]] is one of the best tools at your disposal. Any monster not resistant to poison can be confused via this spell. While in their confused state, monsters will move and attack randomly, and may even damage themselves or their friends!\n*In emergencies, you can use the [[Sublimation of Blood]] spell to restore MP if you have a high [[Necromancy]] skill and enough HP to spare.\n*[[Blink]] can be a lifesaver if you get into a jam and need to run away, especially if you're a slow species. Keep in mind that, unlike with a scroll of blinking, you don't get to pick your destination, so you could blink ''towards'' trouble.\n\n==Miscellaneous==\n*Each regular level has 3 non-hatch staircases down and 3 staircases up, barring the top and bottom of a branch (which may contain an entrance to another branch). When you see fewer staircases, you know the level is not fully explored yet. The opposite may not be true: just because you see 6 staircases does not mean the level is fully explored. Missing stairs might only be accessible by going through an adjacent level -- some levels are split into multiple disconnected sections, and those sections need not be connected.\n*If you're going to stand in one spot for an extremely long period of time -- say, while recovering HP or waiting for a status to time out -- do so on a stairway so you can escape if something dangerous approaches.\n*[[Escape hatch]]es are special one-way staircases that lead you either up or down a floor. They always go to the same spot, but there's no guarantee that a staircase leading back will be anywhere near a hatch's landing point. There's almost never any risk in taking an escape hatch that leads upwards, and can create shortcuts now, or when you've got the [[Orb of Zot]]. But taking an escape hatch downwards can be risky, ''especially'' if it leads to the bottom floor of a branch.\n\n==Fighting Strategies==\nWhether your character is a melee fighter or a spellcaster, you can use the tactics described below.\n\n===If There is a Monster in View===\n*If the monster cannot move (like a [[statue]] or an [[oklob plant]]), leave it be and return to kill it once you have cleared the level, assuming you have the tools to do so. If you're not equipped to fight it, just leave.\n*If it is a [[hydra]], switch to a [[flaming]], ranged, or non-edged weapon, then proceed as usual (this does not apply to [[undead]] hydras -- you may safely use edged weapons on them). If it is a [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]] pretending to be a hydra, you may want to wait until it changes form or force it to change form with a [[wand of polymorph]].\n*If it is attacking you with an element you don't currently resist but can with appropriate randart weapons or rings, wield/put on that item. '''Do not switch other equipment (especially body armour), since this will take many turns during which the monster can attack you freely!'''\n*If there is an extremely dangerous monster in view, you may want to kill it as soon as possible, even if it is part of a larger group. If that would be too dangerous, run, teleport or blink away. Dangerous monsters include:\n**Paralyzing monsters, such as [[floating eye]]s\n**Monsters who can summon [[fiend]]s, such as [[dread lich]]es and [[Pandemonium lord]]s\n**[[Torment]]ing monsters (which remove 35-50% of your HP with a single hit unless you are immune to torment) such as [[fiend]]s, [[curse skull]]s, [[curse toe]]s, [[mummy priest]]s, [[royal mummy|royal mummies]], and [[tormentor]]s.\n**Monsters who can cast [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]], such as [[deep elf annihilator|deep elf]]/[[draconian annihilator]]s, [[wizard]]s, and [[ancient lich]]es.\n**Mutating monsters: [[neqoxec]]s, [[shining eye]]s, [[orb of fire|orbs of fire]], and [[Mnoleg]].\n**Monsters who attack you using an element you aren't resistant to\n**Smiting monsters, such as [[orc priest]]s and [[smoke demon]]s\n**[[Unique]] monsters\n*If there are several monsters, retreat to a chokepoint.\n*If you get swamped by summoned monsters, go up the stairs. Failing that, try to kill the summoner first, since that will get rid of all their summons.\n*If it has a ranged attack, either run up to it to force it into melee or run for cover behind a corner, whichever is faster. \n*If your character's life is at risk, read [[Escaping from (and avoiding) trouble]].\n*Once all monsters are dead, check any equipment they dropped. ctrl+F will show all items of a type; inputting '.' will show all items on the floor.\n\n=== If There is no Monster in View===\n*If you are hurt (and not a [[Meteoran]]), rest by holding Shift and pressing '5' on the NumPad until your HP or MP is full. Consumables should generally be saved for emergencies.\n*If you are not on a special level, press 'o' to auto-explore.\n*If you are on a special level, carefully explore manually in circles from the upstairs until fully cleared and explored. Consider using a [[scroll of magic mapping]] if you know there's a dangerous vault somewhere (like in the bottom floor of a branch).\n*If you are done exploring the current level, follow the [[walkthrough]] for the next steps (which will often be to just continue down, but be careful not to enter branch ends earlier than you should).\n\n{{Guides}}\n\n[[Category:Strategy Guides]]\n[[Category:Tips]]"}

Any existing brand will be replaced with a different one, and any brand forbidden by your current god will not be chosen. Artefacts cannot be branded in this way.}}\n\nUpon reading a '''scroll of brand weapon''', you will be asked to choose a non-[[artefact]] weapon from your inventory to receive a permanent, randomly-selected [[brand]]. This will also replace any brand currently on the targeted weapon, if any.\n\nIf you have already [[identified]] the scroll, you may cancel the process by pressing '''Esc''' without consuming it.\n\nMelee and ranged weapons have different sets of possible brands:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|item-use.cc|3097}}</ref>\n\n==Brand Likelihood==\n'''Melee Weapons'''\n*Common: 13.3%\n**[[Flaming]]\n**[[Freezing]]\n**[[Heavy]]\n**[[Venom]]\n**[[Protection]]\n*Rare: 6.6%\n**[[Draining]]\n**[[Electrocution]]\n**[[Spectral (brand)|Spectral]]\n**[[Vampiric]]\n**[[Chaos]]\n\n'''Ranged Weapons'''\n*Common: 21.4%\n**[[Flaming]]\n**[[Freezing]]\n**[[Heavy]]\n**[[Draining]]\n*Rare: 7.1%\n**[[Electrocution]]\n**[[Chaos]]\n\nThe selected brand will be automatically rerolled in two cases:\n*the new brand is identical to the weapon's former brand;\n*your [[god]] disapproves of the selected brand.\n\nNote that the scroll cannot give the [[antimagic]], [[holy wrath]], [[Pain (brand)|pain]], or [[Speed (brand)|speed]] brands to weapons. Additionally, ranged weapons can't get the [[penetration]] brand from this scroll.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the heavy brand did not exist; it replaced the [[vorpal]] brand. Also, ranged weapons could get [[venom]] instead of [[draining (brand)|draining]].\n*In [[0.28]], brand likelihood was changed to be more uniform.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the spectral brand did not exist.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], rebranding a [[distortion]] weapon would trigger a distortion unwield effect. Also, the scroll would automatically affect your wielded weapon, rather than letting you choose a target.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], you could control which brand you received to some extent: any temporary brand your wielded weapon held upon reading would be made permanent. Additionally, any time you gave your weapon one of the following brands, you would receive the following effect:\n**[[Flame]]/[[Flaming]]: [[Inner Flame]] explosion centered on the reader\n**[[Frost]]/[[Freezing]]: [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]]\n**[[Draining]]/[[Vampiricism]]: Moderate [[draining]] to the reader\n**[[Venom]]: [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]]\n**[[Electrocution]]: [[Orb of Electrocution]] centered on the reader\n**[[Chaos]]: [[Chaos]]-branded explosion\n*:The following temporary brands could not be affixed this way, and attempting to do so was punished as follows: \n**[[Pain (brand)|Pain]]: [[Torment]]\n**[[Distortion]]: A random [[Translocations]] [[miscast effect]] (possibly including [[banishment]])\n**[[Antimagic]]: Drains all your [[MP]]\n*The scroll of brand weapon was added in [[0.13]], replacing the [[scroll of vorpalise weapon]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

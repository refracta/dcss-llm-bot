{"title":"Species","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Species","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\nIn ''Dungeon Crawl'', '''species''' selection determines a character's stats, recommended backgrounds, skill aptitudes, special abilities and equipment options. The game offers [[27]] different playable species; most are essentially humanoid, although some are human-animal hybrids and a few are even stranger.\n\n==Species List==\n*'''[[Armataur]] (At):''' A scaly, four-legged mammalian hybrid which [[rampage]]s into combat, increasing their regeneration as they do so.\n*'''[[Barachi]] (Ba):''' An amphibious, frog-like humanoid with an exceptionally vicious disposition. They can hop long distances, though their movement is otherwise somewhat slow.\n*'''[[Coglin]] (Co):''' A species of goblins that have developed mechanical exoskeletons. They are capable of dual-wielding, but unable to wear [[jewellery]].\n*'''[[Deep Elf]] (DE):''' A cave-dwelling species of elf; smaller and weaker than others, but with incredible magical aptitude. A very good choice for [[spellcaster]]s.\n*'''[[Demigod]] (Dg):''' A humanoid with divine heritage that prevents them from worshiping any god. They have excellent [[stat|attribute]] growth, but learn skills and gain levels slowly.\n*'''[[Demonspawn]] (Ds):''' A humanoid with demonic heritage, able to worship any god but the [[good gods]]. They acquire [[Demonspawn mutations|powerful mutations]] as they mature.\n*'''[[Djinni]] (Dj):''' A spirit of smokeless fire that powers their magic with their own life force. They spontaneously gain spells as they grow instead of learning them from [[book]]s.\n*'''[[Draconian]] (Dr):''' A humanoid dragon that eventually matures into a random adult form, with different aptitudes based on its colour.\n*'''[[Felid]] (Fe):''' A sentient cat that is incapable of using almost all forms of equipment and many items, but is stealthy and can gain multiple lives.\n*'''[[Formicid]] (Fo):''' A humanoid ant with four powerful arms. They can dig through walls and have a permanent [[stasis]] effect.\n*'''[[Gargoyle]] (Gr):''' A winged humanoid with stony skin and a large array of intrinsic benefits, all of which are somewhat offset by their inherent frailty. \n*'''[[Ghoul]] (Gh):''' A terrible undead corpse that draws vitality from slain foes. Has manageable (if below-average) aptitudes for magic and is fairly skilled with its claws.\n*'''[[Gnoll]] (Gn):''' A vaguely dog-like humanoid that has incredible aptitudes for all skills, but must train all skills simultaneously.\n*'''[[Human]] (Hu):''' The basic species against which all others are measured. They have average [[aptitude]]s across the board and regenerate more quickly when they explore.\n*'''[[Kobold]] (Ko):''' A small, unpleasant species of humanoid with a [[Nightstalker|natural affinity for the shadows]]. They level quickly and are quite good as sneaky assassins or as well-rounded mages.\n*'''[[Mountain Dwarf]] (MD):''' A species of dwarves that are able to cast spells easily in heavy armour, and that are able to enchant [[artefact]]s.\n*'''[[Merfolk]] (Mf):''' An aquatic, magical race of half-humanoids, half-fish that thrive in the water. Great aptitudes for [[Polearms]], [[Transmutations]], and [[Ice Magic]].\n*'''[[Minotaur]] (Mi):''' A brawny, bipedal bovine species. Great at all forms of physical combat (both ranged and up close), but horrible with all forms of magic.\n*'''[[Mummy]] (Mu):''' A dry and bandaged corpse animated by unholy magic and uniquely attuned to [[Necromancy]]. However, they have slow skill growth, are unable to drink [[potion]]s, and fear [[fire]] above all else.\n*'''[[Naga]] (Na):''' A hybrid creature with a humanoid torso and a serpentine lower half. Exceptionally stealthy and skilled with [[Poison Magic]], but moves slowly.\n*'''[[Octopode]] (Op):''' An amphibious octopus-like creature with eight tentacles. Cannot wear most types of armour (only hats), but can wear eight [[ring]]s at once and is at home in water.\n*'''[[Oni]] (On):''' Enormous and rowdy humanoids who get free swings and double healing from potions. They are competent at melee, magic, and throwing.\n*'''[[Spriggan]] (Sp):''' A tiny, fey humanoid. They move extremely swiftly and have high aptitudes for the subtler schools of magic, but cannot wear most forms of armour.\n*'''[[Tengu]] (Te):''' A somewhat fragile bird-like species with a beak, talons, and a propensity for violence, both physical and magical. They eventually learn to fly evasively.\n*'''[[Troll]] (Tr):''' Even larger and stronger than the oni, with huge claws, regenerative powers, and abysmal aptitude for most skills that aren't clawing their foes to death or throwing things.\n*'''[[Vampire]] (Vp):''' A sneaky form of undead which can use blood to switch between their frail-but-resistant natural state and a swift-healing living form. Exceptional at [[Hexes|disabling foes]], then [[stab]]bing them in the back.\n*'''[[Vine Stalker]] (VS):''' A fragile creature made of parasitic vines grown from a humanoid core. They have a powerful, magic-draining bite and regenerate incredibly swiftly.\n\n==Table of Aptitudes==\nYour species choice determines [[aptitudes]], the speed at which you learn different [[skills]].\n\nThe following tables list aptitudes for each species and skill combination.\n\n===General Skills===\n\n{{#invoke:Apt|aptitude_chart_general}}\n\n===Melee & Ranged Combat===\n\n{{#invoke:Apt|aptitude_chart_combat}}\n\n===Spellcasting and Magic===\n\n{{#invoke:Apt|aptitude_chart_magic}}\n\n==History==\nThe following species were added/removed in the given versions.

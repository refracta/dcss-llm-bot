{"title":"Demigod","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Demigod","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{for monster}}\n{{flavour|Demigods are mortals with some divine or angelic ancestry, however distant. Demigods look more or less like members of their mortal part's species, but they are extremely robust and can draw on great supplies of magical energy. \n\nThey are able to sculpt their attributes to a far greater extent than any other species, gaining substantial boosts to their choice of Strength, Intelligence or Dexterity as they gain experience. On the downside, they advance more slowly in experience than any other species, gain skills slightly less quickly than Humans and, due to their status, refuse to worship any god.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*'''[[Forlorn]]''': Demigods cannot worship any [[god]]s.\n*'''[[High MP]] 1''': Demigods have +10% MP than average.\n*'''Divine Attributes:''' Instead of the usual +2 stat points per 6 levels, Demigods gain +4 stat points every 3 levels.\n\nDemigods have a base [[Strength]] of 9, [[Intelligence]] of 10, and [[Dexterity]] of 9 (before Background modifiers). They have two extra base [[magic points]].\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Adventurers:''' [[Shapeshifter]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Conjurer]], [[Fire Elementalist]], [[Ice Elementalist]], [[Air Elementalist]], [[Earth Elementalist]]\n\nDue to their religious restriction, Demigods are prohibited from becoming [[Monk]]s or zealots ([[Berserker]]s, [[Chaos Knight]]s, or [[Cinder Acolyte]]s).\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*Four stat points of your choice, of the same attribute, every third level.\n*10% more [[HP]] than average.\n*+4 [[willpower]] per level.\n\n==Starting Equipment and Skills==\nDemigods receive the equipment and skills listed for their chosen background.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Hard}}\n\nDemigods can be difficult to play, due to the lack of deity. They are ''simple'' - not having to choose a god does make the game less complex. However, gods are a reliable clutch in an otherwise random game. Specifically, Demigods cannot have divine abilities, which are otherwise great tools for escaping trouble. On the plus side, Demigods have high HP/MP pools and amazing attribute growth. A late game, 50 intelligence caster or 40 [[EV]] melee fighter is no slouch in combat.\n\nTheir slow leveling is often overstated as a con. A -2 XP aptitude is indeed the slowest of any race, but as level costs are exponential, Demigods are rarely more than 1-2 levels behind. It does make [[spell level]]s harder to obtain, but with great potential INT and high MP, they don't struggle as casters.\n \n{{species_aptitudes|Demigod}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n* The Dungeon Overview screen (Ctrl+O) doesn't display known altars for Demigods, as it is of no use to them.\n\n==History==\n*Demigods were unaffected by the global attribute gain/level change in [[0.28]] (every other species receives +2 stat every 6 levels).\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Demigod base attributes were 11/12/11, and received +2 of their stat of choice on level up.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Demigods had innate [[sustain abilities]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Demigods didn't have an innate High MP mutation, although they got a similar percentage bonus from their MP aptitude.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Demigods gained one random stat every second level instead of gaining two stats of their choice every third level. They also lacked innate sustain abilities.\n \n{{species}}"}

If you have the [[MP-Powered Wands]] mutation, then your \"pow\" gains a +33% boost.</ref> Players have a [[to-hit]] of <code>10.6 + (3.5 * Evocations)/25</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|zap-data.h|1392}}</ref>\n\nMonsters will deal <code>3d(7 + (30 + [[HD]])/12)</code> damage with this wand.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|zap-data.h|1393}}</ref>\n\nIt is [[alternate items|mutually exclusive]] with the [[wand of light]] and [[wand of quicksilver]].\n\n==Strategy==\nWands of acid apply the [[Corrosion]] status, which lowers monster [[AC]] significantly. This can provide a surprising boost to damage, especially against tough enemies like [[orbs of fire]], especially when using fast weapons like [[Short Blades]].\n\nThese wands are also good as a backup attack. A Corrosive Bolt is effectively a level 6 spell, and with a few points into Evocations, as strong as one. Plus, only a few monsters resist acid.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Corrosion on monsters doesn't stack.\n*Beware of [[Ijyb]], the goblin with a wand (of acid). Bolt wands are easily the most dangerous wand for a D:3 or so character to face. Thankfully, wands of acid can only be fired at range 5.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], monsters dealt more damage with this wand. Also, the [[wand of light]] and [[wand of quicksilver]] weren't introduced yet, so acid was in 100% of games.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], bolts would have their range reduced by 1 for each target you hit.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], wands of acid could hold at most 15 charges.\n*Wands of acid were added in [[0.18]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{wands}}"}

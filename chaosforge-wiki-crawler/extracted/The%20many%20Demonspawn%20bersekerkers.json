{"title":"The many Demonspawn bersekerkers","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/The_many_Demonspawn_bersekerkers","type":"raw","data":"{{diary}}\nThis is a diary about all my attempts as a demonspawn berserker. I will keep all fo you informed as I go along.\n\n=Atempt number one=\nEntering the dungeon...three stairs which go back to my home are side by side, forming a line of three stairs : <<<... and one stair going into the depths just below. On the top, a pillar . 4 fountains surround the area. On the other side, there is a zoo of wonters, but luckily, they are in a room with a transparent wall and a door. Since nothing on the other side has hands, I decide not to open the door, and instead go to the door on the right side of the room.\nTwo Kobolds are waiting for me there! after getting 6 points of life in one hit, I go berserk. I kill the two K's extremely easily after that. Whil recuparating fro my exhaustion, I sacrify their corpses, and pack the ring I found on them. I will try to put it when I know it's safe.\n\nToo bad, I found a scroll, read it, teleportation, back to the zoo, while very hungry... I take out my bread and it eat while they are hitting me... I killed nearly all of them with my rage when a goblin comes behind and manages to kill me...\n\n=The ultimate fleeer=\nStarting with lava at the top of the map. Finds an amulet there ,which is later identified as controlled flight. I also read an unidentified scroll which was found to be teleportation, and drink a potion of rage... Why doesn't my rage last so long? and another potion turns out to be healing... ending level 1 I have 1 potion of rage, an amulet of controlled flight, and 2 scrolls of teleportations in bonus, going well so far. I also gained an xp level by killing wimpy monsters...\n\nAt level 2, I encounter Terence... I go back up the stairs, eat something because I was hungry, then activate my rage and kill him. He had 2 scrolls of teleportation, which add to the one I found... He was a coward...but he makes me go up to lvl 3, at which point i choose to become stronger. Behind him i find a  potion of healing, and 2 scrolls of teleportation which gives me 5 of them.But this part seems to be a dea end, so I go back up the stairs and take another one. And on this branch of the level I find a scroll of curse armor (sticky animal skin) ANOTHER teleportation (I'm going to be such a coward... and another dead end... back up again, last stairs... On these branch of the level, a hobgoblin and a snake... preparing for the poison damage, I go berserk, but heal the poison extremely soon. I had a hiccup of surprise because of a goblin with a boomerang dagger...which I of course quiver... and my 7th scroll of teleportation! after chopping the goblin corpse I eat it, and beome ill, I eat the second peace and heal from the sickness, then I go on. I find a glowing hand axe, which I wield, and it's not cursed... I keep it.\n\nLevel 3 now... I think that that darn dagger of return won't come back.... must be my dexterity... Anyway, another scroll of teleportation... I'm renaming myself the Ultimate fleeer now.... \nAnd dead... an orc with a sword of draining..."}

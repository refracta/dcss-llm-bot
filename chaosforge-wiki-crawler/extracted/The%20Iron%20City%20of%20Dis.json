The standard hellspawn of demons and [[tormentor]]s are common. Various (possibly) stair-containing vaults have [[iron troll]]s, [[iron dragon]]s, and [[quicksilver elemental]]s. On the last level, these are are joined by [[war gargoyle]]s, [[hell sentinel]]s, and in most ends mirrored paired guests of [[brimstone fiend]]s and [[ice fiend]]s. The imposing [[iron giant]] and [[iron golem]] also are essentially unique to the branch. [[Crystal echidna]]s will inflict [[barbs]] on you, making it difficult to run away.  The [[Serpent of Hell (Dis)|the Serpent of Hell]] is guaranteed to appear on the last level of one of the four Hells per game.\n\nDis contains several layouts, all of which are built out of [[Wall#Metal|metal walls]]. It shares the grid-based ''layout_city'', the messy ''layout_chaotic_city'', and the tangled gates of ''layout_gridville'' with other branches, but has three unique layouts:\n*'''layout_subdivisions''', which sets down a sprawling box-packed grid maze of connected open rectangular rooms\n*'''layout_overlapping_boxes''', similar to the sub_divisions but with the occasional corner-accommodating box\n*'''layout_jigsaw''', which mixes together misshapen rooms on a regular spaced-out 4x4 grid on the pointed between a connected 5x5x grid\n\nExcept for the last floor, there is no loot to be found. These floors are much smaller than regular floors, having only one exit and one way down.\n\nThe last level contains the iron [[rune of Zot]], guarded by {{monsterlink|Dispater}}. Layouts include a large and straight gate standing before a castle, a densely packed city, an iron fortress with arched gates and a broad column-filled interim field, and a trio of very large arched barriers pockmarked by small asymmetrical boxes.\n\n===Hell Effects===\nIn addition to the universal [[Hell#Hell's Mystical Force|forces of hell]], Dis' abrasive atmosphere gives adventurers permanent [[Corrosion]] (-8 [[AC]] and [[slaying]]) while in it, which is not affected by [[corrosion resistance]].\n\n==Assessment==\nThe Iron City of Dis has ascended over years of development from one of the easiest branches of Hell to one of the hardest. The guaranteed Hell Sentinels may lack the capability to cast Torment like [[Demon#Tier-1_Demons|the first-tier demons]] of the other hell branches, but make up for it between their capability to hurl [[damnation]] and their longevity granted by high defenses and heavy resists. Iron golems have brutal melee attacks and are resistant to almost everything. While few other residents are particularly dangerous for their depth aside from regular tormentors and fiends for their [[torment]] capabilities, end vaults can vary heavily in openness while packing high monster density and roundabout, winding passages. \n\nDis' hell effect is generally weaker than other branches; characters can afford a relatively minor (by the time you get to Dis) AC hit, and the [[holy wrath]] brand is still amazingly powerful.\n\nAs with the other Hells, it is recommended to leave Dis to the end of extended endgame runs- for most characters, the only other levels of equal or further difficulty are the [[Tomb]] and [[Ziggurat]]s.\n\n==Trivia==\nIn Dante Alighieri's ''Divine Comedy'', [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dis_(Divine_Comedy) Dis] is the City of the Dead, and is located in the Fifth Circle of Hell. Punished within Dis are those whose lives were marked by active (rather than passive) sins, such as heretics, murderers, suicides, thieves, and traitors. In Roman mythology, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispater Dispater] was a god of the underworld, later subsumed by Pluto or Hades. Originally a chthonic god of riches, fertile agricultural land, and underground mineral wealth, he was later commonly equated with the Roman deities Pluto and Orcus, becoming an underworld deity.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], The Iron City of Dis did not corrode all adventurers who set foot in it. In addition, floors 1-6 were longer, more chaff monsters like [[iron imp]]s appeared, and unique but slower hell effects occurred.\n*The Iron City of Dis has had several notable changes to its themed monsters guaranteed in the vault ends. [[0.11]] replaced [[pit fiend]]s with [[hell sentinel]]s, [[0.12]] upgraded [[metal gargoyle]]s to [[war gargoyle]]s, and [[0.16]] shifted [[iron devil]]s to [[rust devil]]s. [[Iron giant]]s joined the branch population in [[0.18]].\n*End vaults were upgraded in [[0.11]], introducing pit fiends / hell sentinels and quicksilver dragons, setting a divider wall between the entrance stairs and the castle in older layouts, and bringing in the famously monster-heavy box-based layout of ''dis_st'' that served as a design influence for future Dis end vaults.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Dis (and the other Hell branches) blocked [[teleport control]].\n\n{{branches}}\n\n[[Category:Hells]]"}

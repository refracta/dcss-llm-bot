If at least one cursed item is revealed, the scroll is identified.\n\n==Strategy==\nUsing one scroll of detect curse with an inventory filled with unidentified gear will let you determine how safe it is to test-wield dozens of items at once. Just remember that some items may prove dangerous even when not cursed ([[distortion]], [[vampiricism]], [[Plutonium Sword|+GLOW]]).\n\n==History==\nRemoved in [[0.11]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete items]]"}

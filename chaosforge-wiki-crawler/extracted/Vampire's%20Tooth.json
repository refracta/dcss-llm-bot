It is lethally vampiric, and restores a greater portion of life to its user than other vampiric weapons.}}\n\n[[File:Vampire's_tooth.png]] '''''the +8 Vampire's Tooth'''''\n\n+8 [[quick blade]]\n\n[[Vampiric]] brand<br>\nUpgraded vampirism - when triggered, vampiric always heals for full damage dealt instead of the usual <code>1d(Damage)</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|attack.cc|1423}}</ref>\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Vampire's Tooth'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|278}}</ref> is a highly enchanted quick blade that provides ''massive'' healing when fighting [[natural]] or [[plant]] targets. It is a strong weapon - but like all [[Short Blades]], it's less effective against high [[AC]] enemies. [[Might]] or high amounts of [[slaying]] can help punch through the toughest of armour.\n\n[[Stabbing]] specialists in particular can make excellent use of this weapon, as not only will it deal grievous damage to stab-able enemies, but it will also heal you for the full stab damage whenever the vampirism triggers. This can work particularly well if you have a means of setting up a stab mid-fight ([[throwing net]]s, a [[wand of paralysis]], [[Hexes]], [[Invisibility]], etc.), allowing you to quickly heal up from any beatings you've taken thus far.\n\nThe Vampire's Tooth can sometimes be found in a [[vault]] guarded by depth-dependent vampiric monsters (ranging from [[vampire bat]]s to [[tyrant leech]]es to [[vampire (monster)|vampires]] and [[vampire knight]]s). This vault can appear early in the [[Dungeon]], potentially giving players access to a quick blade well before they would normally begin to appear.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the enchantment of the Vampire's Tooth was +12.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], the Vampire's Tooth was a +4 dagger.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Short blades]]"}

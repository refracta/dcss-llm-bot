{"title":"Jumping spider","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Jumping_spider","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Jumping spiders''' are small, non-poisonous spiders that attack in a unique way; they can quickly \"jump\" ([[blink]]) into melee range with you, and their bite attacks have a 50% chance to ensnare you as though you'd just walked into a [[web]] [[trap]]. This can leave you defenseless for several turns while the jumping spider and anything else around tears you to pieces. They can be found in the [[Spider's Nest]] and near its entrance in [[Lair]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*You can escape webs by [[blink]]ing or [[teleport]]ing away.\n*When facing groups of various kinds of spiders in the Spider's Nest, prioritizing targets can be tricky. Jumping spiders can cover a lot of distance in a very short time and can disable you with very lethal consequences, so try to target them first if possible. Even severe poisoning can be remedied with a single [[potion of curing]] after all.\n*[[Spellcasting]] is not inhibited by being entangled, so consider nuking everything around you before spending several turns struggling to escape.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|jumping spiders will have [[Blink Range]] instead of [[Blink Away]].}}\n*Prior to [[0.19]], they were [[Size|medium-sized]] monsters.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], jumping spiders had a light [[poison]]ous attack.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], jumping spiders did not have an ensnaring melee attack.\n\n[[Category:Arachnid]]"}

{"title":"Gnoll sergeant","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Gnoll_sergeant","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | gnolls}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Gnoll sergeants''' are tougher versions of regular [[gnoll (monster)|gnoll]]s, with more HP, more AC, and higher damage. They always spawn with a [[polearm]] and medium armour, and occasionally come with a [[shield]]. They appear in the early to mid-[[Dungeon]], usually accompanied by regular gnolls.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The gnoll equivalent to [[orc warrior]]s, gnoll sergeants are simple melee threats. How strong they are can vary based on their equipment. A sergeant with a [[kite shield]] and a trident of [[venom]] is much stronger than a sergeant with just a [[spear]].\n**Also, watch out for the equipment that other gnolls bring. A gnoll with a [[throwing net]] can make it very difficult to escape. \n*As they usually appear in a group, any spells or wands which target multiple tiles are useful.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], all monsters had hidden weapon penalties, so they attacked slower and weaker with any weapon. Gnoll sergeants were not nerfed between versions."}

It uses [[arrow]]s as ammunition. Note that while the base damage is 3, the base damage of an arrow is added to give an overall base damage of 10.}}\n\n'''Bows''' are two-handed ranged weapons, capable of doing only modest damage but able to be fired rapidly even at low skill levels. A skilled bowman with a large enough stack of [[arrow]]s can devastate opponents at range, but you'll likely want to upgrade this to a [[longbow]] as early as possible for a significant boost to damage with little loss of accuracy. Because wearing a [[shield]] will slow your rate of fire while using a bow, hybrid fighters should consider using powerful two-handed melee weapons. You can find enchanted bows and ammunition on [[centaur (monster)|centaurs]] throughout the game.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Bow 1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Bow 2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Bow 3.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.15]], an ordinary bow become known as a [[shortbow]].\n\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Bows]]"}

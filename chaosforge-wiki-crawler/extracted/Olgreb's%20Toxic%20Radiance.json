{"title":"Olgreb's Toxic Radiance","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Olgreb%27s_Toxic_Radiance","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n[[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] ('''OTR''') is a level 4 [[Alchemy]] spell which both damages and [[poison]]s any creatures without poison resistance in the caster's [[line of sight]] for a few turns. \n\n[[Alchemist]]s start with this spell, though it can also be [[evoke]]d using the artefact [[staff of Olgreb]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe damage can be split into two parts:\n\n* '''Impact damage.''' Olgreb's deals <code>1d(1 + pow/20)</code> damage per 1.0 [[decaAut]].<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-damage.cc|3359}}</ref> Ignores AC. Poison vulnerable monsters take 150% damage from this.\n* '''Poison status.''' Affected monsters have a 50% chance (on cast, and per 1.0 decaAut afterwards) to gain one poison \"stack\".<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-damage.cc|3398}}</ref> Monsters that haven't been poisoned yet instead have a 100% chance. Keep in mind that monsters have a limit of 4 stacks. See the [[Poison#Poisoned Condition|Poison]] article for more detail on how poison stacks work.\n\nCreatures with [[poison resistance]] are completely immune to Olgreb's Toxic Radiance.\n\nThis spell has a duration of <code>1 + 1d(1 + pow/25)</code> turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-damage.cc|3291}}</ref> Casting this spell again will increase the duration; it does not increase the rate of poison or poison damage.\n\n==Strategy==\nOlgreb's Toxic Radiance is a great spell for crowd-control. It isn't fast, but it ''is'' good at thinning out a crowd; weakening the strong monsters and killing the chaff. Very effective in the [[Spider's Nest]], as most [[list of insects|insects]] and [[list of arachnids|spiders]] are vulnerable to poison. Also great against evasive enemies in general, such as [[killer bee]]s and [[boggart]]s.\n\nWorks very well with [[Ignite Poison]]. Ignite Poison deals 200% - 300% of expected poison damage, immediately. This makes OTR becomes even better at dealing with crowds, able to wipe entire screens of monsters in just a few turns.\n\nThis spell can be useful even into [[Vaults]] and [[Depths]], as it's decent against monsters like [[vault guard]]s and [[deep troll]]s. Even in [[Zot]], it can clear out [[list of draconians|draconian]]s and [[orb guardian]]s (at least with Ignite Poison). While it's less useful in the lategame, since more and more monsters resist poison, that's to be expected of a level 4 spell.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Olgreb's Toxic Radiance deals some direct damage, so it breaks monsters out of [[fear]], and dispels friendly [[summon]]s that don't resist poison.\n*Monsters can have up to 4 poison stacks; monsters that are \"extremely poisoned\" cannot be poisoned further. In tiles, this is represented with 3 poison drops.\n\n==Monster Version==\nPlayers are affected by Olgreb's Toxic Radiance differently. Instead of poison stacks, players take <code>1d(1 + [[HD]] * 0.6)</code> impact damage and then <code>2d(3 + HD/2)</code> HP worth of poison per turn instead.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-damage.cc|3372}}</ref> Otherwise, the monster version acts like the player version.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.24]], monsters did less damage with this spell, <code>2d3</code> HP worth of poison per turn.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], this spell did not deal direct damage on cast, and didn't properly trigger ally-harming conducts. Also, it inflicted poison based on actions and not time_taken, so swapping weapons or swinging a [[quick blade]] would cause more poison than waiting or moving.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the damage of this spell varied by distance and the spell also poisoned the player character.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], this spell poisoned all ''visible'' creatures for a single turn, didn't cause any direct damage, and could be cast when drawing the [[Venom card]] from a [[Deck of destruction]].\n*In [[0.10]], the effectiveness of Olgreb's Toxic Radiance was modified to scale with spell power and to still affect poison-resistant players 10% of the time.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

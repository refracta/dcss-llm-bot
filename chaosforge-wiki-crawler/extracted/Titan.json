{"title":"Titan","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Titan","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n{{list of | giants}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Titans''' are the deadliest of the common [[list of giants|giants]], capable of landing devastating blows in melee and blasting you at range with powerful [[Air Magic]]. They occasionally spawn in [[the Depths]] and [[Cocytus]], and are almost always found on the bottom floor of [[the Vaults]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*First and foremost, don't engage them while standing in open space without creatures (hostile or friendly) or walls; their Airstrike spell deals extra damage to characters surrounded by empty tiles. To deal with Lightning Bolt, have [[electricity]] resistance and avoid standing in a place that makes [[multizap]]s possible.\n*Strong melee characters can generally take them out one-on-one, though you may want to [[haste]] or [[might]] yourself if that's available. [[Berserk]] works great if you know the titan is alone, but often they will appear in areas where monsters will quite often appear at the edge of your [[line of sight]] at inopportune times.\n*Conjurers should use their most powerful non-electric [[Conjurations]], as a titan's low [[EV]] makes them easy targets. As they have only one attack, titans are also relatively easy to overwhelm with reasonably powerful summons.\n*Don't bother with [[Mephitic Cloud]] -- their high [[HD]] means that there is only a 1/11 chance they will be affected per turn, generally letting them walk out unconfused. Other types of [[poison]] are quite effective, though.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], [[Airstrike]] did 8-37 damage (not in dice notation).\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Airstrike did bonus damage against [[fly]]ing targets.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Airstrike did not have a bonus for empty spaces."}

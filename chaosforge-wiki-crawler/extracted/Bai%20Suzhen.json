While she's no [[Tiamat]], she does have more [[HP]] and [[AC]] than most [[list of draconians|draconians]], and can summons [[hydra]]s to her side. She always spawns with a [[quarterstaff]].\n\nWhen she reaches half health, she transforms into her true form - [[#Dragon Form|see below]] for details.\n\n===Location===\n*[[The Depths]]: 1-3\n*[[Elven Halls]]: 3\n*[[The Swamp]]: 3-4\n*[[The Snake Pit]]: 3-4\n*[[The Shoals]]: 3-4\n*[[The Spider's Nest]]: 3-4\n*[[Vaults]]: 2-5\n*[[Crypt]]: 1-3\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While Bai Suzhen is still in her base draconian form, do your best to fight her in a corridor or other chokepoint. You don't need two or three hydras chewing on you while you're trying to fight her.\n*Make sure you have a source of electricity resistance handy; a [[potion of resistance]] will work if you have no other options. She can't deal any electrical damage as a draconian, but once she gets hurt...\n\n==Dragon Form==\n<!-- We're using this instead of the monster info template since otherwise it duplicates the flavor text.

In this form, she has a permanent ring of [[Clouds#Thunder|storm clouds]] around adjacent tiles (dealing electric damage each turn), increased AC, [[trample]] attacks, and a powerful [[Primal Wave]] breath attack. Even after recovering HP, she'll permanently stay in this form.\n\n{{monster spells|Bai Suzhen (dragon)}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Once Bai Suzhen transforms, she gains the ability to [[trample|knock you back]], potentially out of your chokepoint. Fortunately, any summoned hydras that are still around are going to be reluctant to enter her ring of storm clouds, but they could cause issues if they can find a way around to you before timing out.\n*Kiting Bai Suzhen in her dragon form is made more difficult by her Primal Wave, which not only deals decent damage (especially if you aren't [[amphibious]] or [[unbreathing]]) but also creates pools of [[shallow water]] beneath you. If you can't move easily through water, start flying so you aren't slowed down. Keep in mind that any summoned hydras that are still around move faster in water.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.31|Bai Suzhen will get more HPs and will use Primal Wave a little more often. Also, she'll transform into a dragon when at less than 75% health instead of less than 50%.}}\n*In [[0.26]], her [[Ring of Thunder]] spell was replaced with a permanent enchantment.\n*Bai Suzhen was introduced in [[0.19]]."}

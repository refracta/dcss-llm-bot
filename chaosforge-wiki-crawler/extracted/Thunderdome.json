{"title":"Thunderdome","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Thunderdome","type":"raw","data":"{{stub}}\n\n'''Thunderdome''' is the sixth module for [[Dungeon Sprint]]. It's a first-person shooter themed map with a fairly small cross-shaped arena, offering a number of walls in the center to serve as choke points. The edges of the arena are lined with both helpful [[shop]]s and spawn points, out of which will come the various monsters for the level, mostly composed of [[unique]]s. The final boss you face is [[Master Blaster]], easily the most powerful monster you can encounter in any version of ''Crawl''.\n\n==Quad Damage==\n[[file:Quad damage.png]]\n\n{{flavour|A mysterious item resembling a rune of some kind. Once evoked, it will make the user glow blue and add a reverb to all sound... and there may be other effects as well.}}\n\nThe consumable '''quad damage''' power-up can be purchased in one of the shops located around the edge of the map. They are expensive and limited in supply, but timely use of them is absolutely critical to defeating the final boss (not to mention surviving up to that point).\n\n==Layout==\n<pre>\n<nowiki>\nMAP\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXcccccXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXccTTTccXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXc.....cXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXcc.....ccXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXccP.....DccXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXcE.......NcXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXcB.......BcXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXcB.......BcXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXcc.........cXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXccc.........cccXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXcY...........ZcXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXcccccc.G.........G.ccccccXXXXX\nXXXXccMBB.......xxx.......BBFccXXXX\nXXcccI........G.xxx.G........ScccXX\nXcc.............xxx.............ccX\nXcW..........xxx...xxx..........UcX\nXcW..........xxx.{.xxx..........UcX\nXcW..........xxx...xxx..........UcX\nXcc.............xxx.............ccX\nXXcccK........G.xxx.G........HcccXX\nXXXXccCBB.......xxx.......BBOccXXXX\nXXXXXcccccc.G.........G.ccccccXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXc!...........?cXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXccc.........cccXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXc.........cXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXcB.......BcXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXcB.......BcXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXcR.......QcXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXccJ.....LccXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXcc.....ccXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXccVVVccXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXcccccXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nENDMAP\n</nowiki>\n</pre>\n==Trivia==\nThe name Thunderdome and the boss monster Master Blaster are both references to the 1985 post-apocalyptic action film [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max_Beyond_Thunderdome Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome].\n\nThe quad damage power-up is on loan from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game) Quake video game series]."}

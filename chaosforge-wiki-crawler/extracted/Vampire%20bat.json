{"title":"Vampire bat","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Vampire_bat","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n''For a list of all vampires, see [[list of vampires]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Vampire bats''' resemble standard [[bat]]s, but are actually weak [[vampire (monster)|vampires]] in disguise; their bites restore their [[HP]], and they are slightly more durable than bats. They often come with a pack of bat allies as well, but these are no more dangerous than they were when you were a level 1 character. You can find vampire bats in the middle-[[Dungeon]] or in certain vaults of [[the Lair]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*In spite of the name and flavour text, they cannot transform into actual vampires.\n*They have the usual assortment of undead strengths and weaknesses, but they're generally so weak that this doesn't matter."}

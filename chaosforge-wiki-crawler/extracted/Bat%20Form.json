The effectiveness of your melee attacks while in this form is based on experience level instead of on Unarmed Combat skill.}}\n\n[[File:Bat form.png]] '''Bat Form''' is a [[Vampire]] [[ability]] and a [[bad form]] which turns the player into a small and agile [[bat]]-like creature. \n\n==Pros==\n*Greatly increased movement speed (0.6 movement delay, i.e. [[spriggan]] speed)\n*Tiny [[size]] (good evasion and stealth)\n*+5 [[Dexterity]]\n*[[Fly]]ing\n*[[Vampire]]s retain a 1-in-8 chance of a [[vampiric]] melee attack\n\n==Cons==\n*Spellcasting is disabled\n*All equipment other than [[amulet]]s is melded\n*[[Unarmed Combat]] base damage is <code>1 + UC</code>\n*0 [[AC]]\n\n==Sources==\nYou can acquire this ability in the following ways:\n*[[Vampire]]s gain access to Bat Form at level 3 when Bloodless through their unique Bat Form ability. \n*[[Jiyva]] may induce Bat Form (along with a vicious dose of [[magic contamination]]) at random as divine punishment.\n*Being affected by a beam of [[polymorph]].\n*Weapons of [[chaos]] may polymorph the attacker or the defender.\n*[[Cloud]]s of chaos.\n*Moon pies from a [[Killer Klown]].\n\n==Strategy==\nThe most obvious use for Bat Form is for getting away from dangerous situations. Flying allows you to cross [[deep water]] or [[lava]], and the speed and evasion boosts make it easy to get away from melee opponents. Enemies with ranged attacks will still be a threat, particularly if they have unavoidable or [[smite]] attacks.\n\nAlternatively, it can be used to [[kite]] opponents if you happen to have the right abilities. Invokable and Evokable abilities still function while in Bat Form, allowing you to use [[wand]]s and god-given abilities ([[Makhleb]]'s abilities are particularly useful as they don't cost piety). The [[Good_mutations#Fangs|Fangs]] mutation also adds to your Unarmed Combat damage, but bats usually don't want to be in melee.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

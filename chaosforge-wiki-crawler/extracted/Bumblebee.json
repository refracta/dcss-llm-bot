They deal twice as much damage and more [[poison]] with their stings, have double the [[HP]], and are worth triple the [[XP]]. Fortunately, they're much slower, have less [[EV]], and are still just as susceptible to [[poison]]. They can occasionally be found in [[the Lair]], but thankfully not in the huge swarms killer bees tend to appear in.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Poison and confusion are very effective against them.\n\n==History==\nBumblebees were removed in [[0.12]].\n\nPrior to [[0.11]], their description consisted merely of one very memorable phrase:\n\n{{Flavour|A very large and fat hairy bee.}}\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

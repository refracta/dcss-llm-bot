{"title":"Reaping","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Reaping","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Any foe damaged by it may be reanimated upon death as a zombie friendly to the wielder, with an increasing chance as more damage is dealt.}}\n\n'''Reaping''' is a [[brand]] exclusive to the [[sword of Zonguldrok]] which does the following:\n*When an enemy hit by a reaping weapon dies, it has a chance to rise as an allied [[zombie]]. This scales with damage dealt: if a weapon of reaping did all the damage, you have a 50% chance to create a zombie. \n:Reaping works alongside [[Death Channel]], but doesn't work with [[Necrotise]] or [[Animate Dead]], and is overridden by [[Simulacrum]] and [[Infestation]]. [[Death drop]]s (such as [[dragon scales]]) will not be created.\n\nThis is considered an [[evil]] brand. Attacking an enemy with a weapon of reaping will offend the [[good gods]]. Reaping is also ineffective while worshipping [[Gozag]], [[Okawaru]], or [[Yredelemnul]] (who reaps for you).\n\n==Sources==\nReaping can only be found on the [[sword of Zonguldrok]]. It cannot be obtained by any other method.\n\nHowever, the [[chaos]] brand has a 1% chance to add the reaping effect on any attack.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the reaping brand did not prevent [[death drop]]s from appearing.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], this brand could be found on the [[Spear of the Botono]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], this brand could also generate on [[scythe]]s.\n*Before [[0.10]], the effect occurred any time you dealt a killing blow with the reaping weapon.\n*Before [[0.8]], this brand was also found on [[arrow]]s, [[dart]]s, [[bow (item)|bows]] and [[longbow]]s.\n\n{{brands}}\n\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

{"title":"Chain of Chaos","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Chain_of_Chaos","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Creates an arc of pure chaos, striking nearby creatures with unpredictable effects. The arc can touch upon the caster without harming them.}}\n'''Chain of Chaos''' is a spell which has a wide variety of possible effects, much like the [[chaos]] weapon brand. It hits a nearby target, usually (but not always) the nearest target. It then \"arcs\" to another nearby target with reduced power. It can arc multiple times before grounding out, and it can affect the same creature multiple times in 1 cast. Arcs can hit the caster, but have no effect.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nIt can also be caused by the [[Mace of Variability]].\n__NOTOC__\n==Possible Effects==\nThe list of possible effects is as follows, rounded to the nearest tenth:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|beam.cc|613}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Both are incredibly deadly effects, so avoid Psyche as much as possible.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], this spell was given to [[Psyche]].\n*In [[0.22]], the [[Mace of Variability]] was reworked to cast this spell on melee attacks.\n*This spell was added in [[0.14]]. Initially, Chain of Chaos was given to [[chaos champion]]s, but it was replaced with another spell before the release. Chain of Chaos became a [[Xom]] effect instead.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

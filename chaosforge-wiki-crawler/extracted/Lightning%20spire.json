{"title":"Lightning spire","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lightning_spire","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Lightning spires''' are uncommon defensive structures whose purpose is simple: to shoot [[bolt of electricity|bolts of electricity]] at any enemy who stumbles into their range. They are fairly fragile, but nearly immune to most elemental spells. Outside of [[Summon Lightning Spire]], they are extremely rare, but can be found defending certain [[vault]]s (including one [[rune]] vault in [[the Abyss]]).\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Electrical Bolt, unlike [[Lightning Bolt]], is both quiet and accurate. It can still [[doublezap]], though.\n*Hostile lightning spires are as strong as [[electric eel]]s; by the time you find them, most characters can survive smashing through. rElec is still recommended, though, as they usually come in electric-themed [[vault]]s.\n*Lightning spires can't [[see invisible]]. A friendly lightning spire can hit you if you're invisible and there's a monster in the path.\n\n==History==\n*[[Summon Lightning Spire]] was added in [[0.14]].\n*Lightning Spires were introduced for [[Zot Defense]] in [[0.9]]."}

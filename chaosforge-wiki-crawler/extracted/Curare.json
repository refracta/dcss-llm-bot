For susceptible targets, curare deals 2d6 untyped damage, and inflicts both [[poison]] and [[slow]]. It has no effect on monsters with poison resistance. For players, poison resistance gives a 66% chance for curare to fail, and reduces the poison effect if it does work. Players need poison immunity to be immune to curare.\n\nCurare is normally found on [[dart]]s and the [[unrand]] whip \"[[Snakebite]]\". In addition, the [[Concentrate Venom]] spell will upgrade a creature's natural venom (both from [[venom]]ous attacks and the [[Spit Poison]] ability) to curare.\n\n==Strategy==\nEven at 0 Throwing skill, curare darts are powerful. Unlike [[atropa]] and [[datura]], curare doesn't rely on skill to actually inflict its effect - if you hit the dart, you slow and poison any non-resistant enemy. Slowness makes enemies attack 50% slower, allows you to [[kite]] them, and lets you escape from [[attacks of opportunity]]. Many dangerous enemies lack poison resistance, from [[ogre]]s or [[giant]]s to powerful [[unique]]s like [[Gastronok]], [[Snorg]], and even [[Antaeus]].\n\nBe aware that curare will work equally well on you, should you lack poison immunity. Most of the time you won't have to worry about it, but the occasional [[kobold brigand]] or [[spriggan rider]] may be carrying curare darts, the unique kobold [[Sonja]] is guaranteed to spawn with several curare darts, and [[naga magi]] and [[Amaemon]] can grant their allies curare-branded attacks.\n\n==Trivia==\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curare Curare] is a general term referring to resinous, organic substances derived from tropical south and central American plants, crude preparations of which have long been used as arrow poisons to aid in the capture of wild game. Curare produces profound skeletal muscle relaxation, which can lead to respiratory paralysis and death. As such, curare alkaloids were once used in western medicine to induce general anesthesia.\n\nThe world \"curare\" is itself a European interpretation of the South American Indian word for poison.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], curare dealt asphyxiation damage. [[Unbreathing]] creatures were immune to the damage but not poison or slow.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], curare was found on [[needle]]s instead of [[dart]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], curare would interrupt [[Breath]]-based abilities, like [[dragon]] breaths and [[Word of Recall]].\n\n{{brands}}"}

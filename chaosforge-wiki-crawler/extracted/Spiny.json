{"title":"Spiny","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spiny","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\nAnything careless enough to attack a '''spiny''' creature in melee will take damage from the defender's spines. Ranged or [[reaching]] attacks ignore this counterattack, as do spells. Each spiny creature may only hurt a monster once per round.\n\nCreatures with this trait are immune to [[constriction]].\n\n==Monster Version==\nEach time anything attacks a [[:Category:Spiny|spiny monster]] in melee, there is a one in three chance that the attacker will take damage. This damage ignores EV, but is reduced by AC.\n\nBriar patches deal 5d4 damage, which is the default behavior. Cactus giants instead deal 5d8 damage with their spines.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|fight.cc|1299}}</ref>\n\n==Player Version==\nYou can acquire the spiny trait yourself by gaining the [[demonspawn]] [[Demonspawn_mutations#Spiny|spiny mutation]]. Spiny players have a one in two chance to hurt attackers, dealing damage based on mutation rank and experience level:\n\n   Minimum damage: mutation_rank\n   Maximum damage: (2 * XL / 3) + 3 * mutation_rank\n\nAs with monster spines, this ignores EV.\n\n==Spiny Monsters==\n*{{monsterlink|Briar patch}}\n*{{monsterlink|Cactus giant}}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], cactus giants were introduced, which deal more damage with their spines.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], mutation rank had minimal influence on the player damage formula.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], you could naturally find mobile spiny enemies in the Dungeon: [[porcupine]]s, [[torturous demonspawn]]s, and [[hell sentinel]]s had them.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the player version did damage based only on the mutation rank.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Spiny]]\n[[Category:Monster attributes]]"}

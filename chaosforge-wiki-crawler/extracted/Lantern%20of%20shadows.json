It shrouds the wielder in unnatural darkness, making them unstealthy and significantly reducing the power of their spells.}}\n\nThe '''lantern of shadows''' is a \"[[weapon]]\" which reduces your [[line of sight]], but with a number of penalties.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen [[wield]]ed in the weapon slot, the lantern of shadows does the following:\n\n*Reduces your [[LOS]] by 2 tiles (from 8 to 6). This stacks with other sources of LOS reduction.\n*Passively [[summon]]s friendly [[shadow]]s, who are attracted to the lantern and will flutter around it. The chance per turn to create a shadow is increased by [[Evocations]]. They disappear as soon as you unwield the lantern.\n*Greatly reduces your [[spell power]]. It acts as a two negative [[spell enhancer]]s, i.e. it is equal to losing 2 sources of [[Archmagi]].\n*[[Stealth]] score is reduced to 0.\n\nWhile wielding the lantern, 1 [[MP]] is drained per turn. If you are at 0 MP, all shadows vanish and no more will spawn, though the other effects still apply.\n\nThe lantern is not a proper weapon; attacking in melee causes you to \"clumsily bash\", as if you tried to melee with a [[scroll]], [[ranged weapon]], etc.\n\n==Strategy==\nThis item can be useful for escapes. Monsters cannot attack when outside ''your'' LOS, so the LOS reduction is helpful when covering your retreat. But it's finnicky, to say the least. With no weapon, no stealth, and reduced spell power, it is useful only as a swapout.\n\nShadows can be used for [[kiting]]. These monsters are strong for the early-mid Dungeon, but are weak by late [[Lair]]. However, since you can create 'free' shadows by [[pillar dancing]], they are still valuable to have.\n\n== History ==\n*The lantern of shadows was removed in [[0.18]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], lantern of shadows didn't drain MP while in use, and didn't cease to function once its wielder runs dry.  Also, shadows could follow you through stairs, and had regular AI (they didn't flutter).\n*Prior to [[0.13]], the spawn rate of shadows did not scale with [[Evocations]].\n*Prior [[0.9]], an unidentified lantern of shadows always appeared as a '''bone lantern'''."}

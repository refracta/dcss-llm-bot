{"title":"Orc sorcerer","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Orc_sorcerer","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{list of | orcs}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Orc sorcerers''' are advanced [[orc]]ish casters which hurl [[fire]], [[negative energy]], and paralysis at you from the back rows while their orcish and demonic allies keep you busy. They don't handle damage well, but it's difficult to take them out before you've suffered some [[draining]] or a band of demons has come to their aid. They are found in the [[Orcish Mines]], most often on Orc:2, and occasionally in the [[Elven Halls]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Paralysis]] is always a deadly spell. Being surrounded by a group of [[might]]ed orcs for 5 turns is bound to kill. The orc sorcerer alone can do 255 damage in 5 turns if you don't resist both of its bolt spells.\n**It's ideal to give all monsters a 0% chance of success of paralysis. For orc sorcerers, this requires 135 [[willpower]], a bit over Will+++. Base species, like [[Human]]s (3 Will/XL), require XL 19 and external Will++ (or external Will+++) to reach 0% success. The likes of [[Ogre]]s (4 Will/XL) require XL 15 and external Will++ for the same threshold.\n**Blocking line of fire with monsters will at least prevent paralysis.\n*Other than paralysis, they fire strong bolt spells and summon nasty [[tier-3 demon]]s, such as [[sixfirhies]], [[sun demon]]s, and malmutating [[neqoxec]]s. So even if you have full willpower, it's recommended to take out sorcerers quickly.\n*As spellcasters, they can be [[silence]]d, and a [[phial of floods]] can [[waterlog]] them.\n\n===Beogh===\n[[Orc wizard]]s are tough to keep alive, due to their fragile nature. It takes a lot of luck and more than a little micromanagement to promote a wizard into a sorcerer. If you do manage to get a named sorcerer, give them the best [[armour]] available. In addition to the usual tricks for keeping followers alive, try hard not to allow shots at you to also target your frail sorcerers, and call him back to you anytime he gets into an exposed position.\n\n[[Category:Orc]]"}

It lasts for <code>24 + 1d40</code> (more) turns (max. 100).\n\nFlight allows you to pass over [[deep water]] or [[lava]] safely, and negates penalties from [[shallow water]]. It does not provide immunity to [[trap]]s. If the flight runs out while you're over invalid terrain, you don't die, but are [[drain]]ed for every turn you spend in said terrain.\n\n==Strategy==\nPotions of enlightenment serve a dual purpose. The willpower helps defend against deadly [[Hexes]], which is useful in just about any branch. Conversely, flight is useful in a few select areas, most notably [[Swamp]] and [[Shoals]].\n\n*Willpower is one of the few ways to prevent [[paralysis]], which is a ''brutal'' effect. If you have insufficient will from other sources, save some potions against foes who cast Paralyse. Other hexes, such as [[Petrify]], [[Mesmerise]], and [[Confuse]], can also be dangerous in many circumstances.\n*Flight removes the penalties from shallow water. Therefore, it can be useful in order to reposition and/or retreat while in water. It can also be used to cross through certain [[vault]]s with deep water/lava. Note that both water and lava are rare in ''Crawl''; you won't find much outside the aforementioned Swamp and Shoals.\n**Note that if you are [[large]] ([[Armataur]]s, [[Naga]]s, [[Oni]], [[Troll]]s) or [[amphibious]] ([[Barachi]], [[Merfolk]], [[Octopode]]), you don't get any penalties from shallow water.\n**If your flight is running out, but you are close to land, consider not drinking another potion. If you only stand in lava for a turn or two, the drain penalty is minor.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], these potions were known as '''potions of flight''', and did not boost your [[willpower]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], having flight dispelled or cancelled while over deep water or lava could cause [[instant death]].\n*Potions of flight replaced [[potions of levitation]] in [[0.12]].\n\n{{potions}}"}

The ripples of its folds as the wearer leaps and swerves in combat may dazzle those who gaze on it.}}\n[[File:Urand starlight.png]] '''''the +1 cloak of Starlight'''''\n\n+1 [[cloak]]<br>\ncan [[Blind|Dazzle]] attackers (20% when dodging an attack)<br>\n+4 [[EV]]<br>\n[[Stealth]]--\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''cloak of Starlight'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|1034}}</ref> is usually a very competitive piece of equipment. As a +1 cloak with +4 EV, it will be better than a mundane cloak. The [[Blind#Dazzle|*Dazzle]] effect comes in handy fairly often, especially for evasive characters.\n\nThe stealth hit is generally not too painful; usually you either have enough stealth that it doesn't matter, or you aren't using stealth at all. [[Stab]]bers might disagree when attempting to take out a sleeping [[unique]], but in other cases the cloak provides a lot of opportunities for low-tier stabs.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.26]], the cloak got the *Dazzle property and lost rElec and rC+.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the cloak had a +2 enchantment.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the cloak had a +0 enchantment and lesser stealth penalty (Stlth-).\n*Prior to [[0.15]], stealth penalty was -30.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Cloaks]]"}

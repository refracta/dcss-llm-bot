{"title":"Phantom","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Phantom","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Phantoms''' are irritating [[undead]] spirits that harass young adventurers, [[blink]]ing themselves and taking your character with them on melee attack. They have surprisingly high [[HP]] and damage output for a monster found in the early [[Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*A phantom is essentially a walking [[dispersal trap]], which has the potential to be very dangerous. For example, you could be hit once and be trapped between the phantom and an [[ogre]]. They can also prevent you from going up stairs, making escape risky. Always try to fight them in explored and cleared areas. \n*[[Attacks of opportunity]] will never trigger the blink effect. While you'll still be taking damage from the phantom's attacks, you'll at least be able to lead it to a safer part of the Dungeon without getting blinked around.\n*Phantoms are worth a lot of [[XP]] for such early monsters, so try to take them out if you are able. Just be careful about it; mashing [[Tab]] will almost certainly result in dangerous missteps, and make sure not to retreat into areas you haven't explored yet!\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], phantoms dealt 10 base damage with their melee attacks.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], phantoms would [[blink]] randomly and independently, instead of blinking with you on a melee hit."}

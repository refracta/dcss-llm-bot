{"title":"Summon Forest","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summon_Forest","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Summon Forest''' is a level 5 [[Summonings|Summoning]]/[[Translocations|Translocation]] spell that summons a section of forest with a friendly [[dryad]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nSome nearby rock [[wall]]s are converted to [[tree]]s. Additionally, some unoccupied floor tiles will have trees placed on them (in a way that doesn't break connectivity). Sometimes, a pond is created as well. Finally a [[dryad]] is summoned, who instantly casts [[Awaken Forest]], berserking all trees summoned by this spell in addition to any trees part of natural dungeon features. The dryad may later summon additional [[Snaplasher vine]]s, with a constriction melee attack that pulls enemies towards awoken trees.\n\nThe spell may only be cast in an open area. At least one square adjacent to the caster must not have any adjacent solid features.\n\nHigher [[spell power]] may increase the duration and density of the forest, and will make the dryad stronger.\n*Dryad's [[hit dice]] is <code>5 + <power> / 18</code>, randomly rounded.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-summoning.cc|1380}}</ref> This increases HP, strength of Awaken Forest, and melee accuracy.\n\n*Awoken trees deal <code>HD + 1d(HD) - 1 </code> to <code>2 * HD - 1</code> damage/turn (5-9 damage at dryad HD = 5, favoring higher values).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-damage.cc|3117}}</ref> Both [[AC]] and [[EV]] protect against this damage. A creature may only be attacked by 1 tree at a time.\n\n*The duration of the spell ranges from <code>12 + <power> / 10</code> turns to <code>20 + <power> * 1.5 / 10</code> turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-summoning.cc|1323}}</ref> The dryad has the same duration. \n\nYou cannot recast this spell while it is active, therefore there is a summon limit of 1 dryad. Awoken trees and snaplasher vines are instantly neutralized the moment the dryad dies, but the spellâ€™s status effect must still run its course before it can be recast.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe dryad itself isn't very impressive, but the forest and the snaplasher vines deal good damage to any monster in the area. Especially great in [[the Swamp]], which is filled with trees, but works in any somewhat-open space.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n* You can '''[[t]]'''ell your dryad to '''r'''etreat, in order to keep it alive (and maintain the forests' effect).\n* The trees spawned by this spell block line of sight. This can be an interesting option in wide open, dangerous spaces with ranged threats.\n* Be careful that the occasional pond spawned by this spell does not block your retreat, or grant increased speed to fast swimmers like [[hydra]]s.\n* The monster that casts Awaken Forest first has priority. If you use Summon Forest first, [[spriggan druid]]s will be unable to turn the trees against you.\n* If you really need to get rid of the snaplasher vines, you can attack the dryad, which will instantly dispel the dryad (and thus the vines). Note that this will anger the [[good god]]s, and that it won't get rid of the trees. To attack the dryad with melee, you can either use '''v''' or '''ctrl + direction'''.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], fires could spread to temporary forest, and [[Tornado]] could break summoned trees.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], this spell could be used for digging walls: the player could turn a wall into a tree and then burn it.\n*Summon Forest was added in [[0.14]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

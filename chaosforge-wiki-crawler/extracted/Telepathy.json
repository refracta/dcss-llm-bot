{"title":"Telepathy","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Telepathy","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n'''Telepathy''' is a [[status effect]] you can acquire by drawing the [[Dowsing card]] from a [[deck of dungeons]], displayed as {{LightBlue|Emp}}. This allows you to read the surface thoughts of nearby monsters that are not currently in your [[line of sight]], revealing their locations and a general idea of their strength. When playing in console mode, these monsters are displayed by the {{Red|{}} glyph, while tiles mode uses the following icons:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! '''Friendly''' || '''Trivial''' || '''Easy''' || '''Tough''' || '''Nasty'''\n|-\n| [[File:Friendly monster.png]] || [[File:Trivial monster.png]] || [[File:Easy monster.png]] || [[File:Tough monster.png]] || [[File:Nasty monster.png]]\n|}\n\nThese categories are determined by comparing your [[experience level]] to the enemy's [[HD]]. Although it does not reveal the specific nature of the monsters detected, knowing that several high-HD monsters are right around the corner can be extremely useful, and experienced players can sometimes intuit what a particular monster will be by the number of monsters in its band and the area it is found in.\n\nYou can acquire a similar, permanent effect through the [[Antennae]] mutation.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.19]], this [[status effect]] and the [[Dowsing card]] were removed.\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

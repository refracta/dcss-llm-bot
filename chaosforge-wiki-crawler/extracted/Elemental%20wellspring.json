{"title":"Elemental wellspring","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Elemental_wellspring","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Elemental wellsprings''' are obnoxious aquatic monsters which batter you with [[Primal Wave]]s, all the while summoning many hostile [[water elemental]]s. They can be found mainly in [[Cocytus]] and Cocytus-themed [[Ziggurat]]s, but also rarely in [[Shoals]] and the [[Depths]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Primal Wave is a fairly powerful spell, dealing significant damage and pushing you around the battlefield. Resisting it is tricky: unless you're an amphibious character ([[octopode]]s, [[merfolk]], [[barachi]]m and grey [[draconian]]s) or non-breathing (the undead, [[djinn]], [[gargoyle]]s and [[Statue Form]]), you'll take full damage. Flight will help you navigate the suddenly flooded battlefield. A side-effect of the primal flood is a 3x3 square of shallow water that renders useful terrain features (like stairways!) temporarily inaccessible.\n*The water elementals an elemental wellspring summons function like any other summoned unit: if you kill the summoner, the summons die with it. However, ignoring them might be risky for spellcasters, as their attacks can effectively [[silence]] you. Moving away from the elemental will break its hold on you and end the silence... at least until it hits you again.\n*Wellsprings can't [[see invisible]], and are much less likely to cast magic against an [[invisible]] character. Just be aware that invisibility is negated by being in water if you aren't flying.\n*Wellsprings themselves aren't particularly vulnerable to [[fire]] damage, but [[Ignition]] works very well against their densely packed summons. This will also create large numbers of sightline-blocking [[steam]] clouds if the wellspring is over a large body of water (which is common in Cocytus).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], elemental wellsprings had fast regeneration. Wellsprings took damage when using Primal Wave (5-19 HP), and water elementals were summoned through the use of the spell. Also, wellsprings only created shallow water directly underneath themselves.\n*Elemental wellsprings were originally used in [[Depths]] and [[Forest]] during [[0.13]] and [[0.14]] development, with an initial version directly and relentlessly casting an uncapped [[Summon Water Elementals]] alongside [[Primal Wave]]s. They were considered excessive for their depth in their spam, and removed before the stable releases. Though retired, they were brought back in [[0.16]] for use in post-game."}

Once cast, they dissipate.}}\n\n'''Conjure Living Spells''' summons living spell monsters. Each type of [[walking tome]] uses a different spell. They behave like [[Foxfire]]s: each living spell has 1-2 HP, but on contact with an enemy, they'll cast their respective spell. Note that the living spells themselves are unaffected by [[silence]]. Crystal tomes summon 1-2 living spells; the other tomes summon 2-3 living spells.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], walking tomes could sustain up to 6 living spells at once. Also, crystal tomes will only cast 1-2 spells.\n*Conjure Living Spells was introduced in [[0.28]], along with walking tomes.\n\n[[Category: Monster spells]]"}

{"title":"Fedhas Madash","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fedhas_Madash","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n[[File:Fedhas altar.png]] ''\"Spread life and death.\"''\n{{flavour|Fedhas is the god of plant and fungal life. Followers are forbidden from harming any species under Fedhas' protection. In return Fedhas grants a number of abilities that promote the growth of plant and fungi. These abilities may incidentally prove useful to adventurers.\n\nPlants and fungi will not attack Fedhas' worshippers without provocation. Fedhas' worshippers may walk through plants or fungi, and even fire missiles or spells through them without causing harm. Fedhas grants powers to temporarily grow a menagerie of plant allies whose strength and duration increase with Invocations skill. Worshipers may grow a protective wall of briar patches as well as ballistomycetes that fire damaging spores whose explosions confuse living creatures. Devout followers can overgrow a stretch of solid terrain with a cluster of plant allies or even summon a mighty oklob plant.\n\nFedhas likes it when you kill living beings, you destroy the undead, you kill demons, you kill holy beings and you destroy nonliving beings.}}\n\n==Racial restrictions==\n[[Demigod]]s are unable to worship Fedhas (or any other god). Also, characters who sacrificed love under [[Ru]] cannot join Fedhas.\n\n==Appreciates==\n* Killing [[natural]], [[undead]], [[demonic]], [[holy]], or [[nonliving]] creatures.\n\n==Deprecates==\n*Inactivity: You lose 1 piety per 700 turns, on average (1/35 chance every 20 turns).\n\n==Given abilities==\n'''[[Piety|Piety level -]]''': \"Fungal\"\n*All plants are [[peaceful]] towards you. In addition to stationary plants, [[sleepcap]]s, [[shambling mangrove]]s, and [[thorn hunter]]s will be peaceful. (Passive)\n*You can walk through plants (but not [[tree]]s, which are walls). It takes 50% longer than normal to do so. (Passive)\n*Plants and trees are protected from harm. You can fire through all allied plant-type creatures as if they were a [[bush]], and no attack or spell will harm a plant/tree, even with spells like [[Fireball]]. (Passive) \n**Entities created by spells, like [[orbs of destruction]] and [[battlesphere]]s (including its beams), are unable to pass through plants.\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level *]]''': \"Green [Species]\"\n*No new abilities.\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level **]]''': \"Cultivator\"\n* '''Wall of Briars''': Encircles yourself with summoned [[briar patch]]es, which hurt any enemy that attacks them. Enemies can fire [[Ranged Weapons]] and other projectiles past the briars, though [[Hexes]] like [[Confuse]] can't pass through. It won't summon patches for enemies already next to you. (3 MP, 2-3 Piety)\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ***]]''': \"Fruitful\"\n* '''Grow Ballistomycete''': Summons a [[ballistomycete]], at a chosen square up to 2 tiles away. Ballistomycetes create exploding spores, which deal <code>3d(6 + [[Invocations]])</code> damage<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|mon-explode.cc|69}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-summoning.cc|2494}}<br>Note that the spore's HD is adjusted by +1 in {{source ref|0.30.0|mon-cast.cc|6545}}.</ref> and [[confusion|confuses]] creatures that are [[unbreathing|breathing]]. Spores can hit the player. (4 MP, 4-6 Piety)\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ****]]''': \"Photosynthesist\"\n* '''Overgrow''': Transforms dungeon [[wall]]s and trees into plant allies by using the Overgrow ability. Once the plants despawn, the wall will be gone. This can override stone and metal walls. Higher [[Invocations]] will improve the selection of plants. (8 MP, 12-18 Piety)\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level *****]]''': \"Green Death\"\n* '''Grow Oklob''': Grows an [[oklob plant]], at a chosen square up to 2 tiles away. These are strong, long lasting, and [[corrosion|corrosive]] allies. (6 MP, 6-9 Piety)\n:Higher [[Invocations]] increases the oklob's HP and firerate, but not damage. Oklob plants have a <code>25% + (2.5% * [[Invocations]])</code> chance to use Spit Acid each turn, if a target is in range.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|monster.cc|2573}}<br>Cast frequency is (X)/200, so 200 frequency means a spell is cast 100% of the time.</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-summoning.cc|2543}}</ref>\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ******]]''': \"Force of Nature\"\n*No new abilities.\n\n==Punishments==\n{{flavour|Fedhas does not appreciate abandonment, and will call down fearful punishments on disloyal followers!\n\nThose who offend Fedhas will have forces of nature invoked against them in the form of pure elemental destruction. Waves of ballistomycete spores will rise from nearby corpses, and the worst offenders will be surrounded by animate mushrooms and acid-spitting oklob plants.\n\nFedhas's wrath lasts for a relatively short duration.}}\n\nDuring penance, Fedhas will occasionally punish you with one of the following forms of [[divine retribution]]:\n\n*The forces of nature will be invoked against you. This equates to a random [[Corrosive Bolt]], [[Primal Wave]], or [[Volley of Thorns]].\n*[[Corpse]]s in line of sight will produce hostile spores.\n*Hostile plants (biased towards oklobs) will grow around you. This effect will only happen when abandoning Fedhas, never when simply under penance.\n\nAll previously neutral or allied plants will also turn hostile upon abandonment or excommunication.\n\n==Strategy==\nFedhas offers a strong variety of summons that you can fire through. The plants themselves are quite strong, remaining useful throughout a 3-rune game (at the least):\n*Briar patches will prevent enemies from getting into melee range, but they can't block ranged attacks or most damaging spells. Still, Wall of Briars can make it easier to escape, break [[attacks of opportunity]], and deal a fair bit of [[spiny]] damage to melee attackers. Also, being surrounded by briars makes it harder for enemies to surround you. Just beware that it takes 1.5 [[decaAut]] to pass through each plant.\n**Among other things, Wall of Briars can block [[trample]] and [[Harpoon Shot]] (you can't be pushed/pulled past the briars).\n**Briars ''can'' block [[Hexes]], and hex-like spells such as [[malmutate]]. Great for preventing [[paralysis]]!\n*Ballistomycetes inflict [[confusion]], which by itself can take out many early/mid game enemies. Spores are very likely to confuse enemies, regardless of their [[willpower]], [[HD]], or [[poison resistance]] - it will even confuse [[Tiamat]] and the [[Hell]] lords. However, it doesn't do much against [[unbreathing]] ([[nonliving]] or [[undead]]) foes.\n*Oklobs deal moderately high damage (which few monsters resist) and [[corrode]]s enemies, severely lowering their [[AC]]. The corrosion effect is strong in practice, and even stronger when considering that your plant allies also benefit.\n\nAs all invocable plants are both stationary and long lasting, try to place them where you can easily sustain fighting. Make sure you aren't blocking your plants! The end of a hallway is often a good location for oklobs. Meanwhile, ballistomycetes don't work well in cramped corridors; they produce spores that explode in a 3x3 radius, potentially harming you. In that case, you may want to [[kite]] a monster around a wall while your plants fire.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Spores will tend to track towards enemies, but are not perfect. The plant can be '''t'''old to '''a'''ttack a specific target, but spores are unable to listen.\n*Any plants you summon are considered to worship Fedhas, so your oklobs can fire through other plants. (Spores can't pass through, however.)\n*Overgrowth is very expensive compared to Fedhas' other abilities. Its main use is to break through stone and metal [[wall]]s, such the [[Slime Pits|Slime]]:5 loot chambers or the lungs in [[Zot]]:5.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], in some circumstances Fedhas did not prevent you from harming plants, which would cause piety loss.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Fedhas did not protect trees. You would receive [[penance]] for destroying trees.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], oklob plant's Spit Acid dealt less damage (<code>3d7 + 2d4</code>) to monsters, but oklobs fired faster.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], many spells, like [[Fulminant Prism]] and [[Fire Storm]], would harm plants in the process.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], Fedhas did not allow the undead to worship it. Fedhas' abilities were greatly reworked in this version: the previous version revolved around permanent plants, terrain changes, and a direct [[ration]] cost. For more details, see [http://crawl.chaosforge.org/index.php?title=Fedhas_Madash&direction=prev&oldid=51535 this revision].\n*Prior to [[0.22]], Evolution was granted at *, and Sunlight was granted at **.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], Fedhas abilities used [[fruit]]s rather than rations.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Fedhas didn't have [[piety]] decay.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], worshipers of Fedhas could not cast [[Sublimation of Blood]] without incurring piety loss and/or penance.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], Decomposition was accomplished as an ability, not through prayer.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{gods}}"}

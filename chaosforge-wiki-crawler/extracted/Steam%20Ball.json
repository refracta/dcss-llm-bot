It also creates [[cloud#Steam|steam clouds]], dealing more damage and potentially blocking [[line of sight]]. Having [[steam resistance]] or [[fire resistance]] reduces the impact damage by 66%, and gives immunity to steam clouds' damage.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n[[Category: Monster spells]]"}

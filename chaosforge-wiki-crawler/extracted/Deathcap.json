{"title":"Deathcap","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Deathcap","type":"raw","data":"{{version017}}\n{{list of | plants}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Deathcaps''' are essentially an undead form of [[wandering mushroom]]. They can drain life from you and your allies from anywhere within its [[LOS]]. They do not occur naturally, and can only be encountered if summoned by a [[curse toe]]'s [[Summon Mushrooms]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The main threat of deathcaps is the curse toe itself, who'll [[torment]] you. A deathcap's attacks can finish off players who've been tormented to low HP. The amount of mushrooms can make it hard to move, and their [[confusion]]-branded melee can make it harder to fight the toe.\n\n==History==\n*Deathcaps were added in [[0.13]]."}

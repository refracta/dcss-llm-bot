If you're looking for more SH in exchange for EV, then you should probably just upgrade to a [[large shield]]. Only [[kobold]]s and [[halfling]]s might consider wearing this, and even they probably wouldn't: the SH increase is really not worth the EV penalty, especially considering that plenty of non-artefact shields offer useful resistances.\n\n==History==\nIn earlier versions, Bullseye used to be a [[buckler]].\n\nBullseye was removed in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Shields]]\n[[Category:Obsolete items]]"}

They are one of the stronger insects in the game, with decent [[AC]] and a heavy attack. However, they are painfully slow and are easy to kite by the time you find them in the deepest parts of [[the Lair]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Boring beetles make a 'grinding sound' when they dig, alerting you to their presence on the floor.\n*If boring beetles show up with other enemies, be aware that they can dig around other creatures to get at you if you try to retreat into a corridor.\n*A fleeing boring beetle will always run away from you, including through walls.\n*Boring beetles may appear guarding a Pet Rocks [[shop]] along with [[earth elemental]]s or some of the lesser [[List of golems|golems]]. These shops might appear before your character is strong enough to deal with the enemies inside, so use caution if you see one.\n\n==History==\nBoring beetles were removed for being boring in [[0.17]]."}

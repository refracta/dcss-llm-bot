{"title":"Lehudib's Moon Base","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lehudib%27s_Moon_Base","type":"raw","data":"{{version|021}}\n{{flavour|Lehudib, whose famous writings on earth magic left few personal details, is said to have studied the power of magical crystal with single-minded devotion and in the most distant location imaginable. After traveling to some forgotten Moon and carving a fortress into its very surface, the wizard somehow convinced the bizarre surface creatures there to stand guard. Who can say what other knowledge this self-described Lunar Mage learned in such isolation? Adventurers who manage to reach the remote Moon Base of Lehudib may indeed find powers beyond their comprehension.}}\n\n'''Lehudib's Moon Base''' is a [[Wizard Laboratory]], themed as the remote hideout of the famous [[Earth Magic|earth mage]] Lehudib. You'll find earth- and crystal-themed monsters typically seen in [[Vaults]] or [[Depths]], as well as eye monsters found in the [[Slime Pits]] and space-themed [[Abyss]] monsters. After taking the [[teleporter]] you find at one of four locations on the map, you'll face the legendary moon troll.\n\nYou'll find random loot at the portal locations as well as a large pile near the Moon troll. Also near the Moon troll is an artefact [[spell book]] named after Lehudib with a theme of Earth Magic and one of [[Transmutations]], [[Conjurations]], or [[Translocations]]; this spellbook always contains the spell [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]].\n\n==Monsters==\nThe following can be found throughout the map:\n\n{{monsterlink|Golden eye}} - Only dangerous around other monsters, but their [[Confusion Gaze|confusing gaze]] does not require a direct line of fire. Take them out as quickly as possible if there are other threats. Harmless if you have [[clarity]] or high [[willpower]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Eye of devastation}} - Slow, but fires blasts of devastating energies that can't be resisted, but ''can'' be dodged.\n\n{{monsterlink|Great orb of eyes}} - Can sap your magic, confuse or paralyze you, or just blast you with [[Disintegrate]]. Much less dangerous if you have high willpower.\n\n{{monsterlink|Glowing orange brain}} - Yet another source of hexes, but can also summon in reinforcements. If you start getting flooded, take out the summoner promptly.\n\n{{monsterlink|Neqoxec}} - Demons that can and will cast [[Malmutate]] at you, but aren't terribly dangerous otherwise unless you have exceptionally low intelligence. Block their line of effect until they come into range, then take them out.\n\n{{monsterlink|Tentacled starspawn}} - Can reach out with tentacles and drag you towards its maw (and possibly toward other threats). Attacking its tentacles hurts it, so area-damaging attacks work well.\n\n{{monsterlink|Starcursed mass}} - Will split into several entities -- the more of them you can see, the worse their smite-targeted damage gets. Keep attacking them to force them back together.\n\n{{monsterlink|Stone giant}} - Huge, strong, and throws [[large rock]]s at range. Fairly straightforward to deal with, though they can do some serious physical damage.\n\n{{Brown|u}} [[File:Ugly thing1.png]] {{Brown|u}} [[File:Very ugly thing1.png]] '''Brown [[ugly thing]]s and [[very ugly thing]]s''' - Come in packs and have [[acid]]ic attacks to begin with, though they may change elemental affiliations when next to each other. The very ugly things are far more dangerous.\n\n===Subguardians===\nTwo monsters guard specific treasure vaults in the moon base:\n\n{{monsterlink|Cacodemon}} - A cacodemon and some other denizens guard some [[potions of mutation]] in a sealed-off chamber with transparent walls, but the cacodemon can just [[Dig]] a way out. It comes with a couple nasty hexes, [[Malmutate]], and the energy bolts of an eye of devastation. \n\n{{LightMagenta|8}} [[File:Zot statue.png]] '''Lunar statue''' - This is an [[orange crystal statue]] with [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] instead of [[Mass Confusion]] and a 20% higher cast rate. It guards a single [[acquirement]]-level item. If you find it hard to defeat the statue, a [[wand of charming]] on one of the [[stone giant]]s can help out. 'T'ell the giant to charge towards the statue as you hide behind a pillar and as it arrives, step around to give the order to attack. You can then again hide behind the pillar while the giant pummels the statue on your behalf.\n\nAdditionally, each of the four possible portal locations will have one of the following monsters guarding it, possibly with other reinforcements:\n\n{{monsterlink|Crystal guardian}} - Has the not only the toughness and strength of a [[list of golems|golem]], but can fire bouncing bolts of fire or cold. Bring both elemental resistances and don't stand with your back to a wall.\n\n{{monsterlink|Quicksilver dragon}} - A swift-moving dragon that can breathe bolts of energy that strip away any buffs you have.\n\n{{monsterlink|Wretched star}} - Not terribly lethal, but it can quickly bog you down with multiple bad mutations. These are, thankfully, temporary, but you probably won't recover from more than one or two of them over the course of the level.\n\n{{monsterlink|War gargoyle}} - Fast, heavily armored, and hits hard, but its most deadly feature is easily its [[Metal Splinters|shrapnel breath weapon]].\n\n===Moon troll===\n{{flavour|A bizarre breed of intelligent troll, glowing with mysterious power from beyond this world.}}\n{{LightBlue|T}} [[File:Moon troll.png]] The final guardian of the base, the '''moon troll''' is a fast version of an [[iron troll]] with more [[hit dice]] that casts [[Corrosive Bolt]] (3d21) . It always wears [[moon troll leather armour]] if this item hasn't generated, otherwise it wears [[artefact]]-quality [[troll leather armour]]. It's wise to be [[haste|hasted]] and use your strongest attacks as the moon troll has considerable [[AC]] and multiple melee attacks. A source of [[Resist corrosion|corrosion resistance]] will reduce the damage and corrosion from Corrosive Bolt.\n\n==Map==\n[[File:Moonbase minimap018.png]]\n\n<pre>\ncccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\nccccccccccccccccccccccccccccbbbccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\nccccccccccccccccccccccccccc*bSb*cccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\ncccccccccccccccccccccccccc.......ccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\ncccccccccccccccccccccccccc...5...ccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\ncccccccccccccccccccccccccccc...ccccccccccc..cccccccccccccccc\ncccccccc.A.cccccccccccci............ccccc.....cccccccccccccc\nccccccc.....cccccccci....v...v..iv.....cc......ccccccccccccc\ncccccc.......ccccccc.....v.......v........qKK...cccccccccccc\ncccccc...&...cccccccc.....iccccc......cc..KKK....ccccccccccc\ncccccc.......cccccccc.iccccccccccccc......KKK.....cccccccccc\nccccccc......cccccccccccccccccccccccccc...KK..KK...ccccccccc\ncccccccc.<....cccccccccccccccccccccccc......2KKK....cccccccc\ncccccccccccc...ccccccccccccc...ccccccc..KK..KKK......ccccccc\nccccccccccccc...ccccccF................KKK..KK3.KKK..ccccccc\ncccccccccccccc...ccc.kF......K.........KKK.q...KKKK...cccccc\nccccccccccccccc.......Fc..K..2..K..c...KK......KKKq...cccccc\ncccccccccccccccc.......cc....v....cc.......KKK.......ccccccc\ncccvvbbbvvcccccc.......kc..vvvvv..c.......KKKK.....ccccccccc\nccvv*bRb*vvccccc...KK...cc..vvv2.cc...KK..KKKq...ccccccccccc\nccv.......vcccc....KKK...c....2..c...KKK.......ccccccccccccc\nccv...5...vcccck....KKK..cc.....cc..KKKq.....ccccccccccccccc\nccv.......vcccEEE....KK..kcccccccq..KK.......ccccccccccccccc\nccv.v...v.vccc..cck......ccc|Q|ccc.......cc..ccccccccc.jcccc\nccv..hvh..vcc....ccc....cc%%|||%%cc....ccc....ccccccc...Mccc\nccv..vvv..vccc.....ccckcc.%bbbbb%.ccqccc.....cc.jc......cccc\nccvh..v..hvccc.v...cJccc..bb...bb..cccOc...v.cM..cj.vv..cccc\nccvv.....vvccc....ccu.bb...........bb.fcc....cc..cc.v*.ccccc\ncccv.....vccc..v..c...b.............b...c..v.2+.........bbcc\ncccv.vhv.vccc..v..c...b......7......b...c..v..+.......5.Tbcc\ncccv.....vccc2.v..cp..b.............b..oc..v..+.........bbcc\nccvv.....vvccc....cc..bb...........bb..cc....cc..cc.v*.ccccc\nccv..hvh..vccc.v..2c...b...........b...c2..v.cM..cj.vv..cccc\nccv..vvv..vccc.....c...bb.........bb...c.....cc.jc......cccc\nccv...v...vcc2...cccc...bb.......bb...cccc...2ccccccc...Mccc\nccv.v...v.vccc..cc..c....bbb...bbb....c.3cc..cc`````cc.jcccc\nccv.......vccc......cc...............cc...c++c```````c++cccc\nccvv.....vvcccc......cc.............cc2...c..m```````m..cccc\nccccc....cccccc.......ccc.........ccc.....c..m```````m..cccc\ncccccc...ccccccc..v.....cccc...cccc....s..c..cc`````cc..cccc\nccccccc...ccccccc..........ccccc......KK..c...cmmmmmc...cccc\ncccccccc...cccccc..vv.v...................cc...........ccccc\nccccccccc...ccccc..vvr.................K...ccM.......Mcccccc\ncccccccccc...cccr......cccc.....cccc.....Ks.ccc.....ccc'cccc\ncccc.cccccc........v..cccccc.g.ccccccs..KK....cnLnLnc..''ccc\nccc...cccccc....vv...ccccccc+++ccccccc..................''cc\ncc.....ccccc..v.vv..rccccccc...ccccccc...................'cc\nccc..v..cccc........cccccg.G...G.gccccc....sI..\"\".\"\"..I..''c\ncccc..2.......rv....cccc...........ccccs...II.\".....\".II..'c\nccccc..vv.v.vv.....ccccc...........ccccc...I..\".....\"..I..'c\ncccccc.vv...vv.vv.rccccg...cc.cc...gcccc...IKKKKK6KKKKKI..'c\ncccccc..r......vv.ccccc...cc...cc...ccccc..IKKKKK+KKKKKI..'c\nccccccc..v.3......cccc....c.....c....cccc..IKKKKKeKKKKKI..'c\ncccccccc...v.vv..ccccc...............ccccc..IKKKKKKKKKI..''c\nccccccccc....vv..ccccM.g.....5.....g.Mccc''.....KKK.....''cc\nccccccccccc.....cccccc....c*...*c....ccccc''...........''ccc\nccccccccccccc.rcccccccccccccbPbcccccccccccc'''''''''''''cccc\nccccccccccccccccccccccccccccbbbccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\ncccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\n</pre>\n\n==History==\nLehudib's Moon Base was added in [[0.17]].\n\n[[Category: Dungeon Branches]]"}

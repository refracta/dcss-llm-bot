{"title":"Hobgoblin","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hobgoblin","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Hobgoblins''' are one of the more dangerous monsters you can encounter on D:1. While weak, they still present a threat to an XL 1 character. They are found in the early [[Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Hobgoblins are slightly beefier than [[goblin]]s and [[kobold (monster)|kobolds]], and hit about as hard. If you have the choice, avoid fighting a hobgoblin as your first enemy - try to get XP from easier prey, first.\n*Watch out for their equipment. A hobgoblin who has picked up a weapon is one of the most dangerous enemies you can find on D:1. Unfortunately, if it's wielding a weapon, it will be awake and likely to notice you.\n*If you find a mass of hobgoblins and [[goblin]]s on D:2-4, it's likely that [[Robin]] is around.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], the hidden weapon penalties for monsters were removed, so all monsters hit harder and faster with weapons. Hobgoblins were not nerfed directly, but to compensate, they can no longer spawn with weapons. (They can still pick up weapons, though.)\n\n[[Category:Goblin]]"}

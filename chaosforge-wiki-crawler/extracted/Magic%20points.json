{"title":"Magic points","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Magic_points","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n'''Magic points''' or '''Mana points''' (usually abbreviated to MP) is the amount of magical energy which a given character has. It is used for spellcasting, and for invoking divine powers, mutations, and intrinsic abilities. Having your MP fall to zero is not lethal, though you won't have any MP to use on abilities.\n\nEvery spell uses <code>(Spell Level)</code> MP per cast. Other types of abilities can have their own cost, usually ranging from 1 to 10 MP per use.\n\nYour base maximum MP is a function of your experience level, your species, and the either 1. your [[Spellcasting]] skill, or 2. half of your [[Invocations]] skill (The higher of the two; Spellcasting skill is twice as effective as Invocations for MP). Some items like [[ring of magical power|rings of magical power]] or [[artefacts]] with the {MP+} property can increase a given character's reserves of magical power.\n\nA typical character starts with 0-7 MP (e.g. 0 for a Minotaur Fighter, 7 for Deep Elf Hedge Wizard) and eventually grows to many times that (30-40 for a typical level 20 character, or 50-60 when using extra items).\n\n[[Djinn]] do not use MP. Whenever they would spend MP, they spend HP instead; otherwise, they are unaffected by any mechanic that involves MP.\n\n==Regeneration==\n\nYour base magic regeneration rate (BMRR) is <code>7 + MMP/2</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|player.cc|1351}}</ref> This is doubled if you have the [[Mana Regeneration]] mutation. The following modifiers are then applied to determine total magic regeneration rate (TMRR):\n\n*An [[amulet of magic regeneration]] gives +40 MP regen.\n*The [[Amulet of Vitality]] gives +80 MP regen.\n*[[Armataur]]s gain a temporary MP regen bonus when rampaging.\n*[[Jiyva]] adds anywhere between 40 and 80, depending on piety level.\n\nEvery turn (10 [[aut]]s) you accumulate regeneration points equal to your TMRR. When you accumulate 100 points, you restore 1 MP, and excess regeneration points are carried over to the next turn. If your action lasted longer/shorter than 10 aut, then the regeneration is scaled with time taken.\n\n==Strategy==\nMP is a very important stat for spellcasters. Early- or mid-game rings of magical power are extremely useful, since MP costs are low and your base mana pool is small. However, as your MP hits around the 40+ mark, the value of +9 MP decreases.\n\nMethods of MP restoration:\n*Resting.\n*Consumables: [[Potions of magic]] recover a decent amount of magic, but are rare. [[Potions of ambrosia]] offer significant HP and MP regeneration for a duration, but confuses you for the entirety of it; if you cure the confusion, the ambrosia will end too.\n*Casting [[Sublimation of Blood]], which restores your MP at the cost of your own health. (Remember to save 2 MP for this!)\n*Wearing an [[amulet of magic regeneration]].\n*God abilities: [[Ru]], [[Sif Muna]], [[Gozag]], and [[Nemelex]] offer ways to actively recover your mana, with varying degrees of reliability.\n*God passives: [[Vehumet]] lets you recover MP when killing monsters. [[The Shining One]] offers a similar power that only works against unholy and demonic enemies. Worshipers of [[Jiyva]] recover MP unusually quickly.\n*[[Channeling]] items: An [[orb]] of [[energy]] or the [[Staff of Wucad Mu]] may refund MP you spend, but with a chance of backfiring.\n*Biting an enemy as a [[Vine Stalker]].\n*Being a [[demonspawn]] can grant you access to the [[Mana Shield]] mutations, which will grant you improved MP regeneration, especially when you are low on MP. The [[Powered by Pain]] mutations might replenish MP whenever you take damage. Or you could get both.\n\n==Formula==\n*Highest Skill = max(Spellcasting, Invocations/2)\n*MP = Scale*(min(XL, 23) + Highest Skill + min(8, Highest Skill, XL)/2) + Species Modifier\n*Sources of MP scaling:\n**[[Good_mutations#High MP|High MP mutation]]: +10% per level\n**[[Bad_mutations#Low_MP|Low MP mutation]]: -10% per level\n**[[Elyvilon]]'s [[Divine vigour]]: up to +50%\n*Sources of flat MP bonuses (applied after scaling):\n**[[ring of magical power|rings of magical power]]: +9 MP each\n**[[artefact]]s with the {+MP} property: usually +4-12 each -- may vary for some [[unrand]]s\n*Wielding a weapon of [[antimagic]] divides MP by 3. This is applied after all other modifiers.\n\n==MP modifiers==\nFrom [[Dungeon Crawl]] [[Stone Soup]] in-game documentation:\n{{#invoke:Apt|skill_table|Magic Points}}\n\n[[Demigod]]s additionally start with the [[High MP]] mutation.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], the MP property of [[randarts]] was always +9 or -9.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], [[Evocations]] increased max MP.\n*[[0.17]] simplified MP calculations. The base formula was:\n XL + Permanent MP + (XL*Species modifier + 1)/3 + (XL*Species modifier + 1)/3 + max(Spellcasting*XL*3/14 + Spellcasting, Invocations*XL/6.5 + Invocations/3, Evocations*XL/6)\n:Then a stepdown function was applied and MP was capped at 50. Species aptitudes used to be multiplicative, but are now additive.\n*Before [[0.14]], the formula was:\n Unscaled MP = XL + Permanent MP + (XL*Species modifier + 1)/3 +\n max(Spellcasting*XL/4, Invocations*XL/6, Evocations*XL/6)\n:where ''Permanent MP '' was a constant determined by the player's background and species.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Stats]]"}

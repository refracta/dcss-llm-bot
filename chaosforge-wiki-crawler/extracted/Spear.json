With the spear you can take the initiative; the halberd is defensive. In the hands of one of two men of equal ability, the spear gives a little extra strength.<br>\n-Miyamoto Musashi, _The Book of Five Rings_, 1645.}}\n\n{{crawlquote|This weapon falls into the [[Polearms]] category. It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Spears''' are good starting weapons. They require little skill to reach [[minimum delay]], and as a Polearm, they can [[reach]] up to 2 tiles away.\n\n==Strategy==\nOf the \"simple\" starting weapons, spears are the strongest against single targets. Because spears can reach, they get 1 free attack for every engagement, which usually makes up for the worse stats compared to [[mace]]s or [[falchion]]s.\n\nPolearms in general are great if you have some means of creating distance. Characters with fast [[movement]] speed can [[kiting|kite]] enemies. Players with [[summon]]s can attack behind their allies. Even if you didn't start with melee, you can probably get at least one spear off of a [[gnoll (monster)|gnoll]] pack in the early dungeon. At 0 skill, spears are outright better than [[whip]]s and [[short sword]]s (if you aren't stabbing).\n\nBut unless you find a good [[brand]]ed or [[randart]] spear, you'll want to upgrade to a [[trident]] quickly.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Spear1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Spear2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Spear3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]s\n|-\n| '''[[Wyrmbane]]''' || [[File:Wyrmbane.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Force Lance (unrand)|Force Lance]]''' || [[File:Force lance (unrand).png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], spears were also considered [[Throwing]] weapons.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], spears had 7 base damage but lacked [[reaching]].\n\n{{weapons}}\n\n[[Category:Polearms]]"}

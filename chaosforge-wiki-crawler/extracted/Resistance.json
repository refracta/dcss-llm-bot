{"title":"Resistance","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Resistance","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n''For the ego found on robes and shields, see [[resistance (ego)]].''\n\nMonsters and players may have '''resistances''' against various types of damage; these are a subcategory of [[intrinsic]]s.\n\n==Types of resistance==\nThere are six \"major\" resistances.  These are commonly granted by items, spells, or species-specific or random [[mutation]]s:\n\n* [[Fire]] resistance\n* [[Cold]] resistance\n* [[Negative energy]] resistance (life protection), which is resistance against [[draining]] attacks, [[Necromancy|necromantic magic]], etc.\n* [[Electricity]] resistance\n* [[Corrosion]] (acid) resistance \n* [[Poison]] resistance\nThe degrees to which characters may have resistance to these elements vary from resistance to resistance <ref>{{source ref|0.29.1|fight.cc|595}}</ref>:\n\n* '''Fire/Cold resistance:''' 3 levels of resistance and vulnerability. Any level of vulnerability increases damage done by 50% from missile attacks and 100% from melee attacks and clouds. All player sources of resistance/vulnerability stack.\n* '''Negative Energy resistance:''' 3 levels of resistance, no vulnerability.  All sources stack, and rN+++ provides complete immunity.\n* '''Electricity:''' 1 level of resistance, no vulnerability (see below). Level gives 66% damage reduction.\n**Followers of [[Qazlal]] can get 1 level of shock vulnerability if they get under [[penance]].\n* '''Acid resistance:''' 1 level of resistance, no vulnerability. Level gives 50% chance to resist [[corrosion]] and 50% damage reduction.\n* '''Poison resistance:''' 1 level of resistance and vulnerability. rPois does not stack, though any amount of poison resistance and poison vulnerability cancel each other out. \n** '''Poison Immunity''': rPoisâˆž, a full immunity, is obtained via [[species]], an [[staff of Olgreb|unrand]], or special forms. Unable to be vulnerable.\n\n==Damage reduction==\nMonsters and players with resistance will take less or no damage from a resisted attack.  Some attacks are only partly resisted &ndash; for instance, only 45% of the damage from [[Fire Storm]] will have resistance (or vulnerability) applied to it.\n\nResistance is more effective vs. [[Sticky Flame]] and [[miasma]]. Note that players can only gain 1 level of rElec / rPois / rCorr from natural means. Certain forms and monsters may have more.\n\nThe damage reduction for players (except for negative energy) is:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Player Resistance level !! Damage taken !! Dam. vs. sticky/mias.\n|-\n| 1 || 50% || 33%\n|-\n| 2 || 33% || 25%\n|-\n| 3 || 20% || 17%\n|}\n\nMonsters' resistance is more effective:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Monster Resistance level !! Damage taken !! Dam. vs. sticky/mias.\n|-\n| 1 || 50% || 33%\n|-\n| 2 || 20% || 17%\n|-\n| 3 || 0% || 0%\n|}\n\nNegative energy is handled differently:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rNeg !! 0 !! 1 !! 2 !! 3\n|-\n!Players\n| 100% || 66% || 33% || 0%\n|-\n!Monsters\n| 100% || 0% || 0% || 0%\n|}\n\nIt is also possible for the player to be vulnerable (i.e., to have negative resistance) to fire, cold, or poison.  Monsters can be vulnerable to fire, cold, poison, and electricity, and [[evil]] creatures (including the player, if [[undead]], [[demonspawn]], or in [[lichform]]) are vulnerable to [[cleansing flame]].  Vulnerability (of any degree) causes a creature to take 150% normal damage from missiles and 200% damage from all other attacks.\n\nLife protection is handled differently: each level reduces damage taken by a third, meaning level 3 provides total immunity to draining and necromancy. [[Torment]] is also resisted by life protection, using yet another formula.\n\n==Gaining Resistances==\n*Quaffing a [[potion of resistance]] will give you one level of fire, cold, electricity, corrosion and poison resistance for a while.\n*Various [[dragon scales]], as well as other [[ego]] armour, will provide various major or minor resistances if worn.\n*Most resistances (not electricity) can be gained by wearing particular (standard) [[ring]]s.\n*[[Artifact]]s may provide one or more resistances, including electricity resistance and some of the \"minor resistances\" below.\n*All major resistances can be gained through a corresponding [[mutation]] (although only [[demonspawn]] can gain the life protection mutation).\n*Some [[species]] have racial resistances or vulnerabilities. Notably, all the playable undead races have at least [[Cold resistance|Cold Resistance 1]], [[Life Protection 3]], [[Poison Resistance]], and [[Torment|Immunity To Torment]].\n*Many spells in the [[Transmutations]] school provide assorted resistances along with their other, more dramatic effects.\n\n==Minor Resistances==\nThere are also a few \"minor\" resistances which come from specific items or species characteristics.  \n*[[Steam]] resistance from [[steam dragon scales]]. Fire resistance will also grant some resistance to steam.\n*[[Torment]] resistance will reduce damage from monsters casting [[Symbol of Torment]] or when using a [[scroll of torment]]. Being undead or in [[Dithmenos]]'s [[Shadow Form]] provides full resistance, following [[Kikubaaqudgha]] will sometimes prevent torment damage, and having the [[Hurl Damnation (mutation)|Hurl Damnation]] demonspawn mutation, being a gargoyle, or being in Statue Form each reduce torment damage by half. All other adventurers must rely on mitigating torment damage with negative energy resistance.\n*[[Mutation]] resistance comes from the [[Mutation Resistance (mutation)|mutation of that name]], the unrandarts [[Hat of the Alchemist]] or [[Lajatang of Order]], or high piety with [[Zin]]. The unrandarts and ranks 1 and 2 of the mutation have a 66% prevent you from mutating, while Zin's protection scales with piety, reaching 100% at maximum. Rank 3 of the mutation also provides 100% protection from mutations (as well as mutation removal). Additionally, having previous mutations may allow you to resist gaining new ones (though that may remove some of them in the process). Undead will always rot instead of mutating, but mutation resistance will block that rotting with the same frequency it would block mutation for a living character.\n*A few other intrinsics act like specialized resistances: [[clarity]] (confusion, frenzy, sleep, mesmerization), [[stasis]] (slow, teleport, paralysis, haste)\n*Although some monsters are immune to damage from [[holy]] or [[damnation]], that is not available for players.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], [[rot]] resistance existed.\n*In [[0.18]], the amulets of [[Amulet of resist mutation|resist mutation]], [[Amulet of stasis|stasis]], and [[Amulet of clarity|clarity]] were removed and the [[Amulet of resist corrosion|amulet of resist corrosion]] became a ring. Additionally, mutation resistance from now on only provides a 66% chance to avoid mutations. rElec was also changed to reduce by 66%.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], [[sustain attributes]] was named \"sustain abilities\", and [[corrosion]] reduced slaying and AC by 3 and 5 respectively instead of giving -4 to both.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], wearing a [[cloak of preservation]] was the usual choice to prevent item destruction. The concepts of item destruction and permanent corrosion effects retired at the same time. Prior to 0.15, corrosion instead caused permanent damage to weapons and armour, reducing their enchantment values, possibly into the negatives. Also, potions of resistance did not grant rAcid or rCorr.\n*[[Racial equipment]] variants were removed in [[0.14]], so is gone corrosion resistance of anything of dwarven make. \n*Elemental ([[Fire#Fire Resistance|Fire]], [[Cold#Cold Resistance|Cold]], and [[Electricity#Electricity Resistance|Electricity]]) resistances for players were [[nerf]]ed in [[0.6]].\n*[[Poison#Poison Resistance|Poison resistance]] for living characters was nerfed to provide only 90% protection against poisonous melee attacks in [[0.10]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Resistance]]\n[[Category:Intrinsic]]"}

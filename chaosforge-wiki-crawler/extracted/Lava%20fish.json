The intense heat of the lava that passes through its gills will sear anything that gets too close to its mouth.\n----\n“In the black rocks about Tahiti is found the black noki or lava-fish (Emmydrichthys vulcanus), which corresponds perfectly in color and form to a piece of lava. This fish is also noteworthy for having envenomed spines in the fin on its back.”<br>\n-Jordan, Kellogg and Heath, _Animal Studies: A Text-book of Elementary<br>\nZoology_. 1903}}\n\n<!--monster-bot-end-->\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Lava fish''' are slightly more dangerous than the water dwelling [[big fish]], but are generally found so rarely and under such controlled conditions that they pose no major threat. Their attacks deals additional [[fire]] damage and can burn your [[scrolls]]. They can be found in any body of lava except in the earliest portions of [[the Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nIgnore it. The [[experience]] for killing it is negligible by the time you face them, and the potential for losing scrolls is usually not worth the risk. If you insist on doing so, however, use ranged attacks, use a source of [[conservation]], or just drop your scrolls before going into combat.\n\n==History==\nLava fish were removed in [[0.14]]\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

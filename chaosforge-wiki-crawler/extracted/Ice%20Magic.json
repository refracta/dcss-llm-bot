{"title":"Ice Magic","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ice_Magic","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n'''Ice Magic''' skill determines how easily you can cast spells that employ ice, cold, and frost.\n\nIce Magic provides many \"subtle\" spells: most Ice spells cause passive effects, affect a large area, or both. Many of them are [[noise|quiet]]. In this way, the school strikes a good balance between offense and defense. Ice-based spells are generally resistible with [[cold resistance]].\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n{{spell table by level|Ice}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{spell sources|Ice|Book of Frost,Book of Ice,Book of the Tundra,Book of Winter,}}\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Ice Elementalist]]\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.32]], [[Hoarfrost Cannonade]], [[Permafrost Eruption]], and [[Rimeblight]] were added. \n*[[0.27]] redesigned [[Absolute Zero]] into [[Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling]], an [[Air]] spell.

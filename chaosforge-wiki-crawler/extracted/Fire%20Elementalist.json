Their other starting spells are likewise focused on fiery destruction.}}\n'''Fire Elementalists''' are mages who have specialized in [[Fire Magic]]. This sets them up for greater destructive power than most spellcasters, particularly in the realm of [[Conjurations]], but leaves them without any sort of support or defensive magic in the early game.\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Hill Orc]], [[Gargoyle]], [[Tengu]], [[Deep Elf]], [[Demigod]], [[Naga]], and [[Djinni]] are the recommended species if you pick a Fire Elementalist Background.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\n*+0 [[robe]]\n*[[Potion of magic]]\n\n'''Available Spells:'''\n*[[Foxfire]]\n*[[Scorch]]\n*[[Volatile Blastmotes]]\n*[[Inner Flame]]\n*[[Flame Wave]]\n\nFire elementalists start with the [[Foxfire]] spell memorised.\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Stealth]]: 2\n*[[Spellcasting]]: 2\n*[[Conjurations]]: 1\n*[[Fire Magic]]: 3\n\nChoosing Fire Elementalist adds 7 to your starting [[Intelligence]] and 5 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nFire Elementalists are particularly destructive magicians; only [[Conjurer]]s have a comparable set of damaging spells. All 3 of FE's direct damage spells are on the stronger side, and can never be [[ev]]aded - which contributes more to damage than you'd think.\n\nAs most Fire spells are also [[Conjuration]]s, it may be worthwhile to focus on training that skill (over Fire Magic) in order to have more spell options later on.\n\n===Spell Details===\nFire Elementalists struggle slightly at XL 1, due to the finicky nature of [[Foxfire]]. While Foxfire has perfect accuracy and strong damage, it requires open tiles to create and traverse through. Beware of hallways! In a pinch, you can stand in the corner of a hallway, opening up a diagonal to allow foxfires behind you to pass. [[Scorch]] is easier to use, but has its own quirks: it is limited to 3 range and targets randomly. However, Scorch also makes targets vulnerable to fire, giving it plenty of use throughout the Dungeon.\n\nThe level 3 spells can also be difficult to use. [[Volatile Blastmotes]] and [[Inner Flame]] both do good damage, but can harm the user if they are not careful. See their respective pages for more details.\n\nFinally, [[Flame Wave]] deals great damage to every foe in the surrounding area, especially for a level 4 spell. Flame Wave can be channeled; able to be cast twice more with a greater range for only 1 MP. However, don't get too greedy; Flame Wave has a small radius, and nearby monsters might be able to tear you apart.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.30]], [[Conjure Flame]] was replaced with [[Volatile Blastmotes]].\n*In [[0.29]], most backgrounds were buffed; all Mage backgrounds gained a [[potion of magic]].\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Fire Elmentalists started with [[Sticky Flame]] and [[Fireball]] instead of [[Scorch]] and [[Flame Wave]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Fire Elementalists started with the [[Book of Flames]]; FE's spells were unaffected.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Fire Elementalists started with [[Flame Tongue]] instead of [[Foxfire]] and had [[Throw Flame]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Fire Elementalists only started with 1 level of Spellcasting.\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

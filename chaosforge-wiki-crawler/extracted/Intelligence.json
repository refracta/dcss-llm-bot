{"title":"Intelligence","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Intelligence","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n\n'''Intelligence''' (or INT) is one of a character's three main [[attributes]], along with [[strength]] and [[dexterity]]. Characters who plan on using any of the various schools of magic will benefit greatly from having a high intelligence score.\n\nIntelligence affects the following:\n*Reduces chance of [[spell failure]]. \n*Increases [[spell power]].\n\nIf your intelligence is ever reduced to 0 or lower, you will suffer [[stat zero]] effects.\n\n==Useful Info==\nIn general, the power boost is more impactful than the spell failure boost:\n*Spell failure: Intelligence reduces failure. This is done at a rate of 6 intelligence : 1 skill in every spell school ''except'' [[Spellcasting]].\n*Spell power: Before modifiers, intelligence is a <code>INT / 10</code> multiplier, so 20 intelligence is up to twice as much power as 10 intelligence. However, there is a [[Spell Power#Step down|logarithmic stepdown]] if power > 50, so going from 10 to 20 is usually less than twice the power in practice.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Intelligence reduced [[spell hunger]] per casting by <code>INT Ã— [[Spellcasting]]</code>.\n\n[[Category:Stats]]"}

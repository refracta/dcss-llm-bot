To survive, she now offers great arcane power in a terrible bargain: in exchange for a tiny portion of the caster's life essence, taken alongside the magic used every time its wielder casts a spell, she will redirect the life essence of creatures damaged by the spell to the caster.}}\n\n[[File:Majin-bo.png]] '''''the +6 Majin-Bo'''''\n\n+6 bo (modified [[staff]]: 11 base damage, +1 accuracy, 1.2 base delay)\n\n[[Vampiric]] [[brand]]<br>\n[[MP]] +6<br>\n[[Intelligence]] +6<br>\nInjures you each time you cast a spell (1 HP for every 1 MP)<br>\nVampiric spells (100% chance to recover 1d<damage> HP on direct damage if [[Vampiric]] would apply)\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''Majin-Bo'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|1413}}</ref> is an extraordinarily powerful item in the hands of an experienced [[conjurations|conjurer]]. With vampiric melee attacks ''and'' spells, your HP recovery is great. The +6 [[intelligence]] and [[MP]] are useful, too. Even if you don't use magic, it is a decent weapon; its base type is equal to a [[demon whip]] with 0.6 mindelay.\n\nHowever, the Majin-Bo drains your HP for every spell, regardless of the outcome. Vampirism only works if the target has no [[negative energy resistance]]. It is worse than useless against targets with rN+, including demons and undead. Vampirism only triggers on direct damage, so [[Hexes]] and [[Summonings]] specialists will see little benefit. And if you miss, you won't be stealing HP. Still, one cannot deny the appeal of this weapon, particularly for hybrids and characters with powerful attack spells.\n\n[[Djinn]] have the most to gain from spell vampirism, as it becomes an effective MP steal. However, they have the most to lose - the Majin-Bo's HP cost means that spells now cost double to cast.\n\nIf the Majin-Bo's effect would bring you to 0 HP, the staff will leave you at 1 HP and let you cast your spell normally (with spell vampirism).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Majin-Bo was a +6 [[quarterstaff]]. \n*Prior to [[0.29]], Majin-Bo only had a 60% to activate spell vampirism on cast. \n*Prior to [[0.27]], Majin-Bo would prevent you from casting entirely if you would be reduced to 0 HP.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Majin-Bo had [[Archmagi]] instead of spell vampirism.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], the Majin-Bo never spoke occasionally. \n*The Majin-Bo was added in [[0.15]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Staves]]\n[[Category:Magical staves]]"}

Magic Dart is cheap and unresistable, but deals little damage.  Throw Frost does decent damage and is cheap enough for use as a staple attack spell well into the late early game.  [[Mephitic Cloud]] is an extremely powerful debuff, crippling most low-level casters and archers so that you can escape or kill with Throw Frost.  Bolt of Cold is too expensive (especially in food) for regular use until the endgame, but does extremely high damage and is useful for crises.  [[Static Discharge]] is tricky to use and often ignored.\n\nThis book has one major weakness, though - it lacks any effective means to harm monsters that resist cold and poison, that is undead.  While most early undead can be handled with [[kiting]] and Magic Dart, early ice conjurers live in fear of fast zombies, in particular the dreaded [[wyvern]] zombie.  Player ghosts can also pose a problem due to poison resistance, but can be overpowered in most cases with Bolt of Cold, as can be most undead enemies.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\nOne of the starting books for [[conjurer|conjurers]]. It used to be known as Book of Conjurations (ice)."}

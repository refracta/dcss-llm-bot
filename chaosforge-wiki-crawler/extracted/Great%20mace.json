Helen Zimmern, 1883.}}\n{{crawlquote|This weapon falls into the [[Maces & Flails]] category. It is a two handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''great mace''' is the largest and heaviest weapon in the Maces & Flails category that most [[species]] can wield. \n\n==Strategy==\nGreat maces are a fairly common weapon, often carried by [[ettin]]s, [[orc knight]]s, and [[vault guard]]s. They are closer to a [[battleaxe]] or [[glaive]] (in both rarity and strength) than they are to an [[executioner's axe]] or [[bardiche]].\n\nCompared to something like an executioner's axe, great maces lack any special properties, but are more common and reach mindelay at a lower level. [[Troll]]s and [[Oni]] who plan to wield two-handers will want a [[giant spiked club]], but other species can find this a respectable endgame weapon. \n\nHowever, [[eveningstar]]s are typically better. Compared to great maces, eveningstars deal -12% base damage, but only require one hand, allowing use of a [[shield]]. Since shields improve your survivability, this tradeoff is usually worth it. Eveningstars are considerably rarer, though.\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Mace large1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical/Artifact''' || [[File:Mace large2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Mace large3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]s\n|-\n| '''[[Undeadhunter|\"Undeadhunter\"]]''' || [[File:Great_mace_undeadhunter.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Mace of Variability]]''' || [[File:Mace_of_variability.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Firestarter]]''' || [[File:Firestarter.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Dark maul]]''' || [[File:Dark_maul.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], they had 18 base damage, and were much more common.\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

{"title":"Draconian annihilator","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Draconian_annihilator","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{list of | draconians}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Draconian annihilators''' are comparable to the [[deep elf annihilator]]s found in the [[Elven Halls]], but tougher and with resistances that complicate the fight. Like their elven colleagues, they like to cast high-level [[Conjurations]]. They can be found in [[the Realm of Zot]] and, rarely, in [[the Abyss]]. Randomly generated annihilators are [[yellow draconian]]s, complete with [[spit Acid|acidic breath]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nFor squishy characters, turning a corner and finding yourself face-to-face with an annihilator is an emergency, and you should waste no time putting some distance between the two of you via [[Blink]] or other means to escape the range of their most brutal spells. Melee-focused characters will want to do the opposite, engaging them and luring them into physically attacking you as quickly as possible. If you encounter draconian annihilators in groups, killing them should be a high priority.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], classed draconians could randomly generate as any colour."}

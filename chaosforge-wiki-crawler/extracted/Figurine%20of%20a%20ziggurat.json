It is remarkably detailed â€“ almost like a real, vast structure, shrunk somehow smaller than a human hand.}}\n\nThe '''figurine of a ziggurat''' is an [[Evocation|evocable]] item which creates a portal to a [[ziggurat]] upon use, being consumed in the process. A single figurine is guaranteed in the third floor of [[the Tomb]], while a figurine generates on the last, 27th, floor of each ziggurat.\n\nThe figurine serves a surprisingly useful secondary purpose: creating a ziggurat and jumping in is an effective escape route from danger. This takes two turns, and you could even meet a [[pan lord]] on the first floor, but Zig:1 is usually safer than whatever you were fighting. Be aware that you cannot place a portal on top of some [[dungeon features]] like [[shop]]s and [[stairs]], though [[deep water]] and [[lava]] are valid tiles. Also note that this application is limited in scope, as Tomb:3 and Zig:27 are often reserved for the very end of the game.\n\nFigurines of a ziggurat cannot be used while inside a ziggurat: {{crawlquote|Finish your current ziggurat first!}}\n\nWhen a ziggurat has already been completed in the current game, figurines of a ziggurat will display as a '''+X figurine of a ziggurat''', where X is the number of completed ziggurats.\n\nUnlike all other evocable items, it can be evoked even after sacrificing Artifice to [[Ru]].\n\n==History==\n*The figurine of a ziggurat was added in [[0.18]].\n\n{{Evocables}}"}

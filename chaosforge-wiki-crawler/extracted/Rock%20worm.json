While they aren't particularly dangerous normally, they are nearly invulnerable when encased in a wall, but will still be able to bite you. They can be found in the middle-[[Dungeon]], [[the Lair]], and in worm [[vault]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Try luring rock worms out into the open. As they no longer flee, you don't need to lure them more than one square out of their walls.\n*The following spells still affect rock worms even when they're hiding in a wall: [[Disintegration]], [[Freeze]], [[Vampiric Draining]], [[Smiting]], [[Torment]], [[Agony]], [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]], and [[Shatter]]. You can also [[Dig]] them to take away their hiding place.\n\n==History==\nThese were removed in [[0.14]], likely due to the sheer irritation they caused.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

{"title":"Barbs","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Barbs","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|There are barbs embedded in your skin, and moving around will cause you to take damage. Remaining in place for a short time will allow you to remove the barbs without taking damage.}}\n\n'''Barbs''' is a [[status effect]]. Each time a barbed creature moves, it takes damage equal to <code>2d(2 + times_barbs_inflicted)</code> damage (max. 2d6).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|movement.cc|141}}</ref> [[Rampaging]] makes you move twice, so you take double the damage while rampaging.\n\nThe barbs remain in their target for 4-8 turns, adding 2-4 turns per infliction of barbs (max. 12 turns at time).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|beam.cc|4000}}</ref> Remaining in place (no matter what you do) has 100% chance of decreasing the duration. While moving, you only have a 33% chance to decrease the duration. It is possible to rid yourself of barbs by moving, but doing so will incur significant damage.\n\nInflicted by:\n*[[:Category:Barbs flavour|Barbs attack flavour]] \n*[[Throw Barbs]] spell\n*[[Wu Jian]]'s wrath (lasting 5-10 turns)\n\n==History==\n*The barbs attack flavour was added in [[0.28]].\n*Prior to [[0.22]], you had to specifically [[wait]] (with ''''5''', '''s''', or '''.''') in order to have a 100% chance to decrement the duration.

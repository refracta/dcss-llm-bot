{"title":"Magic contamination","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Magic_contamination","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n'''Magic contamination''' is a dangerous condition caused by miscasts and some magical effects.\n\n==Overview==\nVarious activities cause harmful magical energies to accumulate in your body. A small amount of magical contamination (a dark or light grey \"Contam\" status) is mostly harmless, and will dissipate over time without any further effect. Larger amounts of accumulated magic contamination (a yellow, red, or dark red \"Contam\" status) will make you start to [[glow]] with magical contamination.\n\nContamination over 5000 points is considered severe. Being at a severe contamination level makes you easier to hit and reveals you if [[invisible]], similar to the [[Corona]] spell. It also leaves you at risk to bad [[mutation]]s and damaging explosions.\n\nAny amount of contamination can cause [[ugly thing]]s adjacent to you change their colour.\n\n==Contamination Levels==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

See [[Miscast effect#Effects|Miscast effect]] for more information.\n*[[Transmutations]] miscast: Doubles current contamination\n\n===Other===\n*[[Invisibility (ego)]]: 1000-1500 per successful use <ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|ability.cc|2674}}</ref>\n*Removing an [[artefact]] with *Contam: 7000<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|player-equip.cc|389}}</ref>\n*[[Mutagenic fog]]: 1300 - 2550<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|cloud.cc|1165}}</ref>\n*[[Zot trap]]: 7000 - 20000 (one of many possible outcomes)<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|traps.cc|414}}</ref>\n*[[Jiyva]] [[penance]]: 0 - <code>500 * penance</code> (one of many possible outcomes)<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|god-wrath.cc|L1233}}</ref>\n\n==Dissipation==\nMagic contamination is dissipated at the rate of 75 per turn.<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|timed-effects.cc|108}}</ref> Quaffing a [[potion of cancellation]] instantly removes 1000 - 5000 points of contamination.\n\nWhile being severely contaminated every 70 - 200 turns<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|timed-effects.cc|257}}</ref> there is <code>contamination / 12000</code><ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|timed-effects.cc|117}}</ref> chance of a violent release of energies. Standing in [[Zin]]'s Sanctuary stops this from happening.\n\nOne likely bad mutation (about 95% chance) is gained that bypasses [[mutation resistance]]. If contamination is higher than 10,000, there is also a damaging explosion. The damage is <code>3d(contamination / 2000)</code>, and doubled for the non-living. Explosion size also increases with the contamination level. After the negative effects, contamination is reduced by 1000 - <code>1000 + contamination / 4</code><ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|timed-effects.cc|74}}</ref>.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nBeing in lichform, by way of [[Necromutation]], prevents any contamination-related malmutations; instead, your [[stat]]s temporarily rot.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the contamination level for the light grey warning was 3500 instead of 3000. This change was enacted to match [[Irradiate]], which had its contamination increased in this version.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the [[Orb of Zot]] extended contamination.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], magic contamination decayed much slower: -25 per turn instead of -75, while the time between bad effects was also slower (200 - 600 turns).\n*Prior to [[0.25]], [[miscast effect]]s were different, and thus had different contamination levels.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the light grey contamination level didn't exist.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], this effect was simply called [[glow]], a ambiguous term that also referred to the backlight caused by [[Sticky Flame]] and [[Corona]] (and contamination itself).\n\n===Sources of Contamination===\n*Prior to [[0.28]], [[invisibility]] caused contamination over time, and [[Disjunction]] had 750 - 1250 contamination on cast.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], casting [[Controlled Blink]] or reading a [[scroll of blinking]] contaminated the player.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], drinking a [[potion of haste]] contaminated the player, and the [[haste]] effect caused contamination over time.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Magic]]\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

The flavour of the spell was that by allowing the character to see slightly into the future, he or she could more deftly dodge blows.\n\n==History==\nWhen the Divinations school was removed in [[0.6]], this spell was removed as well, and the [[Translocations]] spell [[Phase Shift]] introduced to replace it with exactly the same effect, albeit with a different flavour.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

Many choose to follow Xom in the hope of receiving fabulous rewards and mighty powers, but Xom is nothing if not capricious. There is nothing a follower can do to influence Xom's mood.To worship Xom is to live riskily. In a good mood Xom may shower you with gifts, while at other times this capricious god could decide to “spice things up a little” and send you to your doom. If you prove yourself the stronger, so much the better; if not, well, there'll be other playthings... |\n\n[Chaos Knights](/Chaos_Knight \"Chaos Knight\") begin play worshiping Xom.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Racial restrictions](#Racial_restrictions)\n\n- [2 Piety](#Piety)\n\n- [3 Amusement](#Amusement)\n  - [3.1 Interest](#Interest)\n\n- [4 Acts](#Acts)\n\n  - [4.1 \"Good\" Actions](#.22Good.22_Actions)\n  - [4.2 \"Bad\" Actions](#.22Bad.22_Actions)\n  - [4.3 Revival](#Revival)\n  - [4.4 Death Comments](#Death_Comments)\n\n- [5 Gifts](#Gifts)\n\n- [6 Penance](#Penance)\n\n- [7 Trivia](#Trivia)\n\n- [8 History](#History)\n\n- [9 References](#References)\n\n## Racial restrictions\n\n[Demigods](/Demigod \"Demigod\") cannot worship Xom (or any other [god](/God \"God\")).\n\n## Piety\n\nUnlike other gods, there is no way to affect your piety; it is instead randomly changed.\n\nFor Xom, Piety's only use is to determine the niceness and strength of its actions. Xom's niceness depends on your Piety: the chance to perform a \"good\" action is approximately equal to Piety/2 % (this probability is increased during [dangerous situations](/Tension \"Tension\"), like combat, up to 95%). The strength of Xom's actions will depend on how far you are from 100 Piety (in either direction).\n\nPiety starts at 100 and changes by 1 point roughly every 20 turns (about 49% chance to move towards 100 and 51% chance to move away). When Xom acts, there is a 20% chance that your piety will be set to a random amount. Piety can be observed in the ^ screen by watching your favour status, as well as observing the [piety](/Piety \"Piety\") meter.\n\nDepending on your piety, it displays the following messages:\n\n- 0 - 20: A very special plaything of Xom.\n- 21 - 50: A special plaything of Xom.\n- 51 - 80: A plaything of Xom.\n- 81 - 120: A toy of Xom.\n- 121 - 150: A favourite toy of Xom.\n- 151 - 180: A beloved toy of Xom.\n- 181 - 200: Xom's teddy bear.\n\n## Amusement\n\nAnother important aspect of Xom is that it really, really hates being bored. When Xom is bored, Xom will act more often, and its actions will almost always be bad. This is reflected by an \"amusement\" value, which ranges between 0 and 255.\n\nWhen you start worshiping Xom, its amusement is set to between 2 and 80. Every 20 turns, there's a 50% chance that Xom's amusement will be decreased by one, until it reaches 0. When that happens, you'll get a message \"Xom is BORED\", and the bad stuff will start. You'll get a warning when the amusement gets down to 1 (at least 20 turns before it reaches 0): \"Xom is getting BORED\". If your interest reaches zero, your title will always be \"A BORING thing\", regardless of your piety level.\n\nTo avoid boring Xom, you should always try to keep it interested in you. Unfortunately, Xom is mostly amused by things you can't control (like being teleported away in the Abyss when the exit or a rune was in sight) or if you waste useful resources. When Xom finds something funny, its amusement may be rise to a random point depending on how much it enjoyed the event and if the new amusement is higher than its current amusement. You can guess how high the amusement was set by the message provided:\n\n- Xom is interested: 12 - 25\n- Xom is mildly amused: 26 - 50\n- Xom is amused: 51 - 75\n- Xom is highly amused!: 76 - 100\n- Xom thinks this is hilarious!: 101 - 200\n- Xom roars with laughter!: 201 - 255\n\n### Interest\n\nYou can help make Xom more interested in you by doing or being affected by the following things:\n\n- Extreme (255): Using an unknown potion in dangerous combat (and you are more than [XL](/XL \"XL\") 1)[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1) (200), randomly teleporting into a dangerous situation, being banished to [the Abyss](/The_Abyss \"The Abyss\"), being hit by a vulnerable element (200), or being killed by falling down stairs (200).\n- High (128): Mutating (depends on the mutation) or undead rotting. Reading a random \"bad effect\" scroll in dangerous combat ([Scroll of immolation](/Scroll_of_immolation \"Scroll of immolation\"), [Scroll of poison](/Scroll_of_poison \"Scroll of poison\") if the player does not have poison [resistance](/Resistance \"Resistance\"), [Scroll of torment](/Scroll_of_torment \"Scroll of torment\") if the player does not have negative energy or torment [resistance](/Resistance \"Resistance\")) (100). Being killed by disintegration (100). Being significantly hurt by a monster of a far higher or far lower XL than yourself (amusement value varies).\n- Medium (64): Drinking potions of degeneration or berserk rage, having your intellect devoured (50), using an unknown useless or good scroll with a dangerous monster nearby (50) or when hostile monsters accidentally hit each other.\n- Low (16): Successful use of a box of beasts (14), enchanting things, gaining levels, anyone in sight fumbling in shallow water (14), or being drained (15).\n- Minor: Spell miscasts (the level), becoming confused (duration), or sustaining serious injury (varies).\n\nXom is also interested by dangerous and high **[tension](/Tension \"Tension\")** situations and is more likely to intervene or act when these occur. Some examples include fighting many monsters at once, battling a high [HD](/HD \"HD\") monster when your [XL](/XL \"XL\") is low, and being [slowed](/Slow \"Slow\") or [paralyzed](/Paralyzed \"Paralyzed\").\n\n## Acts\n\nEvery 20 turns (for a character with normal speed), Xom will turn its attention towards you, and depending on the situation (from 7% of the time if there are no monsters in view to 33% in the middle of a big fight) may decide to perform either a \"good\" action or a \"bad\" action.\n\nXom's actions will often be in context (i.e. turning you berserk if there's no one around), although nothing is guaranteed. Good actions are more likely if your Piety is high (see below).\n\nBelow is an incomplete list of actions that Xom may perform.\n\n### \"Good\" Actions\n\n- Affect you with a random potion effect[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2):\n\n  - [curing](/Potion_of_curing \"Potion of curing\"), [heal wounds](/Potion_of_heal_wounds \"Potion of heal wounds\"), [magic](/Potion_of_magic \"Potion of magic\"), [haste](/Potion_of_haste \"Potion of haste\"), [might](/Potion_of_might \"Potion of might\"), [brilliance](/Potion_of_brilliance \"Potion of brilliance\"), or [invisibility](/Potion_of_invisibility \"Potion of invisibility\") (12.35%)\n  - [attraction](/Potion_of_attraction \"Potion of attraction\") or [berserk rage](/Potion_of_berserk_rage \"Potion of berserk rage\") (6.17%)\n  - [experience](/Potion_of_experience \"Potion of experience\") (1.23%)\n\n* Only potions that will have an effect are picked (for example, no Magic if the player character is at max MP). These are more likely to occur during combat.\n\n- Make you cast a random spell.\n- [Confuse](/Confusion \"Confusion\") monsters around you. This will not occur if the monster is [nonliving](/Nonliving \"Nonliving\"), plant, has the [Clarity](/Clarity \"Clarity\") intrinsic, or is already confused. [\\[3\\]](#cite_note-3)\n- Summon one or more allies to help you. This is limited by your experience level. (If you are level 15, the maximum number of demons spawned will be 15. [\\[4\\]](#cite_note-4)\n- Gift you an item.\n- Polymorph a random monster around you into a weaker monster (-3 [HD](/HD \"HD\")).\n- Permanently transform a hostile snake enemy into a \"stick\" (any one of the weapons: club, spear, trident, halberd, glaive, quarterstaff, shortbow, longbow, giant club, or giant spiked club). The stick will never be branded, and is not guaranteed to be useful to the player character. The stick's rarity, type and enchantment are influenced by the [HD](/HD \"HD\") of the snake.\n- Swap the position of you and at least one monster near you (confuses the monster 50% of the time). [\\[5\\]](#cite_note-5)\n- Instantly teleport several times, likely up to a relatively safe place.\n- Give you a random good mutation, or many random good mutations. This will reduce your current HP (but no lower than 50% of your max HP), but they can also restore your health to 50% of your max HP if you are below that amount. These go through [mutation resistance](/Mutation_resistance \"Mutation resistance\").\n- Throw a bolt of divine lightning, which explodes around you. There's a chance based on your HP (the lower, the better) that Xom will protect you against it. (\"The area is suffused with divine lightning!\"). [\\[6\\]](#cite_note-6)\n- Prevent you from being banished.\n- Provide you with vision of the current floor or detect items on the floor around you. This can only occur if less than 80% of the level has been explored.\n- Detect monsters. Note that the location of detected monsters is fuzzed.\n- Change the scenery around you. Fountains may begin to gush blood, or doors may randomly burst open and slam shut. [\\[7\\]](#cite_note-7)\n- You start spewing a harmless trail of magical condensation behind you. This does not block [line of sight](/Line_of_sight \"Line of sight\").\n- Polymorph you into a \"good\" form, such as an [ice beast](/Ice_Form \"Ice Form\") or [dragon](/Dragon_Form \"Dragon Form\").\n- Summon friendly monsters to defend you.\n- Cast [Tukima's Dance](/Tukima%27s_Dance \"Tukima's Dance\") on a random monster's weapon. (\"\\[Enemy]'s \\[weapon] dances into the air!\") [\\[8\\]](#cite_note-8)\n- Hurl [fireballs](/Bolt_spells#Bolt_of_Fire \"Bolt spells\") at your foes. This skips adjacent monsters. If Xom is in a bad mood, there is a chance to hurl fireballs at allied monsters. [\\[9\\]](#cite_note-9) There is a 1/3 chance for the fireballs to be fake and have no effect. [\\[10\\]](#cite_note-10)\n\n### \"Bad\" Actions\n\n- Miscast a spell \"through\" the player. Nothing will occur, but this will be indicated through chat messages \"Xom almost notices you.\" \"Xom's attention almost turns to you for a moment.\" \"Xom's power almost touches on you for a moment.\" or \"You almost hear Xom's maniacal laughter.\"\n- Instantly teleport several times, likely up to a relatively dangerous place.\n- Add a [Chaos](/Chaos \"Chaos\") brand and several [slaying](/Slaying \"Slaying\") increases to a random nearby creature's weapons and ammunition. This will not occur if the item is blessed, is a gift from another god, is branded, or is a boulder or throwing net. If the enemy is an orc priest, there is only a 50 percent chance that the priest's weapon will be chaos enchanted. If the enemy is holy (and not a gift from a chaotic god), their weapons cannot be upgraded. [magical staves](/Magical_staff \"Magical staff\") and [unrands](/Unrand \"Unrand\") also cannot be upgraded [\\[11\\]](#cite_note-11) Upon upgrading, the text \"\\[enemy]'s \\[weapon] erupts in a glittering mayhem of colors\" will alert the player to the chaos upgraded weapon.\n- Give you or random/bad mutations or removes them. This will reduce your current HP (but no lower than 50% of your max HP), but they can also restore your health to 50% of your max HP if you are below that amount. These go through [mutation resistance](/Mutation_resistance \"Mutation resistance\").\n- Polymorph a random monster around you into a stronger monster (+2 HD).\n- If stairs (or escape hatches) are in view, they are moved toward you or away from you. For several turns, when you move on a stair or climb up or down a stair, there's a chance that it will slide away from you. This is far more common in the [Abyss](/Abyss \"Abyss\").\n- Poison you.\n- Confuse you. This will never occur if there are no monsters nearby.\n- Make loud [noises](/Noise \"Noise\") at your location, ranging from shouting to shattering the volume (12 to 31). This cannot be affected by [Silence](/Silence \"Silence\").\n- Inflict you with either [draining](/Draining \"Draining\") (25% chance), stat loss as if you drank a [potion of degeneration](/Potion_of_degeneration \"Potion of degeneration\") (50% chance), or [Symbol of Torment](/Symbol_of_Torment \"Symbol of Torment\") (25% chance).\n- Summon hostile [zombies](/Zombie \"Zombie\"), [demons](/Demon \"Demon\"), [shadow creatures](/Shadow_Creatures \"Shadow Creatures\") or [dancing weapons](/Dancing_weapon \"Dancing weapon\") to fight you. The number of shadow creatures or dancing weapons will be between 1 and 4 [\\[12\\]](#cite_note-12), the number of demons is dependent on the intended severity of Xom's action, but limited by experience level (if you are not under penance).[\\[13\\]](#cite_note-13)\n- Banish you to the [Abyss](/Abyss \"Abyss\"). This is internally considered the most severe action Xom can take. The level of the abyss you are banished to depends on the [XL](/XL \"XL\") of the character. This will not occur if the player character is below the minimum experience level, and can only be a \"fake\" banishment. However, if Xom is \"bored\" or if the player character is under penance, then banishment is always allowed and never reverted. [\\[14\\]](#cite_note-14) If Xom is not bored and the player is not under penance, then there is a chance that Xom will immediately revert banishment to the Abyss. (Weight of 30; not an uncommon occurrence)\n- Open a [Malign Gateway](/Malign_Gateway \"Malign Gateway\") near you.\n\nXom's actions and gifts will often seem to be in the spirit of what Xom (with its particularly capricious sense of humor) finds funny. Xom might gift a [gold dragon scales](/Gold_dragon_scales \"Gold dragon scales\") for your [Octopode](/Octopode \"Octopode\"), just to tease you.\n\nIn any case, Xom's actions will never directly kill you unless Xom is bored or you are under penance (a mutation or effect that would reduce a stat to 0 is cancelled, HP damage that would have killed you is cancelled, etc.). However, anything Xom summons is more than capable of killing you.\n\n### Revival\n\nRarely, upon death, Xom may intervene and save your life. This is affected by the [tension](/Tension \"Tension\") of the situation, if Xom considers the death \"worth saving\", and the current mood (piety). This will never happen if your character's max HP is 1, or your XL is 1. Deaths that cannot be considered \"worth saving\" from are deaths from: leaving the dungeon, winning the game, quitting, or self-aimed death. [\\[15\\]](#cite_note-15). Upon being revived, your character will receive anywhere from 1 [HP](/HP \"HP\") to `1 + Max HP/4` HP. Xom is guaranteed to not be bored within the next 10 [auts](/Aut \"Aut\") (gift timeout is set to a minimum of 10) [\\[16\\]](#cite_note-16).\n\n### Death Comments\n\nXom has a chance to comment upon the character's death if it is particularly \"funny\" or \"boring\".[\\[17\\]](#cite_note-17) These will only occur if the death is final, and Xom does not revive the character. A funny death is one where the death is unusual (not killed by a [monster](/Monster \"Monster\"), killed by a [god](/God \"God\") or otherwise [invisible](/Invisible \"Invisible\") actor, [beam](/List_of_spells_by_flag \"List of spells by flag\"), [cloud](/Cloud \"Cloud\"), [freezing](/Freezing \"Freezing\"), [burning](/Fire \"Fire\"), self-aimed, or [trap](/Trap \"Trap\")), having died with [HP](/HP \"HP\") greater than -9, or having had high [tension](/Tension \"Tension\") (more than 19) before the death. Xom will laugh in the post-death screen (\"Xom roars with laughter!\", \"Xom laughs nastily!\" etcetera). A boring death is one where the dead character has down to -2 HP and the situation was of low tension (maximum of 10). Xom will remark that you were boring (\"Xom yawns loudly!\", \"Huh, did I miss anything?\" etcetera). These comments have no effect on gameplay.\n\n## Gifts\n\nXom will occasionally give you gifts as one of its actions. These are delivered purely at random, not based on any Gift Timeout. Xom's gifts can be normal, useful items, but are usually chosen for maximum annoyance. Items range from excellent randarts to large piles of [gold](/Gold \"Gold\") to utter trash ([robe](/Robe \"Robe\") {god gift}). [Randarts](/Randarts \"Randarts\") will sometimes have titles with Xom's name in them (e.g. leather armour of Xom's Amusement).\n\n## Penance\n\n|   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| - | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|   | Unfaithful ex-followers will find themselves suffering through Xom's bad moods for so long as Xom can be bothered to remember about them. Still, Xom's caprice remains; the unfaithful are rewarded just as the faithful are punished. |\n\nIf you leave Xom (voluntarily or not), your penance counter will be set to 50 (quite high!).\n\nWhile under penance, Xom will occasionally punish you by performing a \"bad\" action from the list above. As a true god of chaos, however, there is a 10% chance that Xom will do a \"good\" action instead.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- When using a QWERTY keyboard layout, the name \"Xom\" is simply \"[Zin](/Zin \"Zin\"),\" but with all letters mistyped one key to the right.\n- In one of the books of [Zin](/Zin \"Zin\") (through the [Recite](/Zin#Given_Abilities \"Zin\") ability), there is a chance for the \"sinners\" to be referred to as \"bastard children of Xom\". [\\[18\\]](#cite_note-18)\n- Xom's \"last name\" on its god page is usually \"of Chaos\" (at a 70.175 percent chance of occurring), but can more rarely be any one of 27 other options. This is unique for all gods in Crawl, as all other gods can only have one last name. [\\[19\\]](#cite_note-19)\n  - Most rarely are the last names \"The Xom-Meister, Xom-a-lom-a-ding-dong\", \"The Xom-Meister, Xom-o-Rama\", \"The Xom-Meister, Xom-Xom-bo-Bom, Banana-Fana-fo-Fom\", \"Xom of Unknown Intent\", \"Xom the Fickle\", \"Xom of Unknown Intention\", \"Xom of Swiftly Tilting Intent\", \"Xom of Fickle Intent\", \"Xom of Ineffable Intent\", \"Xom of Gnomic Intent\", each at a 0.50% chance of occurring. [\\[20\\]](#cite_note-20)\n\n## History\n\n- In [0.33](/0.33 \"0.33\"), Xom will get a new effect that hyperbuffs a player's ally.\n\n- Prior to [0.32](/0.32 \"0.32\"), Xom's demon summons didn't scale with [XL](/XL \"XL\") and had fewer options. Also, several new effects were added in 0.32:\n\n  - Xom can haste, slow, or paralyse everyone, including the player\n  - Xom can summon a swarm of [living spells](/Living_spell \"Living spell\") that cast [Force Lance](/Force_Lance \"Force Lance\")\n  - Xom can drain MP, sometimes summoning [brain worms](/Brain_worm \"Brain worm\"), [mana vipers](/Mana_viper \"Mana viper\"), or even [quicksilver elementals](/Quicksilver_elemental \"Quicksilver elemental\"), depending on player's XL.\n\n- Prior to [0.26](/0.26 \"0.26\"), Xom was not stimulated on worship from a [faded altar](/Faded_altar \"Faded altar\") (+200 amusement).\n\n- Prior to [0.25](/0.25 \"0.25\"), Xom could cause miscast effects.\n\n- Prior to [0.24](/0.24 \"0.24\"), Xom could not summon butterflies when you were [tormented](/Torment \"Torment\").\n\n- Prior to [0.21](/0.21 \"0.21\"), eating mutagenic [chunks](/Chunk \"Chunk\") could grant Xom's interest.\n\n- Prior to [0.18](/0.18 \"0.18\"), Xom branded weapon gifts with [chaos](/Chaos \"Chaos\") less often and didn't chaos brand ranged weapons. Drinking potions of poison could also award Xom's interest.\n\n- Prior to [0.17](/0.17 \"0.17\"), drinking potions of decay could award Xom's interest.\n\n- In [0.16](/0.16 \"0.16\"), Xom gained a 'mood' meter on the Crawl interface, in the same place other gods have piety meters.\n\n- Prior to [0.14](/0.14 \"0.14\"), Xom's confusion could surpass 20 turns; this has been capped to 20. Xom's abilities also did not respect [clarity](/Clarity \"Clarity\") and [sustain abilities](/Sustain_abilities \"Sustain abilities\") at all, although Xom may still bypass these abilities if his mood meter is particularly low.\n\n## References\n\n1.

In a good mood Xom may shower you with gifts, while at other times this capricious god could decide to “spice things up a little” and send you to your doom.

Xom's niceness depends on your Piety: the chance to perform a \"good\" action is approximately equal to Piety/2&#160;% (this probability is increased during <a href=\"/Tension\" title=\"Tension\">dangerous situations</a>, like combat, up to 95%). The strength of Xom's actions will depend on how far you are from 100 Piety (in either direction).\n</p><p>Piety starts at 100 and changes by 1 point roughly every 20 turns (about 49% chance to move towards 100 and 51% chance to move away). When Xom acts, there is a 20% chance that your piety will be set to a random amount. Piety can be observed in the ^ screen by watching your favour status, as well as observing the <a href=\"/Piety\" title=\"Piety\">piety</a> meter.\n</p><p>Depending on your piety, it displays the following messages:\n</p>\n<ul><li>0 - 20: A very special plaything of Xom.</li>\n<li>21 - 50: A special plaything of Xom.</li>\n<li>51 - 80: A plaything of Xom.</li>\n<li>81 - 120: A toy of Xom.</li>\n<li>121 - 150: A favourite toy of Xom.</li>\n<li>151 - 180: A beloved toy of Xom.</li>\n<li>181 - 200: Xom's teddy bear.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Amusement\">Amusement</span></h2>\n<p>Another important aspect of Xom is that it really, really hates being bored. When Xom is bored, Xom will act more often, and its actions will almost always be bad. This is reflected by an \"amusement\" value, which ranges between 0 and 255.\n</p><p>When you start worshiping Xom, its amusement is set to between 2 and 80. Every 20 turns, there's a 50% chance that Xom's amusement will be decreased by one, until it reaches 0. When that happens, you'll get a message \"Xom is BORED\", and the bad stuff will start. You'll get a warning when the amusement gets down to 1 (at least 20 turns before it reaches 0): \"Xom is getting BORED\". If your interest reaches zero, your title will always be \"A BORING thing\", regardless of your piety level.\n</p><p>To avoid boring Xom, you should always try to keep it interested in you. Unfortunately, Xom is mostly amused by things you can't control (like being teleported away in the Abyss when the exit or a rune was in sight) or if you waste useful resources. When Xom finds something funny, its amusement may be rise to a random point depending on how much it enjoyed the event and if the new amusement is higher than its current amusement. You can guess how high the amusement was set by the message provided:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Xom is interested: 12 - 25   </li>\n<li>Xom is mildly amused: 26 - 50</li>\n<li>Xom is amused: 51 - 75</li>\n<li>Xom is highly amused!: 76 - 100</li>\n<li>Xom thinks this is hilarious!: 101 - 200</li>\n<li>Xom roars with laughter!: 201 - 255</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Interest\">Interest</span></h3>\n<p>You can help make Xom more interested in you by doing or being affected by the following things:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Extreme (255): Using an unknown potion in dangerous combat (and you are more than <a href=\"/XL\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"XL\">XL</a> 1)<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> (200), randomly teleporting into a dangerous situation, being banished to <a href=\"/The_Abyss\" title=\"The Abyss\">the Abyss</a>, being hit by a vulnerable element (200), or being killed by falling down stairs (200).</li>\n<li>High (128): Mutating (depends on the mutation) or undead rotting. Reading a random \"bad effect\" scroll in dangerous combat (<a href=\"/Scroll_of_immolation\" title=\"Scroll of immolation\">Scroll of immolation</a>, <a href=\"/Scroll_of_poison\" title=\"Scroll of poison\">Scroll of poison</a> if the player does not have poison <a href=\"/Resistance\" title=\"Resistance\">resistance</a>, <a href=\"/Scroll_of_torment\" title=\"Scroll of torment\">Scroll of torment</a> if the player does not have negative energy or torment <a href=\"/Resistance\" title=\"Resistance\">resistance</a>) (100). Being killed by disintegration (100).

A boring death is one where the dead character has down to -2 HP and the situation was of low tension (maximum of 10).

page is about the [[Religion|god]]. For the removed [[card]], see [[Xom card]]''.\n\n[[File:Xom altar.png]] ''\"A new plaything!\"''\n\n{{flavour|Xom is a wild and unpredictable god of chaos, who seeks not worshippers but playthings with which to toy. Many choose to follow Xom in the hope of receiving fabulous rewards and mighty powers, but Xom is nothing if not capricious. There is nothing a follower can do to influence Xom's mood.\n\nTo worship Xom is to live riskily. In a good mood Xom may shower you with gifts, while at other times this capricious god could decide to “spice things up a little” and send you to your doom. If you prove yourself the stronger, so much the better; if not, well, there'll be other playthings...}}\n\n[[Chaos Knight]]s begin play worshiping Xom.\n\n==Racial restrictions==\n[[Demigod]]s cannot worship Xom (or any other [[god]]).\n\n==Piety==\nUnlike other gods, there is no way to affect your piety; it is instead randomly changed.  \n\nFor Xom, Piety's only use is to determine the niceness and strength of its actions. Xom's niceness depends on your Piety: the chance to perform a \"good\" action is approximately equal to Piety/2 % (this probability is increased during [[tension|dangerous situations]], like combat, up to 95%). The strength of Xom's actions will depend on how far you are from 100 Piety (in either direction).\n\nPiety starts at 100 and changes by 1 point roughly every 20 turns (about 49% chance to move towards 100 and 51% chance to move away). When Xom acts, there is a 20% chance that your piety will be set to a random amount. Piety can be observed in the ^ screen by watching your favour status, as well as observing the [[piety]] meter.\n\nDepending on your piety, it displays the following messages:\n*0 - 20: A very special plaything of Xom.\n*21 - 50: A special plaything of Xom.\n*51 - 80: A plaything of Xom.\n*81 - 120: A toy of Xom.\n*121 - 150: A favourite toy of Xom.\n*151 - 180: A beloved toy of Xom.\n*181 - 200: Xom's teddy bear.\n\n==Amusement==\nAnother important aspect of Xom is that it really, really hates being bored. When Xom is bored, Xom will act more often, and its actions will almost always be bad. This is reflected by an \"amusement\" value, which ranges between 0 and 255.\n\nWhen you start worshiping Xom, its amusement is set to between 2 and 80. Every 20 turns, there's a 50% chance that Xom's amusement will be decreased by one, until it reaches 0. When that happens, you'll get a message \"Xom is BORED\", and the bad stuff will start. You'll get a warning when the amusement gets down to 1 (at least 20 turns before it reaches 0): \"Xom is getting BORED\". If your interest reaches zero, your title will always be \"A BORING thing\", regardless of your piety level.\n\nTo avoid boring Xom, you should always try to keep it interested in you. Unfortunately, Xom is mostly amused by things you can't control (like being teleported away in the Abyss when the exit or a rune was in sight) or if you waste useful resources. When Xom finds something funny, its amusement may be rise to a random point depending on how much it enjoyed the event and if the new amusement is higher than its current amusement. You can guess how high the amusement was set by the message provided:\n\n*Xom is interested: 12 - 25   \n*Xom is mildly amused: 26 - 50\n*Xom is amused: 51 - 75\n*Xom is highly amused!: 76 - 100\n*Xom thinks this is hilarious!: 101 - 200\n*Xom roars with laughter!: 201 - 255\n\n===Interest===\nYou can help make Xom more interested in you by doing or being affected by the following things:\n\n*Extreme (255): Using an unknown potion in dangerous combat (and you are more than [[XL]] 1)<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|item-use.cc|3055}}</ref> (200), randomly teleporting into a dangerous situation, being banished to [[the Abyss]], being hit by a vulnerable element (200), or being killed by falling down stairs (200).\n*High (128): Mutating (depends on the mutation) or undead rotting. Reading a random \"bad effect\" scroll in dangerous combat ([[Scroll of immolation]], [[Scroll of poison]] if the player does not have poison [[Resistance|resistance]], [[Scroll of torment]] if the player does not have negative energy or torment [[Resistance|resistance]]) (100). Being killed by disintegration (100). Being significantly hurt by a monster of a far higher or far lower XL than yourself (amusement value varies). \n*Medium (64): Drinking potions of degeneration or berserk rage, having your intellect devoured (50), using an unknown useless or good scroll with a dangerous monster nearby (50) or when hostile monsters accidentally hit each other.\n*Low (16): Successful use of a box of beasts (14), enchanting things, gaining levels, anyone in sight fumbling in shallow water (14), or being drained (15).\n*Minor: Spell miscasts (the level), becoming confused (duration), or sustaining serious injury (varies).\n\nXom is also interested by dangerous and high '''[[tension]]''' situations and is more likely to intervene or act when these occur. Some examples include fighting many monsters at once, battling a high [[HD]] monster when your [[XL]] is low, and being [[slow]]ed or [[paralyzed]].\n\n==Acts==\nEvery 20 turns (for a character with normal speed), Xom will turn its attention towards you, and depending on the situation (from 7% of the time if there are no monsters in view to 33% in the middle of a big fight) may decide to perform either a \"good\" action or a \"bad\" action.\n\nXom's actions will often be in context (i.e. turning you berserk if there's no one around), although nothing is guaranteed. Good actions are more likely if your Piety is high (see below).\n\nBelow is an incomplete list of actions that Xom may perform.\n\n===\"Good\" Actions===\n*Affect you with a random potion effect<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|899}}</ref>:\n**[[potion of curing|curing]], [[potion of heal wounds|heal wounds]], [[potion of magic|magic]], [[potion of haste|haste]], [[potion of might|might]], [[potion of brilliance|brilliance]], or [[potion of invisibility|invisibility]] (12.35%)\n**[[potion of attraction|attraction]] or [[potion of berserk rage|berserk rage]] (6.17%)\n**[[potion of experience|experience]] (1.23%)\n:Only potions that will have an effect are picked (for example, no Magic if the player character is at max MP). These are more likely to occur during combat.\n*Make you cast a random spell.\n*[[Confusion|Confuse]] monsters around you. This will not occur if the monster is [[nonliving]], plant, has the [[Clarity]] intrinsic, or is already confused. <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|930}}</ref>\n*Summon one or more allies to help you. This is limited by your experience level. (If you are level 15, the maximum number of demons spawned will be 15. <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|982}}</ref>\n*Gift you an item.\n*Polymorph a random monster around you into a weaker monster (-3 [[HD]]).\n*Permanently transform a hostile snake enemy into a \"stick\" (any one of the weapons: club, spear, trident, halberd, glaive, quarterstaff, shortbow, longbow, giant club, or giant spiked club). The stick will never be branded, and is not guaranteed to be useful to the player character. The stick's rarity, type and enchantment are influenced by the [[HD]] of the snake. \n*Swap the position of you and at least one monster near you (confuses the monster 50% of the time). <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|1173}}</ref>\n*Instantly teleport several times, likely up to a relatively safe place.\n*Give you a random good mutation, or many random good mutations. This will reduce your current HP (but no lower than 50% of your max HP), but they can also restore your health to 50% of your max HP if you are below that amount. These go through [[mutation resistance]].\n*Throw a bolt of divine lightning, which explodes around you. There's a chance based on your HP (the lower, the better) that Xom will protect you against it. (\"The area is suffused with divine lightning!\"). <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|1402}}</ref>\n*Prevent you from being banished.\n*Provide you with vision of the current floor or detect items on the floor around you. This can only occur if less than 80% of the level has been explored. \n*Detect monsters. Note that the location of detected monsters is fuzzed.\n*Change the scenery around you. Fountains may begin to gush blood, or doors may randomly burst open and slam shut. <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|1536}}</ref>\n*You start spewing a harmless trail of magical condensation behind you. This does not block [[line of sight]].\n*Polymorph you into a \"good\" form, such as an [[Ice Form|ice beast]] or [[Dragon Form|dragon]].\n*Summon friendly monsters to defend you.\n*Cast [[Tukima's Dance]] on a random monster's weapon. (\"[Enemy]'s [weapon] dances into the air!\") <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|1288}}</ref>\n*Hurl [[Bolt spells#Bolt of Fire|fireballs]] at your foes. This skips adjacent monsters. If Xom is in a bad mood, there is a chance to hurl fireballs at allied monsters. <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|1653}}</ref> There is a 1/3 chance for the fireballs to be fake and have no effect. <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|2818}}</ref>\n\n===\"Bad\" Actions===\n*Miscast a spell \"through\" the player. Nothing will occur, but this will be indicated through chat messages \"Xom almost notices you.\" \"Xom's attention almost turns to you for a moment.\" \"Xom's power almost touches on you for a moment.\" or \"You almost hear Xom's maniacal laughter.\"\n*Instantly teleport several times, likely up to a relatively dangerous place.\n*Add a [[Chaos]] brand and several [[slaying]] increases to a random nearby creature's weapons and ammunition. This will not occur if the item is blessed, is a gift from another god, is branded, or is a boulder or throwing net. If the enemy is an orc priest, there is only a 50 percent chance that the priest's weapon will be chaos enchanted. If the enemy is holy (and not a gift from a chaotic god), their weapons cannot be upgraded. [[Magical staff|magical staves]] and [[unrand]]s also cannot be upgraded <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|682}}</ref> Upon upgrading, the text \"[enemy]'s [weapon] erupts in a glittering mayhem of colors\" will alert the player to the chaos upgraded weapon. \n*Give you or random/bad mutations or removes them. This will reduce your current HP (but no lower than 50% of your max HP), but they can also restore your health to 50% of your max HP if you are below that amount. These go through [[mutation resistance]].\n*Polymorph a random monster around you into a stronger monster (+2 HD).\n*If stairs (or escape hatches) are in view, they are moved toward you or away from you. For several turns, when you move on a stair or climb up or down a stair, there's a chance that it will slide away from you. This is far more common in the [[Abyss]].\n*Poison you.\n*Confuse you. This will never occur if there are no monsters nearby. \n*Make loud [[noise]]s at your location, ranging from shouting to shattering the volume (12 to 31). This cannot be affected by [[Silence]].\n*Inflict you with either [[draining]] (25% chance), stat loss as if you drank a [[potion of degeneration]] (50% chance), or [[Symbol of Torment]] (25% chance).\n*Summon hostile [[Zombie|zombies]], [[Demon|demons]], [[Shadow Creatures|shadow creatures]] or [[Dancing weapon|dancing weapons]] to fight you. The number of shadow creatures or dancing weapons will be between 1 and 4 <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|2452}}</ref>, the number of demons is dependent on the intended severity of Xom's action, but limited by experience level (if you are not under penance).<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|2475}}</ref>\n*Banish you to the [[Abyss]]. This is internally considered the most severe action Xom can take. The level of the abyss you are banished to depends on the [[XL]] of the character. This will not occur if the player character is below the minimum experience level, and can only be a \"fake\" banishment. However, if Xom is \"bored\" or if the player character is under penance, then banishment is always allowed and never reverted. <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|2514}}</ref> If Xom is not bored and the player is not under penance, then there is a chance that Xom will immediately revert banishment to the Abyss. (Weight of 30; not an uncommon occurrence) \n*Open a [[Malign Gateway]] near you.\n\nXom's actions and gifts will often seem to be in the spirit of what Xom (with its particularly capricious sense of humor) finds funny. Xom might gift a [[gold dragon scales]] for your [[Octopode]], just to tease you.\n\nIn any case, Xom's actions will never directly kill you unless Xom is bored or you are under penance (a mutation or effect that would reduce a stat to 0 is cancelled, HP damage that would have killed you is cancelled, etc.). However, anything Xom summons is more than capable of killing you.\n\n===Revival===\nRarely, upon death, Xom may intervene and save your life. This is affected by the [[tension]] of the situation, if Xom considers the death \"worth saving\", and the current mood (piety). This will never happen if your character's max HP is 1, or your XL is 1. Deaths that cannot be considered \"worth saving\" from are deaths from: leaving the dungeon, winning the game, quitting, or self-aimed death. <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|3235}}</ref>. Upon being revived, your character will receive anywhere from 1 [[HP]] to <code>1 + Max HP/4</code> HP. Xom is guaranteed to not be bored within the next 10 [[aut]]s (gift timeout is set to a minimum of 10) <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|3319}}</ref>.\n\n===Death Comments===\nXom has a chance to comment upon the character's death if it is particularly \"funny\" or \"boring\".<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|xom.cc|3210}}</ref> These will only occur if the death is final, and Xom does not revive the character. A funny death is one where the death is unusual (not killed by a [[Monster|monster]], killed by a [[God|god]] or otherwise [[Invisible|invisible]] actor, [[List of spells by flag|beam]], [[Cloud|cloud]], [[Freezing|freezing]], [[Fire|burning]], self-aimed, or [[Trap|trap]]), having died with [[HP]] greater than -9, or having had high [[Tension|tension]] (more than 19) before the death. Xom will laugh in the post-death screen (\"Xom roars with laughter!\", \"Xom laughs nastily!\" etcetera). A boring death is one where the dead character has down to -2 HP and the situation was of low tension (maximum of 10). Xom will remark that you were boring (\"Xom yawns loudly!\", \"Huh, did I miss anything?\" etcetera). These comments have no effect on gameplay.\n\n==Gifts==\nXom will occasionally give you gifts as one of its actions. These are delivered purely at random, not based on any Gift Timeout. Xom's gifts can be normal, useful items, but are usually chosen for maximum annoyance. Items range from excellent randarts to large piles of [[gold]] to utter trash ([[robe]] {god gift}). [[Randarts]] will sometimes have titles with Xom's name in them (e.g. leather armour of Xom's Amusement).\n\n==Penance==\n{{flavour|Unfaithful ex-followers will find themselves suffering through Xom's bad moods for so long as Xom can be bothered to remember about them. Still, Xom's caprice remains; the unfaithful are rewarded just as the faithful are punished.}}\n\nIf you leave Xom (voluntarily or not), your penance counter will be set to 50 (quite high!).\n\nWhile under penance, Xom will occasionally punish you by performing a \"bad\" action from the list above. As a true god of chaos, however, there is a 10% chance that Xom will do a \"good\" action instead.\n\n==Trivia==\n*When using a QWERTY keyboard layout, the name \"Xom\" is simply \"[[Zin]],\" but with all letters mistyped one key to the right.\n*In one of the books of [[Zin]] (through the [[Zin#Given Abilities|Recite]] ability), there is a chance for the \"sinners\" to be referred to as \"bastard children of Xom\". <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|god-abil.cc|487}}</ref>\n*Xom's \"last name\" on its god page is usually \"of Chaos\" (at a 70.175 percent chance of occurring), but can more rarely be any one of 27 other options. This is unique for all gods in Crawl, as all other gods can only have one last name. <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|dat/database/godname.txt|1}}</ref>\n**Most rarely are the last names \"The Xom-Meister, Xom-a-lom-a-ding-dong\", \"The Xom-Meister, Xom-o-Rama\", \"The Xom-Meister, Xom-Xom-bo-Bom, Banana-Fana-fo-Fom\", \"Xom of Unknown Intent\", \"Xom the Fickle\", \"Xom of Unknown Intention\", \"Xom of Swiftly Tilting Intent\", \"Xom of Fickle Intent\", \"Xom of Ineffable Intent\", \"Xom of Gnomic Intent\", each at a 0.50% chance of occurring. <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|dat/database/godname.txt|92}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.33|Xom will get a new effect that hyperbuffs a player's ally.}}\n*Prior to [[0.32]], Xom's demon summons didn't scale with [[XL]] and had fewer options. Also, several new effects were added in 0.32:\n**Xom can haste, slow, or paralyse everyone, including the player\n**Xom can summon a swarm of [[living spell]]s that cast [[Force Lance]]\n**Xom can drain MP, sometimes summoning [[brain worm]]s, [[mana viper]]s, or even [[quicksilver elemental]]s, depending on player's XL.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Xom was not stimulated on worship from a [[faded altar]] (+200 amusement).\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Xom could cause miscast effects.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], Xom could not summon butterflies when you were [[torment]]ed.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], eating mutagenic [[chunk]]s could grant Xom's interest.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Xom branded weapon gifts with [[chaos]] less often and didn't chaos brand ranged weapons. Drinking potions of poison could also award Xom's interest.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], drinking potions of decay could award Xom's interest.\n*In [[0.16]], Xom gained a 'mood' meter on the Crawl interface, in the same place other gods have piety meters.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Xom's confusion could surpass 20 turns; this has been capped to 20. Xom's abilities also did not respect [[clarity]] and [[sustain abilities]] at all, although Xom may still bypass these abilities if his mood meter is particularly low.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{gods}}\n[[Category:Chaotic Gods]]"}

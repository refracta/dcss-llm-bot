Each draconian has a colour, and some have occupations as well; the different colors determine their [[draconian breath attack]]s and resistances, while the occupations determine their equipment, skills, and spells. Fortunately, they are all [[cold-blooded]] creatures and will be [[slow]]ed by weapons of [[freezing]] (unless [[cold resistance|cold resistant]]).\n\n==Draconian Colours & Breath Attacks==\n{{flavour|A scale-covered humanoid with a reptilian tail and small wings.}}\n\n{{Brown|d}} [[File:Draconian (monster).png]] '''[[Draconian (monster)|Draconian]]''' - Immature draconians with no breath attack. If you see one, it's probably a [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]] in disguise.\n\n{{monsterlink|Black draconian}} - Flight-capable draconians that breathe highly-damaging bursts of [[electricity]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Green draconian}} - [[Poison]]ous draconians that have stinger tails and can breathe [[cloud]]s of poison.\n\n{{monsterlink|Grey draconian}} - These draconians lack breath weapons but have more AC, hit harder, and do not drown.\n\n{{monsterlink|Pale draconian}} - Draconians that breathe jets of [[steam]], which don't do much damage but block line of sight.\n\n{{monsterlink|Purple draconian}} - Occult draconians that are quite resistant to magic and breathe blasts of irresistible, enchantment-stripping energy.\n\n{{monsterlink|Red draconian}} - [[Fire|Fiery]] draconians that spew blasts of fire that leave behind clouds of flames.\n\n{{monsterlink|White draconian}} - Frosty draconians with [[AC]]-piercing [[cold]] breath. Their icy nature negates the side-effects of their cold-blooded physiology.\n\n{{monsterlink|Yellow draconian}} - Draconians that will melt your equipment with their [[acid]] breath.\n\n==Draconian Occupations==\n{{monsterlink|Draconian annihilator}} - [[Conjurations]] masters capable of causing devastation at range.\n\n{{monsterlink|Draconian knight}} - Skilled with both weapons and spells, draconian knights are competent opponents.\n\n{{monsterlink|Draconian monk}} - These [[Unarmed Combat]] specialists strike quickly and hard in melee.\n\n{{monsterlink|Draconian scorcher}} - Pyromaniac casters with access to both [[fire]] and [[damnation]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Draconian shifter}} - [[Translocations]] experts who blink both themselves and their allies around a lot.

Her skill in battle and ability to [[Summon Hydra]]s are dangerous enough, but wounding her will force her to unleash her true form...\n\n{{monsterlink|Tiamat}} - Found only in [[the Realm of Zot]], Tiamat is a brutally powerful opponent. She changes her colour randomly and wears the powerful [[dragonskin cloak]], giving her a wide range of resistances. She always travels with a large entourage of lesser draconians.\n\n==Removed draconians==\n{{monsterlink|Mottled draconian}} - Draconians that spat gouts of [[Sticky Flame]], setting their foes ablaze.\n\n{{monsterlink|Draconian zealot}} - Servants of a dark god that could summon demons, raise the dead, and hurl hellfire.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], classed draconians could randomly spawn with varying colours.\n*Mottled draconians and draconian zealots were removed in [[0.20]].\n*[[0.20]] also introduced draconian stormcallers by merging zealots with the old draconian callers.\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

In its raw form it does not provide much protection, but by magical means it may be used to make excellent armour.}}\n\n'''Pearl dragon hide''' is a fairly unimpressive piece of body [[armour]], inferior to [[leather armour]] and providing no special resistances. However, you can upgrade it to an impressive suit of [[pearl dragon armour]] by [[scroll of enchant armour|enchanting]] it, improving its [[AC]] tremendously and adding a rank of [[negative energy resistance]]. Although these hides are extremely rare, you can also produce them by butchering an (equally rare and rather dangerous) [[pearl dragon]]'s [[corpse]].\n\n==History==\n*Pearl dragon hides were removed in [[0.19]].\n*Pearl dragon hides were added in [[0.8]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Hide''' || [[File:Pearl dragon hide.png]]\n|-\n| '''Armour''' || [[File:Pearl dragon armour.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

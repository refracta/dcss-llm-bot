Finally, [[Infusion (spell)|Infusion]] inspired the [[Infusion (ego)|glove ego]] introduced in [[0.28]]. All four spells were removed.\n**[[Song of Slaying]] was renamed to [[Wereblood]] and moved to [[Transmutations]].\n**[[Ozocubu's Armour]], [[Excruciating Wounds]] and [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere]] had their Charms aspect removed, and were altered in the process. [[Death's Door]] became a level 9 pure Necromancy spell.\n*In [[0.25]], [[Regeneration]] was removed.\n*In [[0.19]], the [[Haste]] spell was removed.\n*In [[0.17]], [[Control Teleport]], along with the intrinsic, was removed.\n*Many Charms spells were also removed, over time. Examples include weapon [[brand]]ing spells (like [[Fire Brand]]), ones that gave resistances or intrinsics (like [[Insulation]]), and [[Extension]].\n*In [[0.8]], the [[Enchantments]] school was split in order to create Charms and Hexes.\n\n{{Skills}}\n\n[[Category:Charms|*]]\n[[Category:Magic skills]]"}

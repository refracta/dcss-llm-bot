{"title":"Poisoned","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Poisoned","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''This is about the [[brand]]. For the status, see [[Poison]].''\n{{flavour|It is coated with poison.}}\n\n'''Poisoned''' is a [[brand]] that [[dart]]s may have. Such throwing weapons will usually poison any non-resistant [[monster]]s they hit. Poisoning a target multiple times will strengthen the effect, causing it to deal more damage per turn and take longer to run its course.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Poison is strong in the early Dungeon. One dart can kill most D:1 monsters. Multiple darts can soften all sorts of enemies before they get into melee. You don't need any Throwing skill to take advantage of them.\n*Poison works very well with a [[scroll of immolation]] (or [[Inner Flame]]). Every time poison damages a monster with Inner Flame, a [[flame cloud]] is created on the monster, greatly increasing the damage output. Plus, you'll get all the explosions at the end.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.24]], [[javelin]]s and [[tomahawk]]s could spawn with this brand.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], [[The Shining One]] disapproved of the use of poisoned weapons.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], [[arrow]]s, [[bolt]]s, and [[sling bullet]]s could have this brand.\n\n{{brands}}\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

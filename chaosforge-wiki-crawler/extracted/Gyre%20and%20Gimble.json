Swinging one compels the wielder to swing the other, as if they have minds of their own.}}\n\n[[File:Gyre and Gimble.png]] '''''the +8 pair of quick blades \"Gyre\" and \"Gimble\"'''''\n\n+8 [[quick blade]]\n\n[[Protection]] [[brand]]<br>\nEach swing attacks four times<br>\n[[Handedness|Two-handed]] (except for [[Formicid]]s)\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Gyre and Gimble'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|1431}}</ref> are an unusual weapon - thematically two weapons, they are treated as a single two-handed weapon that happens to attack four times per command (twice that of normal quick blades). With up to 8 attacks per 1 decaAut, Gyre and Gimble take the strengths of Short Blades to an extreme - they are impacted more by 'flat' bonuses and enemy [[AC]].\n\n*Flat bonuses, like [[slaying]], are amplified: dealing +1 damage/hit is four times as good if you attack four times as fast. Unfortunately, Gyre and Gimble, as protection weapons, are unable to benefit from flat damage brands like [[electrocution]] or [[pain (brand)|pain]].\n**Note that Gyre and Gimble can only perform 2 sets of [[auxiliary attack]]s per swing. Having an aux attack with G&G is as effective as any ordinary quick blade, which is still ''good'', just not twice-as-good.\n*Conversely, enemy [[AC]] reduces damage by a flat amount. You'll tear through low-AC monsters, but high-AC threats will often shrug off the blows. You can get past this by [[stab]]bing opponents or with liberal use of [[might]] and/or [[berserk]].\n\nAs Short Blades, Gyre and Gimble are great at [[stab]]bing. A reliable, renewable way to stab ([[Hexes]], [[Mephitic Cloud]], [[Uskayaw]]...) can turn G&G into a phenomenally deadly weapon; [[Confusing Touch]] works especially well.\n\nThese stratagems apply to all Short Blades, not just Gyre and Gimble. Their main advantage is doubled attack speed - more power in exchange for the shield slot. A well-branded, fully-enchanted quick blade with a [[shield]] may be the smarter choice. [[Formicid]]s, of course, don't have to worry about losing their shield slot, but whether they'd prefer Gyre and Gimble over a heavy two-handed weapon is another question.\n\n==Trivia==\nGyre and Gimble are a reference to the poem \"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabberwocky Jabberwocky]\" by Lewis Carrol.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Gyre and Gimble only made 2 attacks per swing, as regular [[quick blade]]s only made 1 attack per swing. However, all quick blades (including G&G) had lower attack delays, and Gyre and Gimble had a +12 enchantment.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Gyre and Gimble had a +7 enchantment.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], Gyre and Gimble had a +5 enchantment, the [[vorpal]] brand, and a -3 penalty to [[dexterity]].\n*Gyre and Gimble were added in [[0.16]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Short blades]]\n[[Category:Unrands]]"}

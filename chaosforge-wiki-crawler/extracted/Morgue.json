{"title":"Morgue","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Morgue","type":"raw","data":"The '''morgue''' is a folder of '''morgue files''' ('''character dumps'''); .txt files that give a summation of everything that happened during your game. It stores both current information, like inventory and skills, and a history of actions, levels, and notes. The [[rcfile]] gives more options as to what is and isn't logged as a note. Sharing a morgue after a particularly gruesome [[death]] is both an informative and entertaining thing to do, though you can generate a morgue file for living characters, too.\n\nYou can update your morgue file by pressing '''#'''. In addition, the # command will either print a link to your morgue (online) or the directory to your morgue folder (offline).\n\nMorgue files are not to be confused with a bones file, which is used to generate [[player ghost]]s."}

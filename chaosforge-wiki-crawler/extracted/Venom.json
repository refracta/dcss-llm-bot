{"title":"Venom","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Venom","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''This page is about the [[Brand|weapon brand]]. For the removed card, see [[Venom card]].''\n{{flavour|It poisons victims.}}\n\nThe '''venom''' [[brand]] inflicts [[poison]] on the target, dealing damage over time.\n\nPoison works differently for players and monsters. Each attack from a venom weapon has a 75% chance to do the following, depending on target:\n\n* '''Players attacking monsters:''' The venom brand deals <code>1 + (4 + 1d8 + 1d<1.5 * dam>)/7</code> \"[[Poison#Monster Formula|stacks]]\" of poison, for dam = damage from the weapon itself.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|attack.cc|1331}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|monster.cc|4005}}</ref> For example, a 1 damage hit can inflict 1-2 stacks of poison. Monsters can be affected by a max. of 4 stacks at a time. For more detail on poison stacks, see the [[Poison#Monster Formula|Poison]] article.\n\n* '''Monsters attacking players:''' Inflicts poison equal to <code>4 + 1d8 + 1d(1.5 * dam)</code> HP. There is no stack system - by the time the poison ends, you'll lose the listed amount of HP.\n\nThe base chance to inflict poison is 75%. Having poison resistance reduces this chance to 25%; rPois doesn't reduce the amount of poison otherwise. Poison immune creatures, like the [[undead]] and the [[nonliving]], are completely unaffected by this brand.\n\n==Strategy==\nVery strong for the early game, since poison doesn't care much about weapon strength; a +0 [[dagger]] can inflict max poison in 2-3 hits. Therefore. daggers, [[short sword]]s, [[whip]]s, and other weapons of venom are great early finds. Even with minimal skill investment, venom is effective at killing most non-resistant enemies in early [[Dungeon]].\n\nHowever, venom falls off by the mid game. While poison is great in [[Spider's Nest|Spider]], in branches like [[Snake]] and [[Swamp]], poison resistance is common. And, since poison damage doesn't care much about weapon strength, it starts to feel lacking by [[Vaults]] and [[Depths]].\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Against melee enemies, inflicting max poison, then backing off, is a strong tactic - even when considering [[attacks of opportunity]]. Ways to [[kite]] enemies are valuable as a result. [[Swiftness]] and [[Blink]] allow you to escape from melee range, avoiding the extra attacks.\n*Combos well with [[Ignite Poison]], a spell that converts poison into instant fire damage. You can attack a few times with venom, reach max poison stacks, then cast Ignite Poison for 8d13 AC- and EV- ignoring damage.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.18]], poison resistant monsters were completely immune to the venom brand.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{brands}}\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

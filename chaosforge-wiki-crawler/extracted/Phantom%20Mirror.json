For the monster-only spell, see [[Phantom Mirror (spell)]].''\n{{item\n |itemtype=Miscellaneous item\n |name=Phantom mirror\n |cost=\n |weight=\n}}\n{{flavour|A hand mirror which can create a reflection of a nearby creature, clouding in the process. The reflection's duration increases with Evocations skill and decreases with the willpower of the target. It is, invariably, slightly weaker than the creature it mirrors.}}\n\nEvoking a '''phantom mirror''' allows you to summon an exact duplicate of a single non-player target. The illusion spawns [[drain]]ed, with only 2/3 of the base [[HD]] of the mirrored monster. You can use the phantom mirror on any non-tentacle creature in the game. The illusion's duration increases with your [[Evocations]] skill and decreases with monster [[willpower]], with a minimum of 9 turns. \n\nThe mirror becomes inert after one use; it can be recharged by gaining experience. Like with other miscellaneous evocables, only 1 phantom mirror will spawn in a given game.\n\n===Duration===\nSpecifically, an illusion's duration can be calculated as follows:\n\n* Duration class = <code>([[Evocations]]/4 + 1) * (100 - check_willpower) / 100</code>, with a minimum of 1 duration class (this is not equal to turns).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|evoke.cc|564}}</ref> \n* \"check_willpower\" is the same function used for other [[Willpower#Resisting enchantments|willpower checks]]. The power of the mirror is equal to <code>(5 + 3 * Evocations)</code>,<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|evoke.cc|563}}</ref> so check_willpower equals <code>[[willpower]] - (5 + 3 * Evocations) + 102 - 1d100 - 1d101</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|actor.cc|121}}</ref> If a target has infinite willpower, check_willpower is set to 100, meaning (100 - check_willpower) = 0. \n: This means that, if a target has at least 99 + (5 + 3 * Evocations) willpower, you will always get a minimum duration summon.\n* Duration class is defined in the [[Summon#Duration|Summons]] page. At 1 duration class, the summon lasts 9 turns.\n\n==Strategy==\nHaving a spare ally can be very helpful, especially when you're fighting powerful [[unique]]s. You can clone just about any monster, including the likes of [[the Lernaean hydra]] and [[Cerebov]]. \n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], phantom mirrors were one-use items and didn't recharge with XP. Also, it was impossible to create copies of enemies hated by your god.\n*Phantom mirrors were added in [[0.16]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Evocables}}"}

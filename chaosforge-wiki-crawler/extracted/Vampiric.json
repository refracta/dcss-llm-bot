{"title":"Vampiric","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Vampiric","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|It inflicts no extra harm, but heals its wielder when it wounds a living foe.}}\nThe '''vampiric''' [[brand]], not to be confused with [[draining (brand)|draining]], does the following:\n*Has a 60% chance per swing to heal you for <code>1d(damage)</code>, if you hurt a living or plant monster ([[:Category:Natural_holiness|natural]] or [[:Category:Plant_holiness|plant]] [[holiness]]) that isn't resistant to [[negative energy]]. \n\nUse of this brand is considered to be [[Necromancy]], so the [[good god]]s forbid its use.\n\nA few [[unrand]] artefacts have special properties. [[Leech]] activates 100% of the time. [[Vampire's Tooth]] activates at the normal rate, but always heals for the full amount possible.\n\n==Attack Flavour==\n[[:Category:Vampiric_flavour|Certain monsters]] have innate vampiric attacks that are slightly different from the weapon brand. These attacks can heal the attacker only if the defender can [[blood|bleed]]. This means that the following player conditions will prevent the monster's vampiric attacks from providing healing:\n*Being [[nonliving]] ([[Djinni]], [[Gargoyle]], or in [[Statue Form]] and [[Storm Form]])\n*Being [[undead]] ([[Mummy]], [[Ghoul]], bloodless [[Vampire]], or in [[Death Form]])\n*Negative energy resistance; rN+++ negates healing entirely\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While vampiricism deals no extra damage, it gives rapid healing, making it a strong brand in its own right. It's often considered to be a top-tier brand, at least before [[extended]] (most monsters in extended are immune to this brand).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], [[plants]] and players in [[Tree Form]] were immune to vampiric attacks.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], wielding a vampiric weapon incurred a significant initial hunger cost, and such weapons could only be wielded when the user was at least Full.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], this brand activated on 80% of attacks.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], this brand was safer when found on sharp weapons, since blunt weapons didn't allow you to butcher corpses.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], vampiric weapons massively increased the hunger cost for all actions (giving an average character the metabolism of a [[troll]]) instead of having a large set hunger cost. Vampires received a smaller hunger penalty. Also, all species received satiation with each attack, although in practice this was never enough to offset the increased hunger without some extremely tedious weapon-switching before and after fights.\n\n{{brands}}\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

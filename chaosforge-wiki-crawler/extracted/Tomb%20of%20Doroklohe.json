These walls will push away objects in their way, but their growth is obstructed by the presence of any creature. They are not permanent, and will expire after a period of time.}}\n'''Tomb of Doroklohe''' is a monster-only spell which surrounds the caster with temporary rock [[wall]]s on all sides, giving him time to recover mid-fight without fear of assault. Unless your character has some means of [[dig]]ging through rock, the caster will be able to regain a significant amount of [[HP]] by the time the walls dissipate.\n\nThe walls created by this spell may not fully surround the caster if there are certain dungeon features in the spaces they would normally fill, and any items in those squares will be displaced (possibly inside the tomb). If the monster doesn't have space for the tomb, it instead acts like an uncontrolled [[Blink]].\n\nThe following monster can cast this spell:\n*{{monsterlink|Khufu}}\n\n==History==\n*Tomb of Doroklohe was fully removed in [[0.28]]. The [[Tomb card]] replicates its effects, however.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], the walls created by this spell were permanent.\n*Tomb of Doroklohe was a level 7 [[Conjurations]]/[[Earth Magic]] spell the player could cast in ''Dungeon Crawl'', but it was removed from the [[Stone Soup]] version of the game. \n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

I am very new to this game, so instead of learning how to play it, I'm just doing whatever seems most entertaining. So enjoy this story. The story of a Ghoul Chaos Knight named Krismeer.\n\n[[User:Invertin|Invertin]]\n\n== Corpse of the Abyss ==\n\nI have awoken!\n\n...\n\nFinally. I thought I'd never get to leave this altar. I've been sealed there for... About a hundred years now? I dunno.\n\nUgh. Flesh mould.\n\nI was once a powerful Paladin you know. Of course, Lugonu didn't like me. I was too goody good for him. So he turned me to his side, and into a ghoul. I must say, I've been enjoying myself with these claws and the chaos.\n\nUntil I pissed him off and he sealed me in an altar.\n\nI did have a final trick up my sleeve, infact, you're reading it. With the help of a wizard friend I cast a spell on a scroll that would write down my thoughts. In retrospect I should have made the scroll shoot fireballs or something, but it made sense at the time. Anyway, I have been freed from this altar so that I can get the Orb of Zot. It sounds fancy. I want it.\n\nAfter being greeted with screams of \"BLOOD! MAIM! KILL!\" from my almighty deity, I grab some supplies in the Abyss and head out into the dungeon.\n\nI now have a set of orcish leather armor, regular leather armor, some gloves, 16 dwarven darts, a silver ring, and a scroll I can't read. I'm not sure why I grabbed gloves. I have claws the size of my arm, it's not like they'll fit.\n\nOh lookie. Chainmail!\n\nAnd I'm rotting now. That's just fantastic.\n\nAnyhow I just left the room I ended up in, admiring the gigantic door that they put there. Oh look! A knife!\n\nThat'll be useful for eating my foes with.\n\nSpeaking of eating, I found a rat. Let's kill it.\n\nHm.. I just thought of an interesting problem. I've been sleeping for about a hundred years (or maybe just a day, It's hard to tell.) and I'm completely underground.. I won't be able to tell what day it is.\n\nI won't even know if any of my old friends are still alive. Or if they are still dead! Ahahahaha!\n\nUh.. If anyone is reading this right now, could they get some more parchment? I only enchanted one scroll...\n\nAH!\n\nWHAT!\n\nOh. Something... Something just teleported me and when I find out who it was-\n\nGOBLIN! IT WAS YOU!\n\nSlash maim death kill stab\n\nHahaha. Stabbed the poor thing in the face.\n\n...Kind of odd that it didn't leave a corpse. And I'm going to get hungry later. And that isn't going to help my current anger problem. Freaking teleport spells.\n\nWell, someone is shining on me today because I just found a set of orcish banded mail. And it wasn't cursed or anything!\n\n...It was part of a goblin ambush though.\n\nOh my goodness. I can't tell if I'm just that awesome or if goblins are made out of paper bags filled with blood, because everyone I kill seems to disintegrate.\n\nI just found a Kobold and a giant bat. I tried throwing some rocks at them, but when that didn't work I just stabbed them in the face.\n\nStabbing seems to work.\n\nAnd the bat left a corpse this time! The Kobold didn't. It's almost like someone is stealing them when I'm not looking.\n\nAnother Kobold just around the corner from the last one. It managed to take two hits instead of the usual stab to the face approach. I feel alot stronger after that last fight. Almost like I'm more experienced! Like I just leve-\n\nHe left a sword, it isn't as sharp as I'd like, but I did find a nice treasure trove of poison darts in the room behind it.\n\nOh! And a banana!\n\n...Wait.. What is a banana doing here? Did a monkey pass through? A monkey that uses poison darts?\n\n... A monkey that wears a wizard hat!?\n\nThat hat is now mine. I have claimed it. And it is green. And mine.\n\nI've found another scroll of jibberish, which makes me wonder if the scroll I'm writing will be in english. I hope so. I want to be able to read it to my undead minions when I return.\n\nOh.\n\nOH!\n\nTHIS EXPLAINS PREVIOUS EVENTS!\n\nThou hast placed a Teleportation Trap in my path. Thou shalt die.\n\nSeriously. When I find who did this...\n\n...BLOOD BAG GOBLIN!\n\nSlash maim stab\n\nWell that was pathetic. I spent most of the battle missing and so did he. He finally stood still long enough for me to stab him in the face...\n\n...And he left a corpse.. Ouch. That looks painful!\n\nLet's make it worse by ripping him into edible shreds."}

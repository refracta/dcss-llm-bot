{"title":"Obsidian bat","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Obsidian_bat","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Obsidian bats''' are fast hell-themed bats that can be found in [[Orcish Mines]]. Their attacks can summon [[hell hound]]s or [[hell rat]]s on hit 66% of the time, capped at 4 at once.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Obsidian bats are [[batty]], so they can hit and move out of melee range between the player's actions. One way to minimize hits is to move away from them rather than toward them. They'll waste most of their turn approaching you and may end up next to you.\n*Fighting them in a corridor will restrict their movement and prevent you from getting swarmed by their summons. You can even trap the bat between yourself and another monster (possibly one of its summons) or a dead end to prevent the bat from moving.\n\n==History==\n*Obsidian bats were added in [[0.32]] with a new '''AF_HELL_HUNT''' [[attack flavour]]."}

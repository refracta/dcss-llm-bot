In ancient times, the gods of the Ereborans ceased to answer their prayers, and in desperation, the people turned to the forbidden worship of dragons. Now, of their works, only this mask remains.}}\n[[File:Mask_of_the_dragon.png]] '''''the +0 mask of the Dragon'''''\n\n+0 [[hat]]<br>\n+3 [[slaying]]<br>\n+40 [[willpower]]<br>\n[[See invisible]]\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''mask of the Dragon'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|978}}</ref> trades the 3-4 [[AC]] from a normal +2 [[helmet]] for a bonus +3 [[slaying]]. It also gives a nice [[willpower]] bonus, and see invisible is convenient to have.\n\nFor melee and ranged fighters, it's usually worth using over a plain helmet. Even for casters, the willpower can make it worth using (in lieu of another hat of willpower). You can find better [[randart]] hats/helmets out there, though.\n\nThe mask covers your face but not your head, so characters with horns will still be able to use their auxiliary attack, making it a great fit for Minotaurs. \n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Headgear]]"}

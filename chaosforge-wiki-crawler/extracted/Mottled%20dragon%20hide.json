It may be turned into proper armour by magical means. Its smooth surface lets sticky flames flow off it like water.}}\n\n'''Mottled dragon hide''' is a light suit of body [[armour]] (only slightly heavier than [[leather armour]]) that provides resistance to [[Sticky Flame]]. It can occasionally be obtained by butchering a [[mottled dragon]] [[corpse]]. Enchanting it with [[scroll of enchant armour]] turns it into a much more useful [[mottled dragon armour]].\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.19]], mottled dragon hide, along with all other hides, was removed.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Hide''' || [[File:Mottled dragon hide.png]]\n|-\n| '''Armour''' || [[File:Mottled dragon armour.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

It magically regenerates its wearer's flesh.\n----\n\n\"THE TROLL KING: Now, listen, Prince Peer, and give way to reason!<br>\nYou're cut out for a troll. Why, look, already<br>\nYou bear yourself quite in a troll-like fashion!<br>\nAnd you want to become one, don't you?<br>\nPEER GYNT: Of course.<br>\nIn return for a bride and a well-found kingdom<br>\nI'm not unwilling to sacrifice something;<br>\nBut all things have a natural limit.<br>\nI have taken a tail, it is true; but, then,<br>\nI can undo the knots that our friend has tied<br>\nAnd take the thing off. I have shed my breeches;<br>\nThey were old and patched; but that won't prevent me<br>\nFrom putting them on if I have a mind to.<br>\nI shall probably find it just as easy<br>\nTo deal with your Trollish way of living.<br>\nI can easily swear that a cow's a maiden;<br>\nAn oath's not a difficult thing to swallow.<br>\nBut to know that one never can get one's freedom –<br>\nNot even to die as a human being –<br>\nTo end one's days as a Troll of the mountains –<br>\nNever go back, as you tell me plainly –<br>\nThat is a thing that I'll not submit to.\"\n\n-Henrik Ibsen, _Peer Gynt_. 1867.}}\n\n'''Troll leather armour''' is one of the lightest [[armour]]s. It has the same defense and encumbrance as [[leather armour]], but also provides Regen+ (+0.80 HP/turn). This bonus does not apply while under [[Inhibited Regeneration|-Regen]]. Note that this armour can be worn by [[Troll]]s, [[Oni]], and [[Spriggan]]s, while regular leather armour cannot.\n\nThis item has a 33% chance to generate when you slay any [[list of trolls|troll]]. The unique trolls [[Pargi]], [[Parghit]], and [[Snorg]] may drop hides that are already enchanted. The moon troll of [[Lehudib's Moon Base]] will drop the [[moon troll leather armour]] (or an [[artefact]] troll armour, if you've already found it).\n\n==Desirability==\nTroll leather armour is decent for characters who need to stay unencumbered, as it is very light. The regeneration boost is equivalent to an [[amulet of regeneration]], which is quite strong. It is arguably better than the couple of extra AC you'd get from light [[dragon scales]]. In addition to the combat benefit, it lets you recover faster, reducing the chance you find a monster while resting.\n\nIn any case, TLA is a direct upgrade to [[leather armour]], and nearly always better than a [[steam dragon scales]]. [[Oni]], [[Troll]]s, and [[Spriggan]]s who have yet to find dragon scales will at least appreciate something heavier to wear.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Armour''' || [[File:Troll leather armour.png]] [[File:Deep troll leather armour.png]] [[File:Iron troll leather armour.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]<br>Troll leather armour\n|-\n| '''[[Moon troll leather armour]]''' || [[File:Moon troll leather armour.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], troll leather armour had a base AC of 4 (and max enchantment of 4).\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the regeneration property gave +1.0 HP/turn.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the regeneration property gave +0.4 HP/turn.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], all trolls, including [[deep troll|deep]] and [[iron troll]]s, dropped only green armour.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], this item could be created by using a [[scroll of enchant armour]] on a [[troll hide]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], wearing this armour increased the rate at which the player grew hungry.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], player [[Troll]]s didn't get a regen bonus for wearing troll leather armour.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], troll leather armour only provided +30 regeneration rate.\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Body armour]]\n[[Category:Troll]]"}

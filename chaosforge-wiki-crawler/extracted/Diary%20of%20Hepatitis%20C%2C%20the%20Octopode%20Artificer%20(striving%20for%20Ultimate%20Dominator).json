Currently Hepatitis C, having found a +4 dagger of venom at the second Dungeon floor along with around three scrolls of enchant weapon, decided to go stealthy in order to survive with the limited charges on his few wands until he gets powerful. Right now this dagger is +8. Found Ring of Magical Power and an Amulet of Guardian spirit in their combination provided him even more ability to survive the beating. There's also a Ring of Protection from Magic. Among his few wands are enslavement, confusion, polymorph, random effects (not the starting one, which he wasted to 0), and the two empty ones, flame and fireball. He also has some scrolls and potions, books of Beasts, Callings and Control, which he won't be able to use for a while until (and if) he gets through Jiyva (for stabilizing a set of mutations, for now, a careless, but lucky test of a potion of mutation yielded him a whooping set of Clarity, rPois+ and Passive Mapping 1) onto Sif Muna (Vehumet's range increase and mana restoration mid-fight would be useful, but the amnesia ability is too useful to miss if he plans to max out every skill). Right now he's with Nemelex. So far his only important achievement was skewering sleeping Sigmund like a kebab, as well as Dowan, then blasting a wand \"'til it goes click\" into an angry Duvessa (they were cuddling together in their sleep rather lovingly, implying there was some kind of incestous act between them earlier).\n\n----\n\n'''XL''': 10\n\n'''Inventory spotlight''':\n\n'''!Equipment!'''\n\na +8 dagger of venom\n\n''a cursed +4 flail of protection''\n\na ring of magic protection\n\na ring of magical power\n\nan amulet of guardian spirit\n\n'''!Wands!'''\n\na wand of enslavement 6\n\na wand of confusion 2\n\na wand of polymorph 6\n\na wand of random effects 3\n\na wand of flame 0\n\na wand of fireball 0\n\n'''!Rods!'''\n\n'''!Cards!'''\n\nan ornate deck of war\n\na plain deck of destruction\n\n'''!Scrolls!'''\n\n3 scrolls of fog\n\na scroll of teleportation\n\n2 scrolls of blink\n\n3 scrolls of remove curse\n\n'''!Potions!'''\n\nheal wounds\n\nrestore abilities\n\ncuring\n\nflight\n\nberserk\n\n'''!Books!'''\n\nof Beasts\n\nof Callings\n\nof Control\n\n\n'''Skills spotlight:'''\n\nEvocations 13.3\n\nStealth 11.1\n\nDodging 8.1\n\n\n----\n\n\n== Day 1. ==\n\n\n'''Dungeon 9'''.\n\nThis bloody sky beast has ripped my old diary apart, so I guess I have to start from the \"Day One\" again. Well, I'm feeling hungry, so this... creature should be of some use, after all. *blood stains are all over the page*\nNow, this should do- no, wait. This meat is glowing. I'm not going to eat it. Guess I'll have to go search for a tasty kobold or orc. There should be a plenty down there.\n\n'''Dungeon 10'''\n\nFinally the much needed meat meal in the form of a large yak pack... Oh, stop, it tickles... No, it hurts! Here, have a cookie and fight by my side! There are too many of you!\nPhew, blinked away.\nThe yaks are dead, and I'm full. What's next? Oh, an orc party, along with some ghosts. Good thing they're sleeping... Oh, not anymore. The priest's weird words hurt.\nThe orcs are dead, the ghosts too, but fighting the latter made me starving. A little packed meal won't hurt.\nOh, another Sky Beast. Inedible as usual.\nOh, a couple of identifying scrolls.\nOh my god, KILLER BEES! Run like hell!\nAlthough this narrow corridor won't allow them to sting all at once...\nThe killer bees are dead. Their flesh tastes a little bitter, but nevertheless good.\nTime to move downstairs.\n\n(The rest of the pages were torn out. This diary was found on the floor 14 of the Dungeon near a pack of uglies.)"}

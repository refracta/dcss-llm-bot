{"title":"Special ability","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Special_ability","type":"raw","data":"{{version021}}\nA '''special ability''' is a spell-like ability that certain monsters possess. Special abilities are genetic, which means only members of a particular species are able to use special abilities. [[Silence]] does not work on special abilities, but there are many monsters which possess normal spells that cannot be silenced either.\n\nSome special abilities:\n* The ability of some monsters to [[blink]], such as [[crimson imp]]s.  Note that some monsters instead possess Blink as a spell.\n* [[Ghost moth]]s' and [[eyes of draining]]'s MP-draining gaze.\n* [[Floating eye]]s' ability to paralyze you.\n* All [[Mara]]'s abilities.\n* [[Dragon]]s and [[draconian]]s have [[Draconian breath attacks|breath attacks]]. The [[Serpent of Hell]] can summon and abjure (in addition to its breath attacks). Some breath weapons are implemented as special abilities, while others are implemented directly as spells.  This has little effect on the player, as none can be silenced.\n\nPlayers can acquire special abilities in a few ways:\n* Play a race that gains special abilities as they become more experienced (such as [[tengu]] or [[demonspawn]]).\n* Transform into a creature that has a special ability ([[Dragon Form]]).\n*[[Mutation|Mutate]] yourself via [[quaff]]ing a [[potion of mutation]], or by worshiping [[Xom]] or [[Jiyva]].\n\n[[Category:Mutations]]"}

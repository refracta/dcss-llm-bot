It can also be used on an item on the ground.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Scrolls of identify become worthless once you identify all potions and scrolls. You can use the '''\\''' key to see all items you (don't) already know. Note that the game will automatically figure out the 'last' potion/scroll through process of elimination.\n*If you have already identified a scroll of identify, You can press ESC to cancel the scroll effect without using it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], scrolls of identify were more necessary, as weapons, armour, and jewellery did not identify when you stepped on their tile. \n*Prior to [[0.21]], wands did not automatically reveal their charge when picked up.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], scrolls of identify would sometimes allow you to identify up to three items in your inventory.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Identification]]\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

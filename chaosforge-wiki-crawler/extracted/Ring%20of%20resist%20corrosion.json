This reduces [[acid]] damage by 50%, gives a 50% chance to resist the corrosion [[status effect]], and gives immunity to [[Cloud#Acidic_fog|clouds of acidic fog]]. Multiple sources of resist corrosion do not stack.\n\n==Desirability==\nAcid is a rare element, but some form of rCorr is nice to have (at least as a swapout). It's particularly good throughout [[the Slime Pits]], which are filled with [[acid blob]]s. Having rCorr is also useful against a number of enemies, such as [[oklob plant]]s, [[entropy weaver]]s, [[goliath frog]]s, and [[caustic shrike]]s.\n\nResist corrosion ''does'' protect against the *Corr [[artefact]] property. Wearing this ring just to protect against *Corr is questionable, though.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.18]], there was an [[amulet of resist corrosion]] instead of a ring.\n*Prior to the corrosion overhaul of [[0.15]], corrosion resistance offered a 90% chance of negating corrosion effects against vulnerable weapons and armour. This stacked with other sources of resistance.\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

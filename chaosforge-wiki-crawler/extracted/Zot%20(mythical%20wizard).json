{"title":"Zot (mythical wizard)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Zot_(mythical_wizard)","type":"raw","data":"'''Zot''' is the powerful entity responsible for the construction of the [[Orb of Zot]] and the entire [[Dungeon]] which guards the Orb. Zot originates from the MS-DOS game ''The Wizard's Castle'', where he was a [[Gnome|Gnomic]] [[wizard]]. Most players presume the Zot from ''Dungeon Crawl'' to be (or have been) that wizard, though whether Zot is even sentient in ''Dungeon Crawl'' is put into question.\n\nAlthough often referenced in-game, Zot never makes a physical appearance. However, taking too long in the Dungeon will tick down the [[Zot clock]]; if the clock runs out, Zot finds and heavily [[drain]]s you, killing adventurers who have already been sufficiently weakened.  Whether it is alive, dead, a god, or even a wizard is never answered; Zot serves merely as a colorful character in the ''[[Dungeon Crawl]]'' back story:\n\n[[File:Wizcastle.gif]]\n\n\n==See Also==\n*[[The Realm of Zot]]\n*[[Zot:5]]\n*[[Orb of Zot]]\n*[[Rune of Zot]]\n*[[Zot trap]]\n*[[Zot statue]]\n\n[[Category:Crawl]]"}

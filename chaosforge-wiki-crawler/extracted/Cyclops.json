{"title":"Cyclops","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cyclops","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n{{list of | giants}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Cyclopes''' are slow, hard-hitting giants that are a menace at range. They usually generate with three or four [[large rock]]s on hand, which they will happily hurl at you from range. Cyclopes can appear alone or with a herd of [[dream sheep]] or [[yak]]s around them, and are most commonly found in the late [[Dungeon]], [[the Vaults]], the [[Orcish Mines]], and [[the Shoals]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Hide around corners and attack them at close range. Any form of [[Repel Missiles#Player sources|RMsl]], such as a [[Scarf#Ego|scarf of repulsion]], will also help. If there are other monsters around, you can use them to block line of fire until the cyclops comes within range.\n*Cyclopes have pretty lousy MR; [[confusion|confusing]] them will eliminate most of the harm they can do to you.\n*As you might expect, they can't [[see invisible]], so quaffing a [[potion of invisibility]] can let you escape in a dire situation.\n\n==Trivia==\nThe presence of sheep and yaks is a reference to Homer's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odyssey ''The Odyssey''], where cyclopes are presented as shepherds."}

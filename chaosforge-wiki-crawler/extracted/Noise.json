{"title":"Noise","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Noise","type":"raw","data":"{{version014}}\n*Note: ''Severely'' outdated. Noise now spreads in a square, many branches have been changed, noise meter added\n\n'''Noise''' in the dungeon can wake [[sleep]]ing monsters.  Monsters that hear a sound will generally wander toward it; if you get involved in a fight, monsters can come from all different directions to see what the fuss is about, potentially overwhelming you.\n\n== Noise propagation ==\nWhen a noisy action happens at a position, the noise will propagate to all the adjacent cells. Each time it advances a cell, the intensity suffers an attenuation. When the intensity reaches a value less than 1, the noise is inaudible and it won't propagate further.\n\nThe attenuation depends on the following factors:\n* The cell type:\n    {|class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0; text-align:left\" \n    ! Cell type !! Attenuation\n    |-\n    | Empty || -0.85\n    |-\n    | Statue or Idol || -1.70\n    |-\n    | Tree or Mangrove || -2.55\n    |-\n    | Closed/Secret door || -6.80\n    |-\n    | Wall || -10.20\n    |-\n    | Permanent wall || -infinity\n    |}\n* The direction: In diagonal, the attenuation is 41% higher (sqrt(2)~1.41).\n\nThis means that in open areas the radius of the area affected by a noise is: loudness/0.85 = loudness*1.176.\n\nThe following picture was generated by compiling the game with the option DEBUG_NOISE_PROPAGATION enabled. It shows which squares are affected by a simple shout. In this case, the intensity was 12 and the ambient noise was 0.\n\n[[ File:Noise_grid_example.png]]\n\n==Ambient noise==\nAmbient noise makes sounds harder to hear. This idea is implemented in the game by adding, or subtracting, a branch-specific amount to ''loudness''. The effective loudness is:\n effective_loudness = loudness - sgn(ambient_noise)Ã—{3d(abs(ambient_noise))/3 - 1}\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n! Branch !! Ambient noise\n|-\n| [[The Dungeon]] || 0\n|-\n| The [[Temple]] || 0\n|-\n| The [[Orcish Mines]] || 0\n|-\n| The [[Elven Halls]] || 0\n|-\n| [[The Lair]] || 0\n|-\n| [[The Snake Pit]] || 0\n|-\n| [[The Swamp]] || 0\n|-\n| [[The Shoals]] || 3\n|-\n| [[The Spider's Nest]] || 0\n|-\n| [[The Slime Pits]] || -5\n|-\n| [[The Depths]] || 0\n|-\n| [[The Vaults]] || 0\n|-\n| [[Hall of Blades]] || -7\n|-\n| [[The Crypt]] || -3\n|-\n| [[The Tomb]] || -10\n|-\n| [[Hell|The Hells]] || 0\n|-\n| [[The Realm of Zot]] || 0\n|-\n| [[Pandemonium]] || 0\n|-\n| [[Portals]] || 0\n|}\n\nIn most branches, this effect is minimal. Certain branches, however (the [[Tomb]] in particular), greatly amplify even the slightest noise. While characters in heavy armour probably won't care, stealthy characters that are used to sneaking around will find that even the noise generated by their attacks attracts attention.\n\n==Sources of noise==\n\n===Melee combat===\nA successful stabbing is always silent, otherwise the loudness is:\n  noise_factor * damage_done / 400\nThis value is capped at 12. Noise is generated even if you miss your attack (in that case loudness is 1). \n\nOther sources of noise in melee combat:\n* [[#Auxiliary_attacks|Auxiliary attacks]]\n* Noisy [[randart]]s: 20 (1 chance in 20)\n* Attacking with a weapon of [[chaos]]: 15 (1 chance in 200)\n\n====Calculation of noise_factor====\nThe base value of noise_factor depends on the damage type of your weapon: 150 for [[unarmed combat]]; 125 for slashing or crushing; 100 for slicing or chopping; 75 for piercing or stabbing. If your weapon has multiple damage types, the game will chose one of them randomly (you can look up the damage types of any weapon [[Weapon#Weapon_details|here]]).\n\n====Auxiliary attacks====\nIf you get an [[auxiliary attack]], that attack also makes noise and its noise factor is:\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0; width:18em;\"\n|-\n! Auxiliary Attack !! noise_factor\n|-\n| Constriction || 10\n|-\n| Kick || 100\n|-\n| Headbutt || 100\n|-\n| Beak || 75\n|-\n| Tail Slap, Stinger || 125\n|-\n| Punch, Claws || 100 (75 if [[Blade Hands]] is active; 125 if you have tentacles)\n|-\n| Bite || 75\n|-\n| Pseudopods || 125\n|-\n| Tentacles || 100\n|}\n\n===Ranged combat===\nThere are two sources of noise when you shoot a projectile: the launcher and the missile.\n\nThe noise generated by the launcher is always made at your position even if you miss the shot.\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0; width:18em;\"\n|-\n! Launcher !! Loudness\n|-\n| None (i.e. [[Throwing]])|| 0\n|-\n| [[Blowgun]] || 0\n|-\n| [[Hunting sling]] || 1\n|-\n| [[Greatsling]] || 3\n|- \n| [[Shortbow]] || 5\n|-\n| [[Longbow]] || 6\n|-\n| [[Hand crossbow]] || 2\n|-\n| [[Arbalest]] || 7\n|-\n| [[Triple crossbow]] || 9\n|}\n\nThe noise generated by the missile itself depends on the base damage of the item. It is damage/3, rounded down. It is generated at the last square it reached, even if doesn't hit anything.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0; width:18em;\"\n|-\n! Missile !! Loudness\n|-\n| [[Tomahawk]] || 2\n|-\n| [[Javelin]] || 3\n|-\n| [[Large rock]] || 7\n|-\n| [[Throwing net]] || 0\n|-\n| [[Needle]] || 0\n|-\n| [[Stone]] || 1\n|-\n| [[Sling bullet]] || 2\n|-\n| [[Arrow]] || 2\n|-\n| [[Bolt]] || 3\n|}\n\nExample: A character with a bow shoots an arrow. The destination is an empty cell.\n(Note that this image is out of date. The arrow would make 1 more noise in recent versions.)\n\n[[File:Noise-grid-ranged-combat.png]]\n\n===Spell noise===\nSee [[spell noise]].\n\n===Player shouts===\n* 12 in normal conditions.\n* 18 in [[Dragon Form]].\n* 8 in [[Spider Form]]\n* 4 in [[Bat Form]]\n* 14 if you have level 2 of the [[Bad_mutations#Scream|scream]] mutation.\n* 16 if you have level 3 of the [[Bad_mutations#Scream|scream]] mutation.\n\n===Other sources===\n*[[Qazlal]] worshipper at piety ******: 16\n*[[Scroll of noise]]: 25\n*The [[Singing Sword]]: 0-35 depending on [[tension]].\n*Blocking an attack with the [[Shield of the Gong]]: 40\n*Monster shouts\n*Monster spells with the [[Spell slot flag|Noisy flag]]\n*Creaking doors: 10 (1 chance in [[Dexterity]] + [[Traps]] + [[Stealth]]/2; \"As you open/close the door, it creaks loudly!\")\n*[[Alarm trap]]s: 40\n*Using the [[Horn of Geryon]]: 15\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.19]], the Lair's ambient noise was 4, and the Orcish Mines's was 3\n\nPrior to [[0.13]], the Crypt's ambient noise was -20.\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

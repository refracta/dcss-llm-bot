Dangerous but short-lived spectral undead creatures will coalesce from the mist over time.}}\n\n'''Spectral Cloud''' is a monster-only spell which creates [[cloud]]s of ghostly flame. These deal a small amount of partially-irresistible [[negative energy]] damage to anything caught inside them, though the undead are immune to this. They also occasionally spawn short-lived [[spectral thing]]s which immediately attack you. Followers of [[Yredelemnul]] are completely immune to these clouds.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], this spell could heal undead.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Spectral Cloud was called Ghostly Flames.\n*Ghostly Flames was added in [[0.13]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

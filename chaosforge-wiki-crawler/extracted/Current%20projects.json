{"title":"Current projects","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Current_projects","type":"raw","data":"{{Community}}\n\nCrawlWiki is growing in size with more than [[Special:Statistics|100 registered users]]. To track what we are doing, we have created this list of current projects.\n\n== Current Projects ==\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n! Project !! Goal !! Contributor(s) !! Status\n|-\n| '''0.14 Update Project'''\n| See [[Current_projects/0.14_update_project]]\n| \n|Active\n|-\n| ''Weigh in''\n| Go to [[:Category:Under Review]] and give us your thoughts on what should be done.  Any input is appreciated!\n| Anyone\n| Done for the moment if the lack of pages is any indication\n|-\n| ''Unstub-a-dub-dub''\n| Add anything you can to any of the pages in [[:Category:Stubs]].  If you add a lot of stuff, remove <nowiki>{{stub}}</nowiki>.\n| Anyone\n| Ongoing\n|-\n<!-- Keep 'under review' and 'stubs' at the top-->\n| ''Missing pages''\n| [[Special:WantedPages]], [[Special:WantedTemplates]], [[Special:WantedFiles]], [[Special:WantedCategories]].  Usually these require some simple redirects or imports from the old wiki.\n| [[User:DC_Malleus|DC_Malleus]]\n| Wanted Pages are under control for the moment - There's a bunch of templates, categories, pages, etc. that I've nominated for deletion - I think most of them are holdovers from the old wiki import. As much as it burns me to say it, there are also a few usual suspects that should be kept for demonstration purposes (unless anyone is more zealous than I am about keeping the Wanted Page clean :D). Turning my baleful eye to the other categories now.\n|-\n| Game Mechanics Pages\n| Creating a more comprehensible and comprehensive collection of pages on fundamental game concepts. Started with [[Movement]], now progressing to [[Actions]]. Ideally, this project will lead to a series of macro-level pages that provide a portal to more detailed pages (e.g. [[Spellcasting]] should introduce all the topics, but link to [[Spells]], [[Spell schools]], [[spell power]], [[Spell hunger]], [[Spell success]], [[Damage type]], etc.)\n| Jk, more contributors appreciated.\n| In progress\n|-\n| ''Renames''\n| Change the link of everything that has been renamed: for instance [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Dragon armour]] and [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Potion of healing]] -- the  pages listed there should have their links changed to [[Fire dragon armour]] and [[Potion of curing]].  This is optional, as there are redirects from the old terms, but it would be nice if the wiki used up-to-date terminology on all pages.\n| [[User:spudwalt]]\n| Finished potions of curing; will take care of dragon armor soon\n|-\n| ''Updating''\n| Go through http://git.develz.org/?p=crawl.git;a=log (2/14/2012 and earlier) to see what parts of the code have changed and update the wiki accordingly.  This can be done even without code-reading skills as the summaries are plain English; make a list of clearly important changes and leave it to code readers to figure out and fill in the specifics.\n| vacant\n| not started\n|-\n| ''[[Habitat]]''\n| Rewrite [[habitat]] to properly describe the habitats LAND, WATER, AMPHIBIOUS, LAVA, and \"fake amphibious\".\n| [[User:Pascal76]]\n| Started \n|-\n| ''Splitsville''\n| Split all items on the [[evocable items]] page onto their own pages, leave behind overviews and links to the individual pages.\n| [[User:MoogleDan]], though help is welcome\n| Started\n|-\n| ''Practical magic resistance''\n| Add a chart of what the bell curve for random2(100) + random2(101) is to the [[MR]] page.  The scale would be spell power minus MR, with the low bound being -100 (0% success); midpoint -1 (I think?) (50% success); and high bound 100 (100% success).  Could just be a table of values in increments of 10, not a graph, though the latter would be fancy.\n| vacant\n| not started\n|-\n| ''Update/expand portal and vault pages''\n| Go through the [http://git.develz.org/?p=crawl.git;a=tree;f=crawl-ref/source/dat/des/portals;h=9e10d9a155f11176301498aa37de2847b493ef75;hb=HEAD portal] and [http://git.develz.org/?p=crawl.git;a=tree;f=crawl-ref/source/dat/des/variable;h=11076c55fdb8ab29193aee32649733cbc27b55f1;hb=HEAD vault] source pages to update/expand our coverage of said dungeon features.\n| vacant\n| not started\n|-\n| ''Merge portal pages''\n| [[Portal]] and [[Dungeon_branches#Miscellaneous_Portals]] overlap heavily; merge any useful info from the branches page into the specialized portal page.\n| vacant\n| not started\n|-\n| ''Add spell info''\n| Peruse the [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhvL_CFCw7ajdEZ5Q3JoOS1tdUxta1NaWTZ1MVNqbXc#gid=6 DCSS spell lab] -- click on the \"Spells\" tab -- to add basic stats about spells to our spell pages.  Especially damage figures.\n| vacant\n| not started\n|-\n| ''[[Resistances]]''\n| Edit the [[resistances]] page to broaden it to mention monster resistances.  Currently it is totally player-centric.\n| vacant\n| not started\n|-\n| ''Import info''\n| Go through [http://crawl.akrasiac.org/learndb.html Henzell's learndb] and copy any useful info to appropriate pages (or create new ones).\n| vacant\n| not started\n|-\n| ''Resistible enchantments''\n| Create a list of things (spells, wands, scrolls, etc.) that are resisted by monster [[magic resistance]].  Give the formula for how effective a given amount of resistance is vs. each thing so you know when to give up on using that wand of confusion & suchlike.\n| vacant; may need some [[Source code|source diving]] skills\n| not started\n|-\n| ''A template in every pot''\n| Make sure all [[:Category:Spells]] are using [[Template:Spell]], all [[:Category:Items]] are using [[Template:Item]].\n| vacant\n| Checked the spells, didn't get to the items\n|-\n| ''Establish new version update procedures''\n| We need some sort of routine in place -- at the very least, a checklist -- to follow when a new version is released, so we can keep the wiki up-to-date.  This should include rerunning our autogeneration scripts and uploading the results.  Potentially tricky, since the scripts may need updating from version to version and people don't hang around for years.  So we need a plan of succession for our script maintainers/guru(s).\n| vacant\n| not started\n|-\n| ''Update spell table pages''\n| [[List of spells/parse-spl-data]] was used to generate the following pages: \n* [[List of spells]]\n* [[List of spells by level]]\n* [[List of spells by school]]\n* [[List of spells by flag]]\n* [[List of spells by book]]\nWe could try extending it to update all our spell-related pages, including individual spells and spell books.\n| [[User:CommanderC]]\n| not started\n|-\n| ''Outdated spell table pages''\n| [[List of attack spells and beams by maximum damage]] and [[Table of attack spells and beams by maximum range]] need updating.  Maybe Neil's script can be extended to redo them.\n| vacant\n| not started\n|-\n| ''Fill in spell damages''\n| Someone needs to do some source diving to fill in what the damage, duration, etc. are for several different spells: [[Tornado]], [[Ice Storm]], [[Fire Storm]], [[Freezing Cloud]], etc.  We could potentially grab some of this from [[List of attack spells and beams by maximum damage]], provided the figures haven't changed too radically.\n| vacant\n| not started\n|-\n| ''Fix some redundancies''\n| Consolidate redundant/out-of-date tables & info in [[stats]] and species attributes.  Current stats can be found in http://git.develz.org/?p=crawl.git;a=blob;f=crawl-ref/source/ng-setup.cc -- bearing in mind that you must add 2 to all those figures.  Also note that that page is from [[trunk]]; MD has been removed and Op is in.\n| Vacant!\n| Not started\n|}\n\n== Past Projects == \n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n! Project !! Goal !! Status\n|-\n| ''Merge community, community portal pages''\n| [[Community]] and [[CrawlWiki:Community portal]] pages have overlapping purpose.  Merge community to community portal and update the [[CrawlWiki|main page]] to reflect the updated community page and its content.\n| Done\n|-\n| ''Review categories''\n| Rename any obtuse or long names, merge duplicates\n| DONE! There is still some stuff to do with the categories (i.e. placing categories into appropriate parent categories, but that will be for another time)\n|-\n| ''Merge candidates''\n| Consolidate [[Multizap]] and The Multizapper's Handbook (''now a dead link'').  Unnecessary to have two pages on the same basic subject, even if one is more technical and the other more strategic.\n| probably done?\n|-\n| ''Half staff''\n| Add [[Template:Item]], [[Template:Flavour]] to the [[:Category:Magical staves]] pages.  Some [[:Category:Wand]] pages are lacking flavour too.\n| Done - most of this was already done, I only had to flavour up a few wands\n|-\n| ''Racial & background attributes''\n| Add racial [[stats]] to each [[species]] page and stat modifiers to each [[background]] page.  Note that the tables on the stats and class attribute modifiers pages are badly out of date and should be updated first. (Cragspyder - \"I checked the stats against the in-game values and they seem to be correct to me, I even checked Vine Stalker and Formicid myself and added them to the list.\"\n| I'm pretty sure this is now done. \n|-\n| ''A template in every book''\n| Create a [[Template:Spellbook]] and convert all [[:Category:book|spellbook pages]] to use it, for ease of maintenance and consistency of styling.\n| {{Done}}\n|-\n| 0.11 Update Project\n| See [[Current_projects/0.11_update_project]]\n| {{Done}}\n|-\n| ''Update info on monster pages''\n| The monster stats were extracted from the source and uploaded in bulk a couple of years ago.  Update the extracting script ([[User:Wideshanks/monsterparse.rb]]) to handle changes to the source; expand its functionality as much as possible to include stuff like what spells monsters have (and how much damage they do) and to reflect resistances not in mon-data.h (like negative energy, torment, confusion, etc.).  Also figure out way to automate upload of new data to the wiki.\n\nThe source code of the program we are currently using can be found [https://gitorious.org/crawl-wiki-monster-bot/crawl-wiki-monster-bot here]. Based on the same program used by the IRC bots.\n| {{Done}}\n|-\n| Monster Group Pages\n| Create separate pages for a monster, the group of monsters, and if needed, the player race. For example, see  [[Spriggan (monster)]], [[List of spriggans]], and [[Spriggan]]. In the list page, make sure to add the [[:Category:Lists of monsters]] at the bottom. We should also add reference links to the list page to every monster on that list. For example, [[Spriggan (monster)]] has a link to [[List of spriggans]], we should do it for [[Spriggan druid]] etc... Other pages that need to be done included [[Merfolk]], [[Gnoll]], [[Deep elf]].\n| {{Done}}\n|-\n| ''What was that?''\n| Update [[spell noise]] with the info on Talk:spell noise (''page no longer accessible'').  Optional: add detailed spell noise info to individual spell pages (via an expanded [[Template:Spell]]?).\n| {{Done}}\n|-\n| 0.10 Update Project\n| See [[Current_projects/0.10_update_project]] \n| {{Done}}\n|-\n| ''Expand attack flavour''\n| [[Attack flavour]] needs filling in.\n| Done.\n|-\n| ''Attack types''\n| Do some source diving to figure out what all the different [[attack type]]s do (sting, butt, shoot, etc.).  See http://crawl.chaosforge.org/index.php?title=Special%3AWhatLinksHere&target=Attack+type&namespace=10 for a list of the wiki's attack type templates.\n| Done.\n|-\n| ''Armour time-to-wear''\n| All body armour takes AC+1 turns to wear or remove; see [[Armour#Wear_and_remove_times]].  Add the weartime parameter to all armour templates.\n| Done.\n|-\n| ''Monster zapper''\n| Add the formula for what spell power monsters get when they use wands to the [[wand]] page.  Old formula was \"30 + 2d([[hit dice]]).  The part over 40 is halved (a power of 80 thus becomes a power of 60). Final power is capped at 70.\"  Is it still correct?\n| Done; current formula seems to be 30+[[hit dice]], although it's not clear what value is used for most enchantments.\n|-\n| ''0.9.2''\n| Add info about the [[0.9.2]] release to the wiki. See [http://git.develz.org/?p=crawl.git;a=blob;f=crawl-ref/docs/changelog.txt;h=b3cef7b43014f705443ce9d636bfadd6302a3b78;hb=33895e9a0446bc438a5dec2b39a335824ce23bf6].\n| Done.\n|-\n| ''Merge [[megabat]] and [[bat]]''\n| [[Template:Monster]] is a complication here; the uploader of all our current tiles changed it to ignore the \"tile\" parameter and instead automatically use pagename.  The monster page updates, below, should clear the way for fixing the tile parameter.\n| Done.\n|-\n| '' Fix size templates ''\n| Move the templates in [[:Category:Size]] to [[:Category:Size templates]]. Also edit these templates so that they add the category \"Foo monsters\" instead of just \"Foo\" to the page. For example, Template:big will categorize monster pages with this flag to \"Big monsters\" instead of just \"Big\". Finally, verify the old category (i.e. Category:Big) to see if there are any monsters that were not using the template and fix them.  \n| Done!\n|-\n| ''Add flavour to pages''\n| See Category:Articles_Without_Flavour (''category no longer exists'')\n| Done.\n|- \t\n| ''Crawl graphics''\n| Upload Dungeon Crawl's graphical tiles and place them in the relevant articles.\n| Done.\n|-\t\n| ''Style guide''\n| Create a style guide.\n| Done.\n|-\n| ''Redirect messages''\n| Redirect all in-game messages to appropriate articles.\n| Not completed / Do we want to do this?\n|-\n| ''Crawl documents''\t\n| Create pages for all Dungeon Crawl documents.\n| Finished for Stone Soup, original Crawl versions are needed.\n|-\n| ''Source code''\n| Upload wikified source code for all major versions.\n| Hell no, that's what the git repository is for.\n|-\n| ''Items''\n| Represent every Dungeon Crawl item with its own article, including an infobox.\n| Done.\n|-\n| ''0.7.0''\n| Create articles on 0.7.0's new features.\n| Done.\n|-\n| ''Categories''\n| Separate categories and articles.\n| Done.\n|-\n| ''Crawl versions''\n| Create an article for every version of Crawl.\n| Finished for Stone Soup, original Crawl versions are needed.\n|}\n\n[[Category:Community]]\n[[Category:Maintenance]]"}

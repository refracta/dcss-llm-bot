{"title":"Orcish Mines","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Orcish_Mines","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|The Orcish Mines are filled with the cave orcs native to the Dungeon, their humanoid labourers, and piles of freshly mined gold. Enterprising merchants have set up trading posts to help relieve the orcs of the latter.\n\nThe entrance to this branch can be found between levels 9 and 12 of the Dungeon.\n\nThis branch is 2 levels deep.\n\nThis branch contains the entrance to the Elven Halls.}}\n\n[[File:Orc entry.png]] The '''Orcish Mines''' are an early [[branch]] full of [[list of orcs|orcs]], [[gold]], and the entrance to the [[Elven Halls]]. Although the Mines lack a [[rune]], the bottom floor contains a guaranteed collection of [[shop]]s, and the gold found along the way makes it easy to afford any particularly useful treasures they may sell.\n\n==Layout==\nThe Orcish Mines are two floors deep and found between Dungeon:9-12. The entrance stairs are usually decorated with orcish idols and occasionally even [[altar]]s to [[Beogh]], and they are often guarded by a large group of orcs.\n\nOrc:1 consists of very open, cavernous areas. Sometimes, these sections can be disconnected - you can access them by using the upstairs on Orc:2. The Mines are made almost entirely out of digging rock, so a [[wand of digging]] can make shortcuts or chokepoints. Expect almost no hallways aside from those you dig yourself.\n\n===Orc:2===\nOrc:2 features an end [[vault]], often with organized buildings. These layouts can vary greatly (as can their difficulty), ranging from a handful of scattered rooms, to one huge room dominating much of the level, to an entire fortified compound housing [[Saint Roka]] and a throng of followers.\n\nOrc:2's end vault guarantees 4 [[shop]]s. Additional shops may spawn through random level generation.\n\n==Useful Info==\nIt's easy to get surrounded in the Mines. You'll often encounter at least a few orcs upon entry, who will [[shout]] to alert nearby enemies. Use [[stair dancing]] to separate groups of orcs; even a crowd of [[orc warrior]]s and [[orc priest|priests]] can be a handful.\n\nMonster difficulty is variable. Most denizens are plain orcs, warriors, priests, and wizards. You'll also encounter [[orc sorcerer]]s, [[orc high priest]]s, [[orc knight]]s, and usually one or two [[orc warlord]]s. A few other monsters, such as [[list of ogres|ogres]] and [[stone giant]]s, can spawn. Since almost everything is armed, pay attention to weapon brands. There's a good chance to encounter orcs with [[electrocution]], [[distortion]], etc.\n\nThe mines typically contain 1000-3000 [[gold]], and a host of [[shop]]s on Orc:2. You'll also find plenty of equipment from the orcs themselves, so there's a good chance to find [[brand]]ed gear. Melee orcs carry plate armour and heavy weaponry, while you'll find plenty of [[robe]]s from the mages.\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile plain [[orc]]s and [[orc warrior]]s shouldn't be a big threat for those encountering the Orcish Mines, it's still a moderately difficult branch. [[The Lair]] is widely considered to be easier. After all, Orc can contain serious [[out of depth]] threats like [[ettin]]s and [[stone giant]]s, while swarms of orcs can be hard to deal with.\n\nThe Orcish Mines are worth clearing eventually - usually after Lair. While it isn't mandatory, the gold, guaranteed shops, XP, and access to [[Elven Halls]] make it worth it. The shops aren't guaranteed to be useful, but there's a good chance that you'll find something nice to buy.\n\nSome characters, namely [[Venom Mage]]s (Orc has less poison-resistant monsters than Lair), may want to dip into Orc \"early\".\n\n===Useful Traits===\nNo resistance is ''mandatory'' for clearing Orc, but there are a few that are useful:\n*Good [[willpower]] - this is to avoid [[orc sorcerer]]'s [[paralysis]], which is always a very dangerous status.\n*[[Fire resistance]] / [[Negative energy resistance]] - To resist orc sorcerer attack spells.\n\n==Monsters==\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Orc}} || {{monsterlink|Orc wizard}} || {{monsterlink|Orc priest}} || {{monsterlink|Orc warrior}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Orc knight}} || {{monsterlink|Orc sorcerer}}  || {{monsterlink|Orc high priest}} || {{monsterlink|Orc warlord}}\n|-\n| {{Yellow|g}} [[File:Gnoll (monster).png]] '''[[Gnoll (monster)|Gnoll]]''' || {{monsterlink|Gnoll shaman}} || {{monsterlink|Gnoll sergeant}} || {{monsterlink|Warg}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Troll (monster)}} || {{monsterlink|Deep troll}} || {{monsterlink|Iron troll}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Ogre (monster)}} || {{monsterlink|Two-headed ogre}} || {{monsterlink|Ogre mage}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Cyclops}} || {{monsterlink|Stone giant}} || {{monsterlink|Ettin}}\n|}\n\nOne of the Orc:2 final vaults, '''pf_orc_diabolical''', features several [[List of demonspawn|demonspawn]] and [[common demon]]s guarding a portal to the [[Pandemonium]]:\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|chaos spawn}}\n| {{monsterlink|hellwing}}\n| {{monsterlink|ice devil}}\n| {{monsterlink|orange demon}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|red devil}}\n| {{monsterlink|rust devil}}\n| {{monsterlink|neqoxec}}\n| {{monsterlink|sixfirhy}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|smoke demon}}\n| {{monsterlink|soul eater}}\n| {{monsterlink|sun demon}}\n| {{monsterlink|ynoxinul}}\n|-\n| {{Brown|6}} [[File: Demonspawn (monster).png]] '''[[demonspawn (monster)]]'''\n|}\n\n===Uniques===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Amaemon}}\n| {{monsterlink|Azrael}}\n| {{monsterlink|Donald}}\n| {{monsterlink|Erica}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Erolcha}}\n| {{monsterlink|Fannar}}\n| {{monsterlink|Gastronok}}\n| {{monsterlink|Harold}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Jorgrun}}\n| {{monsterlink|Josephine}}\n| {{monsterlink|Maurice}}\n| {{monsterlink|Nergalle}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Nessos}}\n| {{monsterlink|Rupert}}\n| {{monsterlink|Saint Roka}}\n| {{monsterlink|Snorg}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Sonja}}\n| {{monsterlink|Urug}}\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.18]], the Orcish Mines were four levels deep.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the Orcish Mines' entrance was located on D:6-11.\n*Earlier versions of ''Crawl'' had sections of the Orcish Mines that were completely disconnected from all other areas.

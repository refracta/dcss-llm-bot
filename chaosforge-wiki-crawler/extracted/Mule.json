(similar to [[Bombard]])<br>\nrF+\n\n==Desirability==\nA +7 hand cannon of flaming is an endgame worthy weapon for any ranged character that wants to wear a shield. The backblast is often helpful, as it can help avoid being in melee range. But watch out - you could move yourself off stairs, out of a corridor, and so on. If you've found another decent hand cannon, it's likely you will want to swap between it and Mule, depending on the situation.\n\n==History==\n*Mule was added in [[0.31]].\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]"}

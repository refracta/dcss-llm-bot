{"title":"Gnoll","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Gnoll","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''This article covers the player [[species]]. For the monster, see [[Gnoll (monster)]]. For a list of all monstrous gnolls, see [[List of gnolls]].''\n{{flavour|Gnolls are a race of caniform humanoids originally hailing from the arid deserts and grasslands of the east. In recent history they have become unusually attracted to the Dungeon, establishing tribes around and even inside of it. Unfortunately their long stay in the Dungeon has exposed their somewhat fragile minds to excessive amounts of its magic.\n\nOn the one hand, their bizarrely altered brains now have incredible proficiency at learning every skill. On the other, these same alterations have rendered Gnolls incapable of selective learning. They learn all skills equally at the same time, so it's hard for them to learn more about any one thing.\n\nIn order to survive with this limitation, Gnolls use their universal knowledge to take advantage of every resource they find in the Dungeon. They also have powerful noses adapted to the Dungeon's scents, allowing them to easily locate where treasures lay hidden.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*'''[[Distributed Training]]:''' Gnolls' experience is split equally to all skills.\n**Note that if you sacrifice a skill to [[Ru]], your other skills won't get a bigger share of the XP. In other words, all skills will get 1/29ths of your XP no matter what,\n*'''[[Fangs]] 1:''' Gnolls can make an [[auxiliary attack|auxiliary bite attack]].\n*'''[[Strong Nose]]:''' Gnolls can sense the location of nearby items on the floor.\n\nGnolls have a base [[Strength]] of 7, [[Intelligence]] of 7 and [[Dexterity]] of 7 (before Background modifiers).\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Zealots:''' [[Cinder Acolyte]]\n*'''Adventurers:''' [[Shapeshifter]], [[Wanderer]]\n*'''Warrior-mages:''' [[Warper]], [[Hexslinger]], [[Reaver]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[strength]], [[intelligence]], or [[dexterity]] every 4 levels\n*Average [[HP]] and [[MP]]\n*+3 [[willpower]] per level\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Beginner}}\n\nGnolls are jacks of all trades, but masters of none. This is even more true than with [[Human]]s; while a Human can (and likely will) specialize in a few specific skills, a Gnoll is forced to have every skill at once. Using what the game provides you as far as items and spells is essential. On the other hand, you will always have skill for any good item you find, which makes skilling and gearing easier. Gnolls also have an easier time with triple school spells than most other races, as they train all three schools at once.\n\nNotably, Gnoll's nominal +8 and +6 aptitudes mean that they start with inflated skill in whatever their [[background]] provides. For example, a Gnoll [[Conjurer]] starts with 7 Conjurations skill rather than the usual 4. While largely meaningless in the endgame, it does make their starts a lot easier.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Gnoll}}\n\n==Strategy==\nGiven that a Gnoll's skills will be at around 16 once hitting character level 27, going for high-level spells will be a challenge, and min delay with heavier weapons will not be possible without a [[manual]] or divine skill boosts. This leads to a hybrid character that should use every advantage they've got - from hexes, summons, and ranged combat - before engaging in melee.\n\nA Gnoll's ability to use anything and everything has the downside of making inventory management even more of an issue than for all other characters.\n\n===God Choice===\n*[[Okawaru]] is a popular god choice for Gnolls, largely due to Heroism's skill boosts. And since Gnolls can use every weapon equally well, Oka's gifts are easier to use, never requiring retraining if you get something absurdly powerful. However, the loss of allies is rougher than most other species.\n*[[Cheibriados]]Ê¼ stat boosts enable a Gnoll to comfortably use just about any item or spell the game throws at them, at the cost of slow movement speed. This speed penalty may be worth paying in exchange for being able to deal with practically any situation before it becomes dangerous.\n*[[Ashenzari]]'s skill boosts can help bolster your skill levels enough to make use of high-end items and spells. Curses force much stricter weapon choice than Gnolls would normally want -- but a single good weapon remains ''capable'' of killing things, if not the best. Non-encumbering armour (the majority of slots) can be cursed without restricting your weapon or spell options.\n\n===Weapon Choice===\nGnolls have a unique dilemma - ''what exactly do I use''? Here are a few points on melee weapons:\n*The main thing to keep in mind is attack delay - you largely want to keep it at or below 1.0. Above that, and you risk normal speed enemies double-hitting you. You can press '''@''' to see the delay with your current weapon.\n*[[Dagger]]s are a useful swap-out when you want to [[stab]], whether you're sneaking up on your foes or using [[Hexes]] or [[wand]]s to give yourself opportunities.\n*Artefacts aren't necessarily better than a regular branded weapon, but they might come with a nice [[brand]] or some neat properties. \n*Gnolls more often than not prefer wearing some sort of shield. They already train the Shields skill, and two-handed weapons demand high skill levels that Gnolls can't compete with. [[Buckler]]s and [[orb]]s are universally useful, while [[kite shield]]s are good if you can cast necessary spells reliably in them.\n\n====Early Dungeon====\n*[[Brand]]s and [[enchant]]ment are the main distinguishing factors throughout the early Dungeon. A [[dagger]] of [[venom]] on a Human is already strong enough to beat enemies on route to [[Lair]], and a +9 [[randart]] [[freezing]] flail will probably be useful for longer.\n*As hostile [[gnoll (monster)|gnolls]] will happily demonstrate, [[Polearm]]s are great to use in the beginning. The extra hit, as well as the low skill requirements of [[spear]]s and [[trident]]s, are great perks in the early game.\n*Gnolls, thanks to their +8 aptitudes, will start with great skill in whatever weapon school they start with. Make sure to use that.\n\n====Later Options====\n*Aim for fast, low skill upgrades: [[Demon whip]]s, [[demon trident]]s, and [[demon blade]]s are all effective in terms of power, speed, and skill. Good non-demonic weapons include [[morningstar]]s, [[eveningstar]]s, and [[scimitar]]s. And [[Axes]] are always useful thanks to their [[cleave]].\n*With a strong [[talisman]], like [[blade talisman|blade]] or [[granite talisman|granite]], you may consider [[Unarmed Combat]] - though Gnoll's low skill makes UC a weaker choice without Okawaru.\n*[[Scrolls of enchant weapon]] represent a form of dedication. A good base weapon that's well enchanted and branded (+6 [[spectral (brand)|spectral]] [[broad axe]], [[eveningstar]], demon weapons, etc.) will remain viable throughout a 3-rune game. Don't fret too much about which specific weapon it is.\n**If you find a strong artefact (especially certain [[unrand]]s), it's probably worth using.\n\n==Notes==\nIn terms of skill training, Gnolls train their +8 skills as if a Human were training a single skill at 13.8%. They train their +6 skills as if a Human were training a single skill at 9.75%.<!-- Simple math: 29 skills, 1/29 * 2^(8/4) and 1/29 * 2^(6/4), respectively -->\n\nThis can be rearranged. A Gnoll's +8 aptitude is equal to training a single skill at a -11.43 aptitude, two skills at a -7.43 aptitude, four skills at a -3.43 aptitude, and so on. The +6 aptitudes are equal to a single skill at a -13.43 aptitude, two skills at a -9.43 aptitude, and so on.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Gnoll base [[attributes]] were 10 Str / 10 Int / 10 Dex.\n*Gnolls were added in [[0.21]].\n*Gnolls went through several developmental iterations. They were intially called Bultungin: eastern caniforms that started with unrestricted skilling and +4 aptitudes, but they rapidly declined to -6 as you actually got skill. The second iteration had +3 aptitudes, but their base attributes couldn't be changed by any means (not even by [[background]]).\n\n{{species}}"}

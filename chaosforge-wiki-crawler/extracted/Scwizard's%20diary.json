Turned gray. Things were going swimmingly until I decided to melee a death yak with a sub 100 speed weapon. BAD IDEA!\nOn a more positive note, Kiku's corpse summoning is all sorts of awesome.\n\n==11/05/2010==\nAfter a few false starts, had a game where I had the luck of running into a goblin with a dagger of venom early on. Now I thought that was good luck, but it's nothing compared to what happened next. I met Pikel and Pikel's staff luckily zerked me. But that's not all. Pikel was carrying a +2 cloak of preservation. The best non art cloak in the game. GODLY LUCK! After that I even found a gourmand amulet, so this means I have two AK items already. At this point I'm mottled (sticky flame is awesome) and just entered the lair.\n\nLair clear. That was uneventful. Didn't even find a death yak.\n\nAfter lair comes mines. Very uneventful until level 4. On level four rests Snorg. Thankfully I find him asleep. I go out of vision and memorize agony. Then I engage Snorg. Agony makes short work of him and he doesn't even zerk, but then while I'm fighting snorg, Rupert appears.\n\nI think Rupert will be a pushover, but it turns out berserk Rupert is a force of nature. I eat all my scrolls of blinking and tele, and manage to escape with one health. After I heal up, I run into him again. Agony and a potion of might are able to do the job, thankfully he didn't zerk again.\n\nWith the money I got from the mines, I was able to buy a quickblade from a shop. I gave it the pain brand with Kiku's blessing. Now it's time to do the snake pits without PR which is ALWAYS fun ^^.\n\nThe number of near misses in snake:4 should have been a hint that doing snake:5 was a BAD idea. It turns out poisoned isn't really even a problem. The problem is hasted greater nagas with high damage weapons. They're like \"screw orbs and poison arrows I'll just bash your face in\" and so they did, gg.\n\n==11/05/2010==\nMan no one ever told me that vampiric draining didn't work on efreets and hell hounds."}

Single-target attacks are much easier to repel than penetrating attacks.}}\n\n'''Repel Missiles''' ('''RMsl''', '''repulsion''') is a passive effect and monster-only spell which causes ranged attacks to miss the caster.\n\n==Effect==\nCreatures with Repel Missiles have +15 [[EV]] against ranged attacks, including spells.<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|fight.cc|107}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|spl-cast.cc|1488}}</ref> This spell only helps to [[ev]]ade ranged attacks; it has no effect on the caster's ability to [[SH|block]] them.\n\n==Player sources==\nThough the Repel Missiles spell is no longer available for players, several other sources exist for players to receive the effect:\n*[[Scarf#Egos|Scarves of repulsion]] provide the effect while worn.\n*Worshipers of [[Qazlal]] will eventually acquire a permanent Repel Missiles effect, as long as they maintain enough [[piety]].\n*[[Demonspawn]] with the [[Repulsion Field]] mutation will eventually develop a permanent repel missiles effect.\n*The [[Amulet of the Air]] is an unrandart amulet that produces a permanent repel missiles effect.\n\n==Monster Version==\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nIn addition, the following enemies provide a Repel Missiles aura:\n*{{monsterlink|Polterguardian}}\n\nUnlike the player version, the monster version can be [[potion of cancellation|dispelled]].\n\nMonsters with Repel Missiles will start with the status permanently active, meaning they never have to cast the spell unless the status is dispelled.\n\n==Strategy==\nRepel Missiles is effective at blocking ranged attacks, from [[list of centaurs|centaurs]] and [[faun]]s with ranged weapons to [[bolt spell]]s and [[crystal spear]]s. AC can't block special effects, like [[Stunning Burst]] paralysis and [[Throw Klown Pie]], but these spells can be repelled or dodged. It's great in [[the Shoals]], the [[Elven Halls]], [[the Vaults]], and other areas infested with enemies who love to shoot at you. \n\nMonsters with Repel Missiles are few and far between. As you would expect, trying to hit them with a ranged attack will be quite difficult. They are still vulnerable to [[Hexes]] and hex [[wand]]s, though most users have a high [[willpower]] to counteract that. And of course, things that don't miss -- like [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]], [[Fireball]], and [[lightning rod]]s -- are unaffected.\n\n[[Yara's Violent Unravelling]] or a [[wand of quicksilver]] can be used to dispel a monster's Repel Missiles.\n\n==History==\n{{Spell\n|name=Repel Missiles\n|level=2\n|school1={{Air Magic}}\n|school2={{Charms}}\n|school3=\n|castingnoise=1\n|spellnoise=0\n|sources=[[Book of Air]]<br>[[Book of Minor Magic]]\n}}\n*Prior to [[0.32]], Repel Missiles reduced the to-hit of ranged attacks against the caster from 0-100% if single-target or 50-100% if penetrating. Also, it didn't work on incapacitated targets.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], a more advanced version of Repel Missiles called [[Deflect Missiles]] existed. Monsters with DMsl instead got Repel Missiles.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], Repel Missiles was a level 2 [[Air]]/[[Charms]] spell available to players; it expired as it helped dodge projectiles. However, other sources still exist.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the Repel Missiles status expired based on a timer.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

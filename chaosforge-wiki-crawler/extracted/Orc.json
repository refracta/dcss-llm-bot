{"title":"Orc","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Orc","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | orcs}}\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Orcs''' are simple-minded creatures. Alone, they aren't much stronger than a [[goblin]] or [[kobold (monster)|kobold]]. However, orcs usually appear in packs. Worse yet, these packs often contain more dangerous orcs, including [[orc priest]]s and [[orc warrior|warriors]]. Orc packs are found throughout the Dungeon, the [[Orcish Mines]], and certain [[bailey]]s.\n\n===Variant Orcs===\n[[File:Deformed orc.png]]You can find '''deformed orcs''', '''febrile orcs''', and '''sickly orcs''' in some of the sealed chambers in [[Cigotuvi's Fleshworks]].\n\n{{Flavour|This poor creature looks hideously deformed.}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Orcs are often a sign that [[orc priest]]s, [[orc wizard|wizards]], and/or [[orc warrior|warriors]] are around. Try to lure packs to a hallway, staircase, or other choke point.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], the hidden weapon penalties for monsters were removed, so all monsters hit harder and faster with weapons. To compensate, orc's base damage was reduced from 5 to 2, though they always generate with a weapon.\n\n[[Category:Orc]]"}

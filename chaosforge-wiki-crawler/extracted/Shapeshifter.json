They enter the dungeon with a beast talisman and a potion of lignification.}}\n\n'''Shapeshifters''' are wanderers who specialise in [[Shapeshifting]], using [[talisman]]s to shift their physical [[form]]. \n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Naga]], [[Merfolk]], [[Draconian]], [[Troll]], [[Demonspawn]], and [[Demigod]] are the recommended species if you pick a Shapeshifter Background.\n\n==Racial restrictions==\n[[Ghoul]]s and [[Mummies]] are forbidden from becoming Shapeshifters, as they cannot use talismans to transform themselves.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[animal skin]]\n*[[Potion of lignification]]\n*[[Beast talisman]]\n*[[Flux talisman]]\n\nShapeshifters start the game in [[Beast Form]].\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Fighting]]: 1\n*[[Unarmed Combat]]: 3\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Shapeshifting]]: 3\n\nChoosing Shapeshifter adds 6 to your starting [[Strength]], 2 to your starting [[Intelligence]], and 4 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\n[[Beast Form]] does ''not'' give a special boost to Unarmed Combat; it boosts all melee and ranged damage, affecting even [[stone]]s and [[dart]]s you throw. If you find a great weapon in the early Dungeon, don't be afraid to use it. Note, however, that [[Flux Form]] forces you into Unarmed Combat, and other talismans do boost Unarmed damage.\n\n===Skilling===\nIn the very early game, Shapeshifters have more complex skill decisions than most weapon starts. What you find on D:1 - D:2 can influence the best thing to train to increase early game survival.\n\n*At 3 Unarmed skill, your fists will be stronger than any plain [[short sword]]s or [[spear]]s on the ground. However, weapons with a strong [[brand]] - such as short swords and [[whip]]s of [[venom]] or [[electrocution]], are better than your unbranded fists.\n*When in Beast Form, each level in Unarmed Combat gives more benefit than Shapeshifting. Shapeshifting, in turn, gives more benefit than weapon skills, and lets you advance to Flux Form.\n**If you don't find a better weapon on D:1, you'll want to train UC for a bit (not training Shapeshifting ''at all''), to make combat easier.\n**Note that the first few levels of any skill are cheap. For [[Human]]s, going from 3 -> 4 Shapeshifting would take the same XP as 0 -> 3 weapon skill. So once a skill becomes a lot more expensive than the others, you can train another useful skill.\n**If you decide to abandon Shapeshifting entirely, then a weapon skill has better long-term prospects. E.g. a weapon-wielder can find a great +2 [[cloak]], which Beast Form prevents you from wearing, and decide to never use a form again.\n\nDepending on what you find and what you've trained, you may want to upgrade to a different form (usually Flux Form), stay in Beast Form, or use formless Unarmed Combat.\n\n==History==\n*Shapeshifters was introduced in [[0.31]], replacing the [[Transmuter]] background.\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

{"title":"Maggie","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Maggie","type":"raw","data":"{{version|028}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Maggie the Vainglorious''' is a [[unique]] [[fire elementalist]] apprentice. She wears [[steam dragon scales|steam]], [[acid dragon scales|acid]], or [[swamp dragon scales]]. \n\nShe is a younger, weaker version of [[Margery]]. Maggie and Margery are mutually exclusive; if one appears in a game, the other will not.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:6-10\n*[[The Lair]]:1-2\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Her [[Bolt of Fire]] seriously hurts, but Maggie herself is reasonably squishy. Try to disable her with [[Hexes]] or a [[wand]] if possible -- her [[willpower]] and [[hit dice]] are both mediocre. [[Mephitic Cloud]] or [[dart]]s are also effective as long as she isn't wearing swamp dragon scales, though darts will require some skill in using them to be reliable.\n*If you get [[mesmerised]] and need to retreat, you'll need to either disable Maggie using one of the aforementioned methods or break [[LOS|line-of-sight]]. Reading a [[scroll of teleportation]] or [[scroll of fog]] will work adequately.\n*Maggie has a small chance of spawning with a slightly pre-enchanted [[Wyrmbane]]. This artefact is an excellent weapon, if you can manage to take it from her.\n\n==History==\n*Maggie was added in version [[0.25]].\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

Designed more for utility than combat, it looks quite capable of butchering a corpse.}}\n\nThe simple '''knife''' is the worst weapon in Crawl: its damage is even lower than a [[dagger]]'s, and unlike the latter it does not get explict stabbing bonuses. On the other hand, the knife weighs a mere 1 aum and is much less likely to be cursed than other random short blades found on the floor, as each of the first five dungeon floors has a 50% chance of receiving an uncursed +0,+0 knife.\n\n==History==\n*Knives were removed in [[0.9]]. Characters now carry a \"bootknife\" to butcher [[corpse]]s without wielding a sharp implement.\n*Knives were removed from caster [[background]]s in [[0.5]].\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Short blades]]\n[[Category:Obsolete items]]"}

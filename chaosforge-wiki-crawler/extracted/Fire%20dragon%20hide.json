It can be fashioned into proper armour, but even in its raw form it provides great protection from the effects of fire but renders its wearer susceptible to cold.}}\n\n'''Fire dragon hide''' is the hide of a [[fire dragon]], gained by butchering its [[corpse]]. Although it provides fairly lousy physical defense considering its EV penalty, it does provide the wearer with two ranks of [[fire]] resistance in exchange for one rank of [[cold]] vulnerability, and you can use a [[scroll of enchant armour]] on it to make [[fire dragon armour]], a much better piece of equipment.\n\n==History==\nFire dragon hides were removed in [[0.19]]\n\nPrior to [[0.10]], this item was known merely as \"dragon hide\".  It was renamed to avoid confusion with other dragon hides.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Hide''' || [[File:Fire dragon hide.png]]\n|-\n| '''Armour''' || [[File:Fire dragon armour.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

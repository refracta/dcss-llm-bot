This page probably contains spoilers.*\n\nThis one turned out to be quite short, but since its not exactly atypical, here it goes.\n\n## The (Short) Journey of Zunchur, Draconian Transmuter\n\n**The Entrance**\n\nSo they cast me out of the monastery, did they? I'll show them all when I return with the Orb of Zot, and make the Abbot clean the latrines for a change, and the Master of Novices... I'll think of, something, something even worse, something so mind-destroying...\n\n**The Beginning**\n\nEnough of that. I have entered the dungeon, and these are some twisting passages here... was the architect drunk?\n\n**Teleport Trap**\n\nWeirdness abounds... suddenly I found myself somewhere completely different, in a large room. A kobold attacked me, but a quit two-knuckles punch to the forehead put paid to that... glad to know all that practice wasn't completely wasted. I found some interesting suggestions in the Book of Changes of utilizing its corpse. I'll have to study some more to be able to do something truly useful with the result... Anyway, I can see a stairwell going deeper from here, I'll check that out next...\n\n**Checking Level Two**\n\nJust some empty corridors. At least they are straight. Going back up, I was assaulted by some assorted vermin, a rat and a bat. I got a nasty bite from the rat... they sure make 'em huge down here! Found a strange potion, which I'll keep for know.\n\n**Gaining Level Two**\n\nDear Diary: More maddened rats and bats. And then, a goblin. It didn't say anything, just charged at me waving its club. Strangely, one of these mad bats came with it, but didn't attack the goblin at all. It is as if a sinister force were driving these creatures...\n\nI have found several more useful techniques in the Book of Changes - now I can put those distilled corpses to a use, and I'll keep the goblin's club around, too.\n\n**Terence**\n\nAfter having explored the first level and examining the two other stairs downward, I make my way downward for good. I have just taken a few steps, and suddenly I am attacked again - by someone named “Terence” according to the nameplate on the elven ring mail he is wearing. Assorted vermin and a kobold come to his aid. Fortunately I have several potions of confusion handy by now, and toss one at Terence. While he stumbles about, I rain down a flurry of blows, and occasionally take care of distractions. After what seems hours of bashing on the confused human, he finally succumbs.\n\n**Snake Nest**\n\nUgh! That goblin meat didn't do me any good, but of course there are no wholesome (if you can call rats, bats, newts and the like wholeseme) creatures around when you need them. So I was staggering around with stomach cramps and worse, when I stumbled into a room with four(!) snakes, and not the small, mostly harmless type, either. I fled into a corridor, but one of them caught up with me. I evaporated a potion of water in the hope that it would hurt it worse than me, but that did not work out. In desperation, I grabbed one of the clubs I had collected and cast the spell to turn it into a snake of my own. I retreated behind my new pet, and waited while it managed to kill one of the snakes before succumbing. By then I had recovered some magical energy, and with a bit of room between it and me, I blew up a potion of confusion in its face. The two nearer snakes then began to fight even while I was waiting for the fumes to disperse, allowing me to repeat the procedure and then kill the survivors. Close call, that.\n\n**A Cloak**\n\nI found a cloak! It's of dwarven make, and slightly enchanted. And it's purple, but then, you can't have everything. Who knows, I may grow up to be purple too, so it ill behoves me to cast aspersions.\n\n**Orcs!**\n\nOrcs! Three and a sorcerer that I can see. As I'm still wounded from fighting surprisingly nasty gecko, I toss two potions at them, confusion and then poison, and hope for the best. Then I retreat, leaving them to choke on the fumes.\n\nAfter a bit of exploring, I come upon more of the ugly brutes in a corridor - possibly I have found the same group from another direction. I kill the first with a cloud of steam, but then stumble on its friends. Two wizards immediately disappear from sight, but that does not protect them from my confusion bomb. I dispatch them forthwith, but am a bit overenthusiastic, so that their brethren manage to crowd up on me. I grab a handful of arrows and transform them to snakes, but manage only on the second try. Wounded and out of magic, I retreat behind them. They manage to kill one orc and wound another before they are defeated. By then I am recovered enough to cast another spell, and steam-boil the remaining orcs.\n\nThe experience leaves me hungry, but yet strangely elated. I now understand several passages in the Book of Changes that have baffled me before. It is a spell that will allow me to take the shape of a gigantic, venomous spider - I shall memorize it immediately!\n\n**The End (post mortem)**\n\nMe is Grrunk. I is orc. I kill nasty little dragonling. I hear fighting, see him fighting Grraak and Grotz. They look very sick. All the others of my band I not see, I think the little dragonling kill them. Me not like the sorcerers, but still dragonling must die. He kill Grraak and beat up Grotz. He not look worried when I come, but he not know I have whip of ele... eleco... many big sparks. I hit him with whip, and he looks surprised. I hit again, and kill him. I loves my sparky whip! Now I write in his book and make funny pictures. Look mom, your Grrunk fancy sorcerer now!\n\n`358 Zunchur the Ruffian (level 5, 0/34 HPs)\n             Began as a Draconian Transmuter on Jan 30, 2010.\n             Slain by an orc\n             ...

one turned out to be quite short, but since its not exactly atypical, here it goes.\n\n==The (Short) Journey of Zunchur, Draconian Transmuter==\n\n\n\n'''The Entrance'''\n\nSo they cast me out of the monastery, did they? I'll show them \nall when I return with the Orb of Zot, and make the Abbot clean \nthe latrines for a change, and the Master of Novices... I'll \nthink of, something, something even worse, something so \nmind-destroying... \n\n\n'''The Beginning'''\n\nEnough of that. I have entered the dungeon, and these are some \ntwisting passages here... was the architect drunk?\n\n\n'''Teleport Trap'''\n\nWeirdness abounds... suddenly I found myself somewhere completely \ndifferent, in a large room. A kobold attacked me, but a quit \ntwo-knuckles punch to the forehead put paid to that... glad to \nknow all that practice wasn't completely wasted. I found some \ninteresting suggestions in the Book of Changes of utilizing its \ncorpse. I'll have to study some more to be able to do something \ntruly useful with the result... Anyway, I can see a stairwell \ngoing deeper from here, I'll check that out next...\n\n\n'''Checking Level Two'''\n\nJust some empty corridors. At least they are straight. Going back \nup, I was assaulted by some assorted vermin, a rat and a bat. I \ngot a nasty bite from the rat... they sure make 'em huge down \nhere! Found a strange potion, which I'll keep for know.\n\n\n'''Gaining Level Two'''\n\nDear Diary: More maddened rats and bats. And then, a goblin. It \ndidn't say anything, just charged at me waving its club. \nStrangely, one of these mad bats came with it, but didn't attack \nthe goblin at all. It is as if a sinister force were driving \nthese creatures...\n\nI have found several more useful techniques in the Book of \nChanges - now I can put those distilled corpses to a use, and \nI'll keep the goblin's club around, too.\n\n\n'''Terence'''\n\nAfter having explored the first level and examining the two other \nstairs downward, I make my way downward for good. I have just \ntaken a few steps, and suddenly I am attacked again - by someone \nnamed “Terence” according to the nameplate on the elven ring mail \nhe is wearing. Assorted vermin and a kobold come to his aid. \nFortunately I have several potions of confusion handy by now, and \ntoss one at Terence. While he stumbles about, I rain down a \nflurry of blows, and occasionally take care of distractions. After what seems hours of bashing on the confused human, he finally succumbs.\n\n\n'''Snake Nest'''\n\nUgh! That goblin meat didn't do me any good, but of course there \nare no wholesome (if you can call rats, bats, newts and the like \nwholeseme) creatures around when you need them. So I was \nstaggering around with stomach cramps and worse, when I stumbled \ninto a room with four(!) snakes, and not the small, mostly \nharmless type, either. I fled into a corridor, but one of them \ncaught up with me. I evaporated a potion of water in the hope \nthat it would hurt it worse than me, but that did not work out. \nIn desperation, I grabbed one of the clubs I had collected and \ncast the spell to turn it into a snake of my own. I retreated \nbehind my new pet, and waited while it managed to kill one of the \nsnakes before succumbing. By then I had recovered some magical \nenergy, and with a bit of room between it and me, I blew up a \npotion of confusion in its face. The two nearer snakes then began \nto fight even while I was waiting for the fumes to disperse, \nallowing me to repeat the procedure and then kill the survivors. \nClose call, that.\n\n\n'''A Cloak'''\n\nI found a cloak! It's of dwarven make, and slightly enchanted. \nAnd it's purple, but then, you can't have everything. Who knows, \nI may grow up to be purple too, so it ill behoves me to cast \naspersions.\n\n\n'''Orcs!'''\n\nOrcs! Three and a sorcerer that I can see. As I'm still wounded \nfrom fighting surprisingly nasty gecko, I toss two potions at \nthem, confusion and then poison, and hope for the best. Then I \nretreat, leaving them to choke on the fumes.\n\nAfter a bit of exploring, I come upon more of the ugly brutes in \na corridor - possibly I have found the same group from another \ndirection. I kill the first with a cloud of steam, but then \nstumble on its friends. Two wizards immediately disappear from \nsight, but that does not protect them from my confusion bomb. I \ndispatch them forthwith, but am a bit overenthusiastic, so that \ntheir brethren manage to crowd up on me. I grab a handful of \narrows and transform them to snakes, but manage only on the \nsecond try. Wounded and out of magic, I retreat behind them. They \nmanage to kill one orc and wound another before they are \ndefeated. By then I am recovered enough to cast another spell, \nand steam-boil the remaining orcs.\n\nThe experience leaves me hungry, but yet strangely elated. I now \nunderstand several passages in the Book of Changes that have \nbaffled me before. It is a spell that will allow me to take the \nshape of a gigantic, venomous spider - I shall memorize it \nimmediately!\n\n\n'''The End (post mortem)'''\n\nMe is Grrunk. I is orc. I kill nasty little dragonling. I hear \nfighting, see him fighting Grraak and Grotz. They look very sick. \nAll the others of my band I not see, I think the little \ndragonling kill them. Me not like the sorcerers, but still \ndragonling must die. He kill Grraak and beat up Grotz. He not \nlook worried when I come, but he not know I have whip of ele... \neleco... many big sparks. I hit him with whip, and he looks surprised. I hit again, and kill him. I loves my sparky whip! Now I write in his book and make funny pictures. Look mom, your Grrunk fancy sorcerer now!\n\n\n<tt><pre>\n358 Zunchur the Ruffian (level 5, 0/34 HPs)\n             Began as a Draconian Transmuter on Jan 30, 2010.\n             Slain by an orc\n             ... wielding a +1,+3 orcish whip of electrocution (13 damage)\n             ... on Level 3 of the Dungeon.\n             The game lasted 00:29:40 (2875 turns).\n\nOverview of the Dungeon\nYou didn't discover anything interesting.\n</pre></tt>"}

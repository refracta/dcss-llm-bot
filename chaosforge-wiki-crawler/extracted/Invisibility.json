For the item ego, see [[Invisibility (ego)]]. For the status, see [[Invisible]].''\n{{flavour|Turns the caster invisible.}}\n\n'''Invisibility''' is a monster-only spell that renders the caster [[invisible]], making it difficult to perceive by players that cannot [[see invisible]]. See the [[Invisible]] page for more details.\n\nThis spell cannot affect targets which are [[Invisible#Backlighting|backlit]] from [[Corona]] or a [[halo]].\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nThe following enemies are [[:Category:Invisible monsters|inherently invisible]] with no need for a spell:\n* {{monsterlink|Ghost moth}}\n* {{monsterlink|Lorocyproca}}\n* {{monsterlink|Shadow wraith}}\n* {{monsterlink|Unseen horror}}\n\n==Notes==\n*Invisibility applied from any source, regardless of spell power, has a duration of 16 to 56 turns. \n*Monsters will generally not use this ability unless you're in line of sight, so you will at least see them for a moment before they become invisible. \n**Do note that monsters ''may'' cast it when in sight of your allies (f.e. your undead minions rushing ahead of you). This can lead to an invisible spellcaster coming right at you, without giving you any hints about its presence until the first attack starts. While this may be a niche case, it is a rather deadly and unexpected one. There are also a few enemies which are inherently invisible and will never be seen, namely [[unseen horror]]s, [[ghost moth]]s, [[shadow wraith]]s, and [[lorocyproca]]s.\n\n==History==\n{{Spell\n|name=Invisibility\n|level=6\n|school1={{Hexes}}\n|school2=\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Burglary]]\n*[[Book of Party Tricks]]\n</div>\n|castingnoise=0\n|spellnoise=0\n|power cap=200\n|range=Self\n|flags=Helpful, Escape, Selfench\n}}\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Invisibility was a player-castable level 6 [[Hexes]] spell.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], players could cast Invisibility on either themselves or another target.\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

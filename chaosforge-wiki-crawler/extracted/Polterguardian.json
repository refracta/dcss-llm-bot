{"title":"Polterguardian","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Polterguardian","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Polterguardians''' are support casters, which give passive [[repel missiles]] to all allies in their [[line of sight]]. They appear in [[the Vaults]] as a part of [[vault warden]] and [[ironbound preserver]] bands, but sometimes they spawn with just 1-2 random monsters.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you see a monster in [[the Vaults]] with the [[Repel Missiles]] effect, that means there's a polterguardian nearby.\n*Polteguardians aren't much of a threat to melee characters, but [[Ranged Weapons]] users should take them out early so they have an easier time hitting other monsters. Casters should do the same if their main spells check [[EV]] (e.g. [[Bombard]] or [[Plasma Beam]]).\n*Many AoE spells (e.g. [[Fireball]], [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]], [[Irradiate]]) ignore EV and are not affected by [[Repel Missiles]].\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.32]], polterguardians were added to the game."}

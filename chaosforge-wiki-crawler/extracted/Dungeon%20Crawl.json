{"title":"Dungeon Crawl","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dungeon_Crawl","type":"raw","data":"'''Linley's Dungeon Crawl''', also known as '''Dungeon Crawl''' or just '''Crawl''', is a [[roguelike]] computer game that began in 1995 as the project of [[Linley Henzell]]. The term is also used to refer to that game's variants, most notably '''Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup'''.\n\n== History ==\n\nVersion 1.0 of ''Crawl'' was made in 1997, and Henzell continued to work on the game until version 3.30 was released in 1999. Following Henzell's departure from the project, a loose coalition of developers officially maintained the game, though visible development has stalled at version 4.0.0's beta 26. Outside contributors, such as Darshan Shaligram, continued to produce patches for the game.\n\nDevelopment team member [[Brent Ross]] worked on Dungeon Crawl 4.1 alpha versions until 2005, rewriting significant parts of the code. Version 4.1 didn't reach a playable state.\n\n== Stone Soup ==\n\n<!--[[Image:Title.png]]-->\n\nIn 2006, the Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup project was formed to pull Dungeon Crawl development out of its perceived state of [[Ensorcelled Hibernation]]. This project is based on the 4.0.0 beta versions, aiming to preserve and improve playability while incorporating several of the features of 4.1 along with ideas from the community. Stone Soup is still being actively developed as of 2022, and most Dungeon Crawl players have switched to it.\n\n==License==\nLinley's Dungeon Crawl is licensed under the \"[http://dungeoncrawl.org/?d.l Crawl General Public License]\", a modification of the [https://nethack.org/common/license.html NetHack General Public License], itself based on the BISON GPL. \n\nDungeon Crawl Stone Soup is licensed under the [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crawl/crawl/master/LICENSE GNU GPL V2 or later]. \n\nBoth variants are open source; the source code for DCSS can be viewed on [https://github.com/crawl/crawl GitHub].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Roguelike]]\n* [[List of Stone Soup versions]]\n\n== External links ==\n\n=== Linley's Dungeon Crawl ===\n\n* [http://www.dungeoncrawl.org/ The official website for Linley's Dungeon Crawl]\n* [http://crawlj.sourceforge.jp/down_e.html Dungeon Crawl Tile Version]\n\n=== Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup ===\n\n* https://crawl.develz.org/ - Official homepage, home of the latest Stone Soup development news, development wiki and bug tracker\n* http://crawl.akrasiac.org/ - The largest official Crawl server, also records online games.

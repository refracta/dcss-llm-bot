{"title":"Vulnerability (status effect)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Vulnerability_(status_effect)","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Your willpower is weaker, making you vulnerable to many magical effects.}}\n\n'''Vulnerability''' (displayed as {{Red|Will/2}}) is a [[status effect]] which temporarily halves the [[willpower]] of its victim, making them more susceptible to many [[Hexes]] and similar effects. Although player-available sources of it are rare, hexers can make good use of it to aid in disabling certain strong-willed opponents. Just be aware that monsters with exceptionally strong will may still be fairly resistant afterwards, and that opponents with unshakeable will are entirely unaffected.\n\n==Sources==\n*Reading a [[scroll of vulnerability]] (affects everything in [[line of sight]], yourself included)\n*The [[Demonspawn mutations#Demonic Touch|Demonic Touch]] mutation at three ranks\n*[[The Enchantress]]'s [[Strip Willpower]] spell\n*The [[:Category:Vuln flavour|melee attacks]] of some monsters:\n**{{monsterlink|phantasmal warrior}}\n**{{monsterlink|nargun}}\n**{{monsterlink|imperial myrmidon}}\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

{"title":"Jessica","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Jessica","type":"raw","data":"{{version024}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Jessica the Apprentice Sorceress''' is a weak [[unique]] caster found very early on. She's generally pretty harmless and extremely fragile, but she occasionally generates with an attack [[wand]] that can make her dangerous.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:2-3\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Melee combatants should lure her around a corner and destroy her at close range. Ranged fighters should simply blast her on sight; she has such low life that she'll fold quickly no matter what. The only time she's a serious threat is if she manages to slow a melee fighter at range and can kite you for several turns, or if you're a caster out of MP with no means of escape.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

{"title":"Bleeding","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bleeding","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n'''Bleeding''' is a [[status effect]] which can occur when a clawed character strikes an opponent in [[Unarmed Combat]]. Each turn the monster will lose up to 3% of their current HP per rank of the [[Claws]] [[mutation]]. Additionally, it causes the opponent to leave blood splotches on the ground wherever it goes so long as the condition lasts.\n\nThe following species have claws naturally:\n*[[Troll]]: Rank 3, 9%/turn\n*[[Ghoul]]: Rank 1, 3%/turn\n*[[Felid]]: Rank 1, 3%/turn\n\nAlternatively, characters under the effect of the [[Dragon Form]] spell gain 3 Claws ranks (9%/turn). Yellow [[draconian]] players can also inflict bleeding with their [[Draconian breath attacks|acidic breath]], and [[Zin]]'s Recite ability may inflict bleeding against worshipers of other gods.\n\nOnly [[:Category:Warm-blooded|warm blood]]ed or [[:Category:Cold-blooded|cold blood]]ed monsters are affected. This makes most insubstantial, arthropods, undead, demonic, holy, and nonliving monsters immune to the effects of bleeding.\n\n==History==\nRemoved in [[0.17]].\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]\n[[Category:Threats]]"}

Equipping it will cause it to auto-identify. Any spell cast while wielding a staff of wizardry will have an improved [[spell success]] rate, allowing you to cast powerful high-level spells before you've actually trained the skills necessary for it.\n\nThe staff can also be used in combat, functioning as a +0 [[staff]]. Unlike some other magical staves, it provides no magical  combat effects, but you can still improve your damage output, accuracy, and attack speed through training [[Fighting]] and [[Staves]].\n\n==Strategy==\nThis staff is useful for any caster, but high level characters may have the skills and [[intelligence]] needed to reliably cast high-level spells without it. For some species, this staff is the best means of having access to the most powerful spells in the game, but others may eventually find it unnecessary. Switch to another weapon or [[magical staff]] if you find yourself in that second category.\n\n==History==\n*Staves of wizardry were removed in [[0.26]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the staff provided a slightly better bonus to [[wizardry]] than a [[ring of wizardry]].\n*Prior to [[0.8]], the chance of a staff of wizardry auto-identifying when wielded depended on the [[Spellcasting]] skill of the wielder."}

You cannot cast this spell on a monster. This boulder rolls in a straight line away from you, but for every tile moved, it has a 20% chance to wobble to either direction (10% to the left, 10% to the right).<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|mon-act.cc|1035}}</ref>\n\nWhenever the boulder collides with a monster, it takes damage and is knocked back. If there are other monsters behind the victim, all the monsters are pushed back in a chain. If a monster is pushed into a wall or impassible terrain (e.g. deep water, [[lava]]), it takes extra knockback damage (2d11 at max power). Then, the boulder itself takes 2d5 damage.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|spl-damage.cc|4686}}</ref>\n\nIf the boulder hits a wall, it is destroyed and explodes in a 3x3 area. This deals the same damage as a boulder impact, but is reduced thrice by [[AC]].\n\nThe boulder is treated as a monster: you cannot move into its tile, and it can be destroyed by attacks. It moves at [[Movement#Monster Speed|speed]] 20 and has base HP of 27 (which is randomized like other monsters; does not depend on power). It can travel through deep water without being slowed down. It disappears after it leaves your [[line of sight]].\n\n==Strategy==\n*While its damage is lower than [[Stone Arrow]], the boulder can hit the same enemy multiple times. This spell can also be used to [[kite]].\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|boulders will move one tile immediately upon being cast. Their HP will increase with spellpower and will generally be higher. Boulders won't take damage when running into enemies. Also, there will be no fragmentation explosion when the boulder is destroyed, which will happen only upon hitting a wall or moving into an enemy that cannot be moved. Boulders will no longer apply a ministun to pushed enemies. They won't veer off course, but will take abrasive damage when moving next to walls or solid features. Finally, boulder damage will be increased.}}\n*Brom's Barelling Boulder was introduced in 0.31.\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

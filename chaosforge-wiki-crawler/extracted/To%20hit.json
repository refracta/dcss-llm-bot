It is one of the two key factors in determining the success of an attack, the other being damage.\n\nThe to hit can be calculated for melee and ranged attacks, and is calculated differently for players and monsters.  The largest factors for players are weapon (or unarmed) skill and fighting skill - with good training on both skills and decent dexterity, it should be rare to miss most targets.\n\n==To-hit vs EV==\nThe higher an attack's to-hit is compared to the opponent's [[evasion]], the more likely the attack is to land:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|attack.cc|1197}}</ref>\n\n*2.5% of the time, the attack misses regardless of the attack's to-hit or the defender's EV.\n*2.5% of the time, the attack hits regardless of the attack's to-hit or the defender's EV.\n*Else, the game checks if <code>1d(to-hit + 1) - 1 â‰¥ 2d(2 * EV - 1)/2</code>. If this equation is true, then the attack hits. Otherwise the attack misses.\n\n==Player To Hit (Weapons)==\nThe player's to-hit in melee and ranged combat is determined by the following factors:\n\n====Base Value====\n*Start with <code>14 + dex/2 + 1d(Fighting + 1)</code>.\n\n====Weapons====\n*Add <code>1d(weapon skill + 1) -1 </code> (number from 0 to weapon skill).\n*Add weapon base accuracy. (Unarmed has +2, or +4 with [[Claws]])\n*Add weapon [[enchant]]ment and any [[slaying]] bonuses.\n\n====Other modifiers====\n*If in wisp, fungus, pig, or non-vampire bat form, add <code>[1d(XL * 100 + 100) / 100] - 1</code> instead of using your weapon skill above.\n*Subtract 5 for [[vertigo]].\n*If you have the eyeballs mutation, add <code>2 * eyeballs_level + 1</code>\n\n====The Roll====\n*Take this total and roll <code>1d(total) - 1</code>.\n\n====Post Roll====\n*Subtract 5 from wearing the [[Amulet of the Air]] or if you [[Ru#Sacrifices|Sacrificed Eye]] for Ru.\n*Subtract 5 if confused.\n*Subtract 6 if you cannot see the target (invisibility).\n*Add 2 + roll between 0 and 7 if the target is backlit ([[Corona]], [[Sticky Flame]], or under a [[halo]]).\n*Subtract 2 + roll between 0 and 3 if the target is in umbra and you do not have night vision (from Dithmenos & Yredelemnul).\n*The [[Confusing Touch]] spell grants +0 to +(DEX-1).\n**Being in the following forms grant bonuses:\n***[[Statue Form]]: 0 to +8\n***[[Dragon Form]]: 0 to +9\n***[[Necromutation|Lich form]]: 0 to +9\n***[[Ice Form]]: 0 to +9\n***[[Spider Form]]: 0 to +9\n***[[Bat Form]]: 0 to +11\n***[[Blade Hands]]: 0 to +11\n***[[Fungus Form]]: 0 to +9\n***[[Tree Form]]: 0 to +9\n***[[Wisp Form]]: 0 to +9\n\n==Monster To Hit (Melee)==\nA monster's to hit is calculated as follows:\n\n===Base Value===\nThe base value is 18.\n\n===Hit Dice===\nMonsters with the [[Fighter flag|Fighter class flag]] get a bonus of +(2.5 * [[HD]]). Other monsters get +(1.5 * HD). Decimals are rounded down.\n\n===Situational Modifiers===\n*An aquatic monster \"using the terrain to its advantage\" gets +5.\n*A monster wielding a weapon receives that weapon's inherent and magical to hit modifiers.\n*A [[confused]] monster gets -5.\n*A monster attacking a [[Corona|backlit]] defender gets +2 to +9.\n*A monster attacking an invisible target suffers a 35% penalty to its to hit number.\n\n==Monster To Hit (Ranged)==\nRanged attacks (\"beams\", to use the game's internal terminology) have a to hit number, just like melee attacks do. This is modified as follows:\n*If you are invisible and the attacker can't see invisible, the to hit number is halved.\n*If you have [[Repel Missiles]], the to hit number is reduced ''by'' a random number between 0 and 1/2 of its value (rounded down).\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Game_mechanics]]"}

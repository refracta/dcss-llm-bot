{"title":"Good item","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Good_item","type":"raw","data":"{{version}}\n{{stub}}\n\nThe term '''good item''' refers to any item which is weighted toward being better than average (enchantment bonuses, better base type, etc.). In maps and vaults these items are represented by the symbol '''*'''. Item level is 5 + 2*item_level, which means that a good item in D:5 is just a normal item in D:15\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]\n[[Category:Items]]"}

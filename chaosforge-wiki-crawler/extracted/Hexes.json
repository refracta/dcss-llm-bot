{"title":"Hexes","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hexes","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n'''Hexes''' are spells that affect things and monsters (usually negatively). They mostly ignore dealing direct damage in favour of inflicting debilitating status effects on enemies. Many effects are resisted by [[willpower]], which can be reduced by a [[scroll of vulnerability]] or an [[orb]] of [[guile]].\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n{{spell table by level|Hexes}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{spell sources|Hexes|Book of Debilitation,Book of Hexes,Book of Maledictions,Book of Misfortune}}\n\n==History==\n*[[0.28]] Added [[Enfeeble]] and [[Anguish]].

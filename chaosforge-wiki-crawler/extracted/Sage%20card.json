{"title":"Sage card","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sage_card","type":"raw","data":"{{Obsolete}}\nThe Sage card temporarily diverts incoming XP towards a skill. The closer a skill is to level 20, the more likely it is to be selected, though every skill is eligible. Gives a [[manual]]-like bonus at power 1 and 2.\n\nMultiple Sage effects stack, even if they affect the same skill, so if the player has a +10% Sage for 1000 xp and a +24% Sage for 2000 xp, the combined Sages will steal 3000 xp total, putting 3580 xp into that skill.\n\n==History==\nThe Sage card could be found in the following [[Decks|decks]] before it was removed in [[0.15]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.11]]\n![[0.12]]\n![[0.13]]\n![[0.14]]\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n|----\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

{"title":"Mutation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mutation","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|The Dungeon contains many sources of mutagenic radiation and magical contamination, which may cause your character to gain semi-permanent mutations if affected. You can use the 'A' command to view a list of any mutations that you have acquired. Individual mutations can be examined in further detail by pressing the letter they are labelled with.\n\nMany mutations are actually beneficial to your character, but there are plenty of nasty ones as well. Some mutations have multiple levels, each of which counts as a single mutation.\n\nIt is more difficult to get rid of bad mutations than to get one. Using potions of mutation will remove a number of your current mutations, but will give you more mutations. These might be better to your taste. However, the only sure-fire ways is to join the gods Zin or Jiyva, each of whom provides some remedy against mutations.}}\n\n'''Mutations''' are genetic oddities you may receive during your travels in the dungeon. Often acquired at random, they may be helpful or debilitating. To learn specifics about each mutation, see the '''[[:Category:Mutations|full list of mutations]]''' or read:\n*[[Good mutations]]\n*[[Bad mutations]]\n*[[Demonspawn mutations]]\n*[[Jiyva mutations]]\n\n==Useful Info==\nMutations induce various properties to your character, good or bad. [[Robust]] increases your max HP, [[Frail]] reduces it. Most species' gimmicks are defined by their starting mutations. Some mutations are transient (temporary), and are cured by gaining XP. Otherwise, mutations are permanent - they'll last until you have a way to remove mutations, usually [[potions of mutation]].\n\n[[Undead]] characters cannot mutate. In situations where a living character would gain a mutation, the undead suffer [[stat drain]], which can be cured by gaining XP.\n\n===Innate===\nMutations from your [[species]], whether on start or by level up, are considered \"innate\". These mutations can never be reduced or removed, though they may be improved (e.g. [[Minotaur]]'s [[Horns]] 2 may lengthen into Horns 3). All other sorts of mutation you'll get can be removed freely.\n\nUnless you are a [[Demonspawn]], innate mutations do not contribute towards [[silver]]'s damage bonus. For each \"acquired\" or demonspawn mutation you have, you take +5% damage from silver weapons (max. +75%).\n\n===Conflicting mutations===\nCertain mutations conflict, so you can't have Fire Resistance and Fire Vulnerability at the same time. Also, mutations may conflict with [[species]] physiology: e.g. [[Octopodes]] can't get [[Claws]] or [[Horns]], and [[Merfolk]]'s tails don't support [[Talons]] or [[Hooves]].\n\n==Viewing Mutations==  \nYou can view all of your current mutations by pressing '''[[A]]'''. In the default settings for the A screen, mutations are displayed in different colors according to type:\n*Innate mutations (from your [[species]]), good or bad, are blue. They can never be permanently removed.\n**Mutations that are a combination of innate and acquired are displayed in cyan (good) or magenta (bad).\n*Acquired good mutations are light grey.\n*Acquired bad mutations are red.\n*Transient mutations (temporary) are light magenta and between brackets.\n*Mutations that are currently suppressed due to a [[transformation]] are dark grey.\n\n==Gaining Mutations==\nThere are many ways to gain external mutations - most are weighted towards the negative.\n\n===Good mutations===\n*[[Jiyva]] offers mutation gifts as you gain [[piety]], including its own [[Jiyva mutations|selection of mutations]] to followers.\n\n===Random mutations===\n*[[Xom]] can mutate you - depending on the action, it can be good, bad, or purely random.\n*[[Potions of mutation]] removes 2-3 mutations, then gives 1-3. Each added mutation has a 60% chance to be good, and 40% chance to be random.\n\n===Bad mutations===\nThese sources (\"malmutations\") have an 80% chance to give you a [[bad mutation]], and a 20% chance for a random one.\n\n*The [[Malmutate]] spell is most common source of malmutation, cast by a small variety of monsters ([[neqoxec]], [[shining eye]], [[cacodemon]], [[orb of fire]]).\n*[[Mnoleg]] can malmutate you on melee attacks (25% chance).\n*Any [[magic contamination]] over 5000 has a chance to malmutate you. Mutations induced this way will ignore mutation resistance 50% of the time (even bypassing [[Zin]]'s protection).<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|timed-effects.cc|105}}<br>The 4th property, \"force_mutation\", has its value set to coinflip - so it's a 50% chance to ignore all resistances.</ref>\n\nAlso, [[Jiyva]]'s [[divine retribution|wrath]] can inflict bad mutations 100% of the time (no chance for random mutation).\n\n===Transient Mutations===\nThese mutations are always bad, but are temporary, and will be cured by gaining XP.\n\n*[[Hell's mystical force]] - Whenever you go downstairs in any of the 4 [[Hell]] branches, you have a 25% chance to get a transient mutation.\n*[[Corrupting Pulse]] inflicts 1-2 transient mutations per use. Most often seen from [[wretched star]]s.\n\n==Removing Mutations==\nThere are only a few ways to remove permanent mutations:\n\n*A [[potion of mutation]] removes 2-3 mutations, then gives 1-3.\n**Followers of [[Zin]] at 6* piety can drink potions to remove mutations. There's no chance to gain mutations, so there's no hit to piety.\n*[[Jiyva]] has a 25% chance to remove a mutation level for each existing mutation, doubled if its a bad mutation, whenever it gifts new ones.\n*One possible effect of Zin's wrath is to remove all of your good mutations.\n\nIf you get a conflicting mutation (e.g. getting [[Frail]] when you have non-innate [[Robust]]), they'll generally cancel each other out. Also, when you gain a random mutation, you may lose a mutation instead - see below for details.\n\n==Mutation Resistance==\nSources of mutation resistance stack multiplicatively:\n*The rMut item property (found only on [[Hat of the Alchemist]] and [[lajatang of Order]]) gives a 66% chance to block bad mutations and a 50% chance to block transient mutations. The item property does not stack with itself.\n*The [[Good mutations#Mutation Resistance|Mutation Resistance]] mutation can block mutations based on its level. Level 1 gives a 66% chance to block permanent mutations and a 50% chance to block transient mutations. Level 2 also gives a 50% chance to block mutations from being removed. Level 3 gives a 100% chance to block incoming mutations and their removal (except from gods and contamination).\n*[[Zin]] provides a <code>piety / 1.6</code>% chance to block mutations. At 6* piety, this is 100% immunity (except for contamination).\n*[[Ashenzari]] provides immunity to mutations that would shatter a [[curse]]d item, like [[Horns]] with a cursed [[helmet]]. This applies 100% of the time to non-innate mutations, even from contamination.\n*Being [[undead]] ([[Ghoul]], [[Mummy]], [[Death Form]], but ''not'' [[Vampire]]) provides full, absolute immunity to mutation. Instead, you \"rot\" when mutating, causing [[stat drain]].\n\nWhen affected by \"random\" mutation (not \"good\" or \"bad\"), you have a <code>6.5% * non_innate_muts</code> chance to prevent it. Each time you resist this way, you have 33% chance to lose a mutation. [[Xom]] ignores this 67% of the time.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe mutation system in ''Crawl'' can be quite punishing:\n*Generally, the bad mutations are more bad than good mutations are good. [[Teleportitis]] randomly teleports you towards monsters, like you're hit by constant [[sourceless malevolence]]. [[No Unsafe Scrolls]]/[[No Unsafe Potions|Potions]] prevents using life-saving consumables. The best good mutations are the likes of resistances & extra HP, which come nowhere close to compensating the potentially lethal effects of the worst mutations.\n*Unless you worship [[Jiyva]], the only reliable way to remove mutations are [[potions of mutation]], which are finite and random. If you're using potions to remove a specific mutation, you can fail to remove that mutation, or introduce even worse ones in the process.\n\nTherefore, you should treat potions of mutation as a 'semi-permanent' resource, and bad mutations as a 'semi-permanent' cost. Try to avoid malmutation at all possible - see the [[Malmutate#Strategy|Malmutate]] article for more details how. Also, it is unadvised to drink potions in hopes of a good mutation: they are your ''only'' way of curing bad mutations, and it often takes multiple potions to get a tolerable mutation set.\n\nYour [[species]]' innate mutations are often ''the'' defining aspect of your species. See the [[Species#Species List|individual species pages]] for more information.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], [[Ashenzari]] did not provide protection against mutations.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], [[Jiyva]] had the ability to Cure Bad Mutations. Its mutation gifting logic was also changed between versions.\n*Prior to their removal in [[0.27]], [[Halfling]]s started with a level of mutation resistance.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], random mutations could be obtained by eating [[mutagenic corpse|mutagenic]] [[chunk]]s. Also, [[Zin]]'s mutation protection was 100% at 200 piety instead of 160 piety.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], there were [[potions of cure mutation]] and [[potions of beneficial mutation]]; regular [[potions of mutation]] gave random mutations and didn't remove any. Also, Zin offered a 1-time ability at 6* to cure every mutation you had (instead of cleansing mutation potions).\n*Prior to [[0.20]], undead would sometimes rot instead of taking stat damage in place of mutations, and [[Mummies]] had a self-restoration ability.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], there was an [[amulet of resist mutation]], and rMut from the amulet or from artifacts gave a 90% chance to resist.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], the [[Hat of the Alchemist]] did not grant mutation resistance.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], vampires had differing responses to mutations at different satiation levels.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], there were [[potions of gain strength]], [[potions of gain dexterity|dexterity]], and [[potions of gain intelligence|intelligence]] in place of the [[potion of beneficial mutation]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], [[Polymorph Other]] (whether from a wand or the monster version of the spell) could inflict bad mutations on you. It was replaced by Malmutate.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Mutations]]"}

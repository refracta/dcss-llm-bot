{"title":"Petrifying Cloud","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Petrifying_Cloud","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Exhales calcifying dust, which petrifies anyone affected for longer than a brief moment.}}\n\n'''Petrifying Cloud''' is a monster-only spell which emits a stream of [[cloud]]s of calcifying dust, dealing minor damage on impact. Anything that ends its turn inside a cloud has a chance to start [[petrify]]ing. The higher your [[XL]] ([[HD]] for monsters), the less likely for the petrification attempt is to be successful.\n\nFor players, those who are a [[Gargoyle]], in certain forms ([[Statue Form]], [[Shadow Form]], [[Storm Form]], [[Wisp Form]]), or under [[Zin]]'s Vitalisation are immune to petrification, while [[Qazlal]] makes you immune to all clouds. You'll still take impact damage, though. For monsters, [[List of gargoyles|gargoyles]], [[statue]]s, [[insubstantial]] monsters, [[earth elemental]]s, and [[catoblepae]] themselves are similarly immune.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

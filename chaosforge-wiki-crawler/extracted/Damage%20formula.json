{"title":"Damage formula","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Damage_formula","type":"raw","data":"{{stub}}\n\nThere isn't a single, general purpose '''damage formula''', but different types of damage have different means of calculating damage.\n\nIn general, damage can be calculated as <code>[(Raw Damage) - (Damage Reduction)] * (Chance to hit)</code> over an action's given speed.\n\n===Raw Damage<ref>not to be confused with weapons' base damage</ref>===\n*'''[[Weapon damage]]:''' which covers damage calculation for player [[weapon]]s, [[unarmed combat]], and [[throwing]].\n*'''Spell damage:''' Most [[spell]]s, [[wand]]s, and monster abilities deal damage in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation dice notation], and deal <code>nD( ([[Spellpower]] * multiplier / divisor) + constant)</code>. Spellpower is determined by skill (and for monsters, [[HD]]). Each spell has its own multiplier, divisor, and constant. See a spell's own page for more details. \n**If the dice has a non-integer amount of sides, it is ''often'' rounded in a weighted manner. That is, 1d1.25 has a 25% chance to be 1d2 and a 75% chance to be 1d1. However, this varies on a case-by-case basis; sometimes dice round down or round to the nearest integer.\n**Certain spells like [[Shatter]] may further be multiplied by external factors.\n**By default, spells check [[AC]] and [[EV]]. Some may ignore one or the other, or both.\n*'''[[Poison#Poisoned Condition|Poison]]''' deals damage over time. The more poison you receive, the more the poison \"stacks\", and the faster you take damage.\n*Certain effects like [[Agony]], [[Torment]], and [[flay]] are percentages of your maximum health.\n\nDamage from monsters is unknown(?), but their maximum damage is displayed on examination.\n\n----\n\n<references />\n\n===Other Factors===\n*'''[[To-hit]]:''' Determines accuracy (chance ''to-hit'') of an attack. Some attacks can't miss, which is an infinite to-hit.\n*'''[[Weapon speed]]''': Determines how [[delay|fast]] you swing/fire a weapon or fists. Most [[spell]]s have a delay of 1.0.\n\n===Damage Reduction===\n*'''[[Resistance]]s''' reduce damage of a [[damage type|specific type]]. Player and monster resistances are not symmetrical.\n*'''[[Armour class]] (AC)''' will reduce most attacks by (0 to AC) damage.\n**Physical attacks in melee against the player are affected by [[guaranteed damage reduction]] (GDR), which increase the minimum AC roll.\n*'''[[Evasion]] score (EV)''' determines how likely you are to dodge an avoidable attack completely. See [[Evasion#To-hit_versus_EV]] for formulas.\n*'''[[Shield]] score (SH)''' determines how likely you are to block an attack completely. Melee attacks, ranged attacks, and certain projectile-like spells can be blocked. See [[Shields#Blocking]] for formulas"}

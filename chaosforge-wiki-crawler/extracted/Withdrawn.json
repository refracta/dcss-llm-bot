{"title":"Withdrawn","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Withdrawn","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\nCertain monsters with shells will become '''withdrawn''' if injured sufficiently, retreating into their shells for safety. In this state they refrain from attacking and attempt to recover their health. This gives them a +10 boost to [[AC]] and boosts their HP [[regeneration rate]], but makes them stationary and unaggressive. They will eventually return to combat if allowed to recover, but it is generally easy to finish them off before this happens.\n\nMonsters that can use this ability:\n*[[Snapping turtle]]\n*[[Alligator snapping turtle]]\n\n==History==\nThis monster ability was removed in [[0.19]].\n\n[[Category:Monster attributes]]"}

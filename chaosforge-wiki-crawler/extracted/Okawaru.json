{"title":"Okawaru","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Okawaru","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n[[File:Okawaru altar.png]] \"Bring me glory in combat!\"''\n\n{{flavour|Okawaru is a dangerous and powerful god of battle. Followers are expected to constantly prove themselves in combat, and may channel Okawaru's might to enhance their prowess. Okawaru demands that followers prove themselves by their own strength alone, and so worshippers are forbidden from gaining allies by any means. Okawaru pays little heed to easy victories, but will reward worshippers for heroic feats against mighty foes.\n\nFollowers of Okawaru will gain the ability to temporarily increase their skills in combat, and, much later, to deal much faster blows. Okawaru will eventually gift followers with throwing weapons, weapons and armour. The most favoured of Okawaru may challenge their foes to honourable single combat.}}\n\n==Racial Restrictions==\n[[Demigod]]s cannot worship Okawaru (or any other god).\n\n==Appreciates==\n*Killing powerful monsters. Monsters with a higher XP value, relative to your [[XL]], give higher amounts of piety. Consequently, weak monsters give almost none.\n\n==Prevents==\nOkawaru prevents the creation of allied monsters. You are unable to use any magic or items to create allies, and reactive abilities (such as from the [[ratskin cloak]]) simply will not work. [[Fire Storm]] creates hostile fire vortices. Entities that are proxies of magical effects: [[orbs of destruction]], [[ball lightning]], [[battlesphere]]s, [[spectral weapon]]s, [[foxfire]]s, and [[fulminant prism]]s, are unaffected. (For example, Orb of Destruction is like a larger [[Magic Dart]], and Okawaru doesn't block Magic Dart).\n\n==Deprecates==\n*Inactivity: You lose 1 piety per 340 turns, on average (1/17 chance every 20 turns).\n\n==Given Abilities==\n'''Piety level (0):''' \"Struggler\"\n* No granted abilities.\n\n'''Piety level (*):''' \"Combatant\"\n*'''Heroism''' - Increases all non-magic skills by 5. [[Evocations]], [[Invocations]], and [[Shapeshifting]] are not boosted. No skill is increased past 27. You don't get any extra HP from the Fighting skill. Invocations increases the duration: <code>9 + 2d(Invocations * 6) / 2</code> turns, up to 100 turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|ability.cc|2811}}</ref> (2 MP, 3-5 piety)\n\n'''Piety level (**):''' \"Warrior\"\n*No new abilities.\n\n'''Piety level (***):''' \"Knight\"\n*No new abilities.\n\n'''Piety level (****):''' \"Myrmidon\"\n*'''Finesse''' - Halves the action delay of melee and ranged attacks, doubling your [[attack speed]]. This does not stack with [[haste]] or [[berserk]]. Invocations increases the duration: <code>9 + 2d(Invocations * 6) / 2</code> turns, up to 100 turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|ability.cc|2829}}</ref> (5 MP, 5-8 piety)\n\n'''Piety level (*****):''' \"Warmonger\"\n*'''Duel''' - Transports you and a single sufficiently worthy (considered \"high\" or \"lethal\" [[threat]] on examination; dependent on your [[XL]] and monster XP value) monster into Okawaru's arena, and immediately temporarily restores half of your missing HP and MP. Dueling will not prevent your opponent from creating more monsters in the arena, so watch out! However, it does prevent [[Banishment]].\n:Once you defeat the monster, Okawaru will immediately kick you out of the arena, and you will return to the same position, HP and MP as you had prior to using Duel. Items dropped in the Arena are placed at your feet, creating an Okawaru altar if necessary to prevent the items being lost in deep water or lava. (7 MP, 5-8 piety)\n:*Abandoning Okawaru while in the arena will immediately kick you (and the monster) out.\n\n'''Piety level (******):''' \"Victor of a Thousand Battles\"\n*'''Receive Armour and Weapon''' - Okawaru offers a choice of one of four weapons, and separately, a choice of one of four armour pieces (including shields). Like a scroll of acquirement, you can use these abilities, see the options, then press '''Esc''' to cancel and pick at a later time.\n:Each one of the available items is of [[scroll of acquirement]] quality. They are influenced by your skills upon using each ability. For the Armour gift, [[body armour]] is much more common than with a regular scroll of acquirement. (No cost, but you can only receive one armour and one weapon per game.)\n\n==Gifts==\n'''Piety level (*****): '''Throwing ammunition''' \n*Whenever you gain piety, if your gift timeout equals 0, you have a <code>40% * (piety - 121) / piety</code> chance to receive some [[Throwing]] ammunition. This includes [[boomerang]]s, [[javelin]]s, [[large rock]]s (if usable), and [[dart]]s; notably excluding [[throwing net]]s.\n:After receiving a gift, the [[gift timeout]] increases to <code>25 + (2d19)/2</code> (26 - 44) piety. Gaining piety will lower the gift timeout. Note that when you have a gift timeout with Okawaru, piety gain for all purposes except gifts is reduced.\n\n==Punishments==\n{{flavour|Okawaru's most vicious warriors are sent against rebellious servants. Novices find themselves swarmed by packs of ogres and gnolls, while champions are surrounded by titans and elvish blademasters.}}\nWhile under penance, Okawaru will sometimes [[divine retribution|punish]] you by sending 1d(experience level/5) hostile, [[durably summoned]] monsters to fight you. These monsters can range from packs of orcs to titans, reflecting your experience level.\n\nIn general, if you can survive [[The Vaults|Vaults:5]], you can survive Okawaru's wrath. The monsters Okawaru summons are no worse than those encountered there, although there is always the possibility that they will be summoned at a particularly inopportune moment.\n\nIf there is nowhere within your line of sight for these monsters to be summoned to, the message, \"Okawaru's forces are busy with other wars,\" will appear instead.\n\n==Strategy==\nOkawaru is a simple, straightforward god that boosts all forms of physical combat. In return, you are unable to use any form of [[ally|allies]].  Unlike [[Trog]], most forms of magic are fair game.\n\n*You'll often rely on Okawaru's 2 buffs: an invoked [[Heroism]] effect at * and a [[Finesse]] effect at ****. Both abilities offer strong boosts to both melee and ranged combat. Their only costs are piety (and a small amount of MP). \n:Previously, it was recommended to \"use Heroism on any remotely threatening fight\". As Heroism's piety cost was increased greatly, this no longer applies. Still, you shouldn't hesitate to buff in dangerous situations - dying with max piety won't help a bit.\n\n* Duel allows you to bring a monster for a 1v1 fight. It can be used for taking out support monsters, such as a [[moth of wrath]], or to fight a tough monster without its cohorts. However, once you've used this ability, the only way to escape is to win the fight or abandon Okawaru. Also, once the duel ends, the enemies outside will have a free turn to hit you.<!--I haven't checked this for 0.32, but this was true for 0.31!-->\n**You can also use this ability in a tight situation, in order to get free turns to buff yourself. While your HP and MP are reset after a duel, other status conditions are not. You can use the Okawaru buffs, Might, etc. while in the Arena, then retain those buffs when you leave.\n\n*Okawaru's 6* gifts can very strong; a +6 [[broad axe]] of electrocution by [[Lair]] (or so) is a major power boost. But, like a regular scroll of acquirement, [[RNG]] could give you nothing but trash.\n**Since your gifts are influenced by your current skill, a possible strategy is to delay a bit before getting the Armour gift. If you only have 5 Armour skill, for instance, you're likely to get trash [[robe]]s and [[acid dragon scales]] instead of heavy armour. However, this is often dubious, since it sacrifices the ''immediate'' gain that Receive Armour could give you.\n\nIn the [[extended game]], Okawaru remains a decent god. While Heroism will be useless (due to an abundance of XP), Finesse is helpful for the entire game, and Duel is a strong panic button. Nevertheless, a [[good god]] (namely [[TSO]]) may be preferable. If you do plan on abandoning Okawaru, be sure to have a safe place to explore whilst facing retribution. The [[Crypt]] is usually a good area to do so. Having good escape potential (like with [[Blink]]) is also helpful.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], using Duel did not affect your HP and MP, Okawaru did not immediately kick you out of the Arena when finished allowing some time to recover, and Duel cost twice as much piety. \n*Prior to [[0.31]], Okawaru gifted weapons and armour over time, instead of having one-time use abilities at 6*. Also, Throwing gifts were available at 3*, had a much lower gift timeout, and were more likely if you had more [[Throwing]] skill. In addition, there was a minimum of 0.2 attack delay, so Finesse was weaker if your attack delay was lower than 0.4.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Okawaru abilities were cheaper: Heroism cost 1-2 piety, and Finesse cost 3-5.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Okawaru would gift [[ammo]] for [[ranged weapon]]s, but only if you trained their respective skill. Throwing ammunition was also twice as plentiful.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Okawaru did not forbid the use of allies. Thus, Oka's 5* [[Titles|title]] was Commander, with the 4* title being Warmonger. Finesse was a 5* ability, as Duel was not introduced.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Okawaru would get angry if you attacked your own allies.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Finesse could be blocked by [[stasis]]; both of Okawaru's abilities cost more piety, but lasted longer even at low Invocations skill. \n*Prior to [[0.17]], Finesse caused [[magic contamination]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Okawaru would only give ammo for skills of level 8 and higher, and would grant piety for [[pray]]ing over enemy [[corpse]]s (the stronger, the better).\n*Prior to [[0.14]], allowing your allies to die incurred piety loss and the Demonspawn [[Demonic Guardian]] mutation was suppressed.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Okawaru didn't care about the death of elementals.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], Okawaru's granted powers were [[Might]] and [[Haste]] instead of the current [[Heroism]] and [[Finesse]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{gods}}"}

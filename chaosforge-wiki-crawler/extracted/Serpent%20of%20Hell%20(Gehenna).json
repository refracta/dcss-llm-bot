{"title":"Serpent of Hell (Gehenna)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Serpent_of_Hell_(Gehenna)","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | dragons}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe '''Serpent of Hell''' is a unique dragon whose elemental affinity varies based on which branch of [[Hell]] you encounter it in. When faced in [[Gehenna]], the Serpent is capable of breathing great gouts of [[fire]] and is completely immune to flames.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Preparations for Gehenna largely render you ready for handling this iteration of the Serpent of Hell: two or three ranks of fire resistance render its Fire Breath much less devastating. If you ''don't'' have that degree of fire resistance already, however, expect to take massive damage.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|this Serpent of Hell will get [[Bolt of Magma]] instead of Flaming Cloud. Also, it will have an extra 43 HP.}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], this Serpent of Hell had [[damnation]] resistance.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], this Serpent of Hell had [[Hellfire]] instead of [[Flaming Cloud]].\n*In [[0.16]], it got the third breath attack, [[Fireball]].\n*In ancient versions of ''Crawl'', the Serpent of Hell did not appear as a unique monster, but rather as a generic dragon that could be found guarding the lowest level of Gehenna en masse. While they may have had fewer hit points, the fact they could appear in considerable numbers made them more dangerous than the single monster ever was: facing multiple 20-HD hellfire-breathing dragons at a time was often a quick death."}

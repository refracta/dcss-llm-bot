{"title":"Confusing Touch","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Confusing_Touch","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Confusing Touch''' is a level 3 [[Hexes]] spell which causes your melee attacks to inflict [[confusion]].\n\n[[Enchanter]]s start with this spell in their libraries.\n\n==Effect==\nWhile the spell is active, your melee attacks focus only on touching the target - they deal 0 damage. [[Cleaving]] is disabled, but the [[reaching]] of [[Polearms]] still applies.\n\nIf you hit, your melee attacks will cause [[confusion]] if you can overcome the target's [[willpower]]. You can see your chance of affecting a particular monster by hovering over it with '''x''' while the spell is active.\n\nConfusing Touch has a duration of <code>10 + 1d(power)/5</code> turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|spl-wpnench.cc|29}}</ref> Casting the spell again will increase the duration. However, successfully bypassing willpower, or attempting to confuse a monster immune to confusion, will immediately end the spell (regardless of remaining duration).\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile confusion [[stab]]s aren't nearly as powerful as those from [[Ensorcelled Hibernation]], Confusing Touch has multiple major benefits:\n* Multiple confusion attempts (melee attacks) per cast. This makes Confusing Touch an MP efficient hex.\n* It uses your [[attack delay]] per hex attempt, plus 1 turn to actually cast this spell. For example, a [[dagger]] at mindelay can attempt to confuse every 0.5 turn. If you need to make multiple hex attempts, Confusing Touch is somewhat turn efficient.\n* Confusion lasts longer than sleep. Unlike sleep, confusion allows for multiple stab attempts. And, while monsters can still act when confused, they are effectively disabled. They can't [[spell]]cast and have a hard time hitting you in melee.\n\nOverall, Confusing Touch is a fairly efficient hex. It works well, even at lower success rates. At 20% hex success, Confusing Touch may take 3 MP and 4 turns, while Ensorcelled Hibernation would take 10 MP and 5 turns. However, against low/no will opponents, Ensorcelled has an advantage - you don't need a turn to \"prepare\" it. Also, Confusing Touch forces you to stay at melee range.\n\n[[Short Blades]] naturally combo with Confusing Touch. Short Blades attack quickly, thus applying the spell faster, and they make the most out of stabbing.\n\nWhile both Confusing Touch and [[Mephitic Cloud]] apply the same status condition, they have their differences. Mephitic Cloud checks [[HD]] and [[poison resistance]] instead of willpower, but its clouds can also affect the caster, and it makes considerably more [[noise]]. Confusing Touch, meanwhile, requires only one spell school instead of three (and Hexes is used by many spells convenient for stabber-type characters) and is quiet enough to barely attract attention. \n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Confusing Touch only triggers on melee attacks. If you need to do damage while the spell is still active, ranged attacks, spells, wands, and [[Invocations]] all still work.\n*Since you need to stay at melee range, be wary of dangerous threats with decent willpower. Every turn you spend failing to confuse that [[hydra]] is another free turn for it to chew on you.\n*Because Confusing Touch requires an extra turn to recast it between applications and only affects one creature, it is most effective in one-on-one fights. If you're fighting multiple opponents, try to retreat into a corridor so only one of them can reach you at a time.\n*Land-bound monsters can fall into nearby [[deep water]] or [[lava]] when confused, instantly killing them. Take advantage whenever possible. Note that this also destroys any items they were carrying.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Confusing Touch increased melee [[to-hit]] by 1d([[Dexterity]]).\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Confusing Touch did not automatically end if the target had infinite [[willpower]].\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Confusing Touch was Level 1 and checked monster [[HD]] instead of [[magic resistance]], making it effective on a much wider array of monsters (including many that were otherwise entirely immune to Hexes).\n*Prior to [[0.23]], Confusing Touch did not function when attacking with a weapon, making it much more awkward to use for most characters.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Confusing Touch was a level 2 spell.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], Confusing Touch had a higher success rate.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

{"title":"Sickness","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sickness","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|You have been sickened, and your health will no longer regenerate.}}\n'''Sickness''' is a [[status effect]] that prevents characters from naturally regenerating [[HP]] until it wears off. It does not affect [[Trog]]'s Hand, [[Jiyva]] regeneration, or [[ambrosia]]. Other, non-regeneration sources of healing work normally.\n\n==Sources==\n*Being within [[line of sight]] of an [[ancient zyme]].\n\n==Dealing with==\n'''Immunity'''\n*[[Undead]] ([[Ghoul]], [[Mummy]], bloodless [[Vampire]], [[lichform]]) and [[nonliving]] ([[Gargoyle]], [[Djinn]], [[Statue Form]], [[Storm Form]], [[Wisp Form]]) creatures are immune to sickness.\n*[[Miasma]] immunity confers immunity to sickness. This includes [[demonspawn]] with the [[Foul Stench]] mutation, and players in [[Shadow Form]].\n*[[Zin]]'s Vitalisation provides temporary immunity (but does not cure existing sickness).\n\n'''Curing'''\n*Quaffing a [[potion of cancellation]] cures sickness.\n*[[Elyvilon]]'s Purification also cures sickness.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the status changed colour depending on remaining duration (red -> pink -> yellow).\n*Prior to [[0.27]], sickness was cured by drinking a [[potion of curing]] instead of a potion of cancellation. Also, increased regeneration rates would cause it to wear off more quickly.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], sickness healed slower if hungry.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], sickness had a chance to cause a single point of temporary [[stat]] damage.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], casting [[Haunt]] could inflict sickness.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], [[Kobold]]s would recover from sickness more quickly than other species.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], sickness was one of the many unique [[needle]] [[brand]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], eating contaminated [[chunk]]s would occasionally cause you to become sick. [[Saprovore]]s were partially protected from this. In [[0.13]], [[nausea]] was introduced as an intermediate step between health and sickness. Eating food while nauseous would occasionally induce sickness, but had few downsides on its own.\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

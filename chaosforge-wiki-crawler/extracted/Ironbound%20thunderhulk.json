{"title":"Ironbound thunderhulk","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ironbound_thunderhulk","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{list of | ogres}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful info==\n'''Ironbound thunderhulks''' are lumbering [[list of ogres|ogres]] of the [[Vaults]] armed with a crude electric device. They can smite you with lightning, but only from a distance.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n* Thunderhulks can hit you from the edges of your [[line of sight]], but cannot hit you if you are two tiles away or closer.\n* Up close, they are only somewhat more durable than [[two-headed ogre]]s but hit no harder than a regular [[ogre]] (though unlike normal ogres, they swing at normal speed). Keep close and keep hitting them until they go down.\n* Their [[willpower]] is fairly poor, making them easy to disable with [[Hexes]] or [[wand]]s.\n\n==History==\n*Ironbound thunderhulks received [[Blink Range]] in [[0.28]]. They also went from 12 to 18 HD, increasing the damage of their Call Down Lightning.\n*Ironbound thunderhulks were added in [[0.27]]."}

For its replacement, see [[stat zero]].''\n\n'''Stat death''' occurs 90 turns after one of a character's primary [[attributes]] ([[Strength]], [[Intelligence]], or [[Dexterity]]) lowered to 0 or below. The character will die unless the stat can be restored in time. After 50 turns have passed, the character can be [[paralysis|paralyzed]] which is also very dangerous.\n\nThe following can all drain your attributes:\n*By 1 at a time, and affected (and thus blocked) by [[sustain abilities]]:\n**The [[bad mutations#Deterioration|Deterioration]] mutation. Rank 1 can generally be kept in check by your natural regeneration; ranks 2 and 3 of this mutation are eventually lethal, however.\n**[[Sickness]]\n**The special attacks of certain monsters ([[brain worm]]s, [[quasit]]s, [[shadow]]s, etc.).  Although all three stats can be drained, INT is by far the one most commonly affected.  This is because it is drained by a smite-targeted spell, where the others are drained only through melee attacks.\n**Decomposition (not to be confused with [[rotting]]) from attempted [[mutation]] of an undead character.\n*By more than 1 at a time, but damage can be halved by [[sustain abilities]]:\n**Evoking certain items, such as a [[crystal ball of energy]] or the [[staff of Wucad Mu]].\n**Spell [[miscast effect]]s, as caused by actual miscasts, [[Hell]] effects, and [[Zot trap]]s.\n**Certain spells, such as [[Summon Horrible Things]] or [[Alistair's Intoxication]], have a chance of draining INT when cast.\n*By varying amounts, and not affected at all by sustain abilities:\n**Equipment with negative stat modifiers (but you can remove the equipment to restore the stat).\n\nStats can be more permanently lowered by the following means:\n*[[Mutations]] which affect attributes (directly, or through stiff/loose muscles, some scale mutations, etc.).\n*The [[Focus card]].\n*[[Jiyva]]'s stat shuffling.\n*The [[Shuffle card]].\n\nThe last two will never lower a base stat to zero, but when combined with one of the above effects could still cause stat death.\n\n==Precautions==\nAny character with a particularly low attribute should be aware of the dangers involved. Any attribute below 8 could conceivably be reduced to 0 by a single unfortunate effect, some of which are common, some less so.\n*Cursed equipment can reduce an attribute by up to 6 for as long as it's equipped, so be cautious about wearing unidentified items if you're at risk. This is especially dangerous in regards to INT, as a character with 0 INT cannot read [[scroll]]s (and thus cannot read a [[scroll of remove curse]] in order to remove the offending item). Low-INT characters may wish to keep a [[potion of brilliance]] on hand to give them a window of time in which they can read scrolls.\n*Miscast effects, Hell effects, [[Zot trap]]s, and [[mummy]] [[death curse]]s can temporarily reduce an attribute by up to 7. You may wish to bring all of your attributes up to a minumum of 8 to guarantee that you can survive a single worst-case scenario shot from either one.\n\n==History==\nStat death was removed in [[0.13]]. In its place, characters now suffer some penalties when at [[stat zero]].\n\nPrior to [[0.7]], stat death occurred immediately upon a stat hitting 0.\n\n[[Category:Stats]]\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

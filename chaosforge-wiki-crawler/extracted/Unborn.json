They also possess the ability to [[Injury Mirror|reflect damage]] you inflict upon them back at you. They can be found in [[the Crypt]], [[the Abyss]], and [[the Depths]].\n\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster5\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Agony]]\n|flags1={{Wizard slot flag}}\n|slot2=[[Dispel Undead]] (3d19)\n|flags2={{Wizard slot flag}}\n|slot3=[[Injury Mirror]]\n|flags3={{Priest slot flag}}\n|slot4=[[Animate Dead]]\n|flags4={{Wizard slot flag}}\n|slot5=[[Haunt]]\n|flags5={{Wizard slot flag}}\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Living characters facing unborn should definitely bring at least one rank of [[life protection]] to negate Agony. Undead characters can rely on summoned hordes to block the line of fire necessary for Dispel Undead to hit you. A few shots of [[Abjuration]] can exorcise whatever horrible things Haunt surrounds you with. In the end, though, Mirror Damage is still the most dangerous spell they possess.\n*As with the [[deep dwarf death knight]], when an unborn \"kneels in prayer and is bathed in unholy energy,\" that means it has activated Mirror Damage. In the console game, its glyph will change from a steady brown {{Brown|L}} to an alternating purple {{Magenta|L}} and grey {{DarkGrey|L}}. Tiles players should look for a little red arrow icon. You can also see if Mirror Damage is active by e'''[[x]]'''amining the unborn to see if it is \"reflecting injuries.\" The spell lasts approximately 20 turns.\n*When an unborn is reflecting damage, do not hit it with any big [[Conjurations]]. Even if it isn't reflecting damage, don't use any massive multi-turn spells like [[Ice Storm]], [[Fire Storm]], or [[Tornado]], as it may turn on reflection halfway through the spell. Instead, snipe at it while it is not reflecting, or use summons to take it out.\n\n==History==\n*Unborn were merged into human [[death knight]]s in [[0.17]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], this monster was known as an [[unborn deep dwarf]] and could be found in [[list of deep dwarves|deep dwarven]] bands. Like all deep dwarves, they did not regenerate."}

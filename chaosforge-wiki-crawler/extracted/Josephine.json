{"title":"Josephine","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Josephine","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For the unique found later in the game, see [[Josephina]]. Also see [[Joseph]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Josephine the Decaying Necromancer''' is a [[unique]] [[evil]] [[necromancer (monster)|necromancer]] with some nasty spells in her repertoire. She can drain your HP to heal herself and blast both living and undead characters with ease. She typically wields a branded [[dagger]] and spawns with a pack of [[wraith]]s.\n\nJosephine is an alternate version of [[Josephina]]. If Josephine has spawned, then Josephina won't, and vice-versa.\n\n==Location==\n* [[The Dungeon]]:10-15\n* The [[Orcish Mines]]:2-4\n* [[The Lair]]:4-6\n* [[The Swamp]]:1\n* [[The Shoals]]:1\n* [[The Snake Pit]]:1\n* The [[Spider's Nest]]:1\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you encounter multiple wraiths on an otherwise normal floor, you've likely found Josephine. Fortunately, wraiths make no [[noise]], letting you wait for them to wake up and start coming after you without alerting their master. If you lure them away and kill them in another room, that'll make the fight with Josephine significantly easier, as Josephine is fairly dangerous even without being [[slow]]ed and surrounded.\n*None of Josephine's spells can miss, and only Ghostly Fireball is reduced by [[AC]]; the only real defense against her magic is to pile on whatever sources of [[negative energy resistance]] you have. If you can reach rN+++ without being undead, Josephine's no more dangerous than an old lady with a knife.\n*Because Josephine herself is immune to negative energy, she won't hesitate to use Ghostly Fireball in melee range.\n*[[Undead]] players should try to take her down quickly; [[Dispel Undead Range]] can tear you apart with frightening speed. Dispel undead needs a clear line of fire to hit, however, so [[summon]]s can help here.\n*Like many spellcasters, Josephine is far less dangerous when [[silence]]d.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Josephine knew [[Animate Dead]].\n*In [[0.16]], Josephine's band of [[wraith]]s was added.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Josephine knew [[Bolt of Cold]], [[Agony]], and [[Simulacrum]] instead of Ghostly Fireball, Vampiric Draining, and Dispel Undead. Also, she had no [[negative energy]] resistance.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

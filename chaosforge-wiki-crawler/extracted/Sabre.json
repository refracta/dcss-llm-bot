It is a one handed weapon, and it is better for the dexterous.}}\n\nThe '''sabre''' is the short blade with the highest base damage, making it a desirable choice for both [[stabbing]] and actual melee combat (though [[quick blade]]s are generally considered more powerful, particularly when coupled with a high [[slaying]] bonus). Sabres are fairly uncommon, but some early- and mid-game monsters wield them (such as the deep elves of the [[Elven Halls]]).\n\nNote that sabres are special-cased to have a minimum delay of 5, even though all other weapons with a base delay of 12 have a min delay of 6.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.14]], sabres were renamed to [[cutlass]]es.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Common || Dwarven || Elven || Orcish\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Sabre1.png]] || [[File:Dwarven sabre1.png]] || [[File:Elven sabre1.png]] || [[File:Orcish sabre1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Sabre2.png]] || [[File:Dwarven sabre2.png]] || [[File:Elven sabre2.png]] || [[File:Orcish sabre2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Sabre3.png]] || N/A || N/A || N/A\n|}\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Short blades]]"}

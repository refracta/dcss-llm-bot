It announces the presence and location of the marked creature to everyone on the same level.}}\n\n'''Sentinel's Mark''' is a monster-only spell which inflicts the '''Mark''' status, if it overcomes the target's [[willpower]]. This causes all monsters in the level to know your location. Sleeping monsters are not affected by this unless they wake up. Quaffing a [[potion of cancellation]] will dispel the status.\n\nYou can also gain the Mark status when an [[alarm trap]] is triggered; this effect ignores your willpower and makes a very loud [[noise]].\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], [[pandemonium lord]]s couldn't cast this spell.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], its [[spell power]] didn't depend on the attacker's [[HD]] and was always 125.\n*This spell was added in [[0.12]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

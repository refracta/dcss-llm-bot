{"title":"Staff of Battle","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Staff_of_Battle","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|A staff encased in vividly coloured scales, wrought by a long-forgotten wizard. It was the mage Iskenderun's favourite playtoy. The staff increases the power of its wielder's conjurations. When danger looms, it conjures a battlesphere, the strength of which depends on the wielder's skill with Conjurations.}}\n''For the current version of this item, see [[sphere of Battle]].''\n\n[[File:Staff of battle.png]] '''''the +0 staff of Battle'''''\n\n+0 [[staff]]\n\n[[Spell enhancer|Enhances]] the power of the wielder's [[Conjurations]]<br>\nAutomatically creates a [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere|battlesphere]] when monsters are in sight; the battlesphere's power depends on your skill with Conjurations.<br>\nHitting a monster with the staff will trigger the battlesphere.\n\n==Desirability==\nSpellcasters who are already using a [[staff of conjuration]] will likely want to upgrade to the '''staff of Battle'''<ref>{{source ref|0.29.1|art-data.txt|1552}}</ref> if they find it. Other mages may also want to hold onto it if they aren't engaging in weapon combat, as having a battlesphere following you around will increase the damage output of your Conjurations for no extra cost.\n\nUnlike mundane staves of conjurations, the staff itself deals no additional damage in melee, but will trigger the battlesphere. Depending on your skill in Conjurations, [[Evocations]], and other schools of magic, a more mundane [[enhancer staff]] may be a better choice of melee weapon.\n\nCharacters that do not plan to use Conjurations have no use for the staff of Battle. [[Djinn]] ''can'' make use of the staff, but as they cannot train the Conjurations skill, the battlesphere's performance will be weaker.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.30]], the staff of Battle was replaced by the [[sphere of Battle]].\n*Prior to [[0.28]], hitting enemies in melee with the staff of Battle did not trigger the battlesphere.\n*The staff of Battle was added in [[0.24]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Staves]]\n[[Category:Magical staves]]"}

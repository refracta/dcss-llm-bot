{"title":"Iron golem","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Iron_golem","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''For a list of all golems, see [[list of constructs]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Iron golems''' are highly durable [[list of constructs|constructs]]. They're slow, but they hit hard and are completely immune to hostile enchantments and elemental damage. They are usually only found in certain [[vault]]s or [[the Iron City of Dis]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Don't let yourself get boxed in with an iron golem; they may be slow, but they're strong enough to mash a squishy wizard in a couple hits and deal serious damage to careless melee fighters.\n*Use its speed to your advantage, whether you're a caster or a melee brute. Iron golems are slow enough for anyone who isn't a devotee of [[Cheibriados]] to kite.\n*To actually take down an iron golem, expect to have to pound on it for an extended period of time with physical attacks or spells like [[Airstrike]], [[Earth Magic]], or non-elemental [[Conjurations]]. Try luring it somewhere relatively safe so you aren't rudely interrupted by something capable of keeping up with you.\n**[[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] works well on iron golems. It has the added bonus of creating shrapnel that damages anything adjacent to the golem.\n**Spells like [[Iron Shot]] and [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] will also cut through their defenses, and their EV is low enough for them to have a decent chance of hitting.\n\n===Variant Iron Golem===\n[[File:Flesh golem.png]] [[Cigotuvi's Fleshworks]] contains a '''flesh golem''' in the first chamber past the prison cells. It's somewhat less durable than a normal iron golem, but hits just as hard and can also cast [[Corrupting Pulse]] to inflict temporary mutations. The chamber also contains clouds of mutagenic fog, so try to stick to the edges.\n\n{{flavour|An animated mound of misshapen flesh, sculpted over an iron skeleton.}}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], iron golems now [[shout|squeak]].\n*Prior to [[0.28]], iron golems were much weaker (35 damage per hit, much less health)."}

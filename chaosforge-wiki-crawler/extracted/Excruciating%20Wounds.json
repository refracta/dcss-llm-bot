Launchers and unarmed attacks are not affected. While this spell is active, you are unable to unwield your weapon, and spells will be harder to cast (increasing raw spell failure by 10%).\n\nCasting the spell at higher [[spell power]] will increase the effect's duration.\n\n[[Djinn]] and [[Felid]]s are unable to learn this spell (the former can't train Necromancy, the latter can't use weapons).\n\n==Strategy==\nIn the hands of a skilled [[Necromancy]] practitioner, the pain brand can render a fast weapon extremely deadly to [[:Category:Natural holiness|most natural monsters]], and by the time a character is capable of casting Excruciating Wounds, they certainly qualify. \n\nFollowers of [[Kikubaaqudgha]] can choose to permanently brand a weapon of their choice with pain, but this spell allows Kiku worshipers to instead choose to learn several extremely powerful Necromancy spells. Many necromancers might not be worshipping Kiku, and pain is rare elsewhere. Just be aware that this brand is useless against opponents with any [[negative energy]] resistance: this includes all [[demon]]ic, [[undead]], [[:Category:Nonliving holiness|nonliving]], and [[:Category:Holy holiness|holy]] opponents. Having the option to use your weapon's innate brand (removed by Kiku blessing) is another benefit of this spell.\n\nCasting the spell is also quite loud, making it unwise to cast it while trying to sneak around sleeping opponents.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], Excruciating Wounds was removed.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Excruciating Wounds was a Necromancy/Charms spell. It did not prevent you from unwielding your weapon, penalize your spell success rate, or make further noise during the spell. However, the initial cast was much louder.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], this spell could not affect weapons that were already branded.\n*Added in [[0.2]]."}

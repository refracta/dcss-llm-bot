While offering great protection, splint mail is quite difficult to move in without proper training.}}\n'''Splint mail''' is a fairly heavy suit of body [[armour]], providing defense similar to but worse than [[plate armour]]. Casters should never use it, and physical fighters should probably upgrade to something better when the opportunity arises. It does provide adequate protection for those who don't quite have the [[strength]] to wear plate armour yet.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Splint mail1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Splint mail2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Splint mail3.png]]\n|}\n\n<!--- This is here to force the category line to not run into the sidebar. -->\n<br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n==History==\nSplint mail was removed in [[0.13]], and chain mail was bumped up to 8 base AC to take its place.\n\n[[Category:Body armour]]\n[[Category:Obsolete articles]]"}

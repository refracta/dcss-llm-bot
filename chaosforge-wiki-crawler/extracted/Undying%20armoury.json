{"title":"Undying armoury","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Undying_armoury","type":"raw","data":"{{version-trunk}}\n{{stub}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nAn '''Undying armoury''' can temporarily upgrade the weapons of 5-7 nearby allies. Those weapons tend to be top-tier items, with good plusses (from +4 to +9), and ''any'' brand, making possible normally unseen weapon/brand combinations: eg, a [[triple crossbow]] of [[distortion]]. These summoned weapons disappear once the monster is felled. They can also cast a damaging spell that also summons a short-lived [[dancing weapon]] near its target. Undying armouries appear in [[the Vaults]]. \n\n<!-- TO BE RESEARCHED: is there a timeout on the bestowed weapons? Or do they persist for as long as the Undying armoury lives? Can it be affecting 5-7 new allies each time the spell is cast? Or are only 5-7 allies affected at any one time? --> \n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Strategy==\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|undying armouries will be added to the game, replacing [[tentacled monstrosities]] in the Vaults.}}"}

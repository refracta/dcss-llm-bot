These penalties will be reduced and eventually eliminated with increased Shields skill.}}\n\nA '''kite shield''' is a shield that provides moderate SH at a manageable penalty. They are a reasonable choice for both melee and caster characters, at least with a bit of [[Shields (skill)|Shields skill]]. While wielding a kite shield, you can [[Shields#Blocking|block]] a maximum of 3 attacks per turn.  Only [[Spriggan]]s are too small to use a kite shield.\n\n==Egos==\nThey can be found with the following [[ego]]s:\n*[[Reflection]]\n*[[Protection]]\n*[[Cold resistance]]\n*[[Fire resistance]]\n*[[Poison resistance]]\n*[[Positive energy]]\n*[[Resistance_(ego)|Resistance]]\n\nShield egos are relatively rare. Of the egos, reflection and protection are the most common. You can occasionally find cold resistance and fire resistance in [[Ice cave]]s and [[Volcano]]s, respectively.\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Shield1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Shield2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Shield3.png]]\n|-\n| || '''[[Unrandart]]<br>kite shields'''\n|-\n| '''[[Shield of Resistance]]''' || [[File:Shield_of_resistance.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Shield of the Gong]]''' || [[File:Shield_of_the_Gong.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], shields did not have a maximum number of blocks per turn. Instead, the more blocks you made per turn, the less likely the next block was to be made.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], kite shields' penalties were negated completely by 15 Shields skill, but their initial penalties were higher.\n*Shield penalties increased in [[0.27]].\n*Kite shields were just called \"shields\" until [[0.25]].\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Shields]]"}

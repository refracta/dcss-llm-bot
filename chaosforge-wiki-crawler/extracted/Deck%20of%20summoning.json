It is one of [[Nemelex Xobeh]]'s decks. Under Nemelex, you can hold up to 13 cards.\n\nIt contains the following cards:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|decks.cc|90}}</ref>\n*[[Dance card|the Dance]] (16.6%)\n*[[Elements card|the Elements]] (16.6%)\n*[[Illusion card|the Illusion]] (16.6%)\n*[[Pentagram card|the Pentagram]] (16.6%)\n*[[Rangers card|the Rangers]] (16.6%)\n*[[Swarm card|Swarm]] (16.6%)\n__NOTOC__\n==Strategy==\n[[Summon]]ed monsters are always useful, and Nemelex is one of the best gods for them. Most cards can create multiple monsters, meaning you have meatshields to hide behind. Over the course of the game, the average strength of each card diminishes, though a clone of yourself or a [[pandemonium lord]] will kill just about everything up to [[Zot]].\n\nTriple Draw lets you avoid hostile summons from the Pentagram, but otherwise is poor for card efficiency. Even then, you could just keep drawing until the situation's clear. If you need to save on turns, Draw Four is a strong ability: it creates a true swarm of allies for when you really need to block line-of-fire.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.23]], this deck was a physical item.\n*Prior to the deck simplification in [[0.19]], the deck of destruction was an archetype deck, with physical decks of destruction only pulling from the archetype.

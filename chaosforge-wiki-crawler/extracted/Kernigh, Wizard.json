I never played such a strange combination. Here at the top of the diary, I document my situation at the start of the game.\n\n```\n                                       Kernigh the Magician\n                                       Mummy\n                                       HP: 9/9\n                                       Magic: 5/5\n                                       AC: 2     (0)\n                                       EV: 10\n                                       Str: 7\n               ###                     Int: 15\n               #@#                     Dex: 9\n               #.#                     Gold: 28\n               #.#                     Experience: 1/0  (25)\n               #.#                     Level 1 of the Dungeon\n               #.#                     a) +0 dagger\n               #.#\n               ...\n               #$#\n               #.#\nYou are undead.\nYour movement speed is average.\nVery agile monsters are a bit awkward to hit given your current equipment.\nYou are not resistant to magic.\nYou feel unstealthy.\n```\n\n```\n You have 25 points of unallocated experience.\n\n                                       b + Spellcasting   Skill  3 ( 0%)\n\na + Dodging        Skill  1 (15%)\n```\n\n```\n                    Innate Abilities, Weirdness & Mutations\n\nYou are in touch with the powers of death.\nYour flesh is vulnerable to fire.\nYour system is immune to poisons.\nYour flesh is cold resistant.\nYou are immune to unholy pain and torment.\nYou are immune to negative energy.\n```\n\n```\nInventory: 15.0/350.0 aum (4%, 3/52 slots)\nHand Weapons\n a - a +0,+0 dagger (weapon)\nArmour\n b - a +0 robe (worn)\nBooks\n c - a book of Minor Magic [frost]\n```\n\nSo what is inside that [book of Minor Magic (frost)](/Book_of_Minor_Magic_\\(frost\\) \"Book of Minor Magic (frost)\")?\n\n```\nThe book of Minor Magic [frost]\n\n Spells                             Type                      Level\n a - Magic Dart                   Conjuration                   1\n b - Throw Frost                  Conjuration/Ice               2\n c - Blink                        Translocation                 2\n d - Sticks to Snakes             Transmigration/Summoning      2\n e - Slow                         Enchantment                   3\n f - Mephitic Cloud               Conjuration/Poison/Air        3\n g - Ozocubu's Armour             Enchantment/Ice               3\n```\n\nWhen I played [Kernigh, Ice Elementalist](/Kernigh,_Ice_Elementalist \"Kernigh, Ice Elementalist\"), I had a [book of Frost](/Book_of_Frost \"Book of Frost\"). That book also had [Throw Frost](/Throw_Frost \"Throw Frost\") and [Ozocubu's Armour](/Ozocubu%27s_Armour \"Ozocubu's Armour\"). This book of Minor Magic has a more diverse collection of spells, but not any of the higher-level spells fromm the book of Frost. I observe that my mummy has already memorised the first spell, [Magic Dart](/Magic_Dart \"Magic Dart\").\n\nThis is my third diary, after Kernigh, Ice Elementalist and [Kernigh, Wanderer](/Kernigh,_Wanderer \"Kernigh, Wanderer\"). As my mummy begins the exploration of dungeon level one, I want to adjust the style of my diary.\n\n### Chatter\n\nI hear that a [mummy](/Mummy \"Mummy\") does not eat, does not need to eat. I might feel the effect of this, but later. --[Kernigh](/index.php?title=User:Kernigh\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"User:Kernigh (page does not exist)\") 19:49, 9 March 2008 (MDT)\n\n## Trespasser in the Dungeon\n\nA mummy enters the [dungeon](/Dungeon \"Dungeon\").\n\nBut the dungeon does not welcome the mummy. *You hear a shout!* Here appears a [kobold](/Kobold \"Kobold\"), already intending to prevent the mummy from looting this dungeon. The kobold exclaims, \"You, undead thing, stay away from here!\" The kobold bears a [club](/Club \"Club\") and seems to be in the mood to club a mummy.\n\nBut the mummy only seems delighted to finally find a practise target for the [Magic Dart](/Magic_Dart \"Magic Dart\") spell. The mummy points at the kobold. *You miscast the spell. The air around you crackles with energy!* The kobold steps into the square adjacent to the mummy. The mummy will soon flee or die, unless it can successfully cast a simple level 1 spell.\n\nThe mummy tries again, launching the Magic Dart at the adjacent kobold. *The magic dart hits the kobold. The kobold is lightly wounded. The kobold hits you with a club. Ouch! That really hurt!* The mummy steps back, aiming to flee up the stairs, but a space opens between kobold and mummy!\n\n```\n                                     Kernigh the Magician\n                                      Mummy\n                                      HP: 4/9\n              ###                     Magic: 3/5\n              #<#                     AC: 2     (0)\n              #.#                     EV: 10\n              #.#                     Str: 7\n              #.#                     Int: 15\n              #@#                     Dex: 9\n              #.#                     Gold: 28\n         #<.....K.......

You kill the kobold!* [Spellcasting](/Spellcasting \"Spellcasting\") seems easy enough to this mummy, but the specific discipline of [Conjuration](/Conjuration \"Conjuration\") seems more difficult. But for now, the mummy may rest.\n\nSo what is inside this dungeon? The mummy looks at the kobold corpse, and takes a club. It grabs a nearby pile of 11 gold pieces. Perhaps, the mummy thinks, there might be some more gold further into the dungeon. The mummy wanders east, looking carefully for any more potential targets for Magic Dart.\n\nThe mummy steps past a pair of [granite statues](/Granite_statue \"Granite statue\"), both depicting [orcs](/Orc \"Orc\"). (Crawl does not specify the appearance of a statue, so I have invented the fact that these are statues of orcs. I will insert such details to maintain the mummy's diary.) So it might be that not only kobolds live in this dungeon. How well would Magic Dart work against an orc?\n\nThe mummy wanders. This seems to be a large dungeon, and there is even a staircase that goes down somewhere. But dungeon level 1, where the mummy remains, seems mostly empty. In the north, someone stashed a scroll labeled HATIKI HAJEZOB and 27 elven darts. The mummy now takes these objects. The scroll has a mysterious purpose, but the elven darts might have a use if the mummy exhausts its magic darts. Also, this mummy would not want another kobold, or an elf, or some other monster, to throw these elven darts against a monster.\n\n... or that [hobgoblin](/Hobgoblin \"Hobgoblin\").\n\n```\n                                       Kernigh the Magician\n                                       Mummy\n                                       HP: 9/9\n                                       Magic: 5/5\n                                       AC: 2     (0)\n                                       EV: 10\n       ########                        Str: 7\n       #......###########              Int: 15\n       #........@......g.

It is wielding a club.\n```\n\nThis particular mummy likes magic more than physical missiles, and now would like to see how a hobgoblin reacts to [Magic Dart](/Magic_Dart \"Magic Dart\"). So the mummy casts that spell once and twice! *You have gained Conjurations skill!* This spell does damage! The mummy casts it three more times, but now the mummy has only 0/5 magic. The mummy turns to flee; the angry hobgoblin chases the mummy and announces, \"Stranger! Leave my dungeon!\"\n\nThe mummy, who either does not talk much, or is temporarily afraid of the hobgoblin, begins to runs away. But the mummy feels a small amount of magic return. At 1/5 magic, the mummy throws another magic dart. The hobgoblin retorts, \"Stranger, you shall die for your trespassing!\" The mummy runs away.\n\nThe mummy reaches a pillar, and tries to circle it, but the mummy is no faster than the hobgoblin. The mummy feels another bit of magic and launches another dart. In response, the hobgoblin swings its club. *The hobgoblin hits you but doesn't do any damage.* The mummy flees a few more steps. Then another bit of magic comes, and this last magic dart kills the hobgoblin. The corpse drops to the floor, and the mummy takes the club.\n\nWith the death of that hobgoblin, the mummy feels encouraged. With enough magic, the mummy believes that survival in this dungeon becomes possible.\n\nSo the mummy has a few more encounters and makes more use of [Magic Dart](/Magic_Dart \"Magic Dart\"). But soon, a [kobold](/Kobold \"Kobold\") begins throwing its [darts](/Dart \"Dart\"). The mummy reacts with surprise, ignores its depleted hp, inspects some other things on the ground and does not flee.\n\n*You die...*\n\n```\n17:27 < Henzell> Kernigh the Magician (L1 MuWz), hit from afar by a kobold\n                 (dart) on D:1, with 43 points after 399 turns and 1:01:24.\n```\n\n### Chatter\n\n# *The Second Tale of Kernigh, Wizard*\n\nTo continue this diary, I must recreate the character. Here arrives another Mummy Wizard, with another [book of Minor Magic (frost)](/Book_of_Minor_Magic_\\(frost\\) \"Book of Minor Magic (frost)\"). This new character interrupts any story that I tried to build with the previous character.\n\n- *Game:* Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup 0.3.4, at crawl.akrasiac.org\n- *Character:* [Mummy](/Mummy \"Mummy\") [Wizard](/Wizard \"Wizard\")\n\nAmong [the ttyrec files of Kernigh](http://crawl.akrasiac.org/rawdata/Kernigh/), this game starts at 2008-03-09.21:29:39.\n\n## Mummy kills Kobold\n\nSo this mummy is slightly different from the previous one. It starts with less [intelligence](/Intelligence \"Intelligence\") but more [strength](/Strength \"Strength\") and [dexterity](/Dexterity \"Dexterity\").\n\n```\n              #..

The mummy takes a [scroll](/Scroll \"Scroll\") labeled DUEM XOLEXATZ and a [pear](/Pear \"Pear\"). The mummy tries [Magic Dart](/Magic_Dart \"Magic Dart\") against a [rat](/Rat \"Rat\"). The rat dies.\n\n*You hear a grinding noise.* The mummy explores carefully. *You hear a grinding noise.* The mummy suspects that something, somewhere is chewing through the rock; but the actual source of the noise remains unknown.\n\nThe mummy kills two [giant newts](/Giant_newt \"Giant newt\"). Unlike the previous mummy's dungeon, which had humanoid guards; this one only seems to have wandering animals that might want to eat a mummy.\n\nAt turn 228, the mummy encounters a [giant gecko](/Giant_gecko \"Giant gecko\") 'l' with a [giant bat](/Giant_bat \"Giant bat\") 'b'.\n\n```\n##.# #......   ...

Two hits kill the gecko and three hits kill the bat, and that was well, because now the mummy has 0/5 magic. With that grinding noise in the background, the mummy rests.\n\nThe mummy explores this dungeon, and uses Magic Dart to kill a few more monsters. When a [goblin](/Goblin \"Goblin\") appears, the mummy handles it as only another monster, and kills it. This dungeon is a good place, the mummy thinks, to practise [Spellcasting](/Spellcasting \"Spellcasting\") and [Conjurations](/Conjurations \"Conjurations\").\n\nBut the mummy meets a [kobold](/Kobold \"Kobold\") throwing [darts](/Dart \"Dart\"). The kobold does not speak, but proceeds to act afraid and throw darts at the mummy.\n\n```\n..#          #.#                       Kernigh the Magician\n..#######    #.#                       Mummy\n........#    #.#                       HP: 9/9\n........#    #.#      .

My mummy travels down the stairs and looks at that part of dungeon level 2. Then the mummy climbs and returns to dungeon level 1. The pool of unallocated experience drops to zero points.\n\nThe mummy wonders at the size of this dungeon and wants to explore more. This dungeon seems to consist of rectangular rooms in the rock, with connecting corridors. The local population seems to be mostly [goblins](/Goblin \"Goblin\") and [hobgoblins](/Hobgoblin \"Hobgoblin\").\n\nAfter the mummy kills a goblin, a hobgoblin in view says, \"No! I will have my revenge against you!\" The mummy has insufficient [magic points](/Magic_points \"Magic points\") to kill the hobgoblin.\n\n```\n                                       Kernigh the Magician\n         ###########                   Mummy\n         ..........###                 HP: 13/13\n        .....g.......#                 Magic: 0/7\n               #.#                     AC: 2     (0)\n               #.#                     EV: 10\n               #.#                     Str: 10\n               #g#                     Int: 13\n               #@#                     Dex: 8\n               #.#                     Gold: 22\n           ### #.#                     Experience: 2/26  (0)\n           #.# #.#                     Level 1 of the Dungeon\n           #.# #.#                     a) +0 dagger\n..         #.# #.#\n...        #.# #.#\n...        #.# #.#\n..#        #.# #.#.\nYou miscast the spell.\nYour skin glows momentarily.\nThe hobgoblin hits you but doesn't do any damage.\n```\n\nSo the mummy flees. The hobgoblin says, \"You may not escape!\" As the mummy's magic points regenerate, the mummy manages to cast [Magic Dart](/Magic_Dart \"Magic Dart\") twice more, but the hobgoblin replies twice with its orcish [club](/Club \"Club\"). At 5/13 hp and 0/7 magic, the mummy seeks a pillar or a circuit route, to flee until hp and magic regenerate.\n\n```\n                  ...         #.#      Kernigh the Magician\n                  ....        #.#      Mummy\n                  ....        #.#      HP: 8/13\n          .       #..#        #.#      Magic: 6/7\n         #.#      #..#        #.#      AC: 2     (0)\n         #.#      #..#        #.#      EV: 10\n         #.#      #..#        #.#      Str: 10\n##########.########..##########.#      Int: 13\n................@a..............#      Dex: 8\n.#####.........g###..########.###      Gold: 22\n.#   #..........g##..#      #.###      Experience: 2/26  (0)\n.#   #............#g.#      #.##.

Unluckily, this [giant cockroach](/Giant_cockroach \"Giant cockroach\") blocks the way. The mummy flees west, but the giant cockroach moves slightly faster than the mummy, and reduces the mummy to 6/13 hp. In desperation, the mummy casts Magic Dart at the adjacent giant cockroach. The mummy has exactly enough magic points to kill the giant cockroach. Eventually, the mummy kills the hobgoblin.\n\nSoon, the mummy has an apparently complete map of dungeon level 1.\n\n### Chatter\n\n## Potion and Rings\n\nCrawl has large, persistent levels, with multiple staircases connecting each pair of adjacent levels. In the mummy's game, two distant staircases on dungeon level one connect to two nearby staircases on dungeon level two.\n\n```\n               #.. #..#                Kernigh the Ruinous\n               #w# #..#                Mummy\n               #.# #..#                HP: 13/13\n               #.# #..#                Magic: 7/7\n               #.# #..#                AC: 2     (0)\n               #.# #..#                EV: 10\n           #####.# #..#                Str: 10\n           #.!.g.# #%.#                Int: 13\n           #.###@###..#                Dex: 8\n           #..<....<..#                Gold: 41\n         #.###.#####..#                Experience: 2/39  (1)\n         #............#                Level 2 of the Dungeon\n         #####.#####.##                a) +0 dagger\n             #.#   #.#\n             #.#   #.#\n             #.#   #.#\n             #.#   #.#\nYou hear a shout!\n```\n\nThe mummy has collected some objects that it found near these two staircases at dungeon level two. I instruct my mummy to bring this [goblin](/Goblin \"Goblin\") 'g' to dungeon level one and kill it. I check my mummy's inventory.\n\n```\nArmour\n b - a +0 robe (worn)\n s - a leather armour\n x - a pair of boots\nComestibles\n e - a pear\n q - a meat ration\nScrolls\n d - 2 scrolls labeled DUEM XOLEXATZ\n i - a scroll labeled QIERAUPAAT\n j - a scroll labeled XINEIPH EZIWA\n l - 2 scrolls labeled XEIBIEHIERCH\nJewellery\n f - a bronze ring\n m - a knobbly marble ring\n t - an ivory ring\nPotions\n o - a glowing silvery potion\nBooks\n c - a book of Minor Magic [frost]\n```\n\nThe mummy looks at the comestibles and the potion. This mummy cannot eat the comestibles and cannot drink the potion. The mummy feels sad about its undead form, and dreams of tasting the comestibles and enjoying the wetness of the potion. There might be some way of magic, so the mummy dreams, to become a form that can eat and drink! The mummy decides that it is a wizard for this reason.\n\nThe mummy then eyes the [rings](/Ring \"Ring\") and the [pair of boots](/Boots \"Boots\"). These might have some immediate use. The mummy puts on the +0 pair of boots, and regards that [AC](/AC \"AC\") increase from 2 to 3. The mummy tries each ring. The bronze ring has no obvious effect, so the mummy removes that ring. The knobbly marble ring is a +3 [ring of protection](/Ring_of_protection \"Ring of protection\"); the mummy removes that ring before trying the third ring. Unfortunately, the ivory ring has a curse and sticks itself to a finger. *Oops, that ring feels deathly cold.* Mummies do not easily feel cold, so the cold feeling from this cursed ivory ring feels strange to this mummy. This mummy has two hands, so it again puts on the ring of protection.\n\n```\nJewellery\n f - an uncursed bronze ring {tried}\n m - a +3 ring of protection (right hand)\n t - a cursed ivory ring (left hand)\n```\n\nI postpone the consideration of the [scrolls](/Scroll \"Scroll\"), and of the level 2 spells in the [book](/Book \"Book\"). I decide to disable the practise of Conjurations, because it seems to consume much of the [experience points](/Experience \"Experience\").\n\n### Chatter\n\nI already began to write the next section

The mummy will soon flee or die, unless it can successfully cast a simple level 1 spell.\n</p><p>The mummy tries again, launching the Magic Dart at the adjacent kobold. <i>The magic dart hits the kobold. The kobold is lightly wounded. The kobold hits you with a club. Ouch! That really hurt!</i> The mummy steps back, aiming to flee up the stairs, but a space opens between kobold and mummy!\n</p>\n<pre>                                     Kernigh the Magician\n                                      Mummy\n                                      HP: 4/9\n              ###                     Magic: 3/5\n              #&lt;#                     AC: 2     (0)\n              #.#                     EV: 10\n              #.#                     Str: 7\n              #.#                     Int: 15\n              #@#                     Dex: 9\n              #.#                     Gold: 28\n         #&lt;.....K.......

You kill the kobold!</i> <a href=\"/Spellcasting\" title=\"Spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a> seems easy enough to this mummy, but the specific discipline of <a href=\"/Conjuration\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Conjuration\">Conjuration</a> seems more difficult. But for now, the mummy may rest.\n</p><p>So what is inside this dungeon? The mummy looks at the kobold corpse, and takes a club. It grabs a nearby pile of 11 gold pieces. Perhaps, the mummy thinks, there might be some more gold further into the dungeon. The mummy wanders east, looking carefully for any more potential targets for Magic Dart.\n</p><p>The mummy steps past a pair of <a href=\"/Granite_statue\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Granite statue\">granite statues</a>, both depicting <a href=\"/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orcs</a>. (Crawl does not specify the appearance of a statue, so I have invented the fact that these are statues of orcs. I will insert such details to maintain the mummy's diary.) So it might be that not only kobolds live in this dungeon. How well would Magic Dart work against an orc?\n</p><p>The mummy wanders. This seems to be a large dungeon, and there is even a staircase that goes down somewhere. But dungeon level 1, where the mummy remains, seems mostly empty. In the north, someone stashed a scroll labeled HATIKI HAJEZOB and 27 elven darts. The mummy now takes these objects. The scroll has a mysterious purpose, but the elven darts might have a use if the mummy exhausts its magic darts. Also, this mummy would not want another kobold, or an elf, or some other monster, to throw these elven darts against a monster.\n</p><p>... or that <a href=\"/Hobgoblin\" title=\"Hobgoblin\">hobgoblin</a>.\n</p>\n<pre>                                       Kernigh the Magician\n                                       Mummy\n                                       HP: 9/9\n                                       Magic: 5/5\n                                       AC: 2     (0)\n                                       EV: 10\n       ########                        Str: 7\n       #......###########              Int: 15\n       #........@......g.

It is wielding a club.\n</pre>\n<p>This particular mummy likes magic more than physical missiles, and now would like to see how a hobgoblin reacts to <a href=\"/Magic_Dart\" title=\"Magic Dart\">Magic Dart</a>. So the mummy casts that spell once and twice! <i>You have gained Conjurations skill!</i> This spell does damage! The mummy casts it three more times, but now the mummy has only 0/5 magic. The mummy turns to flee; the angry hobgoblin chases the mummy and announces, \"Stranger! Leave my dungeon!\"\n</p><p>The mummy, who either does not talk much, or is temporarily afraid of the hobgoblin, begins to runs away. But the mummy feels a small amount of magic return. At 1/5 magic, the mummy throws another magic dart. The hobgoblin retorts, \"Stranger, you shall die for your trespassing!\" The mummy runs away.\n</p><p>The mummy reaches a pillar, and tries to circle it, but the mummy is no faster than the hobgoblin. The mummy feels another bit of magic and launches another dart. In response, the hobgoblin swings its club. <i>The hobgoblin hits you but doesn't do any damage.</i> The mummy flees a few more steps. Then another bit of magic comes, and this last magic dart kills the hobgoblin. The corpse drops to the floor, and the mummy takes the club.\n</p><p>With the death of that hobgoblin, the mummy feels encouraged. With enough magic, the mummy believes that survival in this dungeon becomes possible.\n</p><p>So the mummy has a few more encounters and makes more use of <a href=\"/Magic_Dart\" title=\"Magic Dart\">Magic Dart</a>. But soon, a <a href=\"/Kobold\" title=\"Kobold\">kobold</a> begins throwing its <a href=\"/Dart\" title=\"Dart\">darts</a>.

This mummy cannot eat the comestibles and cannot drink the potion. The mummy feels sad about its undead form, and dreams of tasting the comestibles and enjoying the wetness of the potion. There might be some way of magic, so the mummy dreams, to become a form that can eat and drink! The mummy decides that it is a wizard for this reason.\n</p><p>The mummy then eyes the <a href=\"/Ring\" title=\"Ring\">rings</a> and the <a href=\"/Boots\" title=\"Boots\">pair of boots</a>. These might have some immediate use. The mummy puts on the +0 pair of boots, and regards that <a href=\"/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a> increase from 2 to 3. The mummy tries each ring. The bronze ring has no obvious effect, so the mummy removes that ring. The knobbly marble ring is a +3 <a href=\"/Ring_of_protection\" title=\"Ring of protection\">ring of protection</a>; the mummy removes that ring before trying the third ring. Unfortunately, the ivory ring has a curse and sticks itself to a finger. <i>Oops, that ring feels deathly cold.</i> Mummies do not easily feel cold, so the cold feeling from this cursed ivory ring feels strange to this mummy. This mummy has two hands, so it again puts on the ring of protection.\n</p>\n<pre>Jewellery\n f - an uncursed bronze ring {tried}\n m - a +3 ring of protection (right hand)\n t - a cursed ivory ring (left hand)\n</pre>\n<p>I postpone the consideration of the <a href=\"/Scroll\" title=\"Scroll\">scrolls</a>, and of the level 2 spells in the <a href=\"/Book\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Book\">book</a>.

That book also had [[Throw Frost]] and [[Ozocubu's Armour]]. This book of Minor Magic has a more diverse collection of spells, but not any of the higher-level spells fromm the book of Frost. I observe that my mummy has already memorised the first spell, [[Magic Dart]].\n\nThis is my third diary, after Kernigh, Ice Elementalist and [[Kernigh, Wanderer]]. As my mummy begins the exploration of dungeon level one, I want to adjust the style of my diary.\n\n=== Chatter ===\nI hear that a [[mummy]] does not eat, does not need to eat. I might feel the effect of this, but later. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 19:49, 9 March 2008 (MDT)\n\n== Trespasser in the Dungeon ==\nA mummy enters the [[dungeon]].\n\nBut the dungeon does not welcome the mummy. ''You hear a shout!'' Here appears a [[kobold]], already intending to prevent the mummy from looting this dungeon. The kobold exclaims, \"You, undead thing, stay away from here!\" The kobold bears a [[club]] and seems to be in the mood to club a mummy.\n\nBut the mummy only seems delighted to finally find a practise target for the [[Magic Dart]] spell. The mummy points at the kobold. ''You miscast the spell. The air around you crackles with energy!'' The kobold steps into the square adjacent to the mummy. The mummy will soon flee or die, unless it can successfully cast a simple level 1 spell.\n\nThe mummy tries again, launching the Magic Dart at the adjacent kobold. ''The magic dart hits the kobold. The kobold is lightly wounded. The kobold hits you with a club. Ouch! That really hurt!'' The mummy steps back, aiming to flee up the stairs, but a space opens between kobold and mummy!\n\n                                      Kernigh the Magician\n                                       Mummy\n                                       HP: 4/9\n               ###                     Magic: 3/5\n               #<#                     AC: 2     (0)\n               #.#                     EV: 10\n               #.#                     Str: 7\n               #.#                     Int: 15\n               #@#                     Dex: 9\n               #.#                     Gold: 28\n          #<.....K.......

''The magic dart hits the kobold. You kill the kobold!'' [[Spellcasting]] seems easy enough to this mummy, but the specific discipline of [[Conjuration]] seems more difficult. But for now, the mummy may rest.\n\nSo what is inside this dungeon? The mummy looks at the kobold corpse, and takes a club. It grabs a nearby pile of 11 gold pieces. Perhaps, the mummy thinks, there might be some more gold further into the dungeon. The mummy wanders east, looking carefully for any more potential targets for Magic Dart.\n\nThe mummy steps past a pair of [[granite statue]]s, both depicting [[orc]]s. (Crawl does not specify the appearance of a statue, so I have invented the fact that these are statues of orcs. I will insert such details to maintain the mummy's diary.) So it might be that not only kobolds live in this dungeon. How well would Magic Dart work against an orc?\n\nThe mummy wanders. This seems to be a large dungeon, and there is even a staircase that goes down somewhere. But dungeon level 1, where the mummy remains, seems mostly empty. In the north, someone stashed a scroll labeled HATIKI HAJEZOB and 27 elven darts. The mummy now takes these objects. The scroll has a mysterious purpose, but the elven darts might have a use if the mummy exhausts its magic darts. Also, this mummy would not want another kobold, or an elf, or some other monster, to throw these elven darts against a monster.\n\n... or that [[hobgoblin]].\n\n                                        Kernigh the Magician\n                                        Mummy\n                                        HP: 9/9\n                                        Magic: 5/5\n                                        AC: 2     (0)\n                                        EV: 10\n        ########                        Str: 7\n        #......###########              Int: 15\n        #........@......g.

It is wielding a club.\n\nThis particular mummy likes magic more than physical missiles, and now would like to see how a hobgoblin reacts to [[Magic Dart]]. So the mummy casts that spell once and twice! ''You have gained Conjurations skill!'' This spell does damage! The mummy casts it three more times, but now the mummy has only 0/5 magic. The mummy turns to flee; the angry hobgoblin chases the mummy and announces, \"Stranger! Leave my dungeon!\"\n\nThe mummy, who either does not talk much, or is temporarily afraid of the hobgoblin, begins to runs away. But the mummy feels a small amount of magic return. At 1/5 magic, the mummy throws another magic dart. The hobgoblin retorts, \"Stranger, you shall die for your trespassing!\" The mummy runs away.\n\nThe mummy reaches a pillar, and tries to circle it, but the mummy is no faster than the hobgoblin. The mummy feels another bit of magic and launches another dart. In response, the hobgoblin swings its club. ''The hobgoblin hits you but doesn't do any damage.'' The mummy flees a few more steps. Then another bit of magic comes, and this last magic dart kills the hobgoblin. The corpse drops to the floor, and the mummy takes the club.\n\nWith the death of that hobgoblin, the mummy feels encouraged. With enough magic, the mummy believes that survival in this dungeon becomes possible.\n\nSo the mummy has a few more encounters and makes more use of [[Magic Dart]]. But soon, a [[kobold]] begins throwing its [[dart]]s. The mummy reacts with surprise, ignores its depleted hp, inspects some other things on the ground and does not flee.\n\n''You die...''\n\n 17:27 < Henzell> Kernigh the Magician (L1 MuWz), hit from afar by a kobold\n                  (dart) on D:1, with 43 points after 399 turns and 1:01:24.\n\n=== Chatter ===\n\n= ''The Second Tale of Kernigh, Wizard'' =\nTo continue this diary, I must recreate the character.

The mummy takes a [[scroll]] labeled DUEM XOLEXATZ and a [[pear]]. The mummy tries [[Magic Dart]] against a [[rat]]. The rat dies.\n\n''You hear a grinding noise.'' The mummy explores carefully. ''You hear a grinding noise.'' The mummy suspects that something, somewhere is chewing through the rock; but the actual source of the noise remains unknown.\n\nThe mummy kills two [[giant newt]]s. Unlike the previous mummy's dungeon, which had humanoid guards; this one only seems to have wandering animals that might want to eat a mummy.\n\nAt turn 228, the mummy encounters a [[giant gecko]] 'l' with a [[giant bat]] 'b'.\n\n ##.# #......   ...

Two hits kill the gecko and three hits kill the bat, and that was well, because now the mummy has 0/5 magic. With that grinding noise in the background, the mummy rests.\n\nThe mummy explores this dungeon, and uses Magic Dart to kill a few more monsters. When a [[goblin]] appears, the mummy handles it as only another monster, and kills it. This dungeon is a good place, the mummy thinks, to practise [[Spellcasting]] and [[Conjurations]].\n\nBut the mummy meets a [[kobold]] throwing [[dart]]s. The kobold does not speak, but proceeds to act afraid and throw darts at the mummy.\n\n ..#          #.#                       Kernigh the Magician\n ..#######    #.#                       Mummy\n ........#    #.#                       HP: 9/9\n ........#    #.#      .

My mummy travels down the stairs and looks at that part of dungeon level 2. Then the mummy climbs and returns to dungeon level 1. The pool of unallocated experience drops to zero points.\n\nThe mummy wonders at the size of this dungeon and wants to explore more. This dungeon seems to consist of rectangular rooms in the rock, with connecting corridors. The local population seems to be mostly [[goblin]]s and [[hobgoblin]]s.\n\nAfter the mummy kills a goblin, a hobgoblin in view says, \"No! I will have my revenge against you!\" The mummy has insufficient [[magic points]] to kill the hobgoblin.\n\n                                        Kernigh the Magician\n          ###########                   Mummy\n          ..........###                 HP: 13/13\n         .....g.......#                 Magic: 0/7\n                #.#                     AC: 2     (0)\n                #.#                     EV: 10\n                #.#                     Str: 10\n                #g#                     Int: 13\n                #@#                     Dex: 8\n                #.#                     Gold: 22\n            ### #.#                     Experience: 2/26  (0)\n            #.# #.#                     Level 1 of the Dungeon\n            #.# #.#                     a) +0 dagger\n ..         #.# #.#\n ...        #.# #.#\n ...        #.# #.#\n ..#        #.# #.#.\n You miscast the spell.\n Your skin glows momentarily.\n The hobgoblin hits you but doesn't do any damage.\n\nSo the mummy flees. The hobgoblin says, \"You may not escape!\" As the mummy's magic points regenerate, the mummy manages to cast [[Magic Dart]] twice more, but the hobgoblin replies twice with its orcish [[club]]. At 5/13 hp and 0/7 magic, the mummy seeks a pillar or a circuit route, to flee until hp and magic regenerate.\n\n                   ...         #.#      Kernigh the Magician\n                   ....        #.#      Mummy\n                   ....        #.#      HP: 8/13\n           .       #..#        #.#      Magic: 6/7\n          #.#      #..#        #.#      AC: 2     (0)\n          #.#      #..#        #.#      EV: 10\n          #.#      #..#        #.#      Str: 10\n ##########.########..##########.#      Int: 13\n ................@a..............#      Dex: 8\n .#####.........g###..########.###      Gold: 22\n .#   #..........g##..#      #.###      Experience: 2/26  (0)\n .#   #............#g.#      #.##.

Unluckily, this [[giant cockroach]] blocks the way. The mummy flees west, but the giant cockroach moves slightly faster than the mummy, and reduces the mummy to 6/13 hp. In desperation, the mummy casts Magic Dart at the adjacent giant cockroach. The mummy has exactly enough magic points to kill the giant cockroach. Eventually, the mummy kills the hobgoblin.\n\nSoon, the mummy has an apparently complete map of dungeon level 1.\n\n=== Chatter ===\n\n== Potion and Rings ==\nCrawl has large, persistent levels, with multiple staircases connecting each pair of adjacent levels.

This mummy cannot eat the comestibles and cannot drink the potion. The mummy feels sad about its undead form, and dreams of tasting the comestibles and enjoying the wetness of the potion. There might be some way of magic, so the mummy dreams, to become a form that can eat and drink! The mummy decides that it is a wizard for this reason.\n\nThe mummy then eyes the [[ring]]s and the [[Boots|pair of boots]]. These might have some immediate use. The mummy puts on the +0 pair of boots, and regards that [[AC]] increase from 2 to 3. The mummy tries each ring. The bronze ring has no obvious effect, so the mummy removes that ring. The knobbly marble ring is a +3 [[ring of protection]]; the mummy removes that ring before trying the third ring. Unfortunately, the ivory ring has a curse and sticks itself to a finger. ''Oops, that ring feels deathly cold.'' Mummies do not easily feel cold, so the cold feeling from this cursed ivory ring feels strange to this mummy. This mummy has two hands, so it again puts on the ring of protection.\n\n Jewellery\n  f - an uncursed bronze ring {tried}\n  m - a +3 ring of protection (right hand)\n  t - a cursed ivory ring (left hand)\n\nI postpone the consideration of the [[scroll]]s, and of the level 2 spells in the [[book]].

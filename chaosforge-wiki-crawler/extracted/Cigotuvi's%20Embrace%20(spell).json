Corpses destroyed in this way grant 0.67 points of defense each, while skeletons provide 0.34 with the total rounded down.\n\nUnlike other defensive spells such as [[Ozocubu's Armour]], Cigotuvi's Embrace does not fade away all at once; instead, it will decompose over time reducing your defenses bit by bit.\n\nCigotuvi's Embrace cannot be cast in conjunction with [[Ozocubu's Armour]] or [[Statue Form]].\n\n==Strategy==\nCigotuvi's Embrace is, in most cases, the least appealing of the defensive stat boosting spells. The SH it grants makes it more effective than its counterparts in some areas, but offers little advantage in others. It can only be cast when in the presence of many corpses, usually provides less AC than its counterparts, and requires very high spell power in order for its advantages to last very long. Coupled with its significantly higher spell level, this makes the spell a generally inferior choice, suitable only for characters who intend to ''only'' train Necromancy and who aren't planning to use those corpses for [[Animate Dead|offensive purposes]].\n\nHowever, worshippers of [[Kikubaaqudgha]] can couple it with the Receive Corpses ability to generate massive piles of the dead, which can instantly be converted into phenomenally high AC and SH stats. This will burn through a significant amount of piety, but can easily create AC scores of 100+ (or [http://dobrazupa.org/morgue/Happylisk/morgue-Happylisk-20150322-153903.txt higher] in extreme cases). Even so, it is not a spell widely considered worth bothering with. \n\n==Monster Version==\nThe monster version of this spell is significantly more effective and ignores the number of corpses used, granting 6 + (HD/3) AC and SH. Any monster that knows this spell generates with it active. Each time you strike the caster or have your attack blocked by the caster, there is a 25% chance of the barrier decomposing.\n\nThe following monsters could cast Cigotuvi's Embrace:\n* {{monsterlink|Hellwing}}\n\n==History==\n*The spell was removed in [[0.21]].\n*Hellwings' Cigotuvi's Embrace was removed in [[0.19]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], being hit also degraded the armour.\n*Cigotuvi's Embrace was added in [[0.16]], replacing [[Twisted Resurrection (player spell)|Twisted Resurrection]]."}

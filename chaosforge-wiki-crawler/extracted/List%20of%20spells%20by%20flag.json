{"title":"List of spells by flag","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_spells_by_flag","type":"raw","data":"{{version024}}\nThis is a list of all memorizable spells in Crawl, organized by flags, along with descriptions of those flags.\n\n==Targeting==\nSmite-targeted spells use the [[#Target|target]] or [[#Grid|grid]] flag; the former requires a target creature while the latter does not. [[Apportation]] is unique in that it \"smites\" an object ([[#Targ obj|targ obj]]) rather than a creature. Beam-targeted spells use [[#Dir or target|dir or target]]. Direction-only spells (currently, only [[Passwall]]) use [[#Dir|dir]]. The [[#Not self|not self]] flag prevents you from targeting yourself or your square. The restriction that [[Conjure Flame]] not target a square with a creature is handled as a special case, rather than using a flag.\n\nThe [[#Neutral|neutral]] and [[#Helpful|helpful]] flags affect the default targeting mode for the '''=''' and '''-''' targeting commands (hostiles, any, or friends), though this can always be changed by pressing control-F at the targeting prompt.\n\n==Religion==\nSpells with the flags [[#Unholy|unholy]], [[#Chaotic|chaotic]], [[#Unclean|unclean]], or [[#Hasty|hasty]] offend some gods (as do [[Necromancy]] spells regardless of flags).  See the descriptions below for more details.\n\n{{spell table by flag}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of spells]] (alphabetical)\n* [[List of spells by level]]\n* [[List of spells by book]]\n* [[List of spells by school]]\n* [[List of attack spells and beams by maximum damageâ€Ž]]\n\n[[Category:Spells]]\n[[Category:List]]"}

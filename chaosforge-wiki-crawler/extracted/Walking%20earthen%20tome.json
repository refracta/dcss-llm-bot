{"title":"Walking earthen tome","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Walking_earthen_tome","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Walking earthen tomes''' conjure living [[Petrify]] spells. They have moderately strong melee attacks, too. [[Walking tomes]] are most often seen in [[the Depths]] and the wizlab, [[Tukima's Studio]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n* Walking earthen tomes are arguably the least threatening of the walking tomes, since Petrify can be resisted by [[willpower]], and you can always use a [[potion of cancellation]] to get rid of it. Still, having to use a potion of cancellation - or risk instant death - shouldn't be taken lightly. \n* For reference, earthen tomes cast Petrify at the same strength as an [[ancient lich]]. That's a 14% success rate at the lower bound of Will+++, and a 1% success rate at the lower bound of Will++++. At least 168 willpower is required to reach a 0% success rate.\n* Living spells work similarly to the player [[Foxfire]] spell. It creates a living spell entity, which must have a direct path to a hostile target. If you are in melee range with a tome in a corridor, most of the living spells will be unable to hit you. But unlike the foxfire spell, living spells can spawn behind the player (radius-2 of the walking tome), so a corridor is not foolproof.\n** You can attack a living spell, which will destroy it before it gets the chance to cast itself. Most types of AOE attacks can destroy a few spells while damaging the tome in the process.\n* [[Silence]] works on walking tomes, preventing them from creating living spells.\n\n==History==\n* Prior to [[0.30]], walking tomes could use Conjure Living Spells when [[silence]]d.\n* Walking tomes were added in [[0.28]]."}

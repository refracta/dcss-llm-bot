{"title":"Bombardier beetle","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bombardier_beetle","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Bombardier beetles''' are insects that can set you [[Sticky Flame|on fire]]. They can be found in the early [[Dungeon]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They are slow, so it is easy to retreat if you can't fight one yet.\n*They are vulnerable to [[poison]], so kiting one around while throwing poisoned darts at a distance is a good way to avoid ever getting hit.\n*Moving around will end the fire more quickly.\n*Bombardier beetles' Pyre Arrow is a natural ability, so you can't use [[silence]] to prevent them from casting.\n\n==History==\n* Bombardier beetles were added in [[0.31]]."}

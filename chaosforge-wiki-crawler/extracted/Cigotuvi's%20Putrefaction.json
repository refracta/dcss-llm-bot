{"title":"Cigotuvi's Putrefaction","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cigotuvi%27s_Putrefaction","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{spell info}}\n{{stub}} \n\n'''Cigotuvi's Putrefaction''' is a smite-targeted level 4 [[Necromancy]]/[[Air Magic]] spell, which must be cast on a [[:Category:Natural_holiness|living]] monster that is at least 'heavily wounded'. It causes [[miasma]] clouds to billow out from this monster over the next several turns. These clouds start as harmless 'faint miasma' that turn into proper miasma clouds the next turn. Faint miasma will never turn harmful so long as the player themselves is standing there (so no matter what terrain you create the clouds on, they won't hurt you - though it's still possible to surround yourself!)\n\nThe spell has a [[draining]] cost, which is heavily reduced by spellpower.\n\n==Useful Info==\n\n==Strategy==\n\n==History==\n*Added in [[0.32]] as the thematic replacement for [[Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot]]."}

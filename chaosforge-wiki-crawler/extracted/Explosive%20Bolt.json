Each target it hits will cause a 3Ã—3 explosion on the target, as through struck by [[Fireball]].\n\nWhile it doesn't have perfect accuracy, it can tear through a cramped group of opponents. Also note that the explosions can hurt you, so try to avoid using it against melee opponents.\n\n==History==\n*Explosive Bolt was removed in [[0.20]], along with [[rod]]s.\n*Explosive Bolt was added in [[0.14]]."}

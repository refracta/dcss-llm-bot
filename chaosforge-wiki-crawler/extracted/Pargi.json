{"title":"Pargi","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Pargi","type":"raw","data":"{{version|029}}\n{{list of|trolls}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Pargi the Meek''' is an unusually thin and nervous [[unique]] [[troll (monster)|troll]] who was bullied into fleeing to the higher portions of the [[Dungeon]]. He is weaker than most trolls, but still a serious menace to low-level characters.\n\n[[Parghit]] is an alternate version of Pargi. Only one may spawn per game.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:3-4\n*The [[Sewers]] (some layouts)\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Although weaker than a normal troll, Pargi is a major threat when first encountered. He has decent damage output and trollish [[regeneration]], which you may not be able to overcome so early on. Kill him quickly with strong attacks, overwhelm his healing with [[poison]] or [[Sticky Flame]], or run down a floor and don't risk it until later.\n*If you're lucky, you'll be able to get an early set of [[troll leather armour]] off Pargi's corpse. It might be slightly [[enchant]]ed and will be inscribed with his name, but is otherwise no different than any other set.\n*The fact that he often shows up in the Sewers means casters with [[Mephitic Cloud]] or [[Confusion]] can get an easy kill by confusing him into deep water, though you probably won't be able to get the armour off of his corpse if that happens.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to version [[0.28]], Pargi was known as '''Purgy'''.\n\n[[Category:Troll]]"}

Sprague. January 26, 1900.}}\n{{crawlquote|This weapon falls into the [[Maces & Flails]] category. It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Clubs''' are extremely basic weapons, found in the early Dungeon.\n\n==Strategy==\n''From the learndb: \"Not a terrible weapon forged in the fires of hell -- just a terrible weapon.\"''\n\nClubs are strictly inferior to [[whip]]s, which are almost as commonplace. They are marginally more powerful than 0 skill [[Unarmed Combat]], but whips, [[dagger]]s, and [[short sword]]s are all stronger for a 0 skill character.\n\nVery occasionally, an early [[unique]] like [[Jessica]] or [[Ijyb]] might spawn with a highly-enchanted club, giving you a vaguely acceptable weapon early on, but you'll still want to look for something stronger, faster, and/or with a [[brand]]. [[Killer Klown]]s all carry branded, highly-enchanted clubs, but by the time you've reached the [[Realm of Zot]], you'll have access to dozens of better weapons.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

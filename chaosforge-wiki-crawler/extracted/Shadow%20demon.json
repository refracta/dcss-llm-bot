{"title":"Shadow demon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shadow_demon","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Shadow demons''' are [[demon]]ic summoners which haunt demonic places, summoning waves of dangerous foes at you as soon as they spot you. They're faster than normal, but thankfully aren't very durable by tier-2 standards. They can be found in [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], and the [[Hell]]s (particularly in [[Tartarus]]), as well as summoned by the [[Summon Greater Demon]] spell.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The summons of [[Shadow Creatures]] depends on where you are. If one spawns in the early [[Dungeon]] during the [[Orb run]], it will be next to harmless. On the other hand, one appearing on a particularly bad [[Ziggurat]] floor can be extremely deadly.\n*Shadow demons will spend many of their turns trying to move into melee range with you. Make them a high priority to keep them from calling for reinforcements, and if they do manage to get some nasties out, use powerful ranged attacks to take them down fast. Once the summoner falls, its summons die with it.\n\n==History==\n*Shadow demons lost [[Summon Demon]] in [[0.27]].\n*Prior to [[0.10]], shadow demons had permanent invisibility and normal speed, but no spells.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

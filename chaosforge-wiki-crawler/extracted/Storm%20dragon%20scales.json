It is heavier than most dragon scale armours, and gives its wearer great resistance to lightning discharges.}}\n\n'''Storm dragon scales''' are a heavy suit of [[armour]] that provides [[electricity resistance]].\n\nThis item has a 33% chance to to generate when you slay a [[storm dragon]]. [[Bai Suzhen]] has the same chance to drop an [[enchant]]ed storm dragon scales.\n\n==Desirability==\nStorm dragon scales offer the same protection as [[plate armour]], with slightly lower encumbrance. However, they are in a tight position:\n*Plate armour has slightly more encumbrance, and no rElec, but it's much more common: you can find and [[enchant]] one earlier. Also, you're more likely to find an [[artefact]] plate armour.\n*For heavy armour characters, [[gold dragon scales]] can be found around the same time, which gives more AC and has 3 resistances instead of one. \n*For others, the encumbrance might be too high. Casters and [[ranged weapon]] users will usually want a lighter set of dragon scales.\n\nHowever, electricity resistance is moderately rare. For those who cannot get rElec easily, and can afford the encumbrance, a set of storm dragon scales can be a strong option. Having rElec is most useful in areas like [[Zot]], where electric damage is commonplace.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], it was named storm dragon armour and was obtained by [[scroll of enchant armour|enchanting]] a [[storm dragon hide]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], its encumbrance rating was 17.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

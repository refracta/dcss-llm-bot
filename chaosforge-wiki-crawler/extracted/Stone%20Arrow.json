It deals fair and irresistible damage all throughout the [[Dungeon]], [[Lair]], and [[Orcish Mines]].\n*It's also a strong spell for [[Spellforged Servitor]]. Monster Stone Arrow doesn't have the same power cap as the player, so servitors can do much more damage. However, players with Servitor will likely have the skill for [[Iron Shot]], which is a stronger spell.\n\n==Monster Version==\nThe monster version is similar to the player version, except its power cap is much greater.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], Stone Arrow's damage was increased."}

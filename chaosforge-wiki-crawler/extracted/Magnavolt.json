{"title":"Magnavolt","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Magnavolt","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{stub}}\n{{spell info}} \n\n'''Magnavolt''' is a level 7 [[Air Magic|Air]]/[[Earth]] smite-targeted spell that coats a target with a thin layer of magnetised metal and then fires a bolt of electricity at every visible enemy that is magnetised in this way.\n\n==Useful Info==\n\nThe first time you cast this spelt, it will fire one bolt, but repeatedly casting it will fire 2, 3, 4, and so forth.\n\nThe magnetised status is short-lived, reduces the target's EV to 0, and also causes them to leave behind a [[cloud]] of magnetised fragments for a brief while after death (which is stationary, so that it can continue to serve as an anchor for the spell if the initial target immediately dies, which helps to keep the ramp-up more predictable in situations where the caster is actually successfully killing things). Also, the magnetised dust status reveals [[invisible]] enemies.\n\n==Strategy==\n\n==History==\n*Added in [[0.32]]."}

For information about other versions of Crawl, including the newest, see [List of Stone Soup versions](/List_of_Stone_Soup_versions \"List of Stone Soup versions\").*\n\n**0.15** is a version of *Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup*. It was released on August 28th, 2014.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Highlights](#Highlights)\n- [2 Branches, environment](#Branches.2C_environment)\n- [3 Character](#Character)\n- [4 Monsters](#Monsters)\n- [5 Spells](#Spells)\n- [6 Items](#Items)\n- [7 Cards](#Cards)\n- [8 Gods](#Gods)\n- [9 Interface](#Interface)\n- [10 0.15.1](#0.15.1)\n- [11 0.15.2](#0.15.2)\n\n## Highlights\n\n- New god: Qazlal Stormbringer.\n- Nemelex Xobeh and decks in general have had many changes.\n- Ranged combat has been rewritten from the ground up.\n- Inventory weight limits have been removed.\n- Item destruction is no more, and corrosion has a more severe but temporary effect.\n\n## Branches, environment\n\n- The Hall of Blades has been cut.\n- Crypt is now three levels (was five).\n- Some areas of the Tomb layout can now vary.\n- Mechanical traps no longer drop ammo.\n- Most randomly-placed teleport traps now disappear after one use.\n- Troves asking for items require that item to be unequipped.\n- The Abyss no longer sometimes blocks blinking.\n- Mutagenic fog now causes large amounts of glow instead of mutating directly.\n\n## Character\n\n- Inventory item weight and player burden states are no more.\n\n- Cross-training now gives a direct bonus to cross-trained skills, rather than decreasing the XP cost of learning them.\n\n- Anti-training (for opposite elemental schools) has been removed.\n\n- Formicids can no longer throw large rocks.\n\n- Tengu now gain permaflight at XL14 (was 15).\n\n- All non-undead forms can eat and drink normally.\n\n- All forms can butcher.\n\n- Wisp form can read scrolls and cannot blink on demand.\n\n- Teleportitis cannot be controlled.\n\n- Wanderers have tweaked starting kits with generally better items.\n\n- Player clinging (seen only in Spider Form and with the boots of the Spider) is no more.\n\n- Kobolds, hill orcs, and ogres are no longer saprovorous.\n\n- Kobolds no longer have disease resistance.\n\n- Halflings have rebalanced stats and aptitudes, shifting them towards defense.\n\n- Ogres and centaurs no longer have a fast metabolism; halflings no longer have a slow metabolism.\n\n- Centaurs are no longer herbivorous.\n\n- Vampires:\n\n  - always get the full effect of all potions;\n  - can always mutate; and\n  - always get the full effect of all mutations.\n\n- Some Demonspawn mutations have been modified:\n\n  - The Foul Stench facet gives rot immunity earlier and separately instead of saprovore.\n  - Facets which gave potion/scroll item conservation now give freezing/fire cloud immunity earlier and separately.\n\n- The hoof mutation no longer gives extra damage or a stealth penalty for players wearing boots.\n\n- Player rPois now gives a consistent 2/3rds resistance to poison effects; this is lower than the previous resistance to poisoning, but higher than the old resistance to direct poison damage. \"Strong poison\" effects no longer punch through rPois, and paralytic stings (wasps) can now slow through rPois.\n\n## Monsters\n\n- Many enemy glyphs have been adjusted. See 0.14\\_monster\\_glyphs.txt.\n- Monsters will no longer pick up items that the player has seen. Allies won't pick up items at all.\n- Corrosion affects all of your equipment, but only temporarily, and the chance to corrode equipment does not consider item enchantment.\n- Draining effects no longer permanently reduce monsters' stats ('hit dice'); instead, they apply a temporary status which reduces hit dice for the duration.\n- Monsters no longer fall asleep after long periods of time.\n- New monster: ghost crabs, found in Crypt. They breathe ghostly flames that call dangerous specters into existence.\n- New monster: torpor snails, found in Lair and Spider. Their enemies are slowed on sight, somewhat like ancient zymes.\n- Enemies are more intelligent about using area-of-attack spells such as Symbol of Torment and Chain Lightning even when you are not in sight.\n- Komodo dragons now bite harder but don't sicken the player.\n- Purple ugly things deal extra damage in lieu of a sickness attack.\n- Deep dwarf death knights are now just death knights.\n- Manticores now move as fast as the player, and have an unlimited number of spike volleys.\n- Base draconians can become nonbase draconians with experience.\n- Undead and nonliving enemies regenerate as fast as other enemies.\n- Silver statues and orange crystal statues are immune to disintegration, but have less health and AC and have their abilities converted to spells such that they spam less; this implies OCS confusion can be resisted.\n- Bog bodies no longer randomly rot.\n- Undead monsters will now fall to pieces in deep water, instead of hiding invisibly.\n- Curse skulls are now immobile, again.\n- Lost souls now make enemies into ghosts instead of specters.\n- Spriggan riders now ride wasps.\n- Ugly & very ugly things are now dramatically nastier.\n- Cherub's hymns can buff any allies, not just those with higher HDs.\n- Killing holy monsters no longer invokes cleansing flame on the perpetrator.\n- Ghouls and necrophages can no longer equip weapons or armour.\n- Mimics no longer mimic doors, statues, fountains or hatches.\n- Each unique now has a special title, shown when you first see them or in the description screen.\n- Removed enemies: vapours, thorn lotuses, giant goldfish, silver stars, flaming corpses, grizzly bears, spriggan enchanters, phoenixes, shedu, plague shamblers, giant slugs, elephant slugs, giant fireflies, brown oozes, pulsating lumps, big fish, sharks, lava worms.\n\n## Spells\n\n- Dazzling Spray replaces Invisibility in the book of Maledictions (the Enchanter starting spellbook). Invisibility in turn replaces Apportation in the book of Burglary.\n- Casting Ozocubu's Refrigeration now prevents the player from using potions for several turns instead of destroying potions.\n- Spider Form now moves at normal speed, and no longer gives clinging.\n- Tukima's Dance now animates weapons held by monsters. The weapons will fight against their former owners. It is also now level 3.\n- Confusing Touch now has a short, non-stacking duration which discharges entirely when it successfully confuses an enemy. While it's in effect, your attacks do no damage. It's been moved to level 2.\n- Sublimation of Blood no longer uses chunks; it now only draws from the caster's HP. Fedhas now permits its use.\n- Simulacrum now works on a single corpse at the caster's feet, creating several simulacra from it.\n- Monsters casting Simulacrum now affect all corpses in LOS, producing half as many simulacra as the player version of the spell.\n- Many spells, which used player skill, now use spellpower instead: Death's Door, Passwall, Sticks to Snakes, Ozocubu's Armour, Condensation Shield, Stoneskin, Statue Form, and Ice Form.\n- Shatter is now always full-LOS-ranged, instead of depending on Earth skill.\n- Statue Form no longer gives -10 EV.\n- Death Channel lasts twice as long.\n- The Book of War Chants is no more.\n- Removed spells: Fire Brand, Freezing Aura, Lethal Infusion, Poison Weapon, Summon Elemental.\n\n## Items\n\n- Item destruction is no more.\n\n- Ranged combat has been rewritten based on melee attacks - AC and EV has more of an impact, attack delay is more predictable, and Throwing should be more viable as a ranged option as compared to bows and crossbows, among other changes.\n\n  - Slings have been split into two weapon types; the basic type has been renamed to 'hunting sling', and a new, rare 'greatsling' has been added.\n  - Crossbows have been split into three types. The hand crossbow returns as a starting weapon; the basic crossbow has been renamed to an 'arbalest'; and a new, rare 'triple crossbow' type has been added.\n  - (Plain) bows have been renamed to shortbows.\n\n- Weapon enchantment & slaying bonsues have been merged into a single number, giving both +accuracy & +damage. Scrolls of enchant weapon I, II, and III have all been merged into a new \"enchant weapon\" scroll. The scrolls are rarer, but always succeed.\n\n- Shields have been rebalanced. All non-shield-enchantment sources of SH have been halved, and the effectiveness of SH at blocking attacks has been doubled, to make the utility of a point of SH roughly equivalent to a point of EV. In effect, this is a small buff. Non-bucklers can now be enchanted past +3.\n\n- Multiple changes to unrandarts:\n\n  - The blowgun of the Assassin returns; it has a chance to affect the target more than normal blowguns.\n  - New unrand: the +8 orange crystal plate armour {Archmagi, Int+3 Clar SustAb}.\n  - New unrand: the +6 Majin-Bo {vamp, Archmagi, MP+6 Int+6}. A quarterstaff that takes HP every time you cast a spell.\n  - The dagger of Chilly Death now sometimes flash-freezes enemies, slowing their movement, and the scimitar of Flaming Death now sometimes applies sticky flame to its victims.\n  - Leech is now +8, with -2 to all stats (instead of -1), and -2 to both AC and EV.\n  - Skullcrusher is now +3 with +7 strength.\n  - The Trident of the Octopus King now starts at +8 and gets an additional + for each Ring of the Octopus King worn. If anyone reads this & gets it to +10 or higher in an actual game, send screenshots!\n  - Punk is now a +7 greatsling {Freeze, rC+}.\n  - Sniper is now a \"heavy crossbow\", a triple crossbow with 27 base delay.\n  - The Mace of Brilliance is now the +1 Eveningstar \"Brilliance\".\n  - Many other weapon artefacts have had their enchantments tweaked.\n  - Maxwell's Patent Armour now gives rF+ rC+ instead of Conservation.\n  - The Shield of Resistance, Shield of the Gong, and Large Shield of Ignorance have had their enchantment levels adjusted.\n  - Removed unrands: the boots of the Spider.\n\n- Branding changes:\n\n  - Scrolls of brand weapon will no longer make temporary brands permanent, but can now randomly apply any brand to an unbranded weapon.\n  - Blessed weapons can be rebranded.\n  - Rebranding a distortion weapon no longer causes a distortion effect.\n  - Branded non-artefact weapons can now be given a temporary re-brand.\n  - Damage from the electrocution brand has been reduced slightly.\n  - Draining now triggers somewhat less often, but will cause monsters to be temporarily drained whenever it does fire.\n  - The dragonslaying brand is no longer generated. (Wyrmbane still has it.)\n\n- Food changes:\n\n  - Honeycombs have been renamed to royal jellies; they don't restore abilities.\n  - Potions of blood cure a point of ghoul rotting.\n  - All types of fruit have been merged together into one gooey, messy item type.\n  - Brown (contaminated) chunks are gone, replaced with normal ones.\n  - Cheese, sausages, and ambrosia are no more.\n\n- New item: potion of cancellation, which removes enchantments & contamination on the player.\n\n- Scrolls of vulnerability have been simplified; they now just halve MR for all creatures in LOS.\n\n- Cancellation-type effects (from the potion, quicksilver dragons, etc) now reduce transformation durations to one turn, rather than cancelling them immediately.\n\n- Identify scrolls now always identify a single item.\n\n- Jewellery automatically identifies once equipped.\n\n- Amulets of inaccuracy are always cursed.\n\n- New rings of stealth and loudness, which positively/negatively adjust a player's stealth.\n\n- Amulets of rage no longer have a tiny chance of extending berserk duration.\n\n- Sacks of spiders now place webs directly onto enemies, rather than spreading them randomly around the area.\n\n- Cleaving hits the full eight squares around a player, when not blocked by walls.\n\n- Putting on or taking off armour now always takes five turns.\n\n- Gloves of archery no longer penalise melee.\n\n- Sustain abilities effects no longer stack.\n\n- Amulets of resist corrosion now give only 50% corrosion resistance, from 90%.\n\n- Potions of resistance now grant corrosion resistance.\n\n- Staves of air now activate extra melee damage as often as other elemental staves.\n\n- Flying creatures no longer have a 2/3rds chance of dodging thrown nets.\n\n- Weapons and armour which aren't visibly enchanted no longer have enchantments higher than +0.\n\n- Corpses and skeletons are stationary, and can't be picked up nor apported.\n\n- Other removed items: darts, rings of hunger and sustenance, amulet of conservation, cloak of preservation, potions of strong poison and paralysis.\n\n## Cards\n\n- New cards.\n\n  - Fortitude, which gives Damage Shaving and a bonus to strength.\n  - Storm, which can make shallow water, a tornado, or cause swiftness.\n  - Cloud, which spawns dangerous clouds around the user and on hostiles.\n  - Degeneration, which polymorphs nearby monsters into weaker ones.\n  - Shaft, which creates a shaft under the player.

Qazlal is a temple god, with an altar either in Temple or on D:2-9.\n\n  - Piety on kills.\n  - All followers are immune from their own clouds.\n  - 1\\*: Storm Shield: you passively generate elemental clouds around you and gain bonus SH, and gain RMsl at 3\\*; you also generate a lot of noise.\n  - 2\\*: Upheaval: blast a small nearby area with elemental forces.\n  - 3\\*: Elemental Force: turn nearby clouds into elementals.\n  - 4\\*: Elemental Adaptation: taking elemental or physical damage sometimes temporarily grants you resistance against that element.\n  - 5\\*: Disaster Area: blast the entire area around you with elemental forces.\n\n- Nemelex has been revamped.\n\n  - Nemelex only gives piety for exploration rather than item sacrifices or deck usage.\n  - Peek at Two now reveals the top cards of a deck but cannot be used with other Nemelex abilities.\n  - Nemelex now only gifts decks of war and escape.\n  - Various cards have been changed, added, or removed.

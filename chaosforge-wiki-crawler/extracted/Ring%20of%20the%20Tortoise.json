Its wearer is exceptionally difficult to harm.}}\n[[File:Ring_of_the_Tortoise.png]] '''''the ring of the Tortoise'''''<br>\n+8 AC\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''ring of the Tortoise'''<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|art-data.txt|1124}}</ref> offers a massive amount of general defense, plain and simple. Finding one early on can do amazing things for the survivability of your character, and will remain a helpful aid into the late game. Don't be afraid to swap it out if you need some crucial resistance for a fight, but most characters would be wise to wear this as a general ring.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], this ring was called the '''ring of Robustness'''.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Jewellery]]"}

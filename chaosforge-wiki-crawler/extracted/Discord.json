{"title":"Discord","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Discord","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Discord''' is a level 8 [[Hexes]] spell that attempts to [[frenzy]] all monsters in your [[line of sight]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nAll susceptible monsters who fail a [[willpower]] test will be [[frenzied]]. Frenzy turns monsters \"neutral\", causing them to attack the nearest creature. Additionally, monsters will gain [[haste]] and [[might]] for the duration, and can't cast spells. Monsters are [[slow]]ed for a brief time afterwards.\n\nThis spell can affect all monsters with low enough willpower, including [[nonliving]], [[:Category:Plant holiness|plant]], and [[Monster intelligence|mindless]] creatures. This spell will affect [[allies]], though it will not affect allies which you can never harm (such as [[Fedhas]] plants or [[Demonic Guardian]]s).\n\nLike other \"mass enchantments\", Discord has an [[enchantment power]] multiplier of x1.5.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|beam.cc|1785}}</ref> See the [[Willpower#Resisting enchantments|Willpower]] article for more details on enchantment power.\n\nThis spell is hated by [[Cheibriados]], who will impose [[penance]] on any player casting it.\n\n==Strategy==\nDiscord is a great spell against groups of enemies. Some monsters may resist the spell, but they'll usually be torn apart by their frenzied brethren. Even in the lategame, you'll face packs of low-moderate will monsters, such as [[list of ogres|ogre]] bands, [[deep troll]] packs, and [[list of draconians|draconians]] in Zot. The [[Vaults]]:5 entry is also a great target for Discord.\n\n===Tips & tricks===\n* After frenzying a pack of monsters, you'll usually want to get away, fast. You don't want to be swarmed by a pack of hasted and mighted monsters.\n* Frenzied monsters can attack others ''even if they aren't in your [[LOS]]''. For example, you can use [[Dispersal]] to teleport frenzied monsters around the whole level, causing monsters to fight each other on the other side of the floor. This is unlike a great majority of things in DCSS.\n* Unaffected monsters do not usually target their former allies, unless they themselves get attacked by them. Coupled with the increased damage and speed, it is possible for a frenzied [[vault guard]] to walk up to several mighty dragons and slaughter them one by one.\n* If you need to stop frenzy, you can dispel it with [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]] or a [[wand of quicksilver]].\n* You get full XP from frenzied monsters - both when a frenzied monster dies, and when a frenzy monster kills others.\n\n==External Links==\n*Looking for a Discord ''server'' instead? See for example https://www.reddit.com/r/dcss/comments/6hcvwy/is_there_any_dcss_community_discord_server/.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Discord could not affect sleeping monsters, and did not haste or might creatures which weren't [[natural]] holiness. You would not get XP when a frenzied monster died. Also, gods which hated attacking neutral monsters would forbid attacking a frenzied one. In 0.28, frenzy can be dispelled again.\n*In [[0.27]], Discord's frenzy could not be dispelled.\n*Discord was added in [[0.13]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

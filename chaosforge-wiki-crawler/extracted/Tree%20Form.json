You have minimal evasion but increased health and natural armour, and are resistant to poison and immune to torment.\n\nAny equipped cloak, helmet, gloves, boots and body armour are melded.}}\n\n'''Tree form''' is a [[bad form]] which prevents movement and teleportation, but offers high natural AC and some resistances. It can be forced on the player through a [[wand of polymorph]] or the [[Polymorph]] spell, but can also be entered voluntarily with a [[potion of lignification]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhile transformed into a tree, the player gains the following attributes:\n\n'''Combat:'''\n*'''HP Bonus:''' 150% HP.\n*'''Innate AC:''' <code>20 + [[XL]]/2</code> AC (20 - 33).\n*'''Unarmed Combat:''' 12 damage.\n*[[EV]] is set to basically nil, <code>2 + [[Evasion#Base EV|size_factor]]/2</code>.\n\n'''Resistances:'''\n*[[Poison|rPois]]\n*[[Torment]] immunity\n*[[Unbreathing]] and lacks [[blood]]\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n* '''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' All armour except shield.\n*Cannot move or be moved.\n*Cannot [[teleport]] or [[blink]] (certain divine abilities, like [[Uskayaw]]'s Grand Finale, still work).\n\n==Strategy==\nTree Form is easily the most combat-capable of the bad forms, with high HP, AC, and unarmed branches that are stronger than many weapons in the early game (even at 0 Unarmed skill!). However, it is also one of the most risky, as trees are unable to move or teleport away. \n\nTree Form is useful throughout many different parts of the game:\n*Early on, Tree Form is great for fighting fast, poisonous enemies like [[killer bee]]s and [[black mamba]]s. Very early in the game, Tree Form's high stats can let you take out all sorts of tough monsters.\n*Later in the game, it is useful for the immunity to [[torment]]. It is especially useful in [[the Tomb]], as Tree Form prevents [[dispersal trap]]s  and many [[death curse]]s from affecting you. Just watch out for [[miasma]].\n*Species with armour restrictions  ([[Felid]]s, [[Octopode]]s, oddly-[[size]]d species) will enjoy the increased AC throughout the entire game. [[Troll]]s in particular have a special use for Tree Form, as its high AC and boosted, non-chopping unarmed attacks are perfect for taking out [[hydra]]s.\n\nThe big downside is you cannot move. If a situation becomes too much to handle, you'll be in dire straits. You can use a [[potion of cancellation]] to end the form early, but these potions are rare, and drinking the potion wastes a valuable turn.\n\nAlso, if you don't have a reliable means of ranged combat, be wary of ranged and [[reaching]] attacks, which will strike you with impunity. Use terrain such as a [[kill hole]] to your advantage. A [[potion of attraction]] will force monsters closer, if need be.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*The inability to move also gives immunity to enemies that shove you around ([[wind drake]]s, [[swamp worm]]s, monsters with [[Force Lance]], [[Roxanne]]...).\n*Tree Form will negate the attack penalties of standing in [[shallow water]].\n*Keep in mind that transforming into Tree Form will suppress the innate abilities associated with your original species, leading to possibly unexpected results. For example, if you were a [[formicid]], quaffing the potion to fight an invisible enemy might be counter-productive, since you will lose your [[Good_mutations#Antennae|Antennae]] which allowed you to see invisible.\n*Against enemies that attack with clouds, such as [[ushabti]], you can use a [[scroll of fog]] to counter them. Only one cloud can exist at a time, so placing fog clouds will prevent more deadly clouds from being placed on your tile.\n*Tree Form doesn't have [[blood]], so [[skyshark]]s are unable to activate their bloodzerk attack flavour.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

Tree Form also greatly increased players' [[size]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the [[potion of lignification]] did not exist. Tree Form [[slow]]ed the player by an amount based on your experience level ranging from 50% - 0%, prevented players from shouting, and followers of [[Fedhas Madash]] gained rF+ and rC+.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], it made the player vulnerable to fire, and the AC bonus and the speed penalty didn't depend on XL.\n*Like most bad forms, Tree Form was added in [[0.12]]\n\n{{Forms}}"}

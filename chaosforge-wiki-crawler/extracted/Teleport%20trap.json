{"title":"Teleport trap","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Teleport_trap","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{flavour|A magical trap that will displace anyone passing over it to a random place on the same dungeon level.}}\n\nA '''teleport trap''' is a magical [[trap]] that instantly [[teleport]]s any player or monster that walks on it to another location on the level, even if [[fly]]ing. Because they are an instantaneous form of teleportation, they make for good emergency escape routes, especially if you've already explored most of the current floor.\n__NOTOC__\n==Types==\n===Temporary===\n[[File:Temporary_teleport_trap.png]]\nTemporary teleport traps are randomly generated, and are always visible. Once a player or monster has passed over it once, the trap will disappear. This includes if the subject was not actually teleported (e.g. a [[Formicid]] with [[stasis]]).\n\n===Permanent===\n[[File:Teleport trap.png]]\nPermanent teleport traps are only encountered as part of a pregenerated [[vault]], most notably the [[Hall of Zot]] on [[Zot]]:5. Like temporary traps, they are always visible, though as their name suggests, do not disappear.\n\nItems on a permanent teleport trap are stuck and cannot be accessed normally, even with [[autopickup]]. You must use the [[Apportation]] spell or have the -Tele intrinsic (or be a [[Formicid]]) in order to retrieve it.\n\n===Exploration===\nWhen uncovering dungeon tiles, you may randomly encounter [[sourceless malevolence]] that manifests itself as a teleport trap.  Unlike the physical traps, the exploration effect will always teleport you next to monsters (if possible), similar to [[teleportitis]]. It does not have a physical presence.\n\n==History==\n*Traps in general were overhauled in [[0.23]] - see the [[Traps#History]] section for more details.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], there was still a 'disarm trap' command, and traps did care about whether the player is flying. \n*Prior to [[0.15]], all teleport traps were permanent.\n\n[[Category: Traps]]"}

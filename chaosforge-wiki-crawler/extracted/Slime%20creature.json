Two slime creatures combined form a “large slime creature”, three a “very large slime creature”, and so on (see below). As their size increases, so does their HP and damage:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

The [[XP]] yield is slightly lower when killing a merged slime creature, but this amount is insignificant.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n===Merge Mechanics===\n*It's better to fight slime creatures when separated. Damage may seem similar: fighting 5 individual slimes can deal 5*22 = 110 damage, while a titanic slime deals 110 damage. However, when fighting the individual slimes, your [[AC]] and [[EV]] applies for each of the 5 hits. With the titanic slime, AC and EV are only applied once.\n*Slime creatures generally merge when one slime \"wants to move\" into another slime's tile.\n**In corridors, you can expect them to merge immediately.\n**If you're surrounded by monsters, and the closest position is already filled by a slime, a merge is likely to happen.\n**They'll occasionally merge if a group of slimes are diagonal to you.\n*Slime creatures tend to separate in open space. In practice, if you’re fighting a merged slime creature and there is an adjacent space that is free, they will likely separate. Also, if you leave [[LOS]] of a merged slime, it'll generally split up.\n*Slime creatures cannot merge if they are not adjacent to each other.\n\n===General===\n*The usual tactics of luring individuals away from groups and killing them are vital here. It helps that slime creatures don't make noise.\n*Slimes, no matter how many are merged together, are stuck at 40 [[willpower]]. With moderate skill investment, [[Hexes]] and hex [[wand]]s can be effective. When a merged slime splits, each slime keeps any statuses it had.\n**A [[wand of charming]] turns even the biggest slimes into your side. Plus, if you bring a charmed slime into open space, it'll split.\n**[[Agony]] is effective for its raw damage output. However, it can only be used in melee range. Unless you got great defenses, don't try to agony a titanic slime creature; frailer necromancers can get one-shot.\n*When you [[polymorph]] a merged slime creature, there's an 80% chance of it splitting before the polymorph completes, then each resulting slime is polymorphed. As usual, this is limited to one of the three listed monsters you see before using the wand. The final number of creatures depends on size:\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"margin-left: 4em; margin:auto\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Size Category!!colspan=5 |Number of Creatures\n|-\n!1!!2!!3!!4!!5\n|-\n|Normal||100%||||||||\n|-\n|Large||20%||80%|||||||\n|-\n|Very Large||20%||||80%||||\n|-\n|Enormous||20%||||16%||64%||\n|-\n|Titanic||20%||||||16%||64%\n|-\n|}\n:Note that a slime which ''fails'' to split will polymorph into the same sorts of monster as an individual would. That is, you always get the same possibilities, but you have a 20% chance of getting ''one'' monster regardless of size, and for four-and five-fold merges, you have another 16% chance of losing one in the transformation.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], slime creatures had fast regeneration."}

{"title":"Eleionoma","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Eleionoma","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Eleionomae''' are tree-hugging nymphs found in the [[Swamp]]. They can fire bolts at you, and when adjacent to a tree, can cast Woodweal to heal themselves. When killed, their bones may turn into a random [[wand]] (a net 50% chance for this to happen).\n\nEleionomae can teleport into trees, to get closer to the player. Every turn, there's a 33% chance that an eleionoma teleports adjacent to a [[tree]].  The destination must be closer to the player, and at least 3 tiles away from its current position. It does not need to be currently adjacent to a tree to teleport.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-abil.cc|1064}}</ref>\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Splinterspray can deal up to 72 damage, which is a lot, but its damage is lowered by [[AC]] three times as much as normal spells.\n*Try not to fight them when they are next to trees - they can heal themselves back up to full when almost dead.\n**While eleionomae aren't vulnerable to fire themselves, [[Fireball]] or other strong [[Fire Magic]] can burn down trees.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Eleionmae did not drop wands on death.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Eleionmae destroyed trees whenever they used Woodweal.\n*Eleionomae were added in [[0.26]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

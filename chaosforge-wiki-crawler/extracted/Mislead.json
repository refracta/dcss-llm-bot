While this does make it difficult to determine what you're actually up against, it's possible for experienced players to figure out who's who based on context. [[Clarity]] grants immunity to this effect, and you can remove it by [[quaff]]ing a [[potion of curing]], by hitting yourself with a [[unrand#+3 Robe of Clouds|rain]] effect (''\"The rain washes away your illusions!\"''), or by leaving the level (''\"Away from their source, illusions no longer mislead you.\"'').\n\nIt can be cast by the following monsters:\n*{{monsterlink|Mara}}\n\n==History==\nThis spell was removed in [[0.14]]\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

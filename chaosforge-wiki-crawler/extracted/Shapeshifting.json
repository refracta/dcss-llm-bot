{"title":"Shapeshifting","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shapeshifting","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\nThe '''Shapeshifting''' skill governs use of [[talisman]]s, items that change your [[form]]. Higher Shapeshifting will reduce HP penalties and increase form bonuses.\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n==Strategy==\n*Most forms boost [[Unarmed Combat]] in some way.\n*The biggest jump is going from \"not being in a form\" to \"being in a form\". If you plan on going Shapeshifting, it can be wise to train Shapeshifting skill exclusively, until you reach an acceptable skill for a given form.\n*With the \"average\" species, [[Human]], having -1 Shapeshifting, don't be afraid to train a negative Shapeshifting aptitude.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Talisman]]\n*[[List of talismans]]\n*[[Shapeshifter]]\n\n==History==\n*The Shapeshifting skill was introduced in [[0.31]]. Previously, [[Transmutations]] magic would let you change your form.\n\n{{Skills}}"}

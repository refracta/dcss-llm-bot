{"title":"Mummy","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mummy","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n''This page covers the player [[species]]. For the monster, see [[Mummy (monster)]]. For a list of all monstrous mummies, see [[List of mummies]].''\n{{flavour|These are undead creatures who travel into the depths in search of revenge, redemption, or just because they want to.\n\nMummies progress slowly in levels, half again as slowly as Humans in all skills except fighting, spellcasting and necromancy. The sacred embalming rituals that brought them into unlife also grant them a special connection with the divine, and as they increase in levels, they become increasingly in touch with the powers of death. However, their desiccated bodies are highly flammable. They also cannot drink.\n\nLike other undead, mummies are naturally immune to poisons, negative energy and torment; have little warmth left to be affected by cold; and are not susceptible to mutations.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*Mummies are '''[[undead]]''' creatures, and have the following innate traits:\n**'''[[Cold Resistance 1]]''': Mummies are resistant to cold.\n**'''[[Life Protection 3]]''': Mummies are resistant to [[negative energy]].\n**'''[[Poison Resistance|Poison Immunity]]''': Mummies are immune to poison.\n**'''[[Torment Immunity]]''': Mummies cannot be tormented.\n**Mummies cannot gain [[mutation]]s, use [[talisman]]s, or be [[polymorph]]ed. When mutated, they receive [[stat]] penalties instead.\n**Mummies are [[unbreathing]], cannot be put to [[sleep]], cannot go [[berserk]], and do not have [[blood]].\n**Mummies are vulnerable to [[Dispel Undead]], [[holy]] damage, and [[holy wrath]]-[[brand]]ed weapons. They may not worship the [[good god]]s ([[The Shining One]], [[Zin]], or [[Elyvilon]]). The holy wrath brand will not function on weapons they wield.\n**Mummies cannot use the spells [[Borgnjor's Revivification]], [[Death's Door]], or [[Sublimation of Blood]].\n*'''[[Fire#Fire Vulnerability|Fire vulnerability]]''': Mummies take extra damage from fire.\n*'''[[Amulet of faith|Faith]]''': Mummies gain +25% [[piety]] from gods, and will receive divine gifts 33% more often. Does not stack with the [[amulet of faith]].\n*'''In Touch With Death 1:''' Mummies have a [[spell enhancer]] to all [[Necromancy]] spells, increasing their [[spell power]].\n*Mummies are incapable of drinking potions of any kind.\n\nMummies have a base [[Strength]] of 11, [[Intelligence]] of 7 and [[Dexterity]] of 7 (before Background modifiers).\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Zealots:''' [[Cinder Acolyte]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Hedge Wizard]], [[Conjurer]], [[Summoner]], [[Necromancer]], [[Ice Elementalist]]\n\nMummies are prohibited from becoming [[Shapeshifter]]s, as they can't change form.\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 to a random [[stat]] every 5th level.\n*Average [[HP]].\n*Average [[MP]].\n*+5 [[willpower]] per level.\n*Gain a second [[spell enhancer]] to [[Necromancy]] at level 13.\n\n==Starting Skills and Equipment==\nMummies receive the skills and equipment listed for their background, with the following exceptions:\n*Mummies start with no [[potion]]s of any kind.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Hard}}\n\nMummies are, without a doubt, a challenge species. They can't quaff [[potion]]s, which knocks out many emergency options. [[Confusion]] is a much greater threat, since they can't use [[potions of curing]] to end it. Intrinsic rF- can cause sudden and lethal spikes in damage (until its negated by rF+). In addition, mummies have poor skill aptitudes. Having undead resistances, an intrinsic [[amulet of faith]], and 2 [[Necromancy]] enhancers is more of a consolation prize than anything.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Mummy}}\n\n==Strategy==\nMummies are intentionally difficult, but there are ways to play to their advantages (such as they are).\n\n[[Necromancer]] is a decent start for Mummies, as it gives you access to allies so long as you can kill enemies. In addition to their innate spell boost, mummies are also immune to many of the miscast effects.\n\nAssuming you have managed to offset their rF-, high level Mummies fare well in the optional extended endgame. However, one has to survive all the non-optional parts first, during which time torment immunity barely helps, and all the disadvantages of Mummies are as salient as ever.\n\n===Confusion===\nMummies must always be careful of sources of [[confusion]]. Other than [[Ru]], Mummies have no way of curing confusion, making it (almost) as bad as [[paralysis]]. In a similar vein, [[petrification]] can't be [[potion of cancellation|cancelled]] by the potion. Therefore, Mummies should value [[willpower]] and [[clarity]] highly.\n\nHaving willpower (and poison immunity) can stop most sources of confusion. However, a [[tarantella]]'s touch can only be prevented by clarity, which you can only get by [[Ashenzari]] or a few [[unrand]]s. This makes the [[Spider's Nest]] ''much'' more dangerous than usual. If you don't have clarity (or Ru), you can go down the stairs, get confused-locked, and die on the spot. Without a way to deal with tarantellas, you may have to skip Spider for a long time.\n\n===God Choice===\nMummies have innate faith. While it makes sense to pick gods that benefit most from it, this isn't the only thing to consider.\n\nCertain gods do not benefit from faith, but are great at negating the weaknesses of being a mummy:\n*[[Ashenzari]] provides [[clarity]] (immunity to [[confusion]]) and boosts their normally poor skills. However, Ash doesn't provide any new options for dangerous situations, and does not benefit from faith.\n*[[Gozag]]'s Potion Petition is a cheap emergency option that makes up for the lack of potions, and is often stronger than potions. Shops let you get essential resistances (rF+, willpower...), while Bribe Branch can deal with troublesome floors in the lategame. Gozag only cares about gold, not about mummy's faith.\n*[[Ru]]'s Draw Out Power heals you while curing confusion / petrification. Both it and the passive Aura of Power are reusable tools that help make mummies stronger at general combat. Meanwhile, Apocalypse is as strong as ever. Faith increases the rate in which sacrifices are offered, but once you hit ****** piety, it is useless.\n\nOther gods do benefit from faith, and also synergize with mummies well:\n*[[Kikubaaqudgha]] provides the ability to [[Torment]], which (unlike live species) won't hurt a mummy. This god also provides a path into Necromancy, and faith helps you spam Unearth Wretches more often.\n*[[Okawaru]] is a good overall melee god. Heroism, Finesse, and gifts can make up for mummy's worse aptitudes, while Duel is a nice panic button.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Mummies gained their first Necromancy boost at level 3.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Mummies did not have innate [[Faith]].\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Mummies gained their Necromancy boosts at levels 13 and 26.\n*Mummies were the species least affected by the removal of the [[hunger]] system in [[0.26]]; for most of Crawl's history, they were notable as the one species that could truly ignore the food clock in its entirety. Also, Mummies had [[rotting]] immunity.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], [[Fedhas Madash]] did not allow Mummy worshippers.\n*In [[0.20]], Mummies' [[Spellcasting]] aptitude was increased from -1 to +2.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Mummies gained an ability at level 13 called Self-restoration, allowing them to sacrifice one point of max MP permanently to restore their [[stat]]s and a bit of [[rot]]ted HP.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Mummies did not gain a stat every 5th level.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], Mummies gained 3 MR every level instead of 5.\n\n[[Category:Mummy]]\n{{species}}"}

The freezing clouds add even more cold damage. The clouds can also help you escape, as enemies tend to avoid stepping on them. The noise may be an issue, but most characters who want to use Frostbite can handle being noisy. \n\nLike other axes without [[flaming]], use against [[hydra]]s is not recommended. Works great against other [[cold-blooded]] creatures, though.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Frostbite did not grant immunity to freezing clouds.\n*Frostbite was added in [[0.18]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Axes]]"}

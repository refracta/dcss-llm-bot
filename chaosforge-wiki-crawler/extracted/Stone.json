While unimpressive, they let early characters deal some extra damage at a distance. Stones get half the damage bonus from [[Throwing]] skill that other weapons do.\n\nStones are always [[mulch]]ed (destroyed) after being thrown. \n\n==Strategy==\nStones are useful for a couple of reasons:\n* If you can't attack from range, you might as well throw a stone. Stones let you deal some extra damage against [[adder]]s and other melee enemies.\n* Stones create a soft [[noise]] where they land. If you throw a stone at the edge of [[line of sight]], you can quietly attract enemies that were just out of sight.\n** This can be used to split up packs. Many monsters will [[shout]] after hearing a noise, waking up the whole pack. However, when a monster shouts, the [[noise]] is projected on ''their'' tile, not yours. Because some monsters only hear that shout, they won't know your actual location. Some monsters will wander towards the shout (then a random direction), others towards the direction of the stone. Therefore, some monsters will be split from the pack. This doesn't work on [[:Category:Herd flag|herd]] animals like [[yak]]s.\n* If you hit an enemy, it will always notice you. If you want a monster to notice you, it's better to throw a stone than to wait around or shout yourself.\n* Even stones can deal very respectable damage in the early game if you happen to find some slaying bonuses.\n\nYou can largely disregard stones the moment you find a better ranged option.\n\nNote that stones used by monsters will use the monster's base damage. For example, an [[orc warlord]] will deal up to 29 damage with a stone.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

They were more common, and only [[mulch]]ed 12.5% of the time.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], Sandblast did not require stones to function.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], stones were particularly useful as an anti-[[jelly]] weapon, as jellies would eat most other projectiles and heal by doing so.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], [[mulch]]ing a [[large rock]] would create a stack of stones.  \n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Slings]][[Category:Throwing]]"}

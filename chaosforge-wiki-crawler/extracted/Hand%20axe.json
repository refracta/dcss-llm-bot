It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''hand axe''' is a decent starting weapon. It is weaker than a [[mace]] or [[spear]] against single targets. But, like all axes, it allows the player to [[cleave]].\n\n==Strategy==\nAxes in general deal less damage than comparable options, but allow the user to cleave (hit multiple enemies). As a \"simple\" starting weapon, hand axes are good if you don't care about single-target performance. For example, [[minotaur]]s have the power to plow through the earlygame, whether they use a hand axe or a mace.\n\nHand axes are the only axe with a [[minimum delay]] of 6 aut. Hand axes, in theory, are interesting with \"flat\" damage brands, like [[pain brand|pain]], [[electrocution]], or [[distortion]]. However, past the early game, you'll be losing too much damage compared to a [[broad axe]] of the same brand.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Hand axe1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Hand axe2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Hand axe3.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], hand axes could be thrown at enemies.

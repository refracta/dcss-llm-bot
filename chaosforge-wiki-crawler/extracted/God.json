The game's pantheon features 26 distinct deities; each provides increasingly powerful abilities to their worshipers, but punishes followers for any violation of their individual commandments. Your character may only worship a single god at a time, and most gods punish followers for abandoning them, so choose wisely.\n\n==The pantheon==\n* '''[[Ashenzari]] the Shackled''', god of divinations and [[curse]]s.\n* '''[[Beogh]] the Brigand''', evil god of [[list of orcs|the orcs]].\n* '''[[Cheibriados]] the Contemplative''', the slow god.\n* '''[[Dithmenos]] the Shadowed''', evil god of darkness.\n* '''[[Elyvilon]] the Healer''', good god of healing.\n* '''[[Fedhas Madash]]''', god of [[plant]]s.\n* '''[[Gozag Ym Sagoz]] the Greedy''', god of [[gold]] and mercantilism.\n* '''[[Hepliaklqana]] the Forgotten''', god of ancestry and memory.\n* '''[[Ignis]] the Dying Flame''', fading god of guttering flames.\n* '''[[Jiyva]] the Shapeless''', chaotic god of [[list of jellies|slimes]].\n* '''[[Kikubaaqudgha]]''', evil demon-god of [[necromancy]].\n* '''[[Lugonu]] the Unformed''', chaotic evil god of [[the Abyss]].\n* '''[[Makhleb]] the Destroyer''', chaotic evil god of slaughter and bloodshed.\n* '''[[Nemelex Xobeh]]''', god of [[cards]].\n* '''[[Okawaru]] the Warmaster''', god of battle and single combat.\n* '''[[Qazlal Stormbringer]]''', god of storms.\n* '''[[Ru]] the Awakened''', god of sacrifice and inner power.\n* '''[[Sif Muna]] the Loreminder''', god of [[magic]] and mystical secrets.\n* '''[[Trog]] the Wrathful''', god of [[berserk|violent rage]].\n* '''[[Uskayaw]] the Reveler''', god of dancing and revelry.\n* '''[[Vehumet]]''', god of [[Conjurations|destructive magic]].\n* '''The [[Wu Jian|Wu Jian Council]]''', a council of formerly mortal martial artists.\n* '''[[Xom]] the Unpredictable''', chaotic god of [[chaos]].\n* '''[[Yredelemnul]] the Dark''', evil god of death and [[undead|undeath]].\n* '''[[Zin]] the Law-Giver''', good god of law and purity.\n* '''[[The Shining One]]''', good god of honourable crusades against evil.\n\n==Joining a god==\nYou may become a follower of a god in a number of ways. You can begin with one of the religious [[background]]s:\n* [[Berserker]], worshipping Trog\n* [[Chaos Knight]], worshipping Xom\n* [[Cinder Acolyte]], worshipping Ignis\n\nOtherwise, you may pray with '<' or '>' at a god's [[altar]], where you will be shown a description of the god, their powers, and their commandments as well as given the option to convert to their religion. You can also bring up a description of every god in the game by using the key commands ''''?/G''''. A [[faded altar]] will convert you to a random god (from a pool of 3), and gives you a [[piety]] bonus. \n\nConscious [[orc priest]]s, [[orc high priest]]s, and [[Saint Roka]] all offer [[Hill Orc]]s the opportunity to convert to [[Beogh]] so long as they are within [[line of sight]]. This conversion can be done by using the special ''''a''''bility ''Convert to Beogh''. All orcs within sight of the player will become neutral the first time the player uses this ability in a game.\n\n[[Monk]]s do not start worshipping a god, but their pious lifestyle prior to entering the Dungeon will gain them additional favor; the first time they begin worshipping a god, they gain a significant amount of bonus [[piety]].\n\nSome species have religious restrictions on which gods they may worship:\n* [[Demigod]]s may not worship any god.\n* Only [[Hill Orc]]s may worship Beogh.\n* [[Demon]]ic or [[undead]] species ([[Demonspawn]], [[Ghoul]]s, [[Mummy|Mummies]], and [[Vampire]]s) may not worship good-aligned gods (Zin, Elyvilon, and the Shining One).\n* [[Djinn]] may not worship the spell-granting [[Sif Muna]], [[Vehumet]], or [[Kikubaaqudgha]].\n\n==Changing or renouncing gods==\nYou can abandon your god for another by praying at your new god's altar, or by renouncing your faith with the \"Renounce Religion\" ability. The latter can be done at any time as a special ability (command '''aX'''). In addition, most gods will excommunicate you if your [[piety]] ever reaches 0, and the good gods will excommunicate you for casting the spell [[Necromutation]].\n\nAbandoning a god (or being excommunicated) will always incur [[penance]] and usually results in [[divine retribution]], with a few exceptions. \n*Ru never inflicts divine retribution for abandoment, but any sacrifices that the player makes to it are permanent.\n*Leaving a [[good god]] (Elyvilon, Zin, or The Shining One) incurs penance, but they won't exhibit wrath upon you until you worship a disliked god. All 3 good gods dislike evil gods (Beogh, Yredelemnul, Lugonu, Kikubaaqudgha, Makhleb, or Dithmenos). Zin will also punish you for joining Jiyva or Xom, who are chaotic gods. This won't be forgotten over time;  even if you join an evil god 100,000 turns later, wrath is still incurred.\n:Switching between good gods will even carry over half of your piety from one god to the other. Switching back to the first god will not restore piety; the number is simply halved again.\n\n==Altars==\n[[Altar]]s for most gods (all gods except [[Lugonu]], [[Jiyva]], [[Beogh]], and [[Ignis]]) are likely to appear in the [[Ecumenical Temple]], which holds anywhere from 0 to 21 altars. Any altars of \"temple gods\" not found in the Temple are guaranteed to appear in the main [[Dungeon]] between level 2 and level 10. Additional altars may be found in various other locations deeper into the Dungeon and its sub-branches.\n\n[[Lugonu]]'s altars may be found in [[the Abyss]] or in rare corrupted versions of the Ecumenical Temple. [[Jiyva]]'s altars may found at the entrance to or inside [[the Slime Pits]], in rare corrupted versions of the Temple, and occasionally in the [[Sewer]]. Altars to [[Beogh]] can appear in the [[Orcish Mines]], or more rarely in the main dungeon, most commonly near the entrance to the [[Orcish Mines]]. [[Ignis]] altars are only found in rare versions of the temple; most characters won't ever find an altar.\n\nSome [[transporter]] vaults are themed around various gods; in particular altars to [[Lugonu]] and [[Jiyva]] may both be found in this way.\n\nPlayers may also find one or more [[faded altar]]s in the early Dungeon. Praying at a faded altar allows the player to convert to a randomly selected god with additional [[piety]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Choosing a god]]\n* [[Piety]]\n* [[Divine retribution]]\n* [[God comparison]]\n* [[Pray]]er\n\n==History==\n* [[Ignis]], the Dying Flame, joined the pantheon in [[0.28]].\n* Prior to [[0.27]], Gargoyles were unable to worship [[Yredelemnul]].\n* Prior to [[0.24]], the undead could not worship [[Fedhas]].\n* Prior to [[0.23]], [[Dithmenos]] was not evil.\n* The [[Wu Jian|Wu Jian Council]] was added in [[0.21]].\n* In 0.19, [[Uskayaw]] the Reveler and [[Hepliaklqana]] the Forgotten joined the pantheon, and Pakellas was removed.\n* [[Pakellas]] the Inventive, the engineer god of magical devices, joined the pantheon in [[0.18]]. \n* [[Faded altar]]s were introduced in [[0.17]].\n*[[Gozag Ym Sagoz]] the Greedy and [[Ru]] the Awakened were added in [[0.16]].\n*[[Qazlal Stormbringer]] was added in [[0.15]].\n*[[Dithmenos]] was introduced in [[0.14]].\n* Prior to version [[0.9]], one did not incur penance by switching from one good god to another. This was removed, since it allowed for Zin worshipers to safely switch to Jiyva by momentarily switching to TSO or Elyvilon.  Switching between good gods is still safe, since no wrath will be exhibited, but if you leave for an evil god you will be facing the wrath of both (or all) of your former gods.\n*In [[0.8]] instant divine retribution was removed. You could also find altars in the main Dungeon at level 1.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], altars were not always guaranteed to appear in the Ecumenical Temple or between Dungeon levels 2-9.\n\n{{gods}}\n\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

Maces & Flails skill will help improve your basic effectiveness with the weapon.\n----\n“He that spares his rod hates his son: but he that loves him chastens him early.”<br>\n-King James 2000 Bible, Proverbs 13:24\n}}\nA '''rod of striking''' is an unusual melee-themed [[rod]] which is activated simply by striking the enemy with it. This deals the normal damage for attacking with a rod (identical to attacking with a [[club]], including the rod's enchantment level), then deals an additional 1d(1.5×[[Evocations]]). The target's [[AC]] is applied to each of these separately. Each such attack costs 1 [[MP]], and it will not inflict the additional damage when its MP is at 0. Like all rods, it uses its own MP for powering its effect, and recharges automatically at a rate based on its enchantment and your [[Evocations]] skill.\n\n==History==\nThe Rod of Striking was retired in [[0.16]].\n\nPrior to [[0.13]], the rod of striking could be evoked for the [[Striking]] spell, firing weak blasts of non-elemental damage. It was generally considered useless once the player got past the early game.\n\nPrior to [[0.10]], this rod could be chosen as starting equipment for [[artificer]]s, but was much weaker (dealing only up to 1d8 damage, the same as magic dart).\n\nPrior to [[0.9]], this rod was useful for training your Evocation skill early on without having to waste wand charges and [[scrolls of recharging]], or significant amounts of food. With the death of the [[victory dance]], the rod became almost entirely useless."}

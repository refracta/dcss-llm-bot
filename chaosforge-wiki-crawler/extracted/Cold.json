{"title":"Cold","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cold","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Cold''' is one of the most common elemental forces you will encounter as you explore the [[Dungeon]], consisting of ice-themed and otherwise cool attacks.\n\n==Cold Damage==\nCharacters have many ways to gain cold damage. [[Ice Magic]] is the most evident, but just about any character can use [[freezing]]-branded weapons or a [[wand of iceblast]]. \n\nCold damage is reduced by cold resistance (rC+). [[Cold-blooded]] creatures, including player [[Draconian]]s, are [[slow]]ed by a few specific cold attacks: weapons of [[freezing]], [[Freeze]], [[Frozen Ramparts]], [[freezing vapour]]s, [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]]. Having rC+ negates being cold-blooded.\n\n==Cold Resistance==\nThe cold resistance intrinsic significantly reduces the cold damage you take when attacked:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

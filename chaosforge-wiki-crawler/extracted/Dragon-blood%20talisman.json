Transforms the user into a mighty fire-breathing dragon. The user becomes highly resistant to fire and resistant to poison, but vulnerable to cold. Shapeshifting skill increases damage from claws and armour from scales.

The user retains their innate colour, and becomes resistant to poison.}}\n\n[[File:dragon-blood talisman.png]] A '''dragon-blood talisman''' is a [[talisman]] that changes you into '''Dragon Form'''.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen e'''V'''oked, a dragon-blood talisman turns you into Dragon Form, which lasts until you end the form. Entering or exiting a form takes 5 turns.\n\nDragon Form has the following effects:\n\n'''Combat Bonuses'''\n*'''HP Bonus:''' 150% HP\n*'''Innate AC:''' Linearly scales from the following points, rounding down:\n**Below minimum: 1 AC (0 skill) - 12 AC (16 skill)\n**Above minimum: 12 AC (16 skill) - 18 AC (25 skill) ; +1 AC per 1.33 levels\n*'''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' Linearly scales from the following points (including bonus from [[Claws]]):\n**Below minimum: 9 damage (0 skill) - 24 damage (16 skill)\n**Above minimum: 24 damage (16 skill) - 33 damage (25 skill) ; +1 damage per level\n*Two '''[[auxiliary attacks]]''': Bite 5 (11 dmg) & Tail slap 3 (6 dmg).\n*'''[[Breathe Fire]]:''' Active ability. Launch a piercing, range-5 bolt of fire, creating a [[flame cloud]] where it lands. No cost, but has a [[Breath|cooldown]] of a few turns. Damage = <code>3d(4 + 2*[[XL]]/3)</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|ability.cc|742}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|zap-data.h|999}}</ref>\n*'''Stat Bonus:''' +10 [[strength]].\n\n'''Resistances'''\n*[[Fire resistance|rf++]]\n*[[Cold resistance|rC-]]\n*[[Poison resistance|rPois]]\n*Innate [[flight]].\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n*'''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' All [[armour]], [[weapon]] and [[shield]]. (Can only wear [[jewellery]])\n*You cannot [[throw]] items.\n\n'''Other'''\n*Dragon Form is '''[[Size#Giant|Giant]]'''-sized. This gives a penalty to [[EV]], but you are resistant to [[trample|trampling]], [[constriction]], and [[net]]s.\n*Suppresses many [[mutation]]s. Species [[movement speed]] set to 10.\n\nDragon Form has a minimum [[Shapeshifting]] skill of 16, below which you get an [[Talisman#Skill|HP penalty]], and the AC / Unarmed bonuses scale down. It has a maximum skill of 25, where skill has no further impact.\n\n===Draconians===\nIf you are a [[Draconian]], Dragon Form has the following modifiers:\n*The AC bonus from scales is retained, but Dragon Form itself grants 6 less AC.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|transform.cc|793}}</ref>\n*You retain your natural [[draconian breath weapon|breath weapon]], or lack therof, instead of Breathe Fire. Additionally, your breath weapon is boosted in power.\n*Instead of gaining rF++ and rC-, you retain your natural elemental resistances, or lack thereof. Red and white draconians gain rF++/rC- and rF-/rC++, respectively. You still get rPois, no matter the colour.\n\n==Strategy==\nDragon Form should be treated like the 'glass cannon' of talisman forms, much less durable than the +50% HP would make you think. The reduction to [[EV]] from size, lack of [[shield]], loss of all [[armour]] slots, and relatively low [[AC]] (compared to [[Statue Form]] or a heavy armour character) seriously lowers your survivability. That being said: with 24 base damage, plus aux attacks, added strength, and bonuses from [[Unarmed Combat]] skill, you'll hit like a truck. It's strong even without much UC skill.\n\nAlthough Dragon Form melds [[staves]] and [[int]]-raising gear, you can use magic however you please. Since you won't have armour or shield [[encumbrance]], it might be even easier to cast spells.\n\nCompared to other forms:\n*[[Statue Form]]: Statue Form offers better defense: it has much better AC, does not reduce EV, and allows use of [[shield]]s. Dragon Form, meanwhile, offers much better damage/turn. Note that, due to the rC- and restricted slots, being in Dragon Form makes it hard to get resistances. \n*[[Storm Form]]: In general, Storm Form offers similar damage/turn and effective defense, but with the addition of [[cleaving]]. Dragon Form takes less skill, though. Being a dragon is usually enough to handle [[orbs of fire]], and if you can do that, you can win a 3-rune game. Thus, Dragon Form allows you to invest XP into other skills (without lacking in power).\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Support magic, like [[Ozocubu's Armour]] or [[Vhi's Electric Charge]], can be very useful to have. Since you're using Unarmed Combat, [[Manifold Assault]] only hits 1/2 targets, but it can still be worth using.\n*Don't forget about the fire breath, a free, moderately powerful ranged attack. It creates a [[flame cloud]] on landing; aim with '''f .''' to place the cloud on a specific enemy. Using flame breath at melee range means your enemy will be stuck inside the cloud for a while.\n*If you can manage to get Dragon Form by the [[Lair]] rune branches, the ability to fly and poison resistance are helpful there. Just watch out for [[silver]] [[javelin]]s in [[Shoals]] (and cold attacks, like [[bog body]]'s [[Bolt of Cold]] and [[merfolk aquamancer]]'s [[Throw Icicle]], if vulnerable).\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

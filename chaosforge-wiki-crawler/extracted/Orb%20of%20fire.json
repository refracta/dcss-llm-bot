{"title":"Orb of fire","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Orb_of_fire","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Orbs of fire''' (or '''OOFs''') are fast, powerful, extremely durable horrors with access to brutal [[Fire Magic]] and the ability to inflict [[bad mutations]]. These end-game monsters have traumatized many adventurers who died just before reaching the [[Orb of Zot]]. They can occasionally be found throughout [[the Realm of Zot]] or in certain [[Ziggurat]] floors, and are always found in the Orb chamber of [[Zot:5]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Strategy==\nOrbs of fire are one of the toughest enemies you'll encounter in a 3-rune game. The usual maxims of ''Crawl'' apply even more than usual:\n*Buff up! Battling one with [[haste]], [[might]], and/or [[brilliance]] will significantly reduce the amount of time it has to roast and mutate you. A [[potion of resistance]] directly reduces the damage you'll take.\n*Have ''some'' level of [[fire resistance]]. Having rF+++ reduces fire damage by 80%, making it much easier to survive their onslaught. Characters with sufficiently strong offensive abilities can get away with rF+, but be prepared to face their incredibly high damage output.\n*Avoid fighting more than one at a time. One orb is dangerous on its own; two orbs are (for most characters) a serious cause for concern. Since OOFs are so durable, you're unlikely to kill even one before taking serious damage. Try not to stay in open areas for too long. \n**Being near an OOF and [[Killer Klown]] at the same time is even worse; the latter can [[silence]] you, making it very difficult to escape from the orb. Moreover, it can turn you into a [[bad form]], making the orb nearly impossible to fight.\n*Orbs of fire are fast, so it's difficult to escape from one. If an orb is at the edge of [[LOS]], you can [[haste]] up and run away. [[Scrolls of blinking]] (when combined with haste) are as useful as ever.\n\n===Killing Methods===\nOrbs of fire are very durable enemies that are immune to [[fire]], [[electricity]], [[poison]], and [[negative energy]], and partially resistant to [[cold]]. The following can work well against orbs of fire (but aren't the only ways to deal with them):\n*'''Weapons:''' By the time you reach Zot:5, characters dedicated to melee combat or [[Ranged Weapons]] will often have the stats to win the fight, at least with buffs and multiple sources of rF+. You don't need a perfect brand - a +9 weapon of [[flaming]] is perfectly fine to use.\n*'''Throwing:''' They are weak to [[silver]], so a skilled thrower will find silver [[javelin]]s brutally effective. Killing them with 2 or 3 shots isn't uncommon.\n*'''Irresistible Attack Spells:''' Spells like [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]], [[Bombard]], [[Orb of Destruction]], and [[Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling]] ignore all resistances, making them effective magical options. A [[spellforged servitor]] can fire the former two (while blocking malmutate attempts in the process).\n*'''Summoning:''' [[Malign Gateway]]'s tentacles are immune to fire, so they'll have no trouble in a 1v1 fight. Spellforged Servitor, as mentioned above, can also function well.\n**[[Kiku]] worshippers can summon masses of [[spectral thing]]s and [[simulacrum]]/[[Infestation|death scarab]]s with Unearth Wretches.\n**Most [[Makhleb]] summons won't last long against an orb of fire, but [[balrug]]s are immune to fire, so are great to have against OOFs.\n*'''Level 9 Spells:''' [[Fire Storm]] is a perfectly valid option. While orbs are immune to fire, Fire Storm deals 50% physical damage. The same applies to the likes of [[Chain Lightning]], [[Polar Vortex]], and [[Dragon's Call]]. However, [[Shatter]] performs quite poorly against flying creatures.\n*'''Antimagic:''' While [[antimagic]] won't kill directly, it greatly reduces the amount of spells an orb of fire will cast. ''Good'' weapons of antimagic (a short sword is not a good weapon), a [[Vine Stalker]]'s bite, and [[Enfeeble]] are effective at disabling an OOF. Even [[Summon Mana Viper]] can work, if the viper doesn't die trying to approach.\n\n'''Reminder: these are not the only ways to kill orbs of fire!''' This is just a list of common archetypes that work; you may find other things useful. Also, you don't have to kill everything in Crawl. Sneaking up and stealing the Orb can be a valid option, depending on the character.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*[[Silence]] is worthless against orbs of fire.\n*Orbs of fire can fire bolts through other orbs of fire. However, orbs will generally avoid harming their (non-fire-immune) allies. E.g. standing next to an [[orb guardian]] will usually prevent you from being hit from Fireball.\n*[[Freezing Cloud]] can be used to block bolts of fire (but not [[Fireball]]), reducing the orb's ability to injure you.\n*The glowing colors the orb cycles through in console mode indicate merely that it has cast a spell; it bears no relation to the type of spell cast or about to be cast.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], they were [[:Category:Water_vulnerability|vulnerable to water]].\n*In very ancient, pre-''Stone Soup'' versions of Crawl, these monsters were instead called \"Swords\", [http://git.develz.org/?p=crawl.git;a=blob;f=crawl-ref/docs/obsolete/changes.340;h=e5a83c8a424315c601165caccb2dc744e9322d31;hb=315c7ef50eea9a7d45bc844f173e2b7b3191cbc3#l46 as can be seen in this ancient changelog], in a reference to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicles_of_an_Age_of_Darkness Chronicles of an Age of Darkness] by Hugh Cook. This explains the rather nonsensical (from a thematic standpoint) inclusion of Malmutate in their spell set, since they were originally very different monsters."}

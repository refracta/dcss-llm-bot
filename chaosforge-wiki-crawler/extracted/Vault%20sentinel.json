{"title":"Vault sentinel","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Vault_sentinel","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Vault sentinels''' are one of the weaker human guards in [[the Vaults]]. Although not very dangerous alone, they often generate with [[crossbow]]s, and their special abilities allow them to awaken nearby enemy units or inform all conscious monsters on the current floor of your whereabouts.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Vault sentinels are too durable for most characters to one-shot at a distance, unfortunately, so expect to have to deal with their abilities. Most of the time, the reinforcements that arrive are less dangerous than those teleported in by [[ironbound convoker]]s, usually amounting to one or two more bands of enemies arriving before the mark wears off. If you find yourself marked and near some [[stairs]] to the floor above you, feel free to wait out the effect up there. Just don't be surprised if you need to stairdance a little when you decide to go back down.\n**If marked on Vaults:5, go back upstairs immediately. This floor can become incredibly deadly if a sentinel tags you.\n*Most debilitating effects work very well against vault sentinels. Their low [[hit dice]] and [[willpower]] makes it easy to hit them with [[Mephitic Cloud]] or [[Ensorcelled Hibernation]], and you can't go wrong with [[Silence]].\n\n==History==\nVault sentinels were added to the game in [[0.12]].\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

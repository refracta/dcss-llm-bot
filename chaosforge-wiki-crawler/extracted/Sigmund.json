{"title":"Sigmund","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sigmund","type":"raw","data":"{{version|029}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Sigmund the Dreaded''' is a deadly [[unique]] [[human]], and one of the earliest uniques you can encounter. He is always generated with a powerful [[scythe]], a [[robe]], and several brutal spells. Sigmund is notorious for being one of the [http://crawl.akrasiac.org/scoring/killers.html deadliest] uniques in all of ''DCSS''.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:2-6\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Despite a base damage of 1, Sigmund's damage output in melee is devastating for low-level characters. But an even bigger threat is in his spell list. An invisible Sigmund is almost unbeatable in early-game melee, his Throw Flame lets him brutalize you at range, and expect a swift end if he confuses you and you're out of [[potions of curing]].\n*Avoiding Sigmund is usually the wisest thing you can do. If you find him sleeping early on, just walk away and return once you've gained a few levels and found some better gear.\n*There are some options for low-level characters who want to take him out immediately. [[Mephitic Cloud]] leaves him unable to use magic and almost hopeless in melee, while a few zaps from a good wand will annihilate him. \n**A [[wand of polymorph]] may also turn him into a less deadly form and will probably make him drop his scythe, but it's less of a safe bet; Sigmund the [[centaur (monster)|centaur]] is ''much'' deadlier than normal.\n*If all else fails and you have no choice but to engage him early, don't be afraid to use any useful potions you've identified. [[Berserk]], [[haste]], or [[might]] go a long way toward helping you take him down, and a [[potion of heal wounds]] can keep you in the fight longer than you'd otherwise last. Don't be afraid to use potions you haven't identified, too.\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Donald]] may say to the player \"That guy with the scythe is really mean\", which is a reference to Sigmund.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], Sigmund was nerfed further; 30 -> 27 base HP, and 2 -> 1 base damage. [[Scythe]]s were also reduced by 1 base damage.\n*In [[0.28]], Sigmund was given explicitly slow attack speed (As, prior to 0.27, any monster with a scythe attacked slowly).\n*In [[0.27]], Sigmund was weakened from 5 to 2 damage, due to the removal of monster weapon penalties.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

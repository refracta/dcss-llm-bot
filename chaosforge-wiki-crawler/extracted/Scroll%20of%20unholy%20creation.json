{"title":"Scroll of unholy creation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Scroll_of_unholy_creation","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{item\n |itemtype=Scroll\n |name=Scroll of unholy creation\n |appearance=different\n |cost=95\n |weight=2.0\n}}\n{{flavour|This scroll draws unformed lumps of flesh from the Abyss to create a terrible beast.}}\n\nReading a '''scroll of unholy creation''' will create a friendly, permanent [[small abomination]] to do your bidding. Unlike [[derived undead]], they can heal over time and will follow you up and down [[stairs]].\n\nIf you're worshipping a [[good god]], the abomination will be hostile. The good gods also forbid its intentional use.\n\n==Strategy==\nThese monsters can be useful allies in the early game, providing additional damage output and being able to survive for a few floors if handled with care. In the mid- and late-game, however, they are too fragile to be of much use. \n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*If you're worshipping a good god, the hostile abomination can be extremely dangerous in the early-game.\n**[[Zin]] - Reciting should destroy them with a few attempts. Reciting next to a small abomination is very dangerous early on, however, so try to get some distance between you and the abomination first. \n**[[The Shining One]] - If you have it, Cleansing Flame works just as well.\n*While monsters normally disregard scrolls, intelligent ones will use scrolls of unholy creation if they find them. Bear in mind this does provide a little bit of extra XP and possibly piety if you don't think you'll have a use for them yourself.\n\n==History==\n*Scrolls of unholy creation were removed in [[0.12]].\n*Prior to [[0.11]], these were known as '''[[scrolls of summoning]]''', but functioned identically. The item which now goes by that name functions very differently."}

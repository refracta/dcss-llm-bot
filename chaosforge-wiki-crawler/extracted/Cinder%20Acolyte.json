They start with a robe, a choice of flaming weapons, and the spell Scorch.}}\n'''Cinder Acolytes''' are warrior-mages who worship [[Ignis]],  a god who will eventually burn out.\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Hill Orc]], [[Gnoll]], [[Draconian]], [[Djinni]], and [[Oni]] are the recommended species if you pick a Cinder Acolyte Background.\n\n==Racial Restrictions==\n[[Demigod]]s cannot be Cinder Acolytes, as they cannot worship Ignis (or any other god).\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*-1 [[Flaming]] [[weapon of choice]] ([[unarmed combat|unarmed]], [[hand axe]], [[spear]], [[short sword]], [[falchion]], or [[mace]])\n*+0 [[Robe]]\n\n'''Available Spells:'''\n*[[Scorch]]\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Fighting]]: 3\n*Chosen Weapon's Skill: 3\n*[[Spellcasting]]: 1\n*[[Fire Magic]]: 3\n\nChoosing Cinder Acolyte adds 6 to your starting [[Strength]] and [[Intelligence]].\n\nCinder Acolytes start with 150 [[piety]] with [[Ignis]].\n\n==Strategy==\nCinder Acolytes revolve around Ignis, who grants immediate, but limited, divine favor. Ignis provides abilities that are very strong in the early game; those should be enough to bail you out of most any situation before and even during [[Lair]]. But using them will eventually burn your god out. Even if you don't, Ignis' abilities won't scale as you progress. Deciding when to switch gods, if at all, is very important for a prospective Cinder Acolyte.\n\nWise and liberal use of Ignis' powers will prove to be fruitful. No longer do out-of-depth [[ogre]]s scare you; they'll be blasted by a Foxfire Swarm. Slightly less tough enemies can be dealt with the cheaper Fiery Armour. And Rising Flame is one of the best panic tools in the game, able to escape most any situation in 2-4 turns -- but only once. \n\nCinder Acolytes begin the game with both a flaming weapon and Scorch. The former, while somewhat inaccurate, will deal serviceable damage in melee. The latter will always hit and deals respectable damage even without training any more Fire Magic. Scorch also makes the target vulnerable to fire, so even melee-oriented characters will find some use. However, don't train too much magic ''just'' for Scorch, wait until you get other spells.\n\n==History==\n*Cinder Acolytes were unchanged in [[0.29]], where most other backgrounds got buffed.\n*Cinder Acolytes were introduced in [[0.28]].\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

{"title":"Shuffle","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shuffle","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\nWhen affected by a '''Shuffle''', your character's [[stat]]s ([[strength]], [[dexterity]], and [[intelligence]]) will be permanently and irreversibly rearranged. When carefully and intentionally performed, this can allow for dramatic changes in your playstyle; when done accidentally, it can ruin your character. As such, they are extremely rare and easy to avoid if you don't want to take the chance:\n*You can find [[Shuffle card]]s in ornate or legendary [[decks of wonders]] and [[decks of changes]]. Drawing one immediately rearranges your stats to a random new configuration. This is a very good reason to avoid haphazardly drawing random cards from unidentified decks.\n*[[Jiyva]] will occasionally hit you with Shuffles, but these will be weighted to benefit you based on your current [[skills]], [[inventory]] weight, and the evasion penalty of your worn [[armour]]."}

If the wielder is skilled in Evocations and Conjurations, they can blast those they strike with pure energy, dealing irresistible damage.}}\n\nA '''staff of conjuration''' is a [[magical staff]]. It gives a [[spell enhancer]] to [[Conjurations]], but gives no resistance.\n\nThe staff can also be used in combat, functioning as a +0 [[staff]] that deals additional, untyped damage:\n\n{{crawlquote|'''Damage''': A random amount ranging from 0 to 1.25×(Evocations/2 + Conjurations)<br>'''Chance to Activate on a Hit''': (Evocations + Conjurations/2)×6.66% per hit}}\n\nIn addition, the [[Staves]] and [[Fighting]] skills will increase the damage done by the staff itself.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], staves of conjuration didn't have magical melee effects.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], the chance of a staff of conjuration auto-identifying when wielded depended on the Conjurations skill of the wielder."}

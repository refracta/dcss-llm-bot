The atmosphere in its vicinity seems to shimmer with a dull, dusty haze. Regarded as a nuisance, these creatures were driven from the surface centuries ago due to their naturally inhibitive effect on magical items in their vicinity.\n----\n“Everybody knows there is no fineness or accuracy of suppression; if you hold down one thing, you hold down the adjoining.”<br>\n-Saul Bellow, _The Adventures of Augie March}}\n\n<!--monster-bot-end-->\n\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Moths of suppression''' are weak flying [[list of insects|insects]] with a unique disabling power. At all times, they emit a [[suppression]] [[aura]] that disables most of the effects of your magical weapons, armour, and items. Although they're fairly harmless on their own, their presence in a fight with more dangerous enemies can severely handicap you. They can be occasionally found in the [[Spider's Nest]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*When encountered in the Spider's Nest, realize that your magical sources of [[poison resistance]] will suddenly stop functioning. Consider quaffing a [[potion of resistance]] if you don't have the resistance naturally.\n\n==History==\nMoths of suppression were added in [[0.12]] and removed (along with suppression itself) in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

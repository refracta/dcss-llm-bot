The merfolk have made it their home, alongside many dreaded sea creatures.\n\nA dungeon features only one of the Shoals and Swamp branches.\n\nThis branch is very noisy, and so sound travels much less far.\n\nThe entrance to this branch can be found between levels 2 and 3 of the Lair of Beasts.\n\nThis branch is 4 levels deep.\n\nThis branch contains the barnacled rune of Zot.}}\n\n[[File:Shoals entry.png]] '''The Shoals''' branch is an archipelago of islands surrounded by deep waters, and home to many aquatic creatures and [[merfolk]]. Although dangerous, their lowest floor contains several treasure vaults and the barnacled [[rune of Zot]].\n\nThe Shoals entrance is located between [[Lair]]:2 and Lair:3. If you find the Shoals, you will not find [[the Swamp]] in your current game. \n\n==Useful Info==\nThe Shoals are 4 floors deep and set at sea, in a little archipelago of islands with beaches, tides, and monsters. Unless you're amphibious or [[fly]]ing, it will take some time to fully explore each floor.\n\nThe tides in the Shoals will shift between shallow water and land fairly quickly. It will never cause [[deep water]] to rise or fall, so all areas will remain accessible. Rarely, an island may generate out at sea - you may need to have [[flight]], or enter from a different staircase, to reach it.\n\nExploring [[deep water]] in the Shoals does not count towards for exploration [[piety]]. (It does count for [[Meteoran]] exploration, though.)\n\nThe Shoals provides more [[Throwing]] implements than the Swamp; many residents carry [[boomerang]]s and [[throwing net]]s, and [[merfolk javelineer]]s bring a few [[javelin]]s. \n\n===Shoals:4===\nThe last floor is significantly more difficult than the earlier three. Shoals:4 is often heavily populated with several uniques (the sea witch [[Ilsuiw]] often makes an appearance) and legions of merfolk. Expect to face elemental damage in the form of [[brand]]ed polearms, and make sure to have at least rC+ before engaging Ilsuiw, as she can deal tremendous amounts of damage with [[Throw Icicle]]. Proceed carefully, explore the various chambers cautiously, try not to engage too large a band of merfolk at once, and fight on staircases when possible so you can retreat if overwhelmed.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe Shoals is an open branch which features crowds of fast and/or ranged threats. Whether it's merfolk with [[reaching]] weapons, packs of [[satyr]]s and [[faun]]s shooting from a distance, or higher-tier threats like [[Merfolk javelineer|javelineers]] and [[merfolk|aquamancer]]s, it's easy to get swarmed by fast-swimming enemies. \n\nThere's also many monsters that mess with your positioning: [[wind drake]]s can blow you away, [[merfolk avatar]]s and [[merfolk siren|sirens]] can [[mesmerise]] you (forcing you closer if you don't resist with [[willpower]]), and [[water nymph]]s can prevent use of [[stairs]] with their watery aura. With these monsters nearby, the upstairs isn't always a safe bet. When you combine the 'lack of escape' with a swarm of merfolk, things can get hairy in no time.\n\nHaving [[willpower]] (to resist mesmerise / [[sleep]]) and [[flight]] (to move normally over water) is recommended. [[Repulsion]], if you have it, can be very helpful too.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Unless you're amphibious, flying, or larger than average, staying in water has severe penalties. You'll move slower, fumble melee attacks (but not ranged attacks / spells), and your [[stealth]] is reduced. \n**Note that [[Swiftness]] and [[invisible|invisibility]] won't work in water, ''even if you're amphibious''. Only flight lets you keep these effects.\n*You can take cover behind rock walls, but try not to do this unless you are certain that there aren't even worse things behind them.\n*It's easy to wake up entire hordes of merfolk if you aren't careful. [[Stealth]] pays off here, as does luring enemies to you instead of charging into combat.\n*Most of the enemies in this branch do not [[see invisible]], so invisibility can trivialize even the most difficult of encounters. Keep in mind that if you're in water and not flying, enemies will ignore your invisibility.\n\n==Monsters==\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{LightRed|m}} [[File:Merfolk (monster).png]] '''[[Merfolk (monster)|Merfolk]]''' || {{monsterlink|Merfolk javelineer}} || {{monsterlink|Merfolk impaler}} || {{monsterlink|Merfolk aquamancer}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Siren}} || {{monsterlink|Merfolk avatar}} || {{monsterlink|Water nymph}} || {{monsterlink|Water elemental}}\n|-\n| {{Brown|c}} [[File:Centaur (monster).png]] '''[[Centaur (monster)|Centaur]]''' ||  {{monsterlink|Faun}} || {{monsterlink|Satyr}} || {{monsterlink|Cyclops}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Dream sheep}} || {{monsterlink|Death yak}} || {{monsterlink|Catoblepas}} ||  {{monsterlink|Manticore}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Harpy}} || {{monsterlink|Wind drake}} || {{monsterlink|Snapping turtle}} || {{monsterlink|Alligator snapping turtle}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Sea snake}} || {{monsterlink|Oklob plant}} || {{monsterlink|Kraken}} || {{monsterlink|Frost giant}}\n|}\n\n===Uniques===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Aizul}}\n| {{monsterlink|Bai Suzhen}}\n| {{monsterlink|Donald}}\n| {{monsterlink|Frances}}\n| {{monsterlink|Ilsuiw}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Jorgrun}}\n| {{monsterlink|Josephine}}\n| {{monsterlink|Kirke}}\n| {{monsterlink|Louise}}\n| {{monsterlink|Mara}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Nikola}}\n| {{monsterlink|Polyphemus}}\n| {{monsterlink|Roxanne}}\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Shoals were 5 levels deep.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], the tides of the Shoals could create and destroy deep water tiles.

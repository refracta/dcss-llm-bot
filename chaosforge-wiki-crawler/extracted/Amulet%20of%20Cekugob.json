It provides two levels of negative energy resistance, and thus can quickly render you drain-resistant if you find yourself looking down a [[shadow dragon]]'s maw, and [[electricity]] resistance is fantastic when facing [[Nikola]], [[storm dragon]]s, or an [[electric golem]]. Don't leave it on, though; the -TELE can sometimes cost you your life.\n\n==History==\nThis amulet, along with its base type [[amulet of dismissal]], was retired in [[0.19]]\n\nPrior to [[0.18]], the amulet of Cekugob used an [[amulet of warding]] as its base type.\n\nPrior to [[0.16]], this amulet sped up metabolism.\n\nOne of the oldest artefacts, it also used to provide rF+ and rC+. Sadly, that made it somewhat game-breaking, so these were removed in the pre-''DCSS'' days.\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Amulets]]"}

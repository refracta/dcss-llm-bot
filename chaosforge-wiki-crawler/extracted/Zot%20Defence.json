{"title":"Zot Defence","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Zot_Defence","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n'''Zot Defence''' is a tower-defense-styled variation on [[Dungeon Crawl]]. After selecting one of the five available scenarios and character to play as, you are placed on a map and tasked with defending the [[Orb of Zot]] from all threats. Monsters will be generated in waves, swarming in from the upstairs. You must prevent the monsters from reaching the [[Orb of Zot]], which you may not pick up or apport.\n\nDuring each turn in which a hostile monster stands over the Orb, you suffer one point of [[rot]] damage. Each time you go up one [[experience]] level, you receive a new special \"Zot Ability\" which will aid you in protecting the Orb; the use of these abilities expends Zot Points, which are gained concurrently with experience.\n\nThe waves of monsters grow in strength over time; at the end of each wave, an out-of-depth \"boss\" monster is generated. Every few waves, a [[rune]] is generated on the stairs along with the boss monster. You may pick up the Orb, and leave the dungeon with it, if you are carrying fifteen runes.\n\n==Scenarios==\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:upper-roman\">\n  <li>Hall of Zot</li>\n  <li>Battle Heart</li>\n  <li>Two or Three?</li>\n  <li>Columnade</li>\n  <li>Glassed Sandwich</li>\n</ol>\n\n==Zot Abilities==\n{| {{table}}\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Ability'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Cost'''\n|-\n| Make [[Dart trap]]||5 ZP\n|-\n| Make [[Oklob sapling]]||60 ZP\n|-\n| Make [[Arrow trap]]||30 ZP\n|-\n| Make [[Plant]]||2 ZP\n|-\n| Remove curse||Stat drain\n|-\n| Make [[Burning bush]]||200 ZP\n|-\n| Make altar||50 ZP\n|-\n| Make grenades||2 ZP\n|-\n| Make [[Oklob plant]]||250 ZP\n|-\n| Make [[Net trap]]||2 ZP\n|-\n| Make [[Ice statue]]||2000 ZP\n|-\n| Make [[Spear trap]]||50 ZP\n|-\n| Make [[Alarm trap]]||2 ZP\n|-\n| Make mushroom circle||10 ZP\n|-\n| Make [[Bolt trap]]||300 ZP\n|-\n| Make crystal statue||2000 ZP\n|-\n| Make [[Needle trap]]||30 ZP\n|-\n| Zot-teleport||2 ZP\n|-\n| Make [[Water]]||10 ZP\n|-\n| Make [[Lightning spire]]||100 ZP\n|-\n| Make [[Silver statue]]||3000 ZP\n|-\n| \n|}\n\n==History==\nZot Defence was removed in [[0.16]], reportedly due to lack of development maintenance.\n\n==See also==\n[[Dungeon Sprint]] - Another Crawl variant coded by Chapayev.\n\n==External links==\n* https://sites.google.com/site/crawlvariations/\n* http://crawl.akrasiac.org/\n\n[[Category:Crawl]]\n[[Category:Crawl variants]]"}

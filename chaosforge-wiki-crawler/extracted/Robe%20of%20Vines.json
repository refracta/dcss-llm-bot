The vines form a symbiotic relationship with their wearer, greatly increasing their regeneration, but preventing them from being healed by potions.}}\n\n[[File:Robe of vines.png]] '''''the +2 robe of Vines'''''\n\n+2 [[robe]]\n\n[[Regeneration rate|Regen]]++++ (+3.2 HP/turn)<br>\nPrevents healing from [[potion]]s while worn (includes the regenerative effects of [[potions of ambrosia]])\n\n==Desirablility==\n'''The robe of Vines'''<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|art-data.txt|1453}}</ref> increases its wearer's [[regeneration rate]] by an amount equivalent to 4 [[amulet of regeneration|amulets of regeneration]], providing an incredible bonus of 3.2 [[HP]] per turn. Like other wearable sources of regeneration, it must attune to the wearer at full health before it can function, preventing it from being used to quickly restore HP after a fight.\n\nWhile the robe can provide survivability during battle, a robe with an [[ego]] like [[resistance (ego)|resistance]] or [[Archmagi]] may be better for general use depending on your character. Alternatively, a set of heavier armour and a solid array of resistances can reduce incoming damage enough to make your base regeneration rate perfectly adequate for survival.\n\n[[Inhibited Regeneration]] (inherent to [[Ghoul]]s and bloodless [[Vampire]]s) prevents this regeneration when monsters are in sight. Meanwhile, [[Vine Stalker]]s, [[mummy|Mummies]], and [[lichform]] characters cannot recover HP with potions anyways, and can wear this robe with no drawback. [[Djinn]] may particularly appreciate this robe, as it provides plenty of HP to fuel their spellcasting.\n\n==History==\n* Prior to [[0.28]], this robe provided Regen+++ (+3.0 HP/turn).\n* Prior to [[0.27]]'s buff to regeneration items, this robe provided Regen+++++++ (+2.8 HP/turn).\n* Prior to [[0.25]], this robe did not require attunement at full HP, allowing users to swap it in when they needed to heal quickly.\n* Prior to [[0.18]], this robe was +5 and Regen+10 (+4.0 HP/turn).\n* The robe of Vines was introduced in version [[0.17]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

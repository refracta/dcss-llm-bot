They are highly resistant to most forms of elemental damage, but can be quickly dispatched through use of the the spells [[Shatter]] or [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]]. Their ability to summon demons is unaffected by [[silence]]. Fortunately, they are very rare, appearing only to guard the occasional treasure [[vault]].\n\n<!--spl-bot-begin-->\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Summon Minor Demon]]\n|slot2=[[Summon Demon]]\n|slot3=''none''\n|slot4=[[Summon Minor Demon]]\n|slot5=[[Summon Demon]]\n|slot6=''none''\n}}\n{{clear}}\n<!--spl-bot-end-->\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They do not [[see invisible]]; using this makes it much safer to approach them.\n*An [[amulet of warding]] can help with the hordes of summoned demons, but be aware it has no effect on demonic spellcasting. Watch out for summoned [[neqoxec]]s and [[smoke demon]]s in particular.\n\n==History==\nSilver statues were removed in [[0.16]], and replaced with [[obsidian statue]]s.\n\nPrior to [[0.15]], silver statues were vulnerable to [[wands of disintegration]] - one zap would instantly destroy them. Their summoning behavior was also special coded to place the demons close to the player rather than around the statue.\n\nPrior to the demon overhauls in [[0.9]], silver statues had access to a significantly more disparate and dangerous set of summons, including [[hellion]]s and [[tormentor]]s."}

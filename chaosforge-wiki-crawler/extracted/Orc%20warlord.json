{"title":"Orc warlord","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Orc_warlord","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | orcs}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Orc warlords''' are the epitome of orcish strength and brutality. They wear heavy armour, come with a powerful two-handed melee weapon, and occasionally an [[arbalest]] as a ranged option. They can also send all their orcish allies (and they always come with allies) into a battle fury, making everything you're fighting hit much harder than usual.\n\nThey are moderately rare in the [[Orcish Mines]], though one is often placed inside an end [[vault]]. They are also found in [[the Vaults]] branch, accompanied by [[orc knight]]s. Additionally, they can be found in certain [[Bailey]] layouts, always with a good [[axe]]. \n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Orc warlords have no special resistances beyond increased [[willpower]], so most tricks against other orcs will work well here.\n*With common [[stone]]s and [[boomerang]]s, orc warlords can still hit for 29+ damage. [[Repulsion]] is handy if you have it.\n*Don't underestimate orc warlords, even inside the Vaults. Orc knights and warlords will [[might]] each other with Battlecry, dealing more damage than you'd expect from an \"orcish mines enemy\".\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], orc warlords dealt 32 damage. However, all monsters attacked slower with most types of weapons. For [[Beogh]] allies, having a [[spear]] (38 damage, 1.05 delay) would be stronger (per turn) than a [[bardiche]] (50 damage, 1.5 delay)\n\n[[Category:Orc]]"}

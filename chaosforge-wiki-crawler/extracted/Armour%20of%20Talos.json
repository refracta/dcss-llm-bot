It provides hefty amounts of AC and one level of fire resistance, but the ponderous ego can be dangerous. A well-enchanted suit of dragon armour can often give equal or superior defense without the reduction in movement speed.\n\n==History==\n*The Armour of Talos was introduced and removed in trunk for [[0.18]]. \n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

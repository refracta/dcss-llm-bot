Not all events are exactly as they occured in game. (But I try to stay close; I mainly drop what's dull/repetitive.) This is in Crawl version 0.16 on CAO, and as a Felid Monk. Hope you enjoy! I will continue to update this until my character's journey comes to a close. I have done some proofreading, but it's an ongoing process! [[User:Autofire|Autofire]] ([[User talk:Autofire|talk]]) 06:56, 23 March 2015 (CET)\n\nUpdate: '''I think it's important to note that I'm going more for a story here than directly following DCSS.''' I will be resuming the Crawl shortly, but things are branching for a little while. :S (Written after posting the '???' section) --[[User:Autofire|Autofire]] ([[User talk:Autofire|talk]]) 16:29, 14 April 2015 (CEST)\n\n== Prologue ==\nI took this magic book off Robin. It's quite strange: I can write in it with my mind! Since I feel too full to continue on, I think I'll pass the time by recording my journey in this book.\n\nHmm...I'll begin from when I woke up...\n\n---\n\nI gasped and gritted my teeth from a horrible pain in my head. I found myself in a dimly lit room. Minutes passed before the pain began to subside, and I began to wonder why my bed was so hard. When I finally sat up, I felt very strange and not entirely myself. I looked down to see a pair of large paws, each with a fine set of claws. Thinking that I was being sat on by some large cat, I held perfectly still, hoping that it wouldn't notice me.\n\nMinutes passed, and the cat hadn't moved a muscle. Hoping that it was asleep, and knowing that I couldn't take it for another minute, I dashed away as fast as I could and ducked behind a wall. Looking back, I couldn't see anything chasing me. I felt quite satisfied with myself, but something still felt wrong...and why had I run all that way on all fours? I looked at myself and finally realized...\n\n...that I was a cat!\n\n== Level 1 ==\nIt took me a some time to take it all in. I walked back to where I woke up, and didn't find any more cats. (I realized that I was only scaring myself before.) I found a note on the stone floor, and though I couldn't pick it up (I lacked thumbs), but I could tell that it was written on. When my eyes adjusted to the dim light, I read:\n\n Resignation accepted\n ~WD\n\nI hissed and tore up the note. Resignation? Those jerks read my mind! I hadn't even told anyone I was leaving! Good for nothing thieves! One of their transmuters probably did this to me, and then they dumped me in this...place.\n\nBut there was nothing I could do about it. After my anger began to subside, I began to worry. Where was I? How was I going to become a Spriggan again? I knew nothing about transmuting, and I had no money to pay a professional transmuter to cure me. (Which would cost a small fortune even for the richest lord...something I'm not!)\n\nPushing these things out of my mind, I decided to explore the place. I walked through the cave for a while before finding a stairway leading down. I didn't want to take it though; I sensed that I was deep underground already, so I wanted to go up, not down.\n\nNext I found a giant, sleeping cockroach. I pounced on and dug my claws into it, killing it quickly. Staring at the blood pouring out of its wounds, I suddenly felt very hungry, and found myself eating it without second thought. Only once I was done eating did I realize how strange it was to be eating meat. (As a Spriggan, I only liked fruits and vegetables.)\n\nWell, I continued roaming around the dungeon, killing the rats and bats I encountered in order to get used to my new claws (and my new stomach). I even felled a pair of goblins who ganged up on me. Before long, I was engorged on all of the meat. However, I couldn't find a stairway out of the place.\n\nStealing the backpack of a goblin I felled, I used it to carry a few potions I came across. However, I was unfamiliar with them, none of them looked very pleasant, so I decided to save them until I can figure out what they do. After wandering around for what felt like hours, I finally decided to try downstairs.\n\nLittle did I know what I was getting myself into...\n\n== Level 2 ==\nThe first staircase I tried led to a room full of sleeping goblins. I killed one, but my new body made me fumble and make enough noise to wake the rest up. I fled the way I came and tried another staircase.\n\nThe second staircase had a similar set of goblins, although they were all awake and they seemed to have a leader. I managed to swipe a scroll and escape. (It turned out to be a Scroll of Fog.)\n\nThe third and final staircase led to an empty room with three hallways. I knew that the two hoards of goblins had to be somewhere on this level, so I made sure to be extra careful.\n\nAlmost the first thing I found was a sparkling altar. Looking around it, I found that it belonged to Nemelex Xobeh, the trickster god of cards. I didn't see any reason to join his service, because I didn't like the sound of trusting my life with a deck of cards.\n\nAfter wandering around some more, I found a bread ration, although it looked as tasty as a rock. (Something which I would have never said yesterday!) Then I ran into what I think was the second mob of goblins. I ran off, not wanting to face a certain swarm. I waited patiently for the goblins who strayed from the pack, and quietly dealt with them, one or two a time.\n\nThen I stumbled into a nice little chap named Ijyb. He wasn't too happy to see me, and tried to gut me with his dagger. The fellow wasn't any match for my claws, and pretty soon he was limp and lifeless.\n\nRight after that, a hobgoblin, calling herself Robin, walked in and began throwing her goblin followers at me. (Literally!) I was able to fight back without too much trouble, because I drew them into a tight corridor. When there was an opening, I jumped for Robin and slashed her neck open. Killing Robin left the goblins without moral support, and they went down without much of a fight. They won't skin me so easily!\n\n---\n\nWell, I've written out my journey so far. I think I'll take a little nap, because I'm still rather full. (Although it makes me feel pleased, in a way, to be so full of my prey!) I do have many questions, but I'll have look for answers them when I wake up.\n\n== Level 3 ==\nI can hardly think straight! I've had the most shocking experience in my life. At the very least, I think that I'm a felid, not a simple cat. But the sooner I'm my old self again, the better! I want to get out of this rotten place! I miss the sun dearly...But I can't get out right now. I'll just have to write about what happened to help me make sense of it.\n\nAfter I woke up from my refreshing nap, I was half expecting to be a spriggan again, but I was still a felid. Then I first realized that I couldn't tell what time it was...these caves are quite disorienting!\n\nI went down to the next level. After tearing through the few bats that bothered me, I found a magic wand propped up against a skeleton. Close inspection revealed it to be a Wand of Enslavement. I put it in my pack, just in case.\n\nThen I found another felid! Later, I found that her name was Natasha, but she didn't take any time to tell me that; she attacked me on sight! I began to fight back, but she seemed far more skilled, clawing me painfully. Natasha spoke something, and I realized that I was surrounded by imps. In the confusion, my backpack was cut apart and my potions scattered. Badly wounded, I scrambled for the first two I could reach.\n\nThe first one tasted sweet but did nothing, but after drinking the second one, I felt very strange. I suddenly grew incredibly tall. The felid and her cohorts gasped at me. Staring down at them, I realized that I had become a tree! I whacked Natasha, causing her to yowl. I bashed her again, killing her. All her imps poofed the moment she gave her last breath.\n\nI waited for a while, trying to figure out how to un-tree myself. When I started to wonder if I would always be a tree, my body began to loosen up and shrink. When my transformation ended, I was hoping I would be back to my Spriggan self, but, sadly, I was still a felid.\n\nOn the bright side, I replaced my shredded pack for the one that Natasha wore. (The pack had her name on it, so that's how I learned what her name was.) The pack is great because it allows me to easily slip it off when I need it to. It even has a section for holding vials in a way that I can easily access them during battle. I left Natasha's corpse alone, and I explored some more.\n\nBefore long, I found another felid who looked exactly like Natasha! I was able to run before she noticed me. I was out of potions of lignification, so I didn't want to face her head on. Eventually I was cornered, and had no option but to fight. I pounced on her, this time not giving her any chances. After receiving a very painful-looking slash, Natasha collapsed with a pathetic moan. Her spirit plunged into the ground...I think.\n\nI stared at Natasha's body. It wasn't exactly the same body as before, but there was no mistaking it: it was Natasha! I went back to where my first battle with Natasha took place, but the only signs of a battle were a few bloodstains.  I checked our second battleground again, and her body was still there.\n\nI was quite shaken up, and was hoping this was the last time that would happen. I found two altars in adjacent rooms. One belonged to Qazlal the Stormy, and the other belonged to Xom the Unpredictable. Xom was easy to turn down, and Qazlal's noisiness seems silly for one as stealthy as myself. (I was a spy in my spriggan days, after all!)\n\nThen I found a scroll, and upon reading it, it allowed me to identify a couple of my potions to be Potions of Might. I was very happy; these could save me in a tight situation, I told myself.\n\nI was surprised run into Natasha again! This time, I tried to reason with her, but she didn't seem to want to take any chances, and used a wand of enslavement on me! It seemed to partly work, because I was overpowered and unable to move for a moment. She began to summon more imps against me. When I managed to break free of her wand's power, I used my own wand of enslavement against her. It worked very well, and she even began fighting her own imps!\n\nI had a different idea, though. I made her follow me upstairs, although it was tricky because she seemed to be fighting against my wand's spell. I decided that she couldn't be reasoned with, so I drank one of my potions of might, and used my increased strength to finish Natasha.\n\nI waited for a very long time, not sure what to do. I didn't take my eyes off Natasha, wondering if she'd move. I wish I could have buried her, but I don't have a shovel and all of the cave's walls and floors are solid rock. Only partly satisfied that she wouldn't haunt me, I went back downstairs.\n\nI haven't met with Natasha again. I'm sitting near a stairway to the 4th level of the dungeon. I can only wonder what horrors wait for me down there...\n\nAfter thinking about it for a while, my only explanation is that Natasha faked her death twice. She was definitely capable of magic, because she seemed to be summoning imps. Hopefully, the wand of enslavement kept her from casting the 'fake death' spell again.\n\nBut it's a shame...I would like to have someone to talk to. Not only is this dungeon is very hostile, but it's also quite lonesome!\n\nI suppose it's time to push on.\n\n== Level 4 and Sewer ==\nAs soon as I stepped onto level 4, I heard a odd draining sound. Around the first corner, I was attacked by a pack of gnolls, but I was able to manage against them. (Tight corridors are very nice.) I also found a shop that sold various magic devices, though they were too expensive for the few pieces of gold I found lying around the dungeon.\n\nThen I found a book of Conjurations! Tomes like these are very valuable, I learned how to launch magic darts. They're really useful, since I can't use a blowgun or a sling like I used to. I had a hard time getting them to work every time, but I just need more practice.\n\nNext, I came across a strange drain. I instinctively jumped down it (though I don't know how I fit), and it led to a smelly sewer filled with sickly green water. While exploring the place, I ran into many snakes and kobolds, but they were fairly weak and were good for target practice. I discovered potions of brilliance, magic, and heal wounds while there. Useful! I found a decent stash of scrolls of teleportation as well.\n\nWhen I left the sewer, I did some more exploring. Before long, I found a blue altar in a tiny room. There wasn't any name on it, but it was covered with many strange writings. Feeling curious, I decided to figure out who it belonged to, so I went in the room, closed the door, and sat down.\n\nI sat there for a while, waiting for something to happen. But nothing happened. I tried saying hello, I tried praying (more or less; the whole religious thing is new to me), and I even knocked! Nothing happened. I finally said something like “What's the secret to this thing!?” and was about to leave.\n\n“You seek a secret, then?” said a soft voice. The suddenness made the fur on my back stand up. I asked who was there.\n\nI heard a laugh behind me, so I turned around and found someone standing a little ways off. This someone was wearing deep blue robes and had a hood over her face. In one of her hands was a tome. “I am the one who holds secrets as numerous as the stars. I am the Loreminder.” She gestured toward the walls of the room. Only, it wasn't a room anymore; we were in a huge library! The books that lined the walls from floor to ceiling caught my attention for a moment.\n\n“Initially,” said the Loreminder, “I did not let you in, for curiosity killed the cat. However, as you showed persistence in seeking the secret of my altar, I noticed a speck of the arcane within your mind.”\n\n“Do you mean...this?” I asked as I held out my paw and began creating a magic dart. I fumbled it and accidentally launched it toward the Loreminder. To my relief, she stopped it mid-flight with a wave of her hand.\n\nThe Loreminder lifted the dart up and studied it. “Yes, but you prove wanting of much practice. I wouldn't be surprised if you started your study today! Why, I could unravel it with my eyes alone.” She proceeded to disintegrate the dart (and my pride).\n\n“But all must start somewhere,” she said. “If you desire secrets, come, then, and join. You shall become one of my students, and I shall pour knowledge into you. All I ask of you is an endless hunger for the arcane. Some would say curiosity killed the cat,” here she tossed a magic bolt at my feet, making me jump with surprise. “But the cat's got lives to spare, so why not trade them for knowledge?”\n\n“But I'm not a cat,” I replied slowly. “Well, I'm not supposed to be one. I want to be my old self again, and-”\n\n“You haven't answered my question,” the Loreminder hissed. “Will you follow me or will you not?”\n\nI could tell that she didn't want me wasting her time, so I decided to be direct. “Will we be covering transmutations?”\n\n“Indeed, we shall, assuming you live long enough. But there are so many other topics to cover first.”\n\n“Maybe...ye-...no,” I finally answered.\n\n“Hmph. Fine. Then leave my presence, mortal.” I found myself sitting in front of the altar, alone once again.\n\nDid I make the right choice? I'm not sure...but I do know this: I don't want to become a wizard! I don't want to become completely full of myself, and cares about nothing but power. And I don't think I would be able to bend to a life of study. I may not be in my old body any more, but I'm still me! Right...?\n\nOr am I still me? Not too long ago, I would have never eaten a bit of meat. But what's the only thing I've eaten for the last 24 hours? When there was an enemy who I didn't want to kill, I would avoid them. But that's not what happened when I ran into Natasha. Maybe I was part of a band of outlaws, but I was for doing the right thing...right?\n\nWas I? Even if my heart was in the right place, I wasn't supporting a very friendly cause. But when I joined them in the first place, I certainly knew what I was getting into... And when I couldn't take it any more, I decided to leave.\n\nBut how did they know that I wanted to leave? What tipped them off? And, if they knew, why didn't they just kill me? Why did they even bother to polymorph me and throw me in here?\n\nI wonder if I will ever know...or ever get out, for that matter! Anyway, I must go on. Maybe I'll find someone who knows how to get out.\n\n== Levels 5, 6, and 7 ==\nI'm in quite a lot of pain right now. I think something's broken. Fortunately, this place seems quite safe. Beginning from...was it the 5th level?\n\nI was attacked by an ogre! The brute bashed me...quite painful, to say the least. He had me running for a while, and I managed to hide and regain my strength.\n\nBut while I was resting, a wraith jumped me! It had me scared at first, but I found that it wasn't too much stronger than what I'd faced before. The ghost didn't seem to be able to bleed, so my claws didn't work too well. My magic was able to destroy it in the end.\n\nNext time I found the ogre, I was prepared. I jumped him from behind and gave him a nasty scratch, though his thick skin made it not very effective. So, instead of fighting him head on, I let him chase me around the dungeon while I tossed magic darts at him. I kept this up until the ogre was defeated.\n\nFeeling confident, I went downstairs and promptly got jumped on by a few orcish wizards. It would have been my death if I didn't have another potion of lignificaiton! (So I got to be a tree again...hurray.)\n\nI spent some more time wondering around. Eventually I was attacked by a gargoyle. He was too strong for me, so I had to run. (He didn't seem to bleed, for one thing.) Narrowly avoiding the gargoyle's stone arrows, I dashed down to the level below. [which was level 7.]\n\nBefore I ran much farther, a very powerful ghost of an orcish fighter [named Thomus] found me. He gave me a bad scare, and he's definitely much stronger than the wraith from before. He chased me back upstairs, but then there was that gargoyle up there. So I continued to run for a while, sometimes from the ghost and other times from the gargoyle, until I finally found the place that I'm hiding in now.\n\nI'm not exactly sure where I am, but it's like a little island. Behind me is a giant pillar holding up the cavern roof. I got here on the staircase which winds around the pillar and leads back to the main dungeon. There's water surrouding the island, as far as I can see. (Though that isn't very far; it's quite dark in here.)\n\nThis place feels quite a nice, actually. For once, there's dirt and grass, not hard-packed stone. There's even a few strange trees, though they don't look like the surface trees. They probably can grow here because everything on this little island seems to glow with a soft light. (Now that I mention it, even [I]I'm[/I] glowing!)\n\nBut I can't stay here forever. I need to get going when I feel better...that last encounter with the gargoyle left me with a nasty gash in my side.\n\n---\n\nWhen I went to get some water, I saw my reflection for the first time...and, well, I really don't look like myself anymore. My face seems a bit twisted and gnarled, with my shaggy main and the multiple cuts on my neck and my face. At first, I almost thought I was another one of the denizens of this dungeon...\n\nMaybe that's why all of the creatures are here. Maybe they've been thrown down here, and they can do nothing but fight each other. Maybe Robin and Natasha and that gargoyle were like me...just trapped and looking for a way to stay alive.\n\nWhy would I even want to get out? Yes, I would be on the surface, and there wouldn't be so many goblins. But what would I do from there? Everyone I know wouldn't recognize me. Who would trust me like this? Maybe I could live in some forest and eat of whatever I could catch, but that sounds...empty.\n\nIn a way, I wonder if this is just a big game. Maybe we're supposed to be killing each other, and maybe the winner is the one who gets to whatever is at the bottom of the dungeon.\n\nWell, maybe the only way to find out is to win the game.\n\n== Ecumenical Temple ==\nI wish I had never come here. I feel more confused than ever. Unfortunately, I don't have anyone to talk to, so my journal will have to do.\n\nI got sick of doing nothing, so I decided to walk around the pillar. On the opposite side of pillar, I found a large doorway in the pillar. Inside the pillar were many altars. Some were shiny and smooth, others were dark and jagged.\n\nWhen I got tired of staring, I turned to leave. Before I got out the door, though, an idea hit me: Why don't I ask one of these gods where I am? Sure, some of them are big and would want to smash me for pestering them, but at least one of them would be willing to help...right?\n\nSo I went back among the altars. After a while, I decided to ask Vehument. He was the only one there whom I hadn't heard anything bad about--or anything at all, for that matter--so I thought he was my best bet.\n\nBoy, was I wrong. I walked up to the altar and sat in front of it. After planning how to go about asking my question, I said in a clear voice: “Oh Vehument the mighty, I seek you.”\n\n“Oh, do you now?” was his instant reply. “No, you seek something from me.” I found a large, masked figure standing over the altar. His scarlet robe was covered with colorful runes. “My, what a novice we have here!”\n\n“N-novice? At what?” I asked without thinking.\n\nVehument began bouncing a glob of lava in his hand. “Energy. Magic. Arcana. Destructive power. Whatever you want to call it.”\n\n“What!?” I shouted. “Another wizard-god?”\n\n“Hah! You've met my rival!” He waved his hand to stop my response. “But I promise you, I'm nothing like that egghead Sif Muna. No, I'm far more direct. I see you have a mind like mine.”\n\n“No!” I backed away. “I don't want to have anything you or your magic. I hate wizards!”\n\nVehument burst into laughter. “All wizards hate eachother! It's wizard 101!”\n\n“But I'm not a wizard!”\n\n“Oh? Ha! I like you cat, with your sense of humor!”\n\n“I'm not kidding! I was wrong to disturb you, so-”\n\nVehument reached out and grabbed me. He suddenly seemed like a giant as he held me by the tail. “You're not kidding, eh? We'll fix that.”\n\nBeing held by the tail hurt a lot, and I didn't like the tone in Vehument's voice. “L-look! I'm sorry for bothering you! Please...put me down!”\n\n“As Vehument the Destructive, I'll be the first to tell you that you chose the wrong god to mess with!” He threw me against the wall, sending the world spinning. I was too dazed to move, but I could sense something big coming my way. (Probably a fireball.)\n\nJust then, I heard a boom followed by a shout. When I regained my focus, I realized that there wasn't one figure anymore; there were two! Vehument was lobbing fireballs at the new figure, but the newcomer countered them with ease. The second figure's helmet flashed, igniting a fire beneath Vehument. (Though Vehument didn't seem to mind.)\n\n“Hear me, mortal!” boomed the new figure as he drew his battle ax. “I am Trog, and your hate of magics has won my favor. Join my legion, and together we will-” a fireball landed directly on Trog's helmet. “Gah! Face me, Coward!”\n\n“Face you? I just have!” Vehument laughed before ducking a swing.\n\nMy only thought was to get out of the place. I began slinking toward the door, hoping the two gods would be busy long enough for me to avoid being caught. When I was a foot from the door, a stray fireball crashed into the doorway, making it collapse in flames.\n\nI yowled and jumped back. I was trapped!\n\n“You're as bad as Dithmenos!” shouted Vehument as he threw an iceball.\n\n“Oh! I suppose that makes you twice as much!” Trog shot back as he deflected the magic.\n\nJust like that, the place got darker. “Dare either of you mock my name?” A black figure, darker than the shadows, rose up. Vehument's head snapped toward the newcomer, and Trog groaned.\n\n“Oh no, now who is it?” I wondered, darting behind another altar.\n\n“Oh mortal, I know what you have stirred up, yet your resistance is...charming. Take refuge under the shadow's wing. These fires are no obstacle to the great-” Dithmenos stopped as he engulfed one of Vehument's fireballs. “Fires are mockery to my endless shadow. Join Dithmenos and you will be safe.”\n\n“Shut up you wisp!” shouted Trog. “That cat is mine!”\n\n“The hypocrite came to me first,” said Vehument.\n\n“No matter.” Dithmenos said. “The mortal has made no agreements yet.” \n\n“Exactly!” Trog shouted as he swung his ax into Dithmenos, making him double over. What was once a duel became a brawl.\n\nWhen I was beginning to wonder if I would ever get out, a bright light shone from an altar opposite of the entryway. “SILENCE!” boomed a new voice. A shining figure appeared. “All of you, acting as beastly schoolchildren! Disgraceful!”\n\nThe three gods stopped fighting and turned to the newcomer. Vehument abruptly threw a fireball toward the fourth god. \n\nI didn't want to hang around any longer! I noticed that the fire at the door had died down, and all I had to do was climb over the rubble. I quickly (and silently) ran to the exit, but before I could get out...\n\n“Mortal! Where thinkest thy go?”\n\nI replied, “A-away, if you don't mind.” I saw that the newcomer asked that question.\n\n“Away? Away! Away can be your home when when I'm done with you, for all I care!” In a blink, I found myself in a little silver box. After many failed attempts to escape, I realized I could do nothing and wait. Wait for this fourth god to be 'done with me,' whatever that meant.\n\nI didn't have to wait much longer. The silver box vanished as quickly as it appeared. I found myself in the middle of the temple-area, but it looked as good as new. The door was fixed, there were no more burn marks, and someone swept up all the rubble.\n\n“Now, I must ask...” I turned around, and saw the shining god again. (I later learned that his name was Zin.) “What where you doing, chancing thou life to make quick-tempered hosts loud?” He began stroking his long, white beard. I couldn't tell what his mood was because his hood covered his face.\n\n“I didn't mean to. I was only...” I trailed off, trying to be selective of my words.\n\n“You didn't mean to? Thou liest! Mend thy dishonest tongue! Of course thy meant to walk in here!”\n\n“I wasn't done yet!” I snapped. Before he could get angry, I added, “Please...let me finish.” Zin stayed perfectly silent from then on until I finished explaining what happened since I first found the temple.\n\nZin's beard shook as laughed. “Thy meanst say you only wanted to know the name of this place? What knowledge-starved mind are you housing in your head?”\n\n“W-well, at least you know where we are, right?”\n\n“Yes, I would be ashamed to be Zin the Lawbringer if I didn't know. Oh, and by technical definitions, I'm not here, but that's no matter. Thy finds thyself in the Dungeon of Zot.”\n\nThe Dungeon of Zot!? I was stunned. Of all the places, I wondered, why did they throw me here?\n\n“You were a great fool to approach Vehument. He prides himself with being the most aggressive forces of this time, and is not to be taken lightly. And what do you mean, 'you're no wizard'? By definition, wielding magical power makes one a wizard.”\n\n“Well, when I say I don't want to be a wizard, I mean I don't want to be...you know, like other wizards. And I need some way to launch projectiles until I get my hands back.”\n\n“Does thou mean to say that those hands aren't yours? Are you a hand-stealer? Confess!”\n\n“Oh, about that, I used to be a spriggan, but somehow I've been changed into a-”\n\n“Lies! Knavery!” Zin shouted. “I wilt not feed upon these foul lies! I see no polymorphed bones in your body! Neither charlatans nor their canards do I tolerate! Shame on you for shaming your ancestor's blood!”\n\nI really wasn't sure what to say, other than apologizing. Zin told me to get my head straight before he left.\n\nI've been sitting here...at the water's edge again. I feel well enough to go on through the dungeon some more, but I'm in no mood. What's the point? What if Zin's right? Maybe I am a crazy little felid who doesn't know where she came from. Maybe being a spriggan was just a dream caused by eating something nasty.\n\nBut that doesn't sound right. It just doesn't seem true. And I don't feel better after writing. I just feel beaten.\n\n== ??? ==\n<Odd scribbles cover the next few pages of the diary, before they straighten out into legible text, albeit in a far different hand than before.>\n\nSunbeams shine up over the ocean, greeting me. I stretch out on the sand, still quite drowsy. The regular crash of waves fills the air.\n\n“I must have fallen asleep,” I say to myself. “I wonder if anyone missed me.” By 'anyone' I mean 'the two guys who don't treat me like trash.'\n\nI sit there for a moment, taking in the scene. If only everything was like this. Nobody worrying about what you can do or how you came into the world. Just...peace.\n\n“Doir!” That voice sunk my mood. “I knew you'd be here!”\n\n“Leave me alone,” I answer, not turning to the intruder. Ren, why do you have to make yourself such a pest?\n\n“There's no time! We've got to go!”\n\n“Ren, I don't want to play right now. Go away.”\n\n“No, I'm serious. We have to go. Now!” He grabs my arm and pulls.\n\nAfter wrenching my arm free, I turn to Ren in order to shout at him better, but instead I gasp at his appearance. His woody skin is pale discolored in many spots, and he seems out of breath.\n\n“They're gone, all of them. Lappi, Fen, Stria. Everyone and everything in Wind's Cove. Gone. We have to move.” He grabs my arm again and begins pulling.\n\n“What happened?” My hope that this is an elaborate joke was beginning to wear thin. “Renari, what's going on?”\n\n“The village was attacked at around midnight. I got away because I was playing hide'n seek, and no one found me so I fell asleep up in a tree.”\n\n“Who attacked? Stop running off already!”\n\n“A few mages. I barely got away. Now come on!”\n\n“What? Why would a few mages happen to find Wind's Cove? It's perfectly hidden! And what on earth did they want!?”\n\n“They wanted-” he is interrupted by a fit of coughing. Even I can tell that he badly needed to rest, so I make him sit down. “They wanted an army of slaves.”\n\n“They're enslaving spriggans?” I ask quizzically.\n\n“Worse. They're enslaving spriggan corpses.”\n\n“That's possible?” \n\n“Through a black magic. A very black magic. Though there was smoke and sulfur in the air, nothing could choke out the smell of it. It was...” Ren burst into tears.\n\nI don't quite know what's going on, but I'm certain that there's no joke. “I'm sorry I doubted you.”\n\nAfter he calms down, he answers, “It's alright. I didn't quite believe my eyes at first, either.”\n\n“So...what do we do now?” I ask.\n\n“We must fly. We must live on, keep our legacy alive...Fen told me that before the gas got too much for him.”\n\nI have no response. I stare out at the rising sun over the ocean again. How can we do that? I was one of the biggest misfits in the Cove, and Ren did almost no work, always playing instead. What are we supposed to do?\n\n“Who am I kidding,” Ren said. “I'll never be able to live up to the elders' standards. You might be able to, but I never listened...”\n\n“What!? I might be able to!? Go ahead and foist hundreds of years of heritage on me, will you!”\n\n“Calm down! I didn't mean it like that.” Ren gets up. “We've already wasted too much time. We'll have a lot more time to think about it after we get a hundred miles away from here. We aren't safe yet.”\n\nI can't do anything but agree. I follow Ren back into the forest behind the beach. Being very small and agile, we make our way through the forest at a high speed.\n\n“So...,” I say, “Where to?”\n\nAfter some silence, Ren answers, “Don't know. I di”--we go around a tree, interrupting Ren. “I didn't think I'd make it this far.”\n\n“I guess I should have expected that from you.”\n\n“Shut it, will you! I had a hard enough time keeping myself from burning to death!”\n\n“Burning? This atta”--another tree--”This attacker had fire magic as well?”\n\n“Attackers, you mean. I think there were at least three of them.”\n\n“Oh? What were they like?”\n\n“One was an orc who threw fire. Then there was a human. I think he did the black magic. Then there was a cat who made poison clouds. The three of them leveled...everything. I still can't believe that it's gone.”\n\nWe are silent for a while. “Wait,” I say, “Did the cat look familiar?”\n\n“I only saw a—gwah!” There's a thump beside me. I skid to a stop and turn around. Somethings on top of--\n\n<The line of the last 'f' abruptly stretches to the bottom of the page.> \n\n== Ecumenical Temple (cont.), levels 8-9 ==\nI am quite tired, but I suppose I might as well take the time to record what's happened so far. But to begin from the start...\n\nI woke up with a start. At first, I was rather disoriented and was frantically searching for the thing that attacked me. It didn't take long for me to realize that I had just been dreaming. I was quite upset, because I knew that I wasn't a felid when in the dream; I was a spriggan! I was afraid that this was my craziness again.\n\nAs I was pacing, one of my many thoughts was how real the dream was. I felt like I was jumped on, for example. And I remembered how I barely managed to get away by jumping off a cliff into a lake...\n\nThen I realized that I knew what came next, after the dream. My dream must have recreated my past, I reasoned. But I wasn't quite sure. Were these memories of previous dreams, and was I redreaming past dreams?\n\nEither way, I felt like writing the dream down, since I knew that dreams fade fast. But when I opened my diary, I found that I had already written everything! I believe I fell asleep with my book open, so I must have somehow written it all while I was dreaming. (Since I can write in the book by thinking the words...I think?)\n\nMaybe Zin was wrong, I thought. And why not? He's a god and all, but if these gods can get into fights and such, why can't they be wrong from time to time? I decided that I had one way to find out: ask him again.\n\nThe idea was daunting, but I felt I had no choice. So, I went back into the temple. I sat in front of Zin's altar and consulted him again.\n\n“Thy hast returned, feline. Something troubling you again? Looking to call another storm?”\n\nI forced a laugh. “No, I don't think I'll do that again.”\n\n“Ah, so I'd suppose thy seek the time of day, or what province thou finds thyself, or, by my books! Thy seek mine own middle name!”\n\n“Uh, no, actually--wait, you have a middle name?”\n\n“By my--no! Great Zin covets just one name, thank you!”\n\n“Ah. But, I was wondering...what if you are, uh, wrong. About the--”\n\n“Wrong? Wrong!? WRONG!!?” The dungeon shook. “You audacious little--!”\n\n“E-excuse me,” I said. Despite all the noise he was making, Zin heard me and became quiet, although he was still shuddering with anger. “But I'm quite sure that I was once a spriggan. But I'm not very sure, because...” I trailed off.\n\nZin eyed me. (I think; he got his masked face close to me for a moment.) “You hold this matter in high regard, mortal?” I nodded slowly. “As I thought. But do not squander my time; you is sorely mistaken if you takes my wrath as a feather.”\n\nI jumped as something cold poked my side. I turned to see that a white-robed figure was poking me with a cold staff. When I backed away, the figure turned to Zin. In a voice like a lawyer's, he said, “The mortal lacks anomalies, sir.”\n\n“But, are you sure?” I asked him. “Do you have any other checks?”\n\n“I answer only to Zin,” the figure quickly replied.\n\n“Do it again,” Zin ordered. “On the head.”\n\nBefore I was aware of what was happening, something clonked my head. I collapsed in pain. I vaguely heard the figure say, “The body lacks anomalies.”\n\nI felt crushed. “H-how?” I flopped as I tried to get up.\n\n“However,” the figure continued, “The brain is marked with severe scarring. I cannot see the cause.”\n\n“Oh? Interesting...” Zin mused. “Most strange. For once, certainty evades my mind as a whale to a whaler...” After dismissing the figure, Zin thought in silence. I woozily sat up, still not sure if I should be happy.\n\n“Quite perplexing indeed,” he said at last. “I make you an offer. Supposing my reputation has met thy ears me, thy already know that I despise necromancy, lies, transmutations, cults, and further embodiments of chaos. As you can't be the party responsible for this malady (if that is indeed what it is), my offer is this: I shall cure you of your ailment, as long as thou gains a heart after mine.”\n\n“A heart after...wait, you're asking me to join you, aren't you?”\n\n“How else would one attain such a heart?”\n\n“What would you have me doing, exactly?”\n\n“Defend the law, of course!” Zin continued to talk for a while, discussing what he would expect from his followers, but I don't remember all he said. When he finished, I considered for a while. Zin could cure me, but I was a bit worried about all the things he might make me do.\n\n“Well...alright. I'll join you.” As Zin ordered, I donated some of the gold I found in the dungeon. (He said that is was a sign of humility and trust, but I'm still skeptical!)\n\n“Excellent!” Zin boomed. “To celebrate this moment, I shall grant thy a gift.”\n\n“Already?”\n\n“Yes, but tarry not with details. Go forth and give grant the dead their rest, my child!”\n\n“But you said you'd give me a gift!”\n\n“And that I have.” Zin vanished.\n\nI blinked a few times. There was obviously no gift, so I began to look for one. However, I felt a strange urging to get back to the dungeon instead. As my search continued, this urge became greater and greater, until I had no choice but abandon my search. After grabbing my stuff, I climbed back up the stairs. Too bad I couldn't stay longer!\n\n---\n\nSince the depth I entered had that ghost from before, I decided to find him and try again at putting him to 'rest,' as Zin said. In my hunt, I found a spriggan baker in a little bakery. My first impulse was to say 'hi,' but I stopped myself; I was afraid he'd treat me like the rest of the dungeon's inhabitants. So I left him to his nap.\n\nMinutes (and many corridors) later, I heard a thump behind me. Thomus' ghost . “Back for more, cat?” he laughed. I hissed at him, and began to cast magic darts while trying to keep a safe distance, although that seemed to do no good. After a little slip, Thomus nearly beheaded me.\n\nI felt quite stupid, since I was obviously outmatched. I had no choice but run again. Thomus chased me, shouting, \"Zot is a myth, the Orb is a fable, you'll soon be a tale!\"\n\nI got downstairs, still in one piece. “Who told thy to down a powerful ghost?” said a soft voice.\n\n“Zin did,” I said reflexively. “W-wait...who are you? Where are you?”\n\n“By my sandals! I most certainly did not give such an order! And thy ought to have called upon my name! Next time, speak my name. To something not nearly so powerful.”\n\nI was still a tad confused. “Er, okay?” Zin didn't say anything else, so I continued through the dungeon. Eventually, I rounded a corner and ran into a group of giant bees!\n\n“Haste!” Zin whispered. “Spy the imp over there? I shall work through thy, just give the word!”\n\nI caught a glimpse of something red among all of the bees. “I'm not going in there.” I whispered.\n\nZin sounded grumpy. “Go! Before death regains his sting!”\n\nBefore I could argue anymore, the imp saw me and shouted, alerting all of the bees. Next thing I knew, I was surrounded by a wall of buzzing. I panicked and flailed, but it was no good; they were all too jumpy. Every inch of my skin was burning. I was furious at Zin. What on earth was he thinking!?\n\nSomething drew my attention to one small vial in my pack. “Ah, time to become a tree!” I thought. I rolled to get away from the bees, and then grabbed the little vial with my teeth. After drinking the mouthful in the vial, I stood back and glared at the swarm. (Which was getting awfully close.)\n\nNothing happened. I was horrified to realized that what I had just drunk tasted nothing like the other potions; it was spicy! It burned! I tried running, but I was so busy gagging that the swarm caught up to me.\n\nI felt dreadfully sick. Something twisted inside me, the world swayed, and everything went black.\n\n---\n\nWhen I came to, I was sticky and incredibly sore. The room was littered in bee corpses. I was as exhausted as the bees were dead.\n\n“What happened...” I couldn't help asking aloud between breaths. “Zin better apologize. That was a close one.”\n\n“Fie fie! Apologize for saving your life, indeed!” Zin said in my ear.\n\nI was too tired to be surprised that he heard me. “You know...what happened?...”\n\n“Thy would have been terrified of yourself had you not been so senseless. Madness consumed you. That drought flung you into a berserk rage. Indeed, thy ought to have been slain had I not blessed you.”\n\n“You did...what?”\n\n“My gift was vitality. I told you to destroy the imp, and to that purpose, my divine stamina was granted. Thy blood banished toxins. Had I not done this, thy unconsciousness would have occurred after the fourth sting, but thy received well over forty.”\n\n“Oh...hey, wasn't there an imp thing you were talking about before?”\n\n“Ah, yes. Thanks to you, that foul devil will no longer be causing mischief.” I heard a hint of pride in Zin's voice before he became silent.\n\nAs the minutes passed, and I began to feel a little better. I felt unsafe, in that open room, so I decided to get out. Harder said than done, but I managed to get moving. On my way out, a gleam caught my eye. The little red imp from before had a very valuable-looking amulet around its neck. I took it and put it on. It seems to have some magical properties, but I'm not entirely sure what it does...\n\nBut I should get going again. Zin might have another suicide mission ready. Speaking of that, I wonder if I was too hasty. Sure, I'm not going to become a greedy wizard, but I wonder what's under Zin's mask. And how can I be sure that he's going to actually cure me? Granted, he do <The text abruptly stops.>\n\n'''To be continued'''\n\n== Lies ==\nHere is where, as an author, I've altered major in-game facts.

The use of a large and heavy skeleton (by wielding it) amplifies this spell's effect.}}\n\n'''Bone Shards''' was a level 3 [[Necromancy]] spell which turned a wielded skeleton (two-handed weapon) into a blast of fragmented shards. Damage dealt increased with skeleton weight, but wasn't very impressive.\n\n==History==\nRemoved in [[0.8]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete]][[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

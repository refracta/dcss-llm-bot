It causes some [[magical contamination]] as you are hasted.\n\nIt can hold at most 9 charges.\n\n==Strategy==\nHaste is a very powerful buff. Hasting yourself will help in just about any sticky situation, and let you win fights you otherwise wouldn't. Unless you're in a serious emergency, don't be hasted for too long (more than 2 zaps), or you'll be inflicted with dangerous contamination levels.\n\nWhen players could still learn the [[Haste]] spell, the wand of hasting allowed you to speed yourself up without any skill investment. Even for those with the spell, wands of hasting can be used during [[silence]].\n\nIt can also be used to speed up your own [[allies]], though charges of this wand are fairly scare.\n\n== History ==\n*Wands of hasting were removed in [[0.20]]."}

{"title":"Stoker","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Stoker","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|liches}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Stokers''' are support casters found in Gehenna. They can force you away with [[Wind Blast]] and summon hostile [[creeping inferno]]s while they travel through lava effortlessly.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Killing them will despawn their summoned creeping infernos.\n*The [[Fire Storm]] created when a creeping inferno dies actually does rather minimal damage compared to an actual Fire Storm (from, say, [[Cerebov]]). Decently armored characters with rF++ are not in immediate danger of taking serious damage from them.\n\n==History==\nStokers were added in [[0.28]]."}

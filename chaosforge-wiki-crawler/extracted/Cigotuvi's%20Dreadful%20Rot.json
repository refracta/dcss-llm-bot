This slows, heavily poisons, and damages most creatures that step inside. [[Undead]] and [[nonliving]] monsters are unaffected, as are those with miasma resistance. You are immune to this cloud while you cast this spell, however you must immediately move out of the cloud to avoid suffering its effects. \n\nEach cast [[drain]]s about 9% of the player's max [[HP]], which can be restored by earning [[XP]].<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-clouds.cc|48}}</ref>\n\n==Strategy== \nMost monsters in the early game won't willingly walk through the miasma cloud. In a hallway, you can create a cloud, then attack behind it for a few turns. It can also be used to escape foes, if used in a hallway.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Works well with [[Mephitic Cloud]], as [[confused]] monsters can fall into the cloud. Can also be combined with [[Lesser Beckoning]] or a [[potion of attraction]] for the same result.\n*[[Undead]] and [[nonliving]] monsters are unaffected by miasma. Also watch out for monsters with ranged attacks\n\n==History==\n*Removed in [[0.32]] and replaced by the level 4 spell [[Cigotuvi's Putrefaction]]. [[Hedge Wizard]]s now start with the new spell [[Grave Claw]] instead.\n*This spell was added in [[0.30]], replacing both [[Corpse Rot]] and [[Conjure Flame]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

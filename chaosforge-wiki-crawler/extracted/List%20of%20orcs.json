{"title":"List of orcs","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_orcs","type":"raw","data":"{{version|026}}\n''This page is about the various orc [[monster]]s.  For the player species, see [[hill orc]].''\n\nAlthough bloodthirsty and cruel, '''orcs''' are by no means dim-witted. These subterranean brutes boast dangerous spell casters, dark priests of [[Beogh]], and skilled warriors among their ranks, even if the vast majority of them are unskilled thugs who rely on sheer numbers to overcome foes. Great hordes of orcs inhabit the [[Orcish Mines]], but they can be found throughout [[the Dungeon]], [[the Depths]], [[the Vaults]], and [[the Elven Halls]] as well. \n\n==Orc Types==\n{{monsterlink|Orc}}- These untrained brutes are commonplace nuisances. They are lightly armed, lightly armored, and only especially dangerous early on. However, with the right weaponry they can still damage stronger characters, so don't allow them to swarm you while you take out bigger threats.\n\n{{monsterlink|Orc wizard}}- Early casters who come with a versatile array of spells: they can hit you with [[fire]] or [[cold]] [[Conjurations]], [[haste]]n or turn themselves [[invisible]], and will [[confuse]] or [[slow]] you given the chance. Handle with care while low level or low on [[willpower]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Orc priest}}- The most notable feature of the orc priest is its [[smite]] attack, which is unavoidable, irresistible, and can target you so long as the priest is in your [[LOS]]. Early on, this damage can be deadly. They can also heal themselves and their allies. Definitely make priests a high priority.\n\n{{monsterlink|Orc warrior}}- Hardier than [[ogre (monster)|ogres]] and able to hit you much more effectively. They are often equipped with strong weapons and armour, but their low EV and [[willpower]] makes them vulnerable to [[wand]]s. They are dangerous in melee, and deadly to early characters.\n\n{{monsterlink|Orc sorcerer}}- Their capacity for [[draining]] you, summoning nasty demons, and [[paralyse|paralysing]] you makes them one of the least pleasant orcs to face. \n\n{{monsterlink|Orc knight}}- Basically a stronger orc warrior that is capable of [[might|buffing]] other orcs to deal much more damage. They may carry [[crossbow]]s, making them very dangerous at range. As with orc warriors, giving them disabling [[status effects]] renders them much easier to deal with.\n\n{{monsterlink|Orc high priest}}- Capable of [[smiting]] you like a normal orc priest, but they also add summoned demons into the mix.\n\n{{monsterlink|Orc warlord}}- The beefiest orcs, orc warlords are extreme hazards in melee, and if they generate with crossbows, are deadly at any range. Handle with extreme caution, and be mindful of other orcs in their presence; much like knights, they can [[might]] everything around them.\n\n===Unique Orcs===\n{{monsterlink|Blork the orc}}- An upgraded orc wizard, usually armed with a decently powerful weapon.\n\n{{monsterlink|Urug}}- A nasty orc warrior who generates with a stack of [[javelin]]s and the skill to use them well.\n\n{{monsterlink|Nergalle}}- An orcish [[necromancer]] who summons and then hastes spectral orcs to aid her in combat.\n\n{{monsterlink|Saint Roka}}- The strongest orc of all, Saint Roka is an [[orc warlord]] of [[Beogh]] with smiting attacks and a large retinue of followers.\n\n[[Category:Orc]]\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

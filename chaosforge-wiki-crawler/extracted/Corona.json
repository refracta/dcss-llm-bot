This glow offsets the dark, musty atmosphere of the dungeon, and makes the affected creature appreciably easier to hit.}}\n\n'''Corona''' (also known as \"'''glowing'''\" or \"'''backlit'''\") is a [[status effect]] and monster-only spell which causes the target to glow with an aura of light. \n\n==Effect==\nThe Corona status prevents you from going [[invisible]], greatly reduces your [[stealth]], and makes you easier to hit (attackers gain a [[to-hit]] bonus of <code>1d8 + 1</code>). Monsters inflicted by Corona are affected in a similar fashion, though monsters don't have any stealth to reduce.\n\nThis status is negated by being in [[Dithmenos]]' [[Shadow Form]].\n\n==Sources==\nOther than the Corona spell, the following sources can inflict the Corona status:\n*Evoking a [[piece from Xom's chessboard]] has a 10% chance to inflict Corona on monsters.\n*[[Ru]]'s Aura of Power may inflict the Corona status on monsters.\n*[[Zin]]'s Recite may inflict Corona on monsters.\n*[[Meteorae]] have an innate [[Glowing (mutation)|glowing mutation]].\n\nThe following don't inflict the Corona status directly, but causes the same effect:\n*[[Magic contamination]] above 5000 (yellow or higher) causes glowing, among other unpleasant effects.\n*Setting a target ablaze with [[Sticky Flame]] also causes them to glow.\n*A [[halo]] will backlight all creatures within it.\n\nWhen you emit a halo, the accuracy bonus does ''not'' apply against you - you aren't any easier to hit.\n\n==Monster Spell==\nThe Corona spell must have line of fire to the target to cast, and it must overcome the target's [[willpower]] to inflict the status.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n{{spell\n|name=Corona\n|level=1\n|school1={{Hexes}}\n|school2=\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Maledictions]]\n*[[Book of Debilitation]]\n</div>\n|castingnoise=1\n|spellnoise=0\n}}\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Corona was a player-castable level 1 Hexes spell. [[Enchanter]]s and [[Arcane Marksmen]] started with Corona memorized.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], a target affected by Corona could cancel this effect by going [[invisible]].\n*In [[0.10]] Corona received a power boost (+50% to spellpower)."}

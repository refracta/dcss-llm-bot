{"title":"Undeadhunter","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Undeadhunter","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|A weapon imbued with magic to disrupt and destroy the forces binding undead creatures together. Legends say that, long ago, a lich lord created many such weapons to ensure the loyalty of his undead servants. Sadly, this mace might be the last one left.}}\n[[File:Great_mace_undeadhunter.png]] '''''the +7 great mace \"Undeadhunter\"'''''\n\n+7 [[great mace]]\n\n[[Disruption]]<br>\nrN+\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Undeadhunter'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|718}}</ref> deals superlative damage to the [[undead]], equal to +100% damage on average. However, actually threatening undead monsters are rare before [[extended]], consisting mostly of [[bone dragon]]s ([[Abyss]]), [[curse toe]]s ([[Zot]]), and the three [[lich]]es ([[Vaults]]:5, Zot:5, rarely in other places). Against the living, it's a +7 great mace; alright, but worse than a regular great mace or [[eveningstar]] with a decent [[enchant]] and [[brand]].\n\nNote that [[holy wrath]] already has a massive multiplier (+75% average), also works on [[demons]], and can appear on one-handers. Therefore, Undeadhunter is often just ''unnecessary''. However, undead and demonic players ([[Ghouls]], [[Mummies]], [[Vampires]], [[Demonspawn]]) are unable to use holy wrath. And regardless of species, there's no stronger mace for the undead infested - but demon lacking - [[Crypt]] or [[Tomb]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Undeadhunter was considered an evil weapon, with the [[good god]]s forbidding its use.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], Undeadhunter bore a [[holy wrath]] brand and was unwieldable by evil characters as a result.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

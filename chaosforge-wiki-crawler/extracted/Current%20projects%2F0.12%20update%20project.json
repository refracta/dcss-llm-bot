It now contains five (still infinite) levels of increasing difficulty. Each level is composed of regions with different layouts, most of which are more static than before. The [rune][30] appears only at the third level and below, more frequently at deeper levels.\n* The Abyssal rune always appears in a [vault][31], never lying around on the floor.\n* Having the Abyssal rune greatly increases the generation of Abyss exits.\n* Many [Ziggurat][32] floors have more fine-tuned monster-sets, and a few monster sets have been replaced entirely.\n* Three new [Dungeon Sprint][33] maps: \"[Thunderdome][34]\" by evilmike, \"[The Pits][35]\" and \"[Arena of Blood][36]\" both by st.\n* [The Abyss][29] no longer exists in Sprint.\n* New layouts for [Cocytus][37], [Gehenna][38], [the Snake Pits][39], and the main [Dungeon][40].\n* More layouts allowed in [Zot][41].\n* New [Lair][42] branch ending vaults, and many other new vaults.\n* More decorative vaults are now placed.\n* \"Special rooms\" (kobold/orc rooms, beehives, morgues, jelly pits) have been adjusted, now appear at more appropriate depths and layouts, and no longer place doors.\n* A new \"special room\" - the mythical zoo, with standard high fantasy beasts.\n* New \"runed [door][27]\" feature: won't be opened by auto-explore or by monsters. Becomes a regular door when opened.\n* [Alarm traps][43] only trigger once, but make monsters swarm towards you for some time.\n### Character \n\n- - -\n\n* [Stalker][44] is removed.\n* [Berserkers][45] may choose their starting weapon.\n* [Gladiator][46] no longer starts with a [buckler][47], gets more [Dodging][48] to compensate.\n* [Traps][49] are spotted (or not) deterministically based on skill level and a few other factors: spending more time does not help.\n* [Levitation][50] and [controlled flight][51] are no more - all flight is controlled.\n* [Flying][52] no longer increases carrying capacity.\n* [Tengu][53] receive their [movement][54] speed bonus when flying, regardless of burden.\n* Black [draconians][55] gain permanent flight (like tengu but without the speed boost) at XL 14.\n* Removed the hidden special cost of [Spellcasting][56], [Stealth][57], [Evocations][58] and [Invocations][59]. [Aptitudes][60] adjusted.\n* [Experience][61] aptitude uses the same scale as skill aptitudes. This scale is coarser than the old one, so most races now require slightly more or less experience to gain levels than before.\n* [Deep elves][62] are better at [Earth Magic][63] than [Air Magic][64].\n* [Hill Orcs][65] are better at [Axes][18], worse at gaining levels.\n* [Tengu][53] are better at gaining levels.\n* Levels 1 and 2 of the [teleportitis][66][mutation][67][teleport][68] you only a limited distance.\n* The [Augmentation][69] and [Powered by Pain][70][demonspawn mutations][71] have been improved.\n### Monsters \n\n- - -\n\n* Removed: [ant larvae][72], [bumblebees][73], [blessed toes][74], [rock trolls][75], [wood golems][76].\n* New monster: [moth of suppression][77]. Generates an [aura][78] that prevents evocation and suppresses the magical effects of wielded/worn equipment.\n* New abyssal monsters: \n  * [Wretched star][79]: bestows temporary mutations.\n  * [Tentacled starspawn][80]: has constricting tentacles and a nasty attack.\n  * [Ancient zyme][81]: causes sickness when near the player.\n  * [Lurking horror][82]: stalks like a [wandering mushroom][83], then explodes for [torment][84].\n  * [Starcursed mass][85]: proliferates when ignored, re-merges when damaged. Has a [smite][86]-targeted psychic scream that becomes more powerful as more masses become visible.\n  * [Apocalypse crab][87]: breathes [clouds][88] of chaos.\n  * [Thrashing horror][89]: moves like a [bat][90], tramples, and frenzies.\n  * [Spatial maelstrom][91]: incorporeal vortex that turns walls into [spatial vortices][92].\n* New [deep troll][93] specialist monsters, appearing in late-D deep troll packs: \n  * [Deep troll shamans][94]: cast [Might Other][95] and [Haste Other][96] on their accompanying deep troll packs.\n  * [Deep troll earth mages][97]: cast [Dig][98] and [LRD][99] to allow the rest of the deep troll pack to pursue their opponent.\n* New vaults monsters: \n  * [Vault sentinels][100], with a signal horn that generates a lot of [noise][101] and the [Sentinel's Mark][102] spell which alerts all creatures on the level to the player's location.\n  * [Vault wardens][103], with the ability to close and seal doors near the player for a time or until they are killed.\n  * [Ironbrand convokers][104], with the ability to [recall][105] other monsters on the level to their location. Also cast [Might Other][95].\n  * [Ironheart preservers][106], with the ability to take some damage in place of an enemy the player is currently attacking.\n* New [uniques][107]: \n  * [Jorgrun][108], a deep dwarven earth elementalist.\n  * [Lamia][109], queen of the nagas.\n* Friendly summoned monsters do not attack things unless the player has line of sight to both the summon and the victim. Glass does not count as line of sight for this purpose.\n* Summoned monsters do not cast spells that create permanent allies.\n* Only a select few monsters flee at low HP.\n* [Ereshkigal][110] has more [HP][111], and can now cast [Silence][112] and [Major Healing][113].\n* Changed monsters: [Frances][114], [Joseph][115], [Polyphemus][116], [bone dragons][117], [soul eaters][118], [vampires][119], [vampire knights][120].\n* Rotting [corpses][121] no longer spawn [toadstools][122] for non-[Fedhasites][123].\n* Monsters can now use [wands of digging][124], and cast [Dig][98] in more circumstances.\n* Allies summoned with the [Mercenary card][125] can pick up and use equipment.\n### Spells \n\n- - -\n\n* Removed: [Fulsome Distillation][126], [Evaporate][127], [Cigotuvi's Degeneration][128], [See Invisible][129] and [Insulation][130].\n* New spells: \n  * [Force Lance][131] (level 2 [Conjurations][132]). Fires a short-range single-target projectile that can knock monsters backwards.\n  * [Dazzling Spray][133] (level 3 Conjuration/[Hexes][134]). Fires a spread of energy bolts that can [blind][135] creatures.\n  * [Iskenderun's Battlesphere][136] (level 4 Conjuration/Charms). Creates an autonomous globe that shoots at enemies in sync with your conjurations.\n  * [Fulminant Prism][137] (level 5 Conjuration/Hexes). Creates a time bomb at a [smite][86]-targeted location.\n  * [Disjunction][138] (level 8 Translocation). Has a duration, during which it blinks away nearby monsters. Causes contamination.\n* [Conjurers][23] have a new book with non-elemental spells (including the new conjurations).\n* Spell memorisation failure is no more. As long as the failure chance is not 100%, the spell can be memorized. There is a warning prompt if the chance of a miscast is high.\n* Some [spellbooks][139] have been reorganized.\n* [Condensation Shield][140]'s [SH][141] bonus no longer cares about [Shields skill][142] or [intelligence][143].\n* The [blinking][144] component of the [Dispersal][145] spell is irresistible.\n* [Venom Bolt][146] and [Bolt of Magma][147] do more damage; [Teleport Other][148] works more often.\n* [Recall][105] is now gradual instead of instant: one ally is recalled every 3-6 [aut][149].\n### Items \n\n- - -\n\n* [Axes][18] have a [cleaving][19] attack: they hit up to seven targets with a single swing (all directions except directly opposite the direction of attack, but not if a wall is in the way). These secondary attacks do only 75% damage and do not hit allies. Base damage for the larger axes is reduced to compensate.\n* One-handed [maces &amp; flails][150] have been improved: [flails][151] and [eveningstars][152] get a one point damage increase, and [morningstars][153] get a +3/-1 damage/accuracy boost to replace spiked flails.\n* The [wand of polymorph other][154] is now the [wand of polymorph][155]; use of it against the player will turn them into a random form (including several new forms - [Tree Form][156], [Wisp Form][157], [Porcupine Form][158] and [Fungus Form][159]).\n* [Scroll of unholy creation][160] is replaced with [scroll of summoning][161], which summons a few level-appropriate monsters.\n* Removed items: [spiked flail][162], [potion of water][163], [staff of enchantment][164], plain (non-magic, non-quarter-) staves\n* [Potion of decay][165][rots][166][HP][111] immediately rather than giving the \"Rot\" status.\n* Potions and rings of levitation are now \"of flight\"; boots of levitation are now \"of flying\"; and the +Lev artefact property is now +Fly.\n* [Amulet of controlled flight][167] is removed; [Amulet of the Air][168] now grants passive [Repel Missiles][169] and inaccuracy instead.\n* [Amulet of inaccuracy][170] correctly affects ranged weapons.\n* [Amulet of clarity][171] prevents [mesmerisation][172].\n* Some [rods][173] were changed to have a more focused spell set.\n* The \"Contam\" artefact property no longer causes contamination over time, but only when the item is unequipped.\n* The \"*Rage\" artefact property triggers much less often (except for [Wrath of Trog][174]).\n* Improved fixedarts: [Spear of the Botono][175], [Robe of Night][176], [Cloak of the Thief][177], [Robe of Folly][178], [plutonium sword][179].\n* The hand-and-a-half weapon category is gone; such weapons are now one-handed for normal-size races.\n### [Gods][180] \n\n- - -\n\n* Followers of worshippers of [Beogh][24] and [Yredelemnul][25] can now be [recalled][105] across levels.\n* Followers of [Beoghites][24] now share experience when the player scores kills.\n* [Yredelemnul][25] gives a small amount of piety for desecrating holy remains.\n* [Vehumet][26] is overhauled: Now grants damaging spells one-at-a-time (available from the (M)emorization screen), partially based on your elemental skills. No longer supports summoning, accepts ally kills, or reduces spell [MP][181] cost.\n* [Zin][182]'s Imprisonment placement is much more forgiving, pushing adjacent monsters out of the way if possible.\n* [Lugonu][183]'s Enter the Abyss no longer reduces maximum [HP][111] or [MP][181].\n* [Lugonu][183] no longer gives piety for anything in [the Abyss][29].\n* Mobile [Fedhas][123]-granted allies follow you across levels en masse.\n* New [Xom][184] effects: loud [noises][101], [blink][144] monsters, enchant monster ([petrify][185], [slow][186], [paralysis][187], [enslavement][188]; [haste][189], [might][190], [invisibility][191]), summon [shadow creatures][192].\n* Xom does not reduce [stats][193] as drastically, unless bored.\n* Xom will not animate or swap weapons in the Abyss, and will not hostilely animate your weapon at all anymore.\n### Interface \n\n- - -\n\n* Many updated tiles.\n* A new [Android Port][194] with touch-screen support.\n* New options: auto_sacrifice, dump_on_save, item_glyph, monster_list_colour, tile_cell_pixels, tile_filter_scaling.\n* Removed options: sacrifice_before_explore (now part of auto_sacrifice), annotate_item_class, annotate_item_dropped, autoinscribe_artefacts, show_no_ctele, menu_colour_prefix_class, menu_colour_shops, list_rotten.\n* Player action counts and generated vaults are now included in dumps by default.\n* List options can be prepended to with ^=.\n* The \"evil_eating\" and \"evil_item\" menu-colouring prefixes are renamed to \"forbidden\".\n* Explosion and cloud spells will try to target a spot adjacent to an out-of-range monster before falling back to the player's position, but will ignore plants.\n* It is possible to restrict a ctrl-f stash search to the current level by prefixing it with \"@\".\n* Swap the cycle ammunition commands. '(' = backward, ')' = forward.\n* Webtiles supports real-time animations, toggleable via F10.\n* Webtiles displays miniature health and MP bars on the player.\n* Allies can now be ordered to retreat in a specific direction.\n### Technical \n\n- - -\n\n* Numerous crash fixes.\n* Crashes during level transition no longer result in broken saves.\n\n\n\n[0]: #Project_goals\n[1]: #Contributors\n[2]:

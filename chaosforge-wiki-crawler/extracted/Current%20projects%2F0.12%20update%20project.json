It now contains five (still infinite) levels of increasing difficulty. Each level is composed of regions with different layouts, most of which are more static than before. The [rune](/Rune \"Rune\") appears only at the third level and below, more frequently at deeper levels.~~\n- ~~The Abyssal rune always appears in a [vault](/Vault \"Vault\"), never lying around on the floor.~~\n- ~~Having the Abyssal rune greatly increases the generation of Abyss exits.~~\n- ~~Many [Ziggurat](/Ziggurat \"Ziggurat\") floors have more fine-tuned monster-sets, and a few monster sets have been replaced entirely.~~\n- ~~Three new [Dungeon Sprint](/Dungeon_Sprint \"Dungeon Sprint\") maps: \"[Thunderdome](/Thunderdome \"Thunderdome\")\" by evilmike, \"[The Pits](/The_Pits \"The Pits\")\" and \"[Arena of Blood](/Arena_of_Blood \"Arena of Blood\")\" both by st.~~\n- ~~[The Abyss](/The_Abyss \"The Abyss\") no longer exists in Sprint.~~\n- ~~New layouts for [Cocytus](/Cocytus \"Cocytus\"), [Gehenna](/Gehenna \"Gehenna\"), [the Snake Pits](/The_Snake_Pits \"The Snake Pits\"), and the main [Dungeon](/Dungeon \"Dungeon\").~~\n- ~~More layouts allowed in [Zot](/Zot \"Zot\").~~\n- ~~New [Lair](/Lair \"Lair\") branch ending vaults, and many other new vaults.~~\n- ~~More decorative vaults are now placed.~~\n- ~~\"Special rooms\" (kobold/orc rooms, beehives, morgues, jelly pits) have been adjusted, now appear at more appropriate depths and layouts, and no longer place doors.~~\n- ~~A new \"special room\" - the mythical zoo, with standard high fantasy beasts.~~\n- ~~New \"runed [door](/Door \"Door\")\" feature: won't be opened by auto-explore or by monsters.

[Aptitudes](/Aptitude \"Aptitude\") adjusted.~~\n- ~~[Experience](/Experience \"Experience\") aptitude uses the same scale as skill aptitudes. This scale is coarser than the old one, so most races now require slightly more or less experience to gain levels than before.~~\n- ~~[Deep elves](/Deep_elves \"Deep elves\") are better at [Earth Magic](/Earth_Magic \"Earth Magic\") than [Air Magic](/Air_Magic \"Air Magic\")~~.\n- ~~[Hill Orcs](/Hill_Orc \"Hill Orc\") are better at [Axes](/Axes \"Axes\"), worse at gaining levels.~~\n- ~~[Tengu](/Tengu \"Tengu\") are better at gaining levels.~~\n- ~~Levels 1 and 2 of the [teleportitis](/Teleportitis \"Teleportitis\") [mutation](/Mutation \"Mutation\") [teleport](/Teleport \"Teleport\") you only a limited distance.~~\n- ~~The [Augmentation](/Augmentation \"Augmentation\") and [Powered by Pain](/Powered_by_Pain \"Powered by Pain\") [demonspawn mutations](/Demonspawn_mutations \"Demonspawn mutations\") have been improved.~~\n\n### Monsters\n\n***\n\n- ~~Removed: [ant larvae](/Ant_larva \"Ant larva\"), [bumblebees](/Bumblebee \"Bumblebee\"), [blessed toes](/Blessed_toe \"Blessed toe\"), [rock trolls](/Rock_troll \"Rock troll\"), [wood golems](/Wood_golem \"Wood golem\").~~\n- ~~New monster: [moth of suppression](/Moth_of_suppression \"Moth of suppression\").

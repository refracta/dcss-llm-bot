{"title":"Eye of devastation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Eye_of_devastation","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{list of | eyeballs}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Eyes of devastation''' are slow, floating monsters which shoot bolts of devastation, dealing irresistible damage to and [[vulnerability (status effect)|halving the will]] of anything within range. They have decent durability but no useful [[resistance]]s.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Their bolts can kill off even rather beefy mid-game characters in two or three solid hits and make quick work of fragile casters. Hit them as hard and as fast as you can.\n*They are especially dangerous when hexers are around, as their bolts will make you more vulnerable to hexes.\n*If you can't blast it at range, use a corner to lure it into melee range to avoid getting shot while charging in.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], eyes of devastation had '''Energy Bolt''' instead of Bolt of Devastation, which did not cut willpower in half.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], their Energy Bolts could destroy walls."}

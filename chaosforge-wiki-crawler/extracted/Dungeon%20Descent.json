{"title":"Dungeon Descent","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dungeon_Descent","type":"raw","data":"{{version-trunk}}\n{{flavour|Mode with a branching, one-way path through the Dungeon.}}\n'''Dungeon Descent''' ('''Descent''', '''Ironman''') is a ''Crawl'' variant, along with [[Dungeon Sprint]]. Descent mode is similar to the main game, but you can never go back up a floor, only down.\n\n==Useful Info==\nDescent mode has a number of changes from regular ''Crawl'':\n\n*When going down a regular set of stairs, you get the '''Peek''' status that allows you to preview the next floor. During Peek, you can go back up without spending time on the lower floor (note: you still wait 1.5 turns after going back up). You also get to view the location of all 3 stairs, and the surrounding area of said stairs. \n**Using an [[escape hatch]] or [[shaft]] does not let you peek, so you get none of the above benefits.\n**Doing anything while you have Peek (besides going up) destroys all upstairs on the level, preventing you from going up again. Using a hatch or shaft will also destroy stairs.\n**[[Ignis]]' Rising Flame ability still lets you go up a floor. \n*A '''Debt''' mechanic is introduced. If you don't have enough [[gold]], you can still buy items from a [[shop]]. Doing so puts you into debt, which prevents you from buying other items until it is cleared. Any gold you collect is used to pay off debt. Debt is exactly equal to <code>price - current_gold</code>; there is no interest, and there are no other downsides to going into debt.\n*[[Runes of Zot]] are optional; [[rune lock]]s do not exist.\n*The [[malevolent force]] mechanic does not exist.\n*[[Shaft]]s can only drop the player 1 floor.\n*Certain [[vault]]s do not appear.\n*[[Branch]] order and length is adjusted. See below for details.\n\n==Map==\nNew characters start on level one of [[the Dungeon]]. [[Delver]]s start at level two.\n\nBranches separated by a bar (|) are choices you can make, e.g. on D:12, you can enter either [[Lair]] or [[Depths]]. Branches in ''unbolded italics'' indicate that they are not part of the intended progression - you will skip branches if you enter them.<!-- Maybe the 'progression skip' entrances should be in a different color instead? Maybe a different format?--->\n\n#[[File:Dungeon exit.png]] '''[[The Dungeon]]''' (12 levels)\n#[[File:Lair entry.png]] '''[[The Lair]]''' (5 levels) | [[File:Depths entry.png]] ''The Depths'' (4 levels)\n#[[File:Orc entry.png]] '''[[Orcish Mines]]''' (2 levels) | [[File:Slime entry.png]] ''The Slime Pits'' (5 levels)\n#One of { [[File:Swamp entry.png]] '''[[The Swamp]]''' OR [[File:Shoals entry.png]] '''[[The Shoals]]''' } (4 levels) | One of { [[File:Snake entry.png]] '''[[Snake Pit]]''' OR [[File:Spider entry.png]] '''[[Spider's Nest]]''' } (4 levels)\n#[[File:Elf entry.png]] '''[[Elven Halls]]''' (3 levels) | [[File:Crypt entry.png]] '''[[The Crypt]]''' (3 levels)\n#[[File:Vaults entry.png]] '''[[The Vaults]]''' (5 levels)\n#[[File:Slime entry.png]] '''[[The Slime Pits]]''' (5 levels) | [[File:Depths entry.png]] ''The Depths'' (4 levels)\n#[[File:Depths entry.png]] '''[[The Depths]]''' (4 levels)\n#[[File:Zot entry.png]] '''[[The Realm of Zot]]''' (5 levels)\n\nOn Zot:5, there is an exit to the end of the game, so the [[orb run]] only lasts for one floor.\n\n'''Special:'''\n*The [[Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], and other [[portal]] levels work like normal. Their portals appear in the usual locations, and you can escape back to where you came.\n*Entrances to the [[Vestibule of Hell]] appear in Depths. The Vestibule allows you to go back into Depths. The four hells ([[Cocytus]], [[Gehenna]], [[Tartarus]], [[Dis]]) have portals back to the Vestibule on every floor, like the regular game.\n*The [[Temple]] and [[Tomb]] do not exist. \n\nWith the given branches available, it is possible to get 13 runes of Zot.\n\n==Strategy==\nWithout one of the most important escape tools in ''Crawl'', stairs, Descent is naturally harder than the main game. Essentially, you are [[shaft]]ed when entering each new floor: [[rest]]ing is harder, you can't [[stair dance]], and escaping from dangerous [[out-of-depth]] monsters is difficult. You can no longer \"retreat upwards, then go down a different downstair\", so you are more reliant on consumables to get out of bad situations. \n\nAt the time of writing, there is no compensation to monster or item generation in Descent.\n\nDue to the changes in the Dungeon's layout, there are a few oddities:\n*As there is no Temple, you'll find all the [[altar]]s in the main Dungeon.\n*Branch entrances are guarded by appropriate monsters. So you can find [[hydra]]s and [[bog bodies]] near [[the Swamp]]'s entrance in [[Orc]], [[bone dragon]]s and [[curse skull]]s near [[the Crypt]]'s entrance in [[Spider]], etc.\n*[[Kiting]] is harder, which makes slow enemies like [[worm]]s and [[Gastronok]] bigger threats.\n*You will need to deal with the [[Vaults]]:5 entry party. Sometimes, a branch entrance may spawn in the center of V:5, but this is not guaranteed.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"500px\" heights=\"500px\" class=\"left\" mode=\"nolines\">\nDescentMap.png|'''Visual map of descent mode.'''\n</gallery>\n\n==History==\n*Descent mode will be added in [[trunk]].\n\n[[Category:Crystal Ball Articles]]"}

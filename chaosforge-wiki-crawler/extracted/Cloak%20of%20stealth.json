Note that this stacks with the stealth bonus for [[Armour#Elven_Armour|elven]] cloaks, so such a cloak provides 70 stealth.\n\n==Strategy==\n\nIt's better than no ego, but stealth isn't particularly useful except to stabbers.  It's generally superior to a [[cloak of darkness]], but worse than one of [[cloak of preservation|preservation]] or [[poison resistance]].\n\n[[Category:Cloaks]][[Category:Egos]]"}

{"title":"Type","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Type","type":"raw","data":"'''Type''' refers to a monster's species. Each monster has both a genus (generic group of monsters it fits into) and a species. Monsters with the same genus are represented by the same letter.\n\nMonsters in the same genus will make way for each other in order to surround you regardless of intelligence, and any monster with beneficial spells will generally only be able to cast them on other monsters of the same genus ([[meliai]] can only heal [[killer bee]]s and [[queen bee]]s, [[deep troll shaman]]s can only cast [[Might Other|Might]] and [[Haste Other|Haste]] on other trolls, [[orc knight]]s' [[Battlecry]] only affects other [[list of orcs|orcs]], etc.). There are some exceptions to this rule, such as [[ironbound convoker]]s."}

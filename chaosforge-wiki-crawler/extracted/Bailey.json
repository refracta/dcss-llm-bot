{"title":"Bailey","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bailey","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|The Bailey is the still-occupied and well-guarded fortress of an orcish lord. The treasures within are protected by both physical barriers and large numbers of well armed humanoid warriors.\n}}\n[[File:Bailey portal.png]] '''Bailey''' is temporary [[portal]] level with a medieval warfare theme. Many baileys are built around a castle theme, and some may exploit [[water]] to shoot [[Ranged Weapons]] at you.\n\nBaileys may appear on Dungeon: 7-10. The portal is signaled by the \"creaking of a portcullis\".\n\n==Monsters==\nBaileys are most often filled with roaming bands of the following monsters:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n|-\n| {{Brown|K}} [[File:Kobold_(monster).png]] '''[[Kobold (monster)|Kobold]]''' || {{monsterlink|Goblin}} || {{monsterlink|Hobgoblin}} || {{Yellow|g}} [[File:Gnoll (monster).png]] '''[[Gnoll (monster)|Gnoll]]'''\n|-\n| {{LightRed|o}} [[File:Orc.png]] '''[[Orc]]''' || {{Yellow|o}} [[File:Orc_warrior.png]] '''[[Orc warrior]]''' || {{Cyan|o}} [[File:Orc_knight.png]] '''[[Orc knight]]''' \n|}\n\nOther monsters only appear in specific layouts, or as the \"boss\" defending the loot at the end:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Gnoll sergeant}} | {{monsterlink|Gnoll shaman}}\n|}\n*If you see lots of gnolls and polearms, expect to see some of these guys as well. \n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n|-\n| {{Brown|c}} [[File:Centaur_(monster).png]] '''[[Centaur (monster)|Centaur]]'''\n|}\n*If you see lots of open water, you are about to get attacked by centaurs... with javelins!\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Orc sorcerer}} | {{monsterlink|Orc high priest}} | {{monsterlink|Kobold demonologist}}\n|}\n*If you start seeing these guys, you better have high magic resistance and a way to dispatch them quickly before they call in a bunch of demons.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Orc warlord}}\n|}\n*Found at the end of several baileys, these guys are a serious threat to any character. Try to fight them only after you've cleared the bailey of other monsters.\n\n==Treasure==\n*Baileys generally have useful loot, especially for those wielding axes or polearms. Items usually consist of good weapons and armour, as well as rare [[potion]]s and [[scroll]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Players should exercise caution when entering a bailey. It is entirely possible to become overwhelmed by the enemies inside and end up using precious consumables to escape without gaining access to any of the treasure.\n*If you have a wand of polymorph, you can put it to good use here. Orc warriors may be good with arbalests, but wyverns certainly are not.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], baileys could appear from D:7-14 and Orc:1. Also, many layouts were adjusted in this version.\n\n{{Portals}}\n\n[[Category:Portals]]"}

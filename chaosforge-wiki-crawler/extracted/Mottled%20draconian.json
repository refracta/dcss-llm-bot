{"title":"Mottled draconian","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mottled_draconian","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{list of | draconians}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Mottled draconians''' are the [[Sticky Flame|sticky flame]]-themed members of the [[list of draconians|draconian]] family, and one of the less threatening. Their sticky flame breath attacks do very little damage by this point in the game (3d5), especially if you have [[fire]] resistance. Also, be aware that they themselves are fire resistant, though skilled [[Fire Elementalist]]s can punch through regardless. They can be found primarily in [[the Realm of Zot]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While sticky flame resistance is certainly useful against them, it's rare enough that it's best not to worry about it. Fire resistance will help defend against their breath attacks almost as well, while [[freezing]]-[[brand]]ed weapons help make combat against them much easier.\n\n==History==\nMottled draconians were removed in [[0.20]]."}

{"title":"Nonliving","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Nonliving","type":"raw","data":"'''Nonliving''' monsters are inanimate objects and substances which have gained autonomy via magical, technological, or natural means.  ([[Undead]] monsters, by contrast, were at one time alive.)\n\nNonliving monsters include [[golem]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, [[statue]]s, [[List of elementals|elemental]]s, [[mimic]]s and [[dancing weapon]]s. Nonliving players include [[gargoyle]]s, [[djinn]], and players in [[Statue Form]] or [[Storm Form]].\n\nAll nonliving monsters are immune to [[negative energy]], [[confusion]], and [[asphyxiation]] (being [[unbreathing]]). They can be [[slow]]ed (unless they are immobile), but not put to [[sleep]]. Most &ndash; but not all &ndash; nonliving monsters are also resistant to poison and electricity.  The [[training dummy]], for instance, is resistant to neither.\n\nNonliving players are immune to [[poison]], [[miasma]], and do not have [[blood]]. They are not immune to torment or confusion.\n\n* [[:Category:Nonliving holiness|List of nonliving monsters]]\n\n[[Category:Nonliving holiness|*]]"}

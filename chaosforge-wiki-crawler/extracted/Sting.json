Its impact damage is 70% poison and 30% physical; normal monsters take full damage from it, resistant monsters take 53%, and immune monsters take 30%.\n\n[[Alchemist]]s start with this spell memorized.\n\n==Strategy==\nSting is decent at softening up targets from a short distance. If you've poisoned the enemy, you can start walking back; the poison will be enough to kill most D:1 and D:2 enemies. \n\n[[Mercury Vapours]] is more accurate, and can inflict [[weak]] on foes. In the early game, however, Sting is more MP efficient. Early on, you may want to cast Mercury Vapours once (to get that spell's extra poison), then finish off the foe with Sting. Past the early game, Vapours becomes more efficient overall, so feel free to forget Sting.\n\nWhile Sting ''can'' do damage to poison immune creatures, it's very low (max. 1d3). In a similar vein, Sting is acceptable against [[endoplasm]]s, but struggles against poison resistant enemies that are any stronger.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Sting was a level 1 [[Transmutations]]/[[Poison]] spell.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Sting was a level 1 [[Conjurations]]/[[Poison]] spell with range 7, and was entirely useless against targets with [[poison resistance]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], [[Louise]] and some [[wizard (monster)|wizards]] had this spell."}

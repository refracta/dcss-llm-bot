{"title":"Exclusion","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Exclusion","type":"raw","data":"'''Exclusions''' are areas of [[the Dungeon]] which have been marked as especially dangerous or unwise to explore. The game will not [[autoexplore]] into an exclusion, and will ask you for confirmation before allowing you to walk into an exclusion manually.\n\nThe game will automatically mark exclusions in most places with stationary danger, such as an [[oklob plant]] or dangerous [[cloud]] areas. You can create exclusions by entering examine mode (press '''x'''), moving the cursor over the tile you wish to exclude, and then pressing '''e'''. Pressing '''e''' once will exclude all terrain within [[line of sight]] of the excluded tile. Pressing it again will only exclude the tile itself, and pressing it a third time will erase the exclusion altogether. Pressing '''Ctrl-E''' will remove all exclusions on the current floor.\n\nNote that it's not possible to place exclusions in [[the Abyss]].\n\n==Strategy==\n*Placing a line of sight exclusion on a sleeping monster you hope to avoid ([[hydra]]s, dangerous [[unique]]s, etc.) will allow you to continue exploring a floor with auto-explore without the risk of waking it up. Bear in mind that there are many ways to generate [[noise]] that may wake it up, even if it's not currently visible.\n**LOS exclusions are also useful for [[trap]]s that you don't want monsters to trigger.\n*If you've discovered a [[vault]] that you don't want to deal with immediately, placing a single tile exclusion on the [[door]] to it will ensure that you don't accidentally open it prematurely.\n*Players who tend to [[Tab]] their way through combat may wish to use single tile exclusions when involved in difficult battles near [[shallow water]], [[web]]s, or other terrain that one may accidentally step into when automating combat.\n*Excluding stairs will give you a warning when you attempt to go up/down that staircase. This is useful to prevent yourself accidentally going downstairs to a dangerous pack of monsters or other danger.\n*Temporary exclusions might be helpful for planning your moves in a tough situation. You can place exclusions on nearby tiles, to see what would count as line of sight if a monster would move into it.\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

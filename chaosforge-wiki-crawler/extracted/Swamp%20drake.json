{"title":"Swamp drake","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Swamp_drake","type":"raw","data":"{{version017}}\n{{list of|dragons}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Swamp drakes''' are tiny [[list of dragons|dragons]] often found in [[the Swamp]] which [[confusion|confuse]] their victims with noxious gas before moving in for the kill. They are resistant to poison, but nothing else.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Poison resistance]] renders their breath harmless, making them little more than flying pests.\n*Clouds prevent other clouds from forming, so if you have no other resistances, use one of the Swamp's atmospheric floating clouds to keep from being confused, or create your own with a spell or [[scroll of fog]].\n*Certain entrances to the [[Orcish Mines]] have a swamp drake in them. Swamp drakes are far more dangerous at that point in the game, especially if you haven't found poison resistance yet."}

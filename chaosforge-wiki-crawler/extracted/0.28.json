{"title":"0.28","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/0.28","type":"markdown","data":"_This article is about a previous release of [Crawl][0]. For information about other versions of Crawl, including the newest, see [List of Stone Soup versions][1]._\n\n0.28 is a version of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. It was released on February 4th, 2022. \n\n## Contents\n\n* [1 Highlights][2]\n* [2 Branches, Environment][3]\n* [3 Character][4]\n* [4 Gods][5]\n* [5 Interface and Options][6]\n* [6 Items][7]\n* [7 Monsters][8]\n* [8 Spells][9]\n\n## Highlights \n\n* New Cinder Acolyte background, followers of the dying god Ignis.\n* The Hells burn with new fury, filled with new monsters and effects.\n* Yredelemnul completely redesigned; Okawaru and Jiyva significantly changed.\n* The Spider's Nest respun - many new monsters and maps lurk within.\n* Magical orbs added as a new category of off-hand equipment.\n## Branches, Environment \n\n* You will learn to fear the Hells! \n  * Branch-wide persistent effects: \n    * Dis: ongoing -8 Corrosion.\n    * Cocytus: potions cannot be used.\n    * Gehenna: scrolls cannot be used.\n    * Tartarus: willpower halved.\n  * Timed effects are now the same for all Hells: temporary mutation, hp drain, attribute drain, and noise.\n  * Floors 1-6 of each hell sub-branch are considerably smaller, and place only one pair of stairs.\n  * Each hell subbranch's spawn tables are adjusted to produce more depth appropriate monsters and less chaff. (See also 'Monsters'.)\n* Six new Wizard's Laboratories are added: Eringya's Formal Garden, Tukima's Studio, Yara's Duelist Academy, Borgnjor's Mausoleum, Maxwell's Workshop, and Alistair's Party Mansion.\n* Abyss: \n  * The Abyss no longer generates random items, and kills in the abyss grant no experience or conventional piety. (Uskayaw and Yredelemnul continue to grant their special kinds of piety).\n  * Collecting the abyssal rune of zot grants two XP potions worth of experience.\n  * The chance of an Abyss teleport sending the player deeper is increased, as are the rune, stair, and exit generation rates.\n* Sewer maps have been re-balanced and randomized, and two new sewers added.\n* Bailey maps have been re-balanced and randomized, and three new baileys added.\n* Spider has two new end maps, an \"Endless Swarm\" map featuring broodmothers and a \"Bug Friends\" map featuring all non-spider insects. \n  * Spider is a normal noise level again.\n* Artefacts can now generate on D:2-3.\n* Ziggurats no longer require runes of zot to enter.\n* Exploration-based shaft traps can now happen a maximum of once per branch.\n## Character \n\n* Backgrounds: \n  * New background: Cinder Acolyte, an Ignis zealot. Starts worshipping Ignis, along with Scorch and a -1 flame branded weapon of choice.\n  * Fire Elementalist's starting spells are revised, and are now: Foxfire, Scorch, Conjure Flame, Inner Flame, and Flame Wave. (See 'Spells'.)\n  * The Enchanter background no longer starts with the Corona spell, and instead starts with a potion of invisibility.\n  * The Fighter background now starts with a buckler instead of a kite shield.\n  * The Abyssal Knight background now starts with 5/2/5 Str/Int/Dex (was 4/4/4).\n* Player-chosen attribute increases now happen every 6 XLs, starting at XL 3, and increase a stat by 2. Demigods are unchanged.\n* The experience cost of high-level skills is reduced.\n* Late game XP gains are reduced.\n* Formicids now dig at normal movement speed. Each cell dug causes HP drain.\n* Each level of the evolution mutation now provides exactly two 'good' random mutation, activating once per XL.\n* New bad mutation: devolution. Mechanically similar to evolution but dispenses bad mutations and activates once every 1/4th of an XL.\n* New Demonspawn Mutations: \n  * Weakening Stinger: gives a tail aux attack. Level 3 blocks the cloak slot and applies Weak on hit.\n  * Demonic Touch: adds AC-ignoring damage to off-hand punch attacks. Level 3 blocks the glove slot and applies Vuln (halved Will) on hit.\n* Aux attacks now trigger with a chance based on XL. \n  * The chance to offhand punch now starts at 5% and increases to 50% with Unarmed Combat skill.\n* Strength 0's regeneration reduction is replaced with -Regen in monster LOS.\n* Intelligence 0's 4/5 chance to fail scroll reading is replaced with -Scroll.\n* Wanderers have more useful starting skills and new item possibilities.\n## Gods \n\n* New (non-temple) God: Ignis, the Dying Flame. \n  * Ignis altars do not generate normally, Ignis can only be worshipped from a faded altar or from the new Cinder Acolyte zealot start.\n  * Ignis worshippers normally start at 5* piety.\n  * Ignis has no piety gain and no piety decay.\n  * Ignis grants the following: \n    * Passive rF+ (fire resistance).\n    * 'Fiery Armour': +7AC and fire damage to melee attackers for its duration.\n    * 'Foxfire Swarm': Conjures foxfires on every open space in radius 2, which launch one-shot fire attacks ala the 'Foxfire' spell.\n    * 'Rising Flame': After 2-4 turns, sends the player through the ceiling (up one floor). Can only be used once.\n* Yredelemnul: \n  * Piety now solely based on the number and strength of allied zombies in sight.\n  * Passive reaping: slain living, demonic, and holy monsters have a chance to automatically rise from the dead as undead allies.\n  * Zombies cannot leave the level and expire when the player leaves the level.\n  * Yredelemnul grants the following active abilities: \n    * 0*: Recall Undead Harvest: recalls undead allies to you.\n    * 2*: Dark Bargain. Trade 2 zombies for a long-duration undead summon. Scales with invocations.\n    * 4*: Drain Life. Same as previous drain life, but also costs 3 zombies.\n    * 5*: Bind Soul. Formerly known as 'Enslave Soul', but also costs 4 zombies. A bound soul is permanent and can follow the player between floors.\n  * Removed animate remains/dead and injury mirror abilities.\n  * Kills by Yredremnul allies now grant full experience.\n* Okawaru becomes the god of single combat. \n  * New ability: Duel, granted at 5*. The Duel ability smite-targets a single non-summoned enemy in LOS (which must be threat level \"tough\" or higher), and transports them and the player to an Arena portal vault. Winning the duel opens a gate to return from the portal vault, and the player will be forcibly teleported back after a short duration.\n  * Finesse is moved to 4* (from 5*).\n  * Worshippers may no longer have allies of any kind.\n* Jiyva: \n  * New active 'Oozemancy' 3* ability. Temporarily turns nearby walls within radius 4 into slime-covered walls that do acid damage to adjacent monsters.\n  * Mutations now changed in bursts: existing mutations decay, then new ones are added several levels at once.\n  * Piety now granted solely for exploring, and only outside the Slime Pits.\n  * Now grants passive regeneration of HP and MP at a high rate.\n  * Passive rCorr is now granted at 2*, and jelly spawning on hit at 5*.\n  * Removed: attribute shuffling, the 'cure mutation' ability, and healing/mp restoration from jelly item eating.\n* Elyvilon: \n  * Pacification grants full XP and works on intelligent plants.\n  * Lifesaving is now completely passive, with an extra piety gated chance on top of the basic good god lifesaving chance and a cooldown.\n  * Purification is moved to 1* and reduced in cost.\n  * Greater Healing is renamed to Heal Self and moved to 3*.\n  * Lesser Healing is removed.\n* Cheibriados permits berserk while suppressing the extra speed. \n  * Cheibriados now slows poison on worship and grants bend time at 1*.\n* Ashenzari's passive trap protection and item identification is moved to 1*.\n* The Shining One now gives Divine Shield at 1* and Cleansing Flame at 3*.\n## Interface and Options \n\n* WebTiles now has a clickable action panel, similar to the local tiles inventory panel. This UI element by default shows tactically-relevant consumables, and comes with a number of configuration options (see the various action_panel... options, or right-click on the X).\n* Mutation descriptions can now be inspected in the mut(A)tion menu.\n* Most abilities now have targeters (similar to spell targeters). These are configurable via the force_ability_targeter option, and spell targeter configuration is moved to force_spell_targeter.\n* Many improvements to menus and popups: \n  * Arrow key navigation and selection is available in many more menus. This can be disabled with the new option menu_arrow_control for the classic roguelike experience. Shift-arrows replace arrows as the binding to scroll by a single line. (Console users: not all terminals support these keycodes on default settings.)\n  * The quiver menu has a mode that uses hotkeys from the items/spells/abilities it is showing.\n  * The stash search menu more clearly differentiates items that can be traveled to, and has a number of interface improvements. The closest (travelable) search result is always available via the enter key.\n  * Description popups have been improved and actions in these popups are now activatable using the mouse on webtiles.\n  * Improvements and bugfixes to many other menus.\n* WebTiles mouse support is expanded.\n* WebTiles supports virtual keyboards on touch devices, configurable via the tile_web_mobile_input_helper option. There have also been a number of improvements to rendering on touch devices. (Caveat: these changes are aimed at tablets, not phones.)\n* Console: \n  * A new console option bold_brightens_foreground=force lets bold be applied to bright foreground colors even in 16-color mode.\n  * A popup accessible via&nbsp;! in the help screen shows current terminal and console settings, and attempts to indicate misconfiguration. (PuTTY users may find this particularly helpful.)\n* A small number of options are automatically saved across games based on their value in the relevant in-game user interface. These include default_manual_training, quiver_menu_focus (for the new quiver menu modes), and several of the action panel settings, which can be edited by right-clicking on the panel close button.\n* On MacOS local games, a game menu option will reveal the rc file in the Finder.\n* The inventory-full autopickup prompt now has an \"(A)lways ignore\" choice.\n* Webtiles chat can be closed, as well as opened, via F12.\n## Items \n\n* New item type: orbs, occupying the shield slot. \n  * Orbs give no SH and impose no shield penalty, but always come with an ego.\n  * Orb egos are all new: \n    * Light: a radius 3 halo.\n    * Wrath: *Rage (20% chance to berserk on melee hit).\n    * Mayhem: chance to frenzy a monster in sight after a kill, causing them to wildly attack friends and foes alike ala the Discord spell.\n    * Guile: reduces Will by ++ for both the wearer and those they try to hex.\n    * Energy: gives a source of passive channeling, which gives a chance to refund the MP of a cast spell and a chance to backfire. Backfires cause confusion or Int drain. Scales with Evocations.\n* New glove ego: infusion, spending 1 MP per melee hit to add extra damage.\n* New unrand: the +3 Mad Mage's Maulers {Infuse+∞ RegenMP Int-3}. These use all available MP to give proportional bonus damage to a melee hit.\n* New unrand: the dreamshard necklace {*Dream}. On receiving a lethal or near-lethal hit, the dreamshard necklace shatters, averting the blow, healing the player, releasing dream allies, and fog. Otherwise does nothing.\n* New \"early-game\" unrandarts, unlikely to appear after the early game: \n  * Delatra's gloves. These gloves heal the wearer for drinking unknown potions and give the wearer MP for reading unknown scrolls.\n  * The woodcutter's axe is a vorpal +8 war axe that always swings at 10 aut regardless of skill and speed modifiers.\n  * The staff of the Meek is a +7 quarterstaff of protection that gives extra AC when below 55 HP.\n  * Throatcutter is a +7 long sword of draining with a 1/3 chance to instantly kill foes that are below 21 HP.\n* Shields and armour: \n  * Shield penalties scale linearly with skill, completely disappearing at skill 27. The size of the penalty depends on the shield's encumbrance rating and species size factors.\n  * Shields are no longer affected by Str, only Dex.\n  * Armour and shields no longer impose to-hit penalties.\n* Riposte is removed from long blades and base damage is increased.\n* The skill requirements for minimum delay for executioner's axes and bardiches are reduced to 24; for triple swords the requirement is reduced to 22.\n* *Rage now causes berserk on 20% of hits. This chance stacks linearly among items and with the berserkitis mutation. Certain unrands grant a higher chance.\n* Evokable berserk is removed as an artefact property.\n* The generation of throwing ammunition is reduced.\n* Wand generation is reduced.\n* The electrocution brand triggers 25% less often.\n* One '+' of regen is reduced to 0.8 HP/turn (was 1.0 HP/turn).\n* MPRegen amulets are buffed to 0.4 MP/turn (was 0.25 MP/turn).\n* The archery ego is renamed to 'hurling' and now only applies to throwing.\n* Unrandart tweaks: \n  * The staff of Battle now triggers the battlesphere on melee hits (in addition to the usual spell trigger).\n  * The robe of Clouds' thunder cloud ability is now passive, placing storm clouds on enemies within range 2 each turn.\n  * Leech no longer has *Rage, and now has Harm and Drain.\n  * The necklace of bloodlust now gives a 50% chance to go berserk on hit.\n  * The Zealot's sword now gives a 20% chance to go berserk on hit (up from 5%).\n* The hat of the bear spirit gives a 20% chance to go berserk on hit, increases the bonus HP from going berserk, and reduces the slow duration after. It no longer has rN+.\n* The ring of the Mage is now a ring of Wizardry and Archmagi.\n* The autumn katana loses Clarity and gains a chance to manifold assault on hit.\n* The glaive of Prune turns the wielder into a prune when paralysed, petrified, or asleep, halving the damage received for the duration.\n* Lear's Hauberk is reduced to +18 (was +27).\n* The trident of the Octopus King loses +Will.\n* Wucad Mu now counts as 1.5 sources of channeling. This means it is 1.5x as likely to refund MP and the probability of backfiring is reduced.\n* The robe of Misfortune loses Contam and Drain.\n## Monsters \n\n* New unique: Mlioglotl. A unique horror with the power to corrupt the level, changing terrain and summoning other abyssal horrors, as well as cause fear. Appears in the S-branches and rarely in the abyssal lair end.\n* New Hell monsters (with subbranch): \n  * Wendigo, collapses simulacra into painful iceblasts (Coc)\n  * Nargun, hits hard and petrify (Coc)\n  * Quicksilver elemental, with antimagic and quicksilver bolts (Dis)\n  * Crystal echidna, throws barbs and crystal bolts (Dis)\n  * Creeping inferno, which explodes into a Fire Storm (Geh)\n  * Stoker, keeps at range and calls creeping infernos (Geh)\n  * Searing wretch, a hard hitting fighter that strips fire resistance (Geh)\n  * Tainted leviathan, a giant with a ring of miasma and mesmerise (Tar)\n  * Putrid mouth, a ghost with poisonous melee and miasma breath (Tar)\n* New Spider monsters: \n  * Pharaoh ants are undead that drain and bind souls on death.\n  * Steelbarb worms are fast, regenerate, resist fire and apply barbs in melee.\n  * Jorogumo are tough, ensnare, cast bolt of draining and have hornet poison melee.\n  * Broodmothers summon spiders and bite to summon spiders.\n  * Culicivora join spider packs with a vampiric bite and heal other.\n  * Sun moths are holy with a single tile halo, sticky flame, and energy bolt.\n  * Radroaches are armoured roaches that cast irradiate, greatly contaminating the player.\n* New monsters: walking tomes, which summon living spells that cast themselves at the player. Appear in Depths and the Tukima's Studio wizlab.\n* Demonspawn warmongers' Sap Magic effect now causes a short term -Cast after casting a spell.\n* All derived undead retain their reach, constriction, and trample attacks.\n* Red Devils now apply barbs on hit, instead of hopping back.\n* Wretched Stars only apply one temporary mutation per use of corrupting pulse, and use the spell less often.\n* Demonic and holy monsters are now susceptible to fear, berserk, alistairs intoxication, and ballistomycete spores.\n* Monsters have a chance to break a door permanently when opening it. This chance is higher if the mosnter is berserk.\n* Classed draconians have a fixed colour per job.\n* When Dowan dies Duvessa goes berserk permanently; when Duvessa dies Dowan gains haste permanently.\n* If Jiyva dies Dissolution's summon eyeballs is replaced with a cantrip.\n* Kills by and of player-frenzied monsters now grant XP.\n* Ironbound Beastmasters are removed.\n## Spells \n\n* Kills by summoned allies now grant full experience.\n* Spell summon caps are reduced: \n  * Summon Small Mammal, Summon Hydra, and Monstrous Menagerie are capped at 2.\n  * Haunt is capped at 8.\n  * All other summon spells except Summon Horrible Things and Dragon's Call are capped at 1.\n* New spell: Summon Cactus Giant (L6 Summonings).

Burns adjacent creatures, then when channeled by hitting '.' (like Searing Ray), repeatedly hits enemies in an increasing radius.\n* New spell: Enfeeble (L7 Hexes). Enfeeble irresistibly applies weakness and antimagic to a single foe. Targets that fail a Willpower check are also dazed and blinded.\n* New spell: Anguish (L4 Hexes/Necromancy). All enemies in sight must pass a Will check or gain the new Anguished status effect. Whenever Anguished monsters deal damage, they take the same amount of damage right back.\n* Yara's Violent Unravelling can now unravel summons, killing them immediately and turning them into explosions. It is now smite targeted.\n* Inner Flame is now smite targeted.\n* Corpse Rot now scales with spell power, placing more clouds per corpse and reaching up to range 2 with sufficient clouds.\n* Death Channel now works on demonic and holy creatures. It also now works on corpseless living creatures.\n* Metabolic Englaciation has a minimum slow duration when successful.\n* Eringya's Noxious Bog now places a bog under the caster, as well as on cells with only one adjacent wall.

This can be disabled with the new option menu_arrow_control for the classic roguelike experience. Shift-arrows replace arrows as the binding to scroll by a single line. (Console users: not all terminals support these keycodes on default settings.)</li>\n<li> The quiver menu has a mode that uses hotkeys from the items/spells/abilities it is showing.</li>\n<li> The stash search menu more clearly differentiates items that can be traveled to, and has a number of interface improvements. The closest (travelable) search result is always available via the enter key.</li>\n<li> Description popups have been improved and actions in these popups are now activatable using the mouse on webtiles.</li>\n<li> Improvements and bugfixes to many other menus.</li></ul></li>\n<li> WebTiles mouse support is expanded.</li>\n<li> WebTiles supports virtual keyboards on touch devices, configurable via the tile_web_mobile_input_helper option.

(PuTTY users may find this particularly helpful.)</li></ul></li>\n<li> A small number of options are automatically saved across games based on their value in the relevant in-game user interface. These include default_manual_training, quiver_menu_focus (for the new quiver menu modes), and several of the action panel settings, which can be edited by right-clicking on the panel close button.</li>\n<li> On MacOS local games, a game menu option will reveal the rc file in the Finder.</li>\n<li> The inventory-full autopickup prompt now has an \"(A)lways ignore\" choice.</li>\n<li> Webtiles chat can be closed, as well as opened, via F12.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Items\">Items</span></h2>\n<ul><li> New item type: orbs, occupying the shield slot.\n<ul><li> Orbs give no SH and impose no shield penalty, but always come with an ego.</li>\n<li> Orb egos are all new:\n<ul><li> Light: a radius 3 halo.</li>\n<li> Wrath: *Rage (20% chance to berserk on melee hit).</li>\n<li> Mayhem: chance to frenzy a monster in sight after a kill, causing them to wildly attack friends and foes alike ala the Discord spell.</li>\n<li> Guile: reduces Will by ++ for both the wearer and those they try to hex.</li>\n<li> Energy: gives a source of passive channeling, which gives a chance to refund the MP of a cast spell and a chance to backfire.

Otherwise does nothing.</li>\n<li> New \"early-game\" unrandarts, unlikely to appear after the early game:\n<ul><li> Delatra's gloves. These gloves heal the wearer for drinking unknown potions and give the wearer MP for reading unknown scrolls.</li>\n<li> The woodcutter's axe is a vorpal +8 war axe that always swings at 10 aut regardless of skill and speed modifiers.</li>\n<li> The staff of the Meek is a +7 quarterstaff of protection that gives extra AC when below 55 HP.</li>\n<li> Throatcutter is a +7 long sword of draining with a 1/3 chance to instantly kill foes that are below 21 HP.</li></ul></li>\n<li> Shields and armour:\n<ul><li> Shield penalties scale linearly with skill, completely disappearing at skill 27.

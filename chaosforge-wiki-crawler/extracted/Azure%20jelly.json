{"title":"Azure jelly","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Azure_jelly","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | jellies}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Azure jellies''' are some of the most dangerous jellies in the game, moving quickly and hitting very hard (they can deal 30-88 [[cold]] damage per turn on top of their physical damage). Although they lack the ability to corrode your equipment with [[acid]] like most jellies, their raw damage output makes them one of the most likely jellies to kill unprepared characters. They can be found in [[the Slime Pits]], [[Cocytus]], or near [[Jiyva]] [[altar]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Even without acid, they can consume [[door]]s, so don't expect to hide behind one when you meet azure jellies outside of [[the Slime Pits]].\n*High [[AC]] and rC++ or better negates most of their ability to harm you. If you're lacking either, going into melee with them is going to hurt. Take them out at range, preferably with [[fire]] damage.\n*Azure jellies are one of the possible creatures that can appear after [[the Royal Jelly]] takes damage. If you lack cold resistance, these should absolutely be your highest priority... unless you also lack acid resistance, in which case you probably shouldn't be there at all.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], azure jellies had [[electricity resistance]]."}

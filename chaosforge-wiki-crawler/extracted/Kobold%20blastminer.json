{"title":"Kobold blastminer","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Kobold_blastminer","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|kobolds}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Kobold blastminers''' are ranged monsters that wield an [[arbalest]] (or rarely, a [[hand cannon]]) and carry a shoulder cannon. They can pelt you with bolts from afar, or if you get in range, fire a devastating [[Bombard]]. They appear in the [[Orcish Mines]], usually in pairs.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Try to stay far away, since Bombard is their stronger source of damage. Bombard is a range 4 spell, so stay 5 tiles away or more.\n**Melee characters will find blastminers hard to deal with. Since Bombard knocks the caster backwards, it is hard to approach these monsters. Try to use ranged attacks if you have them.\n*They have low [[willpower]], so [[Hexes]] and hex [[wand]]s can work well. A [[wand of polymorph]] deserves special mention, since it'll remove their arbalest and cannon at the same time. Their HD isn't amazing, either, so [[Mephitic Cloud]] can also do the trick.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], this monster was added to the game."}

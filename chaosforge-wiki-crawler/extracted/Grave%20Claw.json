{"title":"Grave Claw","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Grave_Claw","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Grave Claw''' is a smite-targeted level 2 [[Necromancy]] spell that does physical damage and inflicts the Bind [[status effect]] on a target. The target will be unable to move for 2-4 turns, although this effect doesn't prevent [[blink]]ing.\n\nThe player can have up to 3 charges of Grave Claw. Each of these charges takes a random 4-6 living deaths to recharge. When the player first memorises the spell, they gain one charge of it immediately.\n\n[[Necromancer]]s and [[Hedge Wizard]]s start with this spell in their library. \n\n==Useful Info==\n\n==Strategy==\nThis spell has limited uses but deals good, irresistible damage, and cannot be dodged or blocked. It is therefore best saved for dangerous creatures. \n\nNecromancers and Hedge Wizards may wish to use it against [[undead]] or poison-resistant creatures, for which their other spells may not work. \n\nCasting this spell on a monster adjacent to you and then moving away will reliably allow you to create a gap.\n\n==History==\n*Added in [[0.32]] as a replacement level 2 spell following the removal of [[Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot]]. [[Necromancer]]s and [[Hedge Wizard]]s start with this spell in their library."}

{"title":"Protean progenitor","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Protean_progenitor","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{list of|giants}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Protean progenitors''' are primordial, [[chaotic|unstable]], and giant monsters. On their own, they are fast, hit hard, regenerate very quickly and cast [[Irradiate]]. On death, they will split into [[#Aspiring flesh|aspiring flesh]]. They appear in the [[Realm of Zot]] and the domain of [[Mnoleg]], usually in pairs.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Protean progenitors are essentially more dangerous [[Orb Guardian]]s that appear in pairs. Try to fight them individually.\n*Try not to remain in melee range with them for too long, or you could end up severely [[contamination|contaminated]].\n*Due to their very fast regeneration, if you disengage from a battle with them for even a short amount of time they will likely have recovered back to full health.\n*Protean progenitors are vulnerable to [[silver]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n\n==Aspiring flesh==\n{{monster info|aspiring flesh}}\n\nWhen a protean progenitor dies, it splits into 2-4 '''aspiring flesh'''.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|mon-death.cc|1335}}</ref> After a few turns, an aspiring flesh will transform into a permanently [[haste]]d and [[might]]ed copy of a given monster.\n*Aspiring flesh transforms one at a time. The first aspiring flesh takes 2-4 turns to transform. Each flesh thereafter takes 1-2 turns longer than the previous.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|mon-death.cc|1376}}</ref>\n*All aspiring flesh from the same progenitor will turn into the same type of monster. This monster is determined when the progenitor dies. (\"For just a moment, the protean progenitor begins to look like <[[foo|monster]]>, then it explodes!\") The more [[HD]] said monster has, the less flesh is created. The HD of chosen monsters is around 12, but can vary greatly ([[scorpion]]s have been seen to spawn from them.)\n*Aspiring flesh can be killed to prevent the monsters from being created.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Aspiring flesh can be difficult to destroy in the few turns that it exists for. Try not to focus on it if there are other threats nearby.\n*Take note of what monster will spawn from the aspiring flesh. Hasted and mighted [[bunyip]]s are nothing to scoff at, even for Zot characters.\n**They can turn into just about any [[natural]] monster, so watch out for odd interactions. For example, they can turn into an [[eye of devastation]], which can strip your willpower as you're next to a [[dread lich]].\n*You can use [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]] or a [[wand of quicksilver]] to remove the haste and might from aspiring flesh-created monsters.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], protean progenitors could [[see invisible]]. Also introduced in this version was the ability to see what the aspiring flesh will turn into simply by inspecting one.\n*In [[0.31]], protean progenitors and aspiring flesh were introduced.\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

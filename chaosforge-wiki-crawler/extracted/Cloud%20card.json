Note that this is not guaranteed to break line of sight to a lone target.\n\nIt is found in the following [[Decks|decks]]:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.15]]\n![[0.16]]\n![[0.17]]\n![[0.18]]\n![[0.19]] and beyond\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of destruction|Destruction]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n|----\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n==History==\n* Prior to [[0.25]], the Cloud card surrounded enemies with a variety of damaging clouds instead of smoke.\n* In the simplification of decks in [[0.19]], the Cloud card was one of 23 cards to be kept, now appearing only in the deck of escape.\n\n* Prior to 0.16, it would simply disperse a number of flame clouds or freezing vapours anywhere in sight (except ontop of players and allies), the number dependent on card power level.\n\n* The Cloud card was introduced in [[0.15]] as a repurposing alteration of [[Flame card|the Flame]] card, which was eliminated. \n* In [[0.15]] the cloud card used to surround enemies with clouds of either fire or cold. \n\n{{cards}}\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

{"title":"Tordak Nalest, Mountain Dwarf Fighter of Okawaru","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tordak_Nalest,_Mountain_Dwarf_Fighter_of_Okawaru","type":"raw","data":"{{diary}}\n\nThe following journal entries were found tucked inside a suit of dwarven scale mail for sale in Ysitap's Armor Emporium, located on level four of the dungeon.\n\n'''Entry One - My manifesto'''\n\nTordak I am, Nalest is my home!  I have studied the ways of war under some of the finest Mountain Dwarf masters!  I am prepared to destroy all resistance between me and the Orb of Zot!  Once I have recovered the Orb Mountain Dwarves across the realm will be revered and respected!  No more elves and their condescending attitudes!  No more foul-smelling orcs with their shoddy equipment!   No more humans and their annoying averageness!  DWARVES SHALL RULE AND I SHALL BE THEIR SUPREME MASTER!\n\n'''Entry Two - THOU SHALT NOT RESIST!'''\n\nI began my journey today, armed with a fine dwarven hand axe and some incredibly comfortable dwarven scale mail.  With my trusty dwarven buckler slung across my arm, I descended boldly into the dungeon.  I am bold, much bolder than most dwarves.  I am certain I am destined to find the Orb.  What others call luck is, in reality, skill.  I skillfully acquired a teleport scroll and a healing potion within steps of entering the dungeon.  I am sure I do not need to elaborate on what happened to the bat, hobgoblin, and kobold, all of whom challenged me simultaneously.  These fools hang out on the upper parts of the dungeon, undoubtedly searching for easy elf or spriggan prey.  I am certain word will get out about the fearsome dwarf chopping his way effortlessly through the dungeon.  If they were smart the beasts would just drop any fine equipment they are hoarding in an easy to find location and hide until I've moved on.\n\n'''Entry Three - Where did all this junk come from?'''\n\nKobolds are incredibly dumb.   I played hide and go seek with one for a while, only to see how long he'd chase me around trying to throw his lame darts.   Turns out it was quite a while, but I mercifully reduced him to a steaming corpse and picked up what remaining darts he had.  I am starting to think all these tales of treasures to be found in the dungeon are ridiculous nonsense.   So far in the first three levels I've found a cursed ring that I got rid of immediately, a couple rings of ice, and some stupid scrolls that serve no real purpose.  Let's not forget the potion that poisoned me, or the other one that left me extremely confused.  I'm starting to believe that dwarves claim that the dungeon is full of treasure hoping that other dwarves will go hunting it and never come back, leaving their wives available for the taking.   Fortunately I am not married.  If I was, you can bet that bearded tart would be on a leash following me right into the dungeon. \n\n'''Entry Four - Okawaru, my heart cries out for thee'''\n\nLo, I have discovered within eyesight of the stairwell the entrance to the mystical Ecumenical Temple.  Within its diamond-shaped interior I found an altar of he who shall guide me on my quest - the mighty Okawaru.   As Okawaru is eternally wise, he quickly recognized my importance and accepted as his disciple.\n\nUpon return to the dungeon I discovered a bunch of jealous orcs, including an orc priest and an idiot magic-user who turned invisible and started annoying me with magic darts.  Concerned about their unfair tactics, I teleported away and planned my tactical ambush.  The teleport scroll was faulty, probably the result of elven crafstmanship, and I ended up teleporting basically to the next room.  It didn't take long for the orcs to realize this and start firing their stupid magic darts at me.   I must admit... I was slightly concerned for a bit since I lacked any healing potions.   I read my last teleport scroll, which dropped me next to an upward stairway.  I went up and rested before coming back down in search of those orcs.   Orcish blood will flow when I find them.\n\n'''Entry Five - Why orcs should be relegated to the fields.'''\n\nIt turns out that apparently level four is some sort of orc party area.  In addition to a bunch of idiot casters and priests, and the occasional ordinary useless orc, I stumbled across a big fat, half-naked orc named Blork, who apparently is smart enough to figure out how to haste himself.  I have a feeling this jerk is going to be a challenge.   As I write this I am currently hiding on the other side of level four, which I accessed by going up one staircase and down another.   I found a shop near the second entrance to level four, but Ysitap has nothing worthwhile in his armor shop.  Perhaps these orcs bought it all."}

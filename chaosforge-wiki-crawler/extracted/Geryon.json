{"title":"Geryon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Geryon","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Geryon''' is a powerful [[demon]] who serves as the guardian of [[the Vestibule of Hell]]. Any character entering there will immediately encounter Geryon and his horde of allies. He carries the [[horn of Geryon]], and he will sound it regularly to summon demonic [[hell beast]]s to his aid.\n\n[[File:Horn of geryon.png|Horn of Geryon]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Although Geryon is somewhat dangerous on his own due to his high HP and decent melee abilities, the greater threat comes from the other monsters he shares the Vestibule with, including numerous [[hell knight]]s, [[undead]], and assorted [[demon]]s. Geryon cannot use stairways, but you can lure away the other inhabitants of the Vestibule so you can get a clear shot at Geryon.\n*Geryon's attacks have reach, allowing him to hide behind his wall of hell beasts and still mangle you. Even high-level melee fighters will need to keep this from happening to avoid fighting an impossible war of attrition. The fact that hell beast attacks often [[trample]] you, pushing you in unintended directions around the battlefield, does not help. Make sure you have a [[scroll of blinking]] ready in case you get shoved away from the entrance.\n*Although [[silence]] does not stop demonic spell casting, it ''does'' disable his horn. Hit him with a [[scroll of silence]] to stop the flood of reinforcements.\n*Once in your possession, the horn becomes a powerful evocable item, summoning hell beasts to your aid. Just be aware that they are not always friendly, and that followers of [[good gods]] are forbidden from using it.\n\n==Trivia==\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geryon Geryon] was a Greek giant formed from three enormous bodies fused together. He was slain by Heracles when the [[demigod]] was completing his tenth labour, which required him to steal Geryon's cattle.\n\nLater, Geryon became a monstrous gatekeeper of Hell in Dante's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy Divine Comedy], dwelling in a waterfall between the seventh and eighth circles of Hell.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.14]], sounding his horn was necessary in order to open the gates to the four other branches of [[Hell]], making Geryon the only monster one absolutely must kill in order to win a perfect 15-rune game. Additionally, Geryon was unable to fly."}

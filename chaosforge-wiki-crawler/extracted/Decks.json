{"title":"Decks","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Decks","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n''Deck items have been removed. For info regarding 'decks' still in the game, see [[Cards]]. \n{{flavour|A deck of powerful magical cards painted in the ichor of demons. They may have any number of helpful or dangerous effects when drawn.}}\n\n==Overview==\nDecks are magical devices granted by [[Nemelex Xobeh]] which are used by e'''V'''oking them, similar to [[wand]]s. This draws a random [[Cards|card]] from the deck to produce a certain effect.  Each deck comes with 4-13 cards. Their power is governed by [[Invocations]] skill and piety, not [[Evocations]].\n\n===Power level===\nDecks can be either plain, ornate or legendary. Ornate and legendary decks get bonuses to card power.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! Plain || Ornate || Legendary\n|-\n| [[File:Deck.png]] || [[File:Deck 2.png]] || [[File:Deck 3.png]]\n|}\n\n===Composition of decks===\nDecks of destruction, summoning and escape are composed of 6 different types of card which are randomly placed throughout the deck. The player will only draw from the deck of punishment if they try to deal four on a deck with less than four cards remaining, or when suffering from Nemelex's wrath.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n!rowspan=1|Deck\n!colspan=1|[[Deck of destruction|Destruction]]\n!colspan=1|[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!colspan=1|[[Deck of summoning|Summoning]]\n!colspan=1|[[Deck of punishment|Punishment]]\n|----\n!Cards\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Degeneration card|Degeneration]]\n<br>[[Orb card|the Orb]]\n<br>[[Pain card|Pain]]\n<br>[[Storm card|the Storm]]\n<br>[[Vitriol card|Vitriol]]\n<br>[[Wild Magic card|Wild Magic]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Cloud card|the Cloud]]\n<br>[[Elixir card|the Elixir]]\n<br>[[Exile card|Exile]]\n<br>[[Shaft card|the Shaft]]\n<br>[[Tomb card|the Tomb]]\n<br>[[Velocity card|Velocity]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Dance card|the Dance]]\n<br>[[Elements card|the Elements]]\n<br>[[Foxfire card|Foxfire]]\n<br>[[Illusion card|the Illusion]]\n<br>[[Pentagram card|the Pentagram]]\n<br>[[Rangers card|the Rangers]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Famine card|Famine]]\n<br>[[Swine card|the Swine]]\n<br>[[Torment card|Torment]]\n<br>[[Wraith card|the Wraith]]\n<br>[[Wrath card|Wrath]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.23]], decks existed as items instead of being available via [[Nemelex Xobeh]]'s [[ability|abilities]].\n*In [[0.19]], decks were greatly simplified. Prior to this version:\n** Decks could randomly be found on the floor, instead of being Nemelex only.\n** A [[scroll of identify]] could be used to reveal both the deck type and the current top card. \n** Many decks were removed.\n*** '''Archetype Decks''' were a list of cards that weren't used by the player, but were used to compose physical decks. They included the deck of [[deck of battle|Battle]], [[deck of destruction|Destruction]], [[deck of emergency|Emergency]], [[deck of oddities|Oddities]], [[deck of punishment|Punishment]], [[deck of summoning|Summoning]], [[deck of transport|Transport]], and [[deck of wonders|Wonders]]. All concept of archetype decks were removed (the 4 post-0.19 decks all had archetypes, but they also had a corresponding physical deck too).\n*** '''Physical Decks''' were the decks you actually got. They used either one archetype deck (\"pure\" decks), or a mix of archetypes. Removed physical decks include the deck of [[deck of changes|Changes]], [[deck of defence|Defence]], [[deck of oddities|Oddities]], [[deck of war|War]], and [[deck of wonders|Wonders]].\n**There were also many more cards that existed. The full list of removed cards can be found on the [[Cards]] page.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], players had to '''w'''ield the deck that they wished to draw from.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n{{Cards}}\n[[Category:Deck]]\n[[Category:Items]]"}

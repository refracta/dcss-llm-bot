{"title":"Call Canine Familiar","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Call_Canine_Familiar","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Call Canine Familiar''' is a level 3 [[Summonings|Summoning]] spell which summons a mystical canine to your aid.\n\n==Useful Info==\nSummons an [[inugami]], or supports it if one is already present.\n\nHigher spellpower increases the summon's stats directly, rounded in a weighted manner:<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|ghost.cc|751}}</ref>\n*[[HD]] = <code>3 + power/15</code>\n*[[HP]] = <code>14 + power/4</code>\n*[[AC]] = <code>5 + power/10</code>\n*Melee damage = <code>5 + power/6</code>\n\nDuration of the summon is around 81 turns ([[duration class]] 5); it does not depend on spell power.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-summoning.cc|174}}</ref>\n\nThere is a summon limit of 1 inugami. Casting the spell while an inugami is present will heal it for <code>5 + power/5</code> to <code>9 + power/5</code> HP, and cause it make a [[cleaving]] attack immediately (in addition to its regular turn).<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-summoning.cc|201}}</ref>\n\nIf the inugami dies (not counting expiry or [[Abjuration]]), you cannot cast this spell again for 13-21 turns.\n\n==Strategy==\n*The inugami is a fast, reliable ally. You can't summon multiple dogs in a row, but they are significantly better at combat than the earlier Summoning spells.\n*If the inugami dies, you can use other summoning spells and/or [[kiting]] to stall out time.\n*This is the only spell in the [[Summoner]] starting book that summons an ally with [[see invisible]]. At the least, it's decent at dealing with early [[sky beast]]s and [[unseen horror]]s.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|recasting the spell will increase the dog's duration by 6-9 turns, but only if your summon has less than 11 turns of the duration left.}}\n*In [[0.31]], this spell was reworked. Prior to this version:\n**Instead of an inugami, you could summon either a [[hound]], [[wolf]], or [[warg]]. To decide, a random value within <code>power Â± 10</code> was chosen; if 60 or more, a warg was summoned, if 40 or more, a wolf was summoned. Therefore, reaching 30 power and 50 power were relevant breakpoints.\n**Recasting the spell did not cause the summon to heal or make an attack, and you could cast the spell again if the summon died.\n**The [[duration class]] ranged from 2 (around 18 turns) to 6 (around 171 turns); the formula was <code>2 + (1d<power> - 1) / 4</code> (capped at 6).\n*Prior to [[0.14]], this spell could also summon [[jackal]]s and its summon cap was 3.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

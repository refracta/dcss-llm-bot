It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\nDespite its ridiculous concept, the rare '''double sword''' is a desirable weapon for any Long Blades user looking to wear a [[shield]]. It has roughly the same stats as an [[eveningstar]], though Long Blades scale with [[dexterity]] rather than [[strength]].\n\nUnlike the [[demon blade]], the double sword is two-handed for [[Kobold]]s and [[Spriggan]]s.\n\n==Strategy==\n===Compared to demon blades===\nOn most species, [[demon blade]]s are mostly equivalent to double swords. If both weapons are at minimum delay, a +0 demon blade is 1% stronger than a +0 double sword against a 0 AC opponent. As the demon blade attacks faster, it is penalized more by [[AC]], though it benefits more from [[slaying]] and [[auxiliary attack]]s. \n\nOverall, the differences are too small to make an impact. A +9 demon blade is enough to win you the game, as is a +9 double sword. Generally, the sword you get ''first'' should be the sword that you use. (The sword you get first can benefit first from [[scrolls of enchant weapon]]).\n\nFor smaller species, the demon blade will usually come out ahead, because it does not use the shield slot.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Double_sword.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Double_sword2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Double_sword3.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Sword of Zonguldrok]] || [[File:Sword_of_zonguldrok.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Singing Sword]] || [[File:Singing sword.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Maxwell's Thermic Engine]] || [[File:Maxwells thermic engine.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Double swords had [[riposte]] and 14 base damage in [[0.19]], then back to 15 damage and no riposte in [[0.28]].\n*Double swords were renamed to [[bastard sword]]s in [[0.14]], then back to double swords in [[0.16]].\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Long blades]]"}

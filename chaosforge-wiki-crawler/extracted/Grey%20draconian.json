They only appear in [[Wucad Mu's Monastery]] and in certain [[vault]]s, such as in the entrance of [[Zot]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Grey draconians are perhaps the easiest of the draconians. Their amphibious nature rarely comes into play in the Realm of Zot, and their bonuses in melee combat don't amount to much. [[Freezing]] [[brand]]ed weapon will help make combat against them even easier.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.17]], grey draconians spawned with the other draconian types."}

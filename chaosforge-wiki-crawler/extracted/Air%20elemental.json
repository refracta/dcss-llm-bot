{"title":"Air elemental","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Air_elemental","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of|elementals}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Air elementals''' are beings of animated wind. Fast and [[ev]]asive, they are capable of dealing moderate physical damage. More threatening is their [[Stunning Burst]], which can cause a 1-turn [[paralysis]]. Stunning Burst ignores [[willpower]], though it can be [[ev]]aded, and rElec has a 50% chance to prevent the paralysis.\n\nMonsters can summon them using the [[Summon Air Elementals]] spell, and sometimes they will be found following [[spriggan air mage]]s. Otherwise, you typically find them in the [[Elven Halls]], [[the Abyss]], the [[Cloud Mages' Chambers]], and certain air- or wind-themed [[vault]]s. You can summon them yourself by invoking [[Qazlal]]'s Elemental Force when storm clouds or clouds of [[fog|smoke]] are visible.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Even one turn of paralysis can be deadly if it happens when you're standing next to a pack of monsters. At the very least, retreat to a corridor when encountering air elementals, and try to limit their lines of fire.\n*Stunning Burst pierces through enemies. This means that air elementals can fire through monsters immune to electricity, such as [[dancing weapon]]s, [[earth elemental]]s, and other air elementals.\n*With high [[EV]] and low [[AC]], attacks that never miss (such as [[Airstrike]]) can work well.\n**A [[tin of tremorstones]] can also be effective, since it has high accuracy.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], air elementals had [[Vortex]] (a lesser version of [[Tornado]]) instead of Stunning Burst, and were resistant to the Tornado spell.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], air elementals had [[:Category:Wind resistance|wind resistance]] instead of [[:Category:Tornado resistance|tornado resistance]]; notably, this also gave them immunity to [[Airstrike]].\n*Prior to [[0.21]], air elementals did not have [[Vortex]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], air elementals could dissipate, effectively [[submerging]] themselves in air, only to reform a few turns later."}

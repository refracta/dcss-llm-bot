{"title":"Background","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Background","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\nA '''background''' (also known as a '''class''') is your character's occupation, i.e. what they have learned prior to entering the [[Dungeon]]. Your background determines your starting [[skills]], stats, [[items]], and (in the case of religious backgrounds) your [[god]]. \n\n==Backgrounds & Difficulty==\nAs one might expect, some backgrounds are easier than others, or at least easier to learn. New players should try out [[Berserker]] and [[Fighter]]. Berserker starts with [[Trog]]'s [[berserk]] ability, while Fighters enter with better-than-average weapon and armour, including a [[shield]]. If you would rather play a mage, try a [[Conjurer]].\n\n==Classes in ''Crawl''==\nAn important difference between ''Crawl'' and many other roguelikes (and indeed other video game RPGs) is that your background is only your ''starting package'', not an advancement path that is set in stone. \n\n''Crawl'' was  designed to give you a lot of flexibility with how your character develops as they grow, and it does this by giving you a free hand to distribute your experience between your skills however you see fit. Your chosen background has no direct impact on this; it only gives you a starting point to move forward from. Your choice of [[species]], however, will make certain skills easier to learn than others, and your background helps determine your starting [[stats]], perhaps making certain play styles more viable than others.\n\nFor example, your [[Fighter]] could potentially learn [[spell]]s until they look more like a [[Hedge Wizard]], build up their [[Stealth]] and [[Dodging]] until they're basically a [[Brigand]]... or just keep bashing monsters, wearing heavy armour, and becoming a more talented Fighter. As a Fighter, your high [[strength]] may not contribute as much to these alternate paths as high [[intelligence]] or [[dexterity]] would, but the choice is there.\n\n==List of backgrounds==\nThere are currently 25 different backgrounds in ''Dungeon Crawl'', with many others removed. More information can be found on the pages for each individual background.

This can be dangerous (although not directly fatal) for [[species]] with very low stats, since reaching zero or less in a stat will cause [[stat zero]] penalties. The lost stats will recover over time as [[experience]] is gained. [[Xom]] is somewhat amused if you quaff an unidentified potion of degeneration, but this is hard to do intentionally.\n\n{{crawlquote|There was something very wrong with that liquid!}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.18]], the potion lowered a random stat by 1-4 instead of decreasing every stat by 1-3.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], having a stat reduced to 0 could cause [[stat death]]. This was replaced by the [[stat zero]] penalties.\n\n{{potions}}"}

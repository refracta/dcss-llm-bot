If you think a page is up to date, make sure to add [Template:version013](/Template:Version013 \"Template:Version013\") (i.e. {{version013}}) to the page.\n- Secondly, articles tagged with [Category:Crystal Ball Articles](/Category:Crystal_Ball_Articles \"Category:Crystal Ball Articles\") should be removed from the category after being updated (unless they refer to 0.14 or trunk material). There may be some sentences that need to be changed from future to past tense.\n- Finally, there is [new artwork](/Category:013_Tiles \"Category:013 Tiles\") that needs to be updated as (lower priority). Instructions are in the link.\n\n### Contributors\n\n- [Flun](/index.php?title=User:Flun\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"User:Flun (page does not exist)\")\n- [Sildraith](/User:Sildraith \"User:Sildraith\")\n- [CommanderC](/User:CommanderC \"User:CommanderC\")\n- [Ion Frigate](/index.php?title=User:Ion_Frigate\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"User:Ion Frigate (page does not exist)\")\n- [MoogleDan](/User:MoogleDan \"User:MoogleDan\")\n- [Jebus](/index.php?title=User:Jebus\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"User:Jebus (page does not exist)\")\n- *Add name here*\n\n## 0.13 Changelog\n\n### 0.13 highlights\n\n***\n\n- ~~A new race: [Gargoyles](/Gargoyle \"Gargoyle\").~~\n- ~~- A reimagined [Skald](/Skald \"Skald\") background.- A thorough rework of the monster set in [Crypt](/Crypt \"Crypt\").- Improvements to many evokable items.~~\n  ~~A new item: [sack of spiders](/Sack_of_spiders \"Sack of spiders\").~~\n- Massively overhauled layout generators.\n- ~~[Summonings](/Summonings \"Summonings\") school: per-spell limits and no stair following or pulling.~~\n- New [Sprint](/Sprint \"Sprint\") map: linesprint.\n\n### Branches, environment\n\n***\n\n- A new Sprint map: \"|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\" by st (otherwise known as linesprint).\n- ~~[Branches](/Branch \"Branch\") now have exactly one exit stair (except [the Dungeon](/The_Dungeon \"The Dungeon\"), which can, but is not guaranteed, to have more).~~\n- Many new layouts have been added to most branches, including unique layouts for branches that didn't have them; and numerous tweaks and improvements to existing layouts.\n- [Vaults](/Vault \"Vault\") can now be placed at the centre of some layouts prepared to accept them there.\n- ~~All [portal](/Portal \"Portal\") vaults entrances that time out are now announced.~~\n- ~~- [Temple](/Temple \"Temple\") overflow [altars](/Altar \"Altar\") can now contain multiple altars.- New [shop](/Shop \"Shop\") type: gadget shops, which sell evokable items.- Mechanical [traps](/Trap \"Trap\") do not spawn outside of vaults.~~\n  ~~[Zot trap](/Zot_trap \"Zot trap\") effects are now only a subset of the full set of miscasts, and have some new unique effects - draining of [wand](/Wand \"Wand\") charges and Word of Recall (as per [ironbrand convokers](/Ironbrand_convoker \"Ironbrand convoker\")).~~\n\n### Character\n\n***\n\n- ~~A new race: [Gargoyles](/Gargoyle \"Gargoyle\"), with low natural [HP](/HP \"HP\") but an impressive host of resistances and the ability to [fly](/Fly \"Fly\") at XL14.~~\n- ~~~~\n  ~~[Sludge elves](/Sludge_elves \"Sludge elves\") are no more.~~\n- The [Skald](/Skald \"Skald\") background gets a reworked [spell book](/Spell_book \"Spell book\") with four new spells:\n  - ~~[Infusion](/Infusion \"Infusion\") grants additional melee damage costing MP with each strike;~~\n    ~~- [Song of Slaying](/Song_of_Slaying \"Song of Slaying\") grants an incremental slaying bonus with every monster killed (of sufficient threat level);- [Spectral Weapon](/Spectral_Weapon \"Spectral Weapon\") creates an allied spectral clone of your weapon which strikes enemies in melee when you do.- [Song of Shielding](/Song_of_Shielding \"Song of Shielding\") has a similar effect to [spirit shield](/Spirit_shield \"Spirit shield\"), trading [HP](/HP \"HP\") loss for [MP](/MP \"MP\") loss.~~\n- ~~- [Priests](/Priest \"Priest\") are no more.- The [nausea](/Nausea \"Nausea\") [status effect](/Status_effect \"Status effect\") from eating contaminated [chunks](/Chunk \"Chunk\") has been removed; contaminated chunks now give less nutrition for characters that can't handle them.- [Stabbing](/Stabbing \"Stabbing\") skill is no more; stabs now depend upon the average of the character's [stealth](/Stealth \"Stealth\") and weapon skill.- The [Traps](/Traps \"Traps\") skill is no more; all characters detect traps as though they had (XL/3) Traps skill.- [Chaos knights](/Chaos_knight \"Chaos knight\") start with a +0 [chaos](/Chaos \"Chaos\") weapon instead of a +2 normal weapon.~~\n  ~~New tier 2 [demonspawn mutation](/Demonspawn_mutation \"Demonspawn mutation\") - \"magic shield\", giving [spirit shield](/Spirit_shield \"Spirit shield\") at level one, improved magic regeneration at level two, and regenerating mana in place of health as a function of current magic level at level three.~~\n- Deaths to [acid](/Acid \"Acid\"), self-targetting, and [sticky flame](/Sticky_flame \"Sticky flame\") now credit the appropriate monster/spell.\n- ~~[Draining a stat to zero](/Stat_death \"Stat death\") can no longer directly kill the player; instead, further stat drain damages the player.

If you think a page is up to date, make sure to add [Template:version013][12] (i.e. {{version013}}) to the page.\n* Secondly, articles tagged with [Category:Crystal Ball Articles][13] should be removed from the category after being updated (unless they refer to 0.14 or trunk material). There may be some sentences that need to be changed from future to past tense.\n* Finally, there is [new artwork][14] that needs to be updated as (lower priority). Instructions are in the link.\n### Contributors \n\n* [Flun][15]\n* [Sildraith][16]\n* [CommanderC][17]\n* [Ion Frigate][18]\n* [MoogleDan][19]\n* [Jebus][20]\n* _Add name here_\n## 0.13 Changelog \n\n### 0.13 highlights \n\n- - -\n\n* A new race: [Gargoyles][21].\n* A reimagined [Skald][22] background.\n* A thorough rework of the monster set in [Crypt][23].\n* Improvements to many evokable items.\n* A new item: [sack of spiders][24].\n* Massively overhauled layout generators.\n* [Summonings][25] school: per-spell limits and no stair following or pulling.\n* New [Sprint][26] map: linesprint.\n### Branches, environment \n\n- - -\n\n* A new Sprint map: \"|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\" by st (otherwise known as linesprint).\n* [Branches][27] now have exactly one exit stair (except [the Dungeon][28], which can, but is not guaranteed, to have more).\n* Many new layouts have been added to most branches, including unique layouts for branches that didn't have them; and numerous tweaks and improvements to existing layouts.\n* [Vaults][29] can now be placed at the centre of some layouts prepared to accept them there.\n* All [portal][30] vaults entrances that time out are now announced.\n* [Temple][31] overflow [altars][32] can now contain multiple altars.\n* New [shop][33] type: gadget shops, which sell evokable items.\n* Mechanical [traps][34] do not spawn outside of vaults.\n* [Zot trap][35] effects are now only a subset of the full set of miscasts, and have some new unique effects - draining of [wand][36] charges and Word of Recall (as per [ironbrand convokers][37]).\n### Character \n\n- - -\n\n* A new race: [Gargoyles][21], with low natural [HP][38] but an impressive host of resistances and the ability to [fly][39] at XL14.\n* [Sludge elves][40] are no more.\n* The [Skald][22] background gets a reworked [spell book][41] with four new spells: \n  * [Infusion][42] grants additional melee damage costing MP with each strike;\n  * [Song of Slaying][43] grants an incremental slaying bonus with every monster killed (of sufficient threat level);\n  * [Spectral Weapon][44] creates an allied spectral clone of your weapon which strikes enemies in melee when you do.\n  * [Song of Shielding][45] has a similar effect to [spirit shield][46], trading [HP][38] loss for [MP][47] loss.\n* [Priests][48] are no more.\n* The [nausea][49][status effect][50] from eating contaminated [chunks][51] has been removed; contaminated chunks now give less nutrition for characters that can't handle them.\n* [Stabbing][52] skill is no more; stabs now depend upon the average of the character's [stealth][53] and weapon skill.\n* The [Traps][54] skill is no more; all characters detect traps as though they had (XL/3) Traps skill.\n* [Chaos knights][55] start with a +0 [chaos][56] weapon instead of a +2 normal weapon.\n* New tier 2 [demonspawn mutation][57] - \"magic shield\", giving [spirit shield][46] at level one, improved magic regeneration at level two, and regenerating mana in place of health as a function of current magic level at level three.\n* Deaths to [acid][58], self-targetting, and [sticky flame][59] now credit the appropriate monster/spell.\n* [Draining a stat to zero][60] can no longer directly kill the player; instead, further stat drain damages the player.

they also come with a band of [vampires][81].\n  * [Rotting hulks][82] are now [plague shamblers][83], capable of inflicting a \"[retching][84]\" [status effect][50] that prevents food consumption; they generate a [cloud][85] of [miasma][86] on death.\n  * [Spectral things][87] move at their full base monster speed.\n  * [Deep dwarf death knights][88] gain slightly better attack power and starting equipment, and now come with a band of [undead][89].\n  * [Flying skulls][90] get a slight HP boost and a larger attack power boost.\n  * [Ghouls][91] inflict [rot][92] half as often.\n  * [Curse skulls][93] are capable of out-of-LOS movement, similar to [wandering mushrooms][94], but preferring to place themselves where a player needs to move the most to actually reach them.\n  * New monster: [revenants][95], possessing a ghostly fireball attack and capable of creating clouds of ghostly flame, which do not harm undead and occasionally summon spectral things.\n  * New monster: [lost souls][96], who sacrifice themselves to heal nearby undead creatures or assume the shape of a nearby killed living creature; they can be summoned by [deep elf death mages][97].\n  * [Necromancers][98] don't come with [necrophages][99], but do come with [simulacra][100].\n  * [Unborn deep dwarves][101] are now just [unborn][102].\n  * New monster: [jiangshi][103], who move in short burts (like [sixfirhies][104]) and possess a [vampiric][105] melee attack.\n* New [forest][106]-themed monsters: \n  * [Spriggan assassins][107] and [spriggan enchanters][108], who attempt to disable the player with [blowguns][109] and [hexes][110] respectively before moving in for the kill.\n  * [Fauns][111], who hex the player before attacking from afar, and their larger brethren [satyrs][112], who can empower their nearby allies.\n  * [Dryads][113], who can awaken the forest and summon vines to pull their enemies closer to trees.\n** [Wind drakes][114], who can breathe powerful blasts of wind and [airstrike][115] the player. \n\n* * [Thorn lotuses][116], plants adrift on the water that pepper the player with thorns fired from afar.\n  * [Thorn hunters][117], who fire volleys of thorns and create briar patches to impede their foes' movements.\n  * [Spirit wolves][118], who can howl to summon additional spirit wolves at periodic intervals.\n  * [Ancient bears][119], a bear to rival a dire elephant with fire resistance.\n  * [Water nymphs][120], who can teleport their target to their home water area and strike down the player with said water.\n  * [Treants][121], slow-moving, tough plants home to a nest of wasps.\n* Other new monsters: \n  * [Tengu reavers][122], skilled with both steel and spells;

the spell set with sticky flame has been removed.\n  * [Gloorx Vloq][185]: \n    * No longer has [Invisibility][186] as an emergency spell.\n* Speed adjustments to several monsters: \n  * Speed 8: [spiny worms][187], [snapping turtles][188], [guardian mummies][189] (all previously speed 9).\n  * Speed 10: [jellies][190] (previously 9).\n* [Shadows][191] can now turn invisible, allowing them to move faster and land a guaranteed stab attack on enemies.\n* The retribution effect for killing an [apis][192] now inflicts [Weakness][131] on the player, instead of healing nearby hostiles.\n* [Giant fireflies][193] can now signal nearby awake monsters in a manner similar to shouting.\n* [Vault wardens][194] can seal stairways in addition to doors.\n* [Zombies][195] no longer appear excessively out of depth in the early dungeon.\n* Orb run monster spawns no longer include weak monsters, and now include [Orb Guardians][196].\n* Monster actions are now taken in order of speed, rather than any given monster taking all of its actions at once.\n* Removed monsters: \n  * [Laboratory rats][197].\n  * [War dogs][198] (replaced by [wolves][199] with essentially matching stats).\n  * [Deep dwarf scions][200], [deep dwarf necromancers][201], and [deep dwarf artificers][202].\n  * [Deep elf soldiers][203].\n  * A large number of vault-specific monsters.\n* Imps and other weak monsters no longer appear in [Pandemonium][204].\n* [Nergalle][205] appears earlier in the dungeon.\n* [Lamia][206] no longer comes with a band of minions.\n* Creatures other than natural creatures can now be [frenzied][207]; this causes them to attack anything in sight. The [berserking][208] effect of frenzy (might and haste effects) is limited to natural creatures.\n### Spells \n\n- - -\n\n* New spells: \n  * [Searing Ray][209], a level 2 conjuration replacing [Force Lance][179] in the [Book of Conjurations][210] that deals damage over several consecutive turns.\n  * [Discord][211], a level 8 [Hexes][110] spell that attempts to [frenzy][212] all monsters in sight.\n* [Summon Small Mammals][213] now only ever summons one mammal, and is renamed to [Summon Small Mammal][214] as a consequence.\n* 100% of teleports on the orb run are delays (up from 50%).\n* [Haunt][215] adjustments: \n  * Summons now fixate on their target.\n  * [Flayed ghosts][74] are no longer summoned.\n  * Friendlies are no longer targettable.\n* [Olgreb's Toxic Radiance][216] now [poisons][217] continuously over several turns (and deals impact damage); it also ignores the caster's poison resistance (if any).\n* [Dragon Form][218] is pure [Transmutations][219] (was Tmut/Fire for all but [Draconians][220]).\n* [Force Lance][179] is now level 5 (was level 2), with boosted range and damage to match.\n* [Fulminant Prism][221] now caps at 200 spellpower.\n* [Swiftness][144] can be cast in water; it doesn't operate in water, but it grants the status (which operates as expected when out of the water).\n* [Summonings][25] caps are introduced. This acts on a per-spell basis, each spell has a fixed numerical limit for the number of summons active at any time. Going over this limit means your oldest summons will expire in a very short number of turns. Applies only to non-necromantic non-permanent summons.\n* Temporary summons will no longer follow the player down stairs.\n* Temporary summons expire when the player moves to a different level.\n### Items \n\n- - -\n\n* The elemental evocation items have been reworked: \n  * All no longer depend on elemental magic skill or nearby terrain, can summon multiple elementals, and have an XP-based recharge timer.\n  * The [lamp of fire][222] fires up to three trails of flame in a given direction.\n  * The [fan of air elementals][223] is now the [fan of gales][224], and blows back nearby enemies.\n  * The [stone of earth elementals][225] is now the [stone of tremors][226]; it causes rubble to fall from nearby rock, stone, or permarock walls to damage creatures adjacent to them, and has a chance to [shaft][227] creatures;\n  * A new elemental evoker item - the [phial of floods][228]; it generates a wave of water which temporarily leaves a pool of water behind, and summons [water elementals][124].\n* The dependence of armour penalties on strength has been adjusted; there are no longer magic strength numbers for lowest possible penalties.\n* Potions of gain &lt;ability&gt; have been replaced by [potions of beneficial mutation][229], which grant the player a single beneficial mutation.\n* the [Scroll of vorpalise weapon][230] is now called [Scroll of brand weapon][231], and can rebrand weapons that already have a permanent brand affixed.\n* the [Scroll of immolation][232] has been reworked to [Inner Flame][233] everything in [LOS][234].\n* [Lear's chain mail][235] is now [Lear's hauberk][236] - a +27 [chain mail][237] that covers all armour slots other than [shields][238] and [cloaks][239].\n* The [staff of energy][240] eliminates 100% of spell hunger again, and includes the now-gone [staff of channeling][241] as well.\n* The [staff of power][242] scales with your maximum magic power.\n* [Box of beasts][243] has been reworked: \n  * Has a fixed, random number of charges between 5 and 15 inclusive.\n  * 1/3 chance to fail on usage with no bad effects.\n  * When successful, generates a [chimera][244]; a new monster with three heads. Each head can be a different beast, picked from a list which provides better/stronger beasts at higher [Evocations][245] skill. The heads determine the attacks and abilities available to the monster.\n* New \"[sack of spiders][24]\" item: \n  * Fixed charges between 5 and 15 inclusive.\n  * On evoking, creates [webs][246] around you and releases [spiders][247].\n  * Number of webs and type/number of spiders scales with evocations.\n* [Splint mail][248] has been removed; [chain mail][237] is now 8 AC to compensate.\n* [Needles][249] of [sickness][250] have been removed.\n* [Manuals][251] do not need to be read to be activated; they're always on while in inventory.\n* The [rod of striking][252] now functions as a melee weapon - it expends charges to deal additional damage in melee.\n* [Boots][253] of [running][254] have a -1 movement delay (was -2).\n* The [lantern of shadows][255]' rate of shadow spawning scales with evocations, and the resulting shadows now wander instead of following the player.\n* New unrand: the +4 [moon troll leather armour][256] {Spirit MP+5 Regen}.\n* Adjustments to unrands: \n  * [Arga][257] is now a [broad axe][258].\n  * [Bullseye][259] is now a [large shield][260].\n  * The [shield of the Gong][261] no longer has [guardian spirit][262]; it is otherwise unchanged.\n  * The [knife of Accuracy][263] and [boots of the Assassin][264] are no more.\n  * The [lightning scales][265] are now +6 (was +3).\n* [Hammers][266] do not generate outside of vaults.\n### Gods \n\n- - -\n\n* [Yredelemnul][267] no longer gifts [rotting hulks][82] / [plague shamblers][83].\n* [Hill orcs][268] encountering an [orc priest][269] for the first time are offered the chance to convert to [Beogh][270] on the spot.\n* [Zin][271]'s Recite no longer paralyses the player; the player can take any action that doesn't involve the mouth while reciting.\n### Interface \n\n- - -\n\n* For online play, explore_delay and travel_delay are instananeous by default.\n* Dungeon features with variable-colour tiles now display those colours in tiles (e.g. walls in the Abyss, the Elven Halls, and the Pan disco hall).\n* Examining a monster will display the spells monsters of its type are capable of using.\n### Technical \n\n- - -\n\n* A port to OpenSolaris (Dyson/Illumos).\n* MSVC compilation once again possible (Visual Studio [Express] 2012)\n&lt;/s&gt; \n\n\n\n[0]: #Project_goals\n[1]: #Contributors\n[2]: #0.13_Changelog\n[3]: #0.13_highlights\n[4]: #Branches.2C_environment\n[5]:

{"title":"Pikel","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Pikel","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{list of|kobolds}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Pikel, Merchant of Souls''' is a [[unique]] [[kobold]] who has a number of [[lemure]]s under his command. He is dangerous on his own, wielding an enchanted [[whip]] of [[flaming]] (40% chance), [[freezing]] (40%), or [[electrocution]] (20% chance, and by far the most dangerous). With the help of his thralls, he is more than a match for most low-level characters. If you can manage to kill him, however, his slaves will be freed and will leave the Dungeon.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:4-9\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you intend to face him in melee, don't allow any of his lemures to reach you; he does enough damage on his own. Facing him in a hallway or luring him upstairs helps.\n*Confusion through [[Mephitic Cloud]] can easily disable both him and his thralls, often with lethal results.\n*Successfuly using a [[wand of charming]] on him will free his captured souls, despawning any lemures in the process. See the history for more details.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Pikel was known as '''Pikel the Slaver'''.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Pikel had human [[slave]]s instead of lemures. When Pikel died or was [[wand of enslavement|enslaved]] himself, the slaves would be freed and turn neutral.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], he could only spawn with a whip of flaming or electrocution.\n\n[[Category:Kobold]]"}

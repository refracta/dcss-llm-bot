As a precaution in case of detection, it also bears enchantments allowing the wearer to make a hasty retreat under cover of fog.\n\n----\n\n“so long suckers! i rev up my motorcylce and create a huge cloud of smoke. when the cloud dissipates im lying completely dead on the pavement”\n\n-wint, @dril Twitter.

Slow weapons with high base damage (like [[heavy]] weapons) can largely ignore the slaying penalty, but [[quick blade]] users may prefer a plain cloak, and most weapons lie somewhere in between. The clouds can potentially allow you to ignore all threats that are not within a 2 tile radius of you, making it easier to escape from ranged enemies. However, this is not reliable, and they can just as easily prevent you from blinking away from a dangerous monster that is already in melee. Clouds also make ranged options less viable, so this cloak is better for melee builds that don't mind the -2 slaying penalty.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|the cloak will give noise suppression instead of a passive ability to generate clouds on hit. The effect will be equivalent to the [[Noise Dampening]] mutation, but won't stack with it. Also, the enchantment will be lowered from +2 to 0, and the Slay penalty will be removed.}}\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the cloak of the Thief generated clouds by evoking it, rather than automatically when the wearer is injured.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], this cloak only penalized damage (-3), not accuracy, and provided a slightly higher stealth bonus.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], this cloak provided small bonuses to [[EV]] and [[dexterity]], as well as evocable [[invisibility]] and [[levitation]], but lacked the fog effect.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], the -3 damage [[slaying]] penalty was much more severe, as slaying bonuses and penalties were multiplied by your skills.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Cloaks]]"}

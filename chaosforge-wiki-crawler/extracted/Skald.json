Unique to the highlands in which they originate, these spells and formulae are second nature: they can either inspire greatness in themselves and their allies, or fear in the hearts of their enemies.}}\n'''Skalds''' are warriors who use magical [[Charms]] to bolster their fighting skills. Because heavy armour hinders spellcasting, many of them prefer lighter armour than more traditional [[Fighter]]s.\n\n==Preferred Races==\n[[Halfling]], [[Centaur]], [[Merfolk]], [[Draconian]], and [[Vampire]] are the recommended races if you pick a Skald Background.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+1 [[weapon of choice]] ([[hand axe]], [[spear]], [[short sword]], [[falchion]] or [[mace]], or [[unarmed]])\n*+0 [[leather armour]]\n*[[Book of Battle]]\n*[[Ration]]\n\n===Available Spells===\n*[[Infusion (spell)|Infusion]]\n*[[Shroud of Golubria]]\n*[[Song of Slaying]]\n*[[Ozocubu's Armour]] \n*[[Spectral Weapon]] \n\nSkalds start with the [[Infusion (spell)|Infusion]] spell memorised.\n\n==Starting Skills==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Fighting]]: 2\n*Chosen Weapon's Skill: 2\n*[[Armour]]: 1\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Spellcasting]]: 2\n*[[Charms]]: 3\n\nChoosing Skald adds 3 to your starting [[Strength]], 5 to your starting [[Intelligence]] and 4 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nSkald is a 'hybrid-melee' start; they'll often prefer lighter armour than your typical melee, but have a number of buff spells to make up for it. Like with other backgrounds, it is only a start - it's perfectly reasonable to go heavy armour and abandon Spellcasting (either for a while or for the rest of the game).\n\nSkalds often prefer to start with [[Polearms]], so that Spectral Weapon can take advantage of its reaching.\n\nSpecies/Gods that work well with Skald:\n*[[Merfolk]] - Merfolk are perfect for [[Dodging]] and Charms-based melee play, and have a +4 Polearms aptitude to boot.\n*[[Okawaru]] - A strong melee god in general. Heroism eases up your skill training, and gifts are always nice to have.\n*[[Kiku]] - Necromancy is a different spell school entirely, but it fits well for a hybrid-style character. The 3* gift can contain Excruciating Wounds, taking advantage of both Necromancy and Charms.\n\n===Spell Strategy===\n[[Infusion (spell)|Infusion]] adds extra damage, but this damage is reduced by [[AC]]. It'll help you against early [[adder]]s, [[gnoll (monster)|gnolls]], and [[ogre (monster)|ogres]], but does almost nothing against armoured targets like [[orc warrior]]s.\n\n[[Spectral Weapon]] is the main bread and butter of Skald. It gives an immense boost of power - nearly doubling your attack output. Try to learn it quickly, even if it means not learning your other spells first.\n\n[[Shroud of Golubria]] is a useful defensive spell to keep up whenever you enter into dangerous melee combat. [[Ozocubu's Armour]] further increases your defense, but it ends if you move, and it only works if you have light armour. Both are worth casting, at least if you get the skill to use Spectral Weapon.\n\n[[Song of Slaying]] creates significant [[noise]], attracting monsters to your location... but it gives a significant [[slay]] bonus. Use it in hallways or other chokepoints, where groups are more manageable.\n\nKeep an eye out for [[Swiftness]], a useful escape spell.\n\n==History==\n*Skalds were removed in [[0.26]], along with the [[Charms]] spell school.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], skalds' starting [[book of Battle|book]] had [[Regeneration]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], skalds started with 20 [[gold]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], skalds started with +0 weapons, a [[book of War Chants]], and couldn't select falchions.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], skalds were known as '''crusaders'''.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], crusaders used the [[Enchantments]] school of magic.\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]\n[[Category:Obsolete backgrounds]]"}

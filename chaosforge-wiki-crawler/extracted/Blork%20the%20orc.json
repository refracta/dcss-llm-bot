{"title":"Blork the orc","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Blork_the_orc","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Blork the orc''' is a unique [[orc]]ish spellcaster who can cast a few low-level [[Conjurations]] and buff himself significantly. He occasionally spawns with a strong weapon, like a [[battleaxe]] or [[glaive]].\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:4-6\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Blork is basically a beefier [[orc wizard]]. He has more attack spells and [[Haste]], but lacks [[Confuse]]. Because he can haste himself, it's more difficult to run away. Otherwise, unless he spawns with a big weapon, you can treat him like a strong orc wizard.\n*If you worship [[Beogh]], he may join you as a follower.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Blork the orc is a reference to Mork from Ork, a rainbow-suspenders-wearing alien from the 70's television show \"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mork_%26_Mindy Mork & Mindy]\".\n*If you [[polymorph]] him, his name will change accordingly (e.g. he might become Blork the [[centaur]]).\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Blork the orc will become '''Blorkula the orcula''', a vampire that splits into multiple randomly-colored vampire bats when he dies. Additionally:}}\n**He will gain the [[Sting]], [[Sandblast]], and [[Shock]] spells. [[Cantrip]] and [[Magic Dart]] will be removed from his spell list.\n**He will gain a second attack with the vampiric [[attack flavour]].\n**He will spawn in D:5-8 instead of D:4-6.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], he could cast [[Invisibility]] when low on health.\n\n[[Category:Orc]]"}

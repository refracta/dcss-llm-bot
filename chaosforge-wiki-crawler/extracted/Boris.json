{"title":"Boris","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Boris","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|liches}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Boris, Master of Life and Death''' is a [[unique]] [[lich]], armed with a variety of powerful [[Conjurations]]. Although he's generally less dangerous than an [[ancient lich]] or [[dread lich]], he generates early enough to be a serious threat. \n\nUnlike other uniques, Boris can generate multiple times in one game. If killed (and has not yet reappeared), he has 16.7% chance of appearing on (almost) any new floor you explore (in the place of a regular hostile monster).<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|mon-place.cc|3125}}</ref> \n\n==Location==\n*[[The Elven Halls]]:3\n*[[The Depths]]\n*[[The Vaults]]\n*[[The Crypt]]\n*[[The Tomb]]\n\nBoris will also occasionally appear among the enemies that spawn during the [[orb run]]. If you have the Orb, he will gain permanent [[haste]] and [[brilliance]] effect.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Boris is capable of one- or two-shotting careless characters. If you aren't confident you can handle him, run. Thankfully, he doesn't have [[haste]].\n*Like all liches, Boris is weak to [[Silence]] and [[antimagic]], but immune to most [[hexes]].\n*Players can [[kite]] Boris if they have [[Potion of haste|potions of haste]]; of his spells, only Orb of Destruction has full screen range, which you can dodge.\n*The clouds of excruciating misery created by March of Sorrows will devastate players without [[negative energy resistance]]. If you don't resist them, step out of them as soon as possible!\n*To avoid Orb of Destruction, you can move out of the way, [[Blink]], and/or create [[summon]]s. You can create your own OOD to negate it, but this creates an extremely loud [[noise]]. You can also get into melee range - staying in melee greatly reduces the strength of the orb.\n*He lacks any summoning or area-of-effect spells, meaning that your own high-level summons should be able to bring him down. In addition, your summons will shield you from [[Iron Shot]] and [[Orb of Destruction]].\n* '''Don't kill Boris.''' If you want to avoid encountering him again and again, just leave him where he is and he won't bother you again until you return to his floor. However, should you enter [[Pandemonium]] or the [[Ziggurat]] after Boris has been killed but before he has reappeared, you will have a 16.7% of meeting him on every Pan/Zig level (even if you left him alive on a previous Pan/Zig level). In any case, Boris can ''not'' reappear in: [[The Depths]], [[The Vaults]], [[The Tomb]], [[The Crypt]].<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|mon-place.cc|3133}}</ref> \n<!-- What about a temporary portal, like Wizard's Lab?  -->\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although never explicitly stated in game, examination of flavor text reveals that he once had a powerful [[artefact]] [[dagger]] called [[Morg]] and a familiar named [[Natasha]]. Reuniting him with his lost possessions doesn't have any special effect, however.\n*Boris and Natasha together are a reference to the characters from \"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Rocky_and_Bullwinkle_and_Friends The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends]\".\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Boris will drop a [[randart]] [[robe]] each time you kill him.}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Boris had [[Invisibility]] in place of [[March of Sorrows]]. He also spawned on fewer floors and didn't appear in the [[Elven Halls]] at all.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Boris did not gain buffs if you had the Orb.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Boris would not spawn as part of the orb run.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

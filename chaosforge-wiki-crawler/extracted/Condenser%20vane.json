When evoked these clouds form around hostile monsters near the user. The quantity and lethality of these clouds increases with Evocations skill. At low power it will create noxious fumes, and as power increases this gives way to roaring flames, freezing vapours, and poisonous gas. At the highest tiers of power storm clouds, acidic fog and clouds of negative energy become available.}}\n\nA '''condenser vane''' is evoked to engulf every monster in sight as well as the 8 squares surrounding it with semi-random [[cloud]]s.\n\nThis item is [[alternate items|mutually exclusive]] with the [[tin of tremorstones]]. Like with other miscellaneous evocables, only 1 condenser vane (or tin of tremorstones) will spawn in a given game.\n\n==Useful Info==\nEvoking the vane will create dangerous [[cloud]]s around monsters, chosen randomly. Each tile can get a different type of cloud. These include, in ascending order of power:\n\n*[[Cloud#Noxious fumes|Noxious Fumes]]\n*[[Cloud#Poison|Poisonous Gas]]\n*[[Cloud#Flame|Flame]] / [[Cloud#Freezing vapour|Freezing Vapour]]\n*[[Cloud#Negative energy|Negative Energy]]\n*[[Cloud#Thunder|Thunder]]\n*[[Cloud#Acidic fog|Acidic Fog]]\n\nYour [[Evocations]] skill determines not only the type of clouds, but also their number and duration.\n\nFor each square adjacent to at least one enemy, or containing an enemy, you have a <code>(25 + 3.5*[[Evocations]]) / 1.2</code>% chance<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|evoke.cc|826}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|evoke.cc|760}}</ref> to create a cloud on that square (max. 99.6%; min. 1 cloud total). However, the condenser vane will never create a cloud on top of you or your [[allies]]. Each time you use the condenser vane, the clouds will be all the same.\n\nIf you are worshipping a [[good god]] and you get clouds of negative energy, your god will suppress these clouds and you will not waste a charge of the vane.\n\nThe condenser vane expends itself after one use; it can be recharged by gaining experience.\n\n==Strategy==\nSince the condenser vane works very much like the spell [[Ignition]] does, it is best used when you are facing a (large) group of enemies with restricted room to maneuver: the density of monsters will create a carpet of clouds, at least at high Evocations. The entrance to [[Vaults]]:5 is an obvious one, as are [[Ziggurat]] floors.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*At low HP, [[Monster intelligence|intelligent]] enemies won't willingly walk through clouds (unless they're already on top of one). A [[potion of attraction]] can pull them in. Combining this with [[Silence]] can make the end vault of [[Elven Halls|Elf]]:3 a whole lot safer.\n*In a [[killhole]], the only valid tile will be the one the monster's standing on, thus guaranteeing a cloud on top of them.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], the condenser vane was less likely to spawn clouds. Also, for every use, all the clouds would be of the same type.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the condenser vane would always spawn a 3x3 area of clouds around each monster, regardless of Evocations skill. It could spawn negative energy clouds even if you were worshipping a good god. Also, it did not  [[alternate items|alternate]] with the [[tin of tremorstones]].\n*The condenser vane replaced the [[wand of clouds]] in [[0.26]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Evocables}}"}

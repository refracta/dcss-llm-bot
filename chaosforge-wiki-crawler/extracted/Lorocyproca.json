{"title":"Lorocyproca","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lorocyproca","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Lorocyprocas''' are innately [[invisible]] [[tier-2 demon]]s that sneak up on you and damage both [[HP]] and [[MP]] with their [[antimagic]] branded attacks. Although they aren't terribly durable, finding them in the first place can be a challenge, and any caster that lets them get into melee range will regret it. They can be found in [[the Abyss]] and [[Pandemonium]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Lorocyprocas are just one of many reasons to keep up the [[see invisible]] intrinsic whenever you're somewhere demon-infested.\n*Once they get within a few tiles of you, casters should treat them like [[eyes of draining]]; don't conserve your MP if the alternative is letting a monster simply take it away.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|lorocyprocas will be removed from the game.}}\n*Prior to [[0.10]], lorocyprocas were slightly slower than average and had an unbranded attack.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

It carries with it some of the corrosive malice of the Iron City of Dis.}}\n\n[[File:Orb of Dispater.png]] '''''the orb of Dispater'''''\n\n[[Orb]]<br>\nProvides an ability to launch [[damnation]]<br>\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Corrode (3%)<br>\n+5 AC<br>\n[[Evil]]\n\n==Mechanics==\nThe orb gives you an '''a'''bility to cast [[Hurl Damnation]]. However, it comes at a cost to [[HP]] and [[MP]]:\n\n{{crawlquote|'''Spell Power''': [[Evocations]]×8<br>'''Damage''': 3d(8+Spell Power/5)<br>'''Cost''': 10% HP, 4 MP <br>'''Restrictions''': You cannot use this ability if you are under the effects of [[Death's Door]].}}\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''orb of Dispater'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|350}}</ref> is a special orb that can only be obtained by defeating [[Dispater]], lord of the [[Iron City of Dis]]. \n\nVery few things can resist damnation damage (it's mainly just the [[demon]]s that use damnation themselves), making this orb a useful weapon against all manner of end-game monsters. Damnation ignores [[AC]], [[EV]], and all other resistances, meaning it's great at finishing off monsters or dealing with tough monsters.\n\nOf course, by the time you've defeated Dispater, you'll have most likely found a great [[shield]], [[orb]], or two-handed weapon. Therefore, this orb faces heavy competition for the shield slot. You'll often want to keep what you were already using.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.30]], this item was introduced, replacing the [[staff of Dispater]]. Compared to the staff, it gains the *Corrode property and +5 AC.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Orbs]]"}

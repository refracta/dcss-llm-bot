{"title":"Parghit","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Parghit","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|trolls}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Parghit the Mighty''' is an unusually strong [[unique]] [[troll (monster)|troll]]. Along with claws that surpass even [[Tiamat]], he has an ''astonishing'' +27 HP / turn regeneration, [[large rocks]], and highly enchanted [[gold dragon scales]] (a 1% of being the [[scales of the Dragon King]]).\n\nParghit is an alternate version of [[Pargi]]. If Pargi has spawned during a game, then Parghit won't spawn.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Depths]]: 3-4\n*[[Realm of Zot]]: 1-4\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Burst damage is the name of the game, at least if you're fighting Parghit head-on. Users of elemental spells should not hesitate to resort to their finest assets, such as [[Shatter]] or [[Fire Storm]]. Those who rely on necromantic allies can send in high damage swarmers with [[Infestation]], and those who prefer [[Summonings]] can resort to [[Malign Gateway]]. Characters dabbling in [[Alchemy]] may possess [[Sculpt Simulacrum]] allowing Parghit to die clawed by icy clones of himself.\n*While Parghit has fairly high [[willpower]], a [[scroll of vulnerability]] can make it reasonable for [[Hexes]] or status [[wand]]s to disable him. Once his will has been lowered, you can follow up with a spell, [[wand of paralysis]], or [[wand of polymorph]], negating almost all of his massive defenses.\n*Parghit can't see [[invisible]], so [[stab]]ber and melee fighters can go invisible to gain a significant advantage.\n*Melee brutes should not rush in and try to outcompete the regeneration by sheer strength. Self-buffing with [[Might]], [[Haste]] and relevant god [[invocations]] is practically mandatory.\n\n==History==\n*Parghit was introduced in [[0.29]].\n\n[[Category:Troll]]"}

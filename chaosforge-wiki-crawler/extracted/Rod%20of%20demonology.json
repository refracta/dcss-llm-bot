[[Call Imp]] can create several weak but willing minions capable of taking down [[jellies]], [[mummy (monster)|mummies]], and other opponents you'd rather not face yourself. [[Summon Demon]] generates significantly more powerful allies, useful well into the late game, but be aware that these will occasionally arrive hostile. Fortunately, the [[rod]]'s final spell ([[Abjuration]]) is perfectly suited for sending unfriendly summons back to whence they came. While [[Call Imp]] is effective even without significant [[Evocations]] training, the other two spells are best avoided until you've gotten some skill under your belt.\n\nAlthough this rod is considered [[evil]] by the [[good god]]s, they don't mind if you use it for [[Abjuration]].\n\n==History==\nThe rod of demonology was removed in [[0.14]]."}

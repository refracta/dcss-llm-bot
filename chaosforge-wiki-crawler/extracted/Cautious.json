{"title":"Cautious","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cautious","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{stub}}\n\nIf an '''M_CAUTIOUS''' monster doesn't opt to cast a spell that turn (or use a wand, reaching attacking, etc.) but had a valid spell it ''could'' have cast, and is not already in melee range of something, it has a 2/3 chance to wait in place instead of moving forward. It's similar to having a [[cantrip]] that the monster won't ever use in place of attacking.\n\n*[[:Category:Cautious monsters|List of cautious monsters]]\n\n==History==\n*This flag was added in [[0.32]], intended mostly for [[Beogh|orc apostle wizards]].\n\n[[Category:Cautious monsters|*]]\n[[Category:Monster flags]]"}

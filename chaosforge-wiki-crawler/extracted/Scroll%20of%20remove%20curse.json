It will not remove the curse from any items sitting in your inventory; you will need to equip them first before using it.\n\n{{crawlquote|You feel as if something is helping you.}}\n\n==Strategy==\n*A scroll of remove curse lets you test [[armour]], [[weapon]]s, and [[jewellery]] without the risk of being stuck with cursed gear. Try to save up several item types to test at the same time, as one scroll can uncurse any number of equipment slots. Keep in mind that certain [[amulet]]s and some [[artefact]]s can possess [[properties]] that can negatively affect the player when an item is removed!\n*Worshippers of [[Ashenzari]] can consume a scroll of remove curse to place a curse upon an item of their choosing.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], [[curse]]s were globally removed, removing the need to remove curse.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], the player could use [[scroll of enchant armour|scrolls of enchant armour]] and [[scroll of enchant weapon|enchant weapon]] to remove curses.\n{{scrolls}}"}

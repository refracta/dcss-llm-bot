Unlike a permanently distortion-branded weapon, the affected weapon may still be safely unwielded. It will not affect artefact weapons.}}\n\n'''Warp Weapon''' is a Level 5 [[Charms]]/[[Translocations]] spell that temporarily gives the player's wielded melee weapon the [[distortion]] [[brand]]. Unarmed attacks and ranged weapons are unaffected. The weapon can harmlessly be unwielded, removing the temporary brand.\n\n[[Felid]]s are unable to wield a weapon, so are unable to use this spell.\n\n==Strategy==\nDistortion is quite a powerful brand on fast weapons like [[Short Blades]] or [[demon whip]]s, as its bonus damage and ''10%'' banishment chance ignores how much damage you actually did. This comes without having to worship [[Lugonu]] or putting up with terrible miscast effects, but with a somewhat large XP investment.\n\nYou will occasionally cause your foes to blink around or teleport away, but the high damage output and chance of banishment make these weapons very deadly regardless. Try using it against annoyingly well-defended foes, such as [[hell sentinel]]s and [[orbs of fire]]. If possible, do so in small, cramped areas, so they can't blink too far away.\n\nThis brand sees very marginal utility for Lugonu worshippers; it replaces your current brand, meaning you can swap brands very quickly (for the cost of 5 MP).\n\n==History==\n*Warp Weapon was removed in [[0.19]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Warp Weapon would only work on unbranded weapons.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], Warp Weapon was a level 7 spell.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

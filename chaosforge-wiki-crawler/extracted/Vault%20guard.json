{"title":"Vault guard","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Vault_guard","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Vault guards''' are stout warriors found in [[the Vaults]], occasionally guarding its entrance, or the entrance to a [[treasure trove]]. They tend to wield powerful, occasionally-[[brand]]ed weapons and sometimes shields. On their own, they're about as dangerous as an [[orc knight]], but they tend to be found in bands alongside [[ironbound preserver]]s, [[ironbound convoker]]s, and/or [[vault warden]]s. You are guaranteed to face a horde of them upon entering the fifth and final floor of the Vaults.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Although not particularly terrifying, they can land decently powerful hits, particularly when armed with well-branded gear. Try not to take on too many at once.\n*Their [[willpower]] is not that great. Confusing, enslaving, or petrifying them is not a bad idea. In case of emergency, bring a [[scroll of fear]] to send most of them running.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

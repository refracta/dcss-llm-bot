{"title":"Decaaut","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Decaaut","type":"raw","data":"''Main Article: [[Actions]]''\n\nOne '''decaAut''' ('''deca-aut''', sometimes referred as a '''turn''') is equal to 10 [[aut]], or 10 arbitrary units of time. It is the time it takes for an un[[transformation|transformed]], un[[status effect|status]]ed [[human]] to [[wait]] (with '''s''' or '''.''') for one turn. It is also the 'standard' time for most actions in the game, and is therefore used as a general measurement of time. For example, decaAut (listed as \"turns\") is used to measure the game's [[Zot clock]]. \n\nMost [[species]] and [[monster]]s take 1 decaAut to move, and it is the time it takes for all species in their natural form and condition to do many actions (like quaffing [[potion]]s or casting the vast majority of [[spell]]s). A primary exception is [[attack speed]], which is often measured by delay; weapons can take from [[quick blade|0.7]] to [[dark maul|3]] decaAut to swing, before modifiers like [[shield]]s and [[skill]].\n\nDecaAut are often considered [[turn]]s, but they are technically distinct measures. The Time counter in the status bar only measures decaAut; the actual turn counter measures the amount of commands, irrespective of how long the command takes. For example, a [[Naga]] takes 1.4 decaAut to move, but this is counted as 1 turn for the turn counter. However, the [[Zot clock]] considers this as 1.4 \"turns\" for its purposes."}

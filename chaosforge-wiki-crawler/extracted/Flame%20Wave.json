It deals fire damage to adjacent creatures (creatures in a 1-tile radius), then gives the '''Wave''' status. Subsequent turns can be spent waiting (hitting '.' or tab), which will cast the spell again. This only costs 1 MP, but deals the same damage and increases the radius by 1. This can be done twice, for a total spell cost of 6 MP. \n\nChanging position by any method (whether by moving, [[blink]]ing, teleporting, or being moved by monster attacks like [[trample]] or [[Primal Wave]]) will interrupt Flame Wave.\n\n[[Vehumet]]'s range increase will allow this spell to be channeled an additional time, hitting everything within 4 tiles from the caster.\n\n==Strategy==\nFlame Wave deals decent damage to a whole area, and due to the channeling mechanic, it's reasonably MP-efficient. The main downside is short range, meaning monsters will often be in melee with you. Don't get too greedy; while Flame Wave can hit 8 enemies at once, it also means that you'll be hit by 8 enemies at once.\n\nDespite being a \"wave\" spell, Flame Wave is effective at corridor combat, too. Compared to other [[Fire Magic]], it can't directly damage you (unlike [[Fireball]], [[Inner Flame]], and [[Volatile Blastmotes]]), and it does more damage per MP than [[Scorch]].\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*An [[amulet of the acrobat]] will improve your [[EV]] while you channel the spell, which can help with survivability.\n*Flame Wave is strong enough to light [[tree]]s on fire. Using it in forested areas can create massive, deadly infernos, but be careful not to set yourself ablaze in the process.\n*Like other fire spells, Flame Wave creates [[steam]] over any [[water]] tile. Using it twice when surrounded by water (e.g. in [[Swamp]] or [[Shoals]]) creates a short-lived, [[LOS]]-blocking barrier of steam.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Flame Wave dealt <code>2d(4.5+Power/8)</code> damage.\n*Flame Wave was introduced in [[0.28]]."}

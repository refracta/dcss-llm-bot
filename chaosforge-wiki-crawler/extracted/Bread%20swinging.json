{"title":"Bread swinging","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bread_swinging","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n\n'''Bread swinging''' is a strategy designed to lower your turn count. You can swing manually by the [[v]] key. It takes 15 ''[[aut]]s'' to swing a miscellaneous item, like a scroll, but only one ''[[turn]]''. Therefore, you will have more [[time]] to regenerate health, while taking the same amount of turns. \n\nAn untrained weapon with high [[delay|base delay]], such as a [[heavy]] weapon, will swing slower and thus save more turns. However, note that taking off a [[shield]] and putting it back on again will take 10 turns (of 10 aut each).\n\nThis strategy has a relatively little impact on the number of turns taken, and zero impact outside of a [[speedrun]]. The '''insert''' key allows you to repeat an action over and over for this purpose.\n\n==History==\n*[[Comestible|Ration]]s were removed in [[0.26]], removing bread swinging's namesake entirely. \n*[[Bread ration]]s were merged to rations in [[0.21]]."}

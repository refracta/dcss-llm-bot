{"title":"Death knight","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Death_knight","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''This page is about the monster. For the obsolete background see [[Death Knight (background)]].''\n{{monster info|death knight}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Death knights''' are human followers of [[Yredelemnul]]. They can cast [[Agony]] and reflect damage back to they take. They spawn in late [[Dungeon]], as well as [[the Crypt]] - usually with undead like [[freezing wraith]]s, [[phantasmal warrior]]s, and [[flayed ghost]]s.\n\nAs followers of Yredelemnul, death knights are unaffected by [[umbra]]'s accuracy penalty. As humans, they are not vulnerable to [[holy wrath]].\n\n{{monster spells|Death knight}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Agony is basically [[torment]], so it hurts a lot. A [[potion of lignification]] gives immunity to this spell. Having high [[willpower]] reduces the chance of it affecting you.\n*Watch out for Injury Mirror - it's often a good idea to stop attacking the knight during Injury Mirror. Check for the status icon (or the status text in console) to make sure it ends. Also note that lasting effects, e.g. [[poison]] and [[cloud]]s, count as your damage for their duration.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.18]], death knights could cast [[Haunt]], and could not be found in the Dungeon.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], death knights could cast [[Drain Life]] and [[Animate Dead]] instead of Agony and Haunt.\n*Death knights replaced [[deep dwarf death knight]]s in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

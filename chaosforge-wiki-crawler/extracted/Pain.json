For the card, see [[Pain card]].''\n\n[[Pain]] is a monster-only [[Necromancy]] spell which fires a beam of [[negative energy]] against a single target. It must overcome its target's [[willpower]] to have an effect but never misses and is unaffected by [[AC]].  All nonliving, undead and demonic monsters are immune, as are players with rN+++ and monsters with rN+.\n\nMonsters cast Pain with an enchantment power of 50, and a minimum spellpower (attack power) of 150, leading to most monsters dealing the same damage. It does damage given by:\n{{crawlquote|1d(7 + Power/20)}}\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n{{Spell\n|name=Pain\n|level=1\n|school1={{Necromancy}}\n|school2=\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Necromancy]]\n*[[Book of Pain]]\n</div>\n|castingnoise=1\n|spellnoise=1\n}}{{AttackSpell\n|name=Pain\n|formula = 1d(4 + Power/5)\n|maxdmg = 1d9 [[negative energy]]\n|maxsp = 25\n|range = 5\n|target = Beam\n|special =*Ignores [[AC]]<br>*[[Will]] resists<br>*Costs 1 [[HP]] to cast}}\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Pain was a level 1 Necromancy spell available to players, being one of the few spells that did self-damage (1 point of negative energy).

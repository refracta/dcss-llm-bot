Other races with similar aptitudes can also follow this path, as can other [backgrounds](/Background \"Background\") (such as [Wizards](/Wizard \"Wizard\"), other types of elementalists).\n\nThe overall progression outlined here involves heavy use of air magic in the early game, which enables the use of [Summon (air) Elemental](/Summon_Elemental \"Summon Elemental\") by the midgame, then a heavy concentration on [Necromancy](/Necromancy \"Necromancy\") until [Necromutation](/Necromutation \"Necromutation\") can be consistently cast, at which point [Haunt](/Haunt \"Haunt\") becomes the primary means of offense.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Starting Spellbook](#Starting_Spellbook)\n\n- [2 Initial Skills](#Initial_Skills)\n\n- [3 Melee](#Melee)\n\n- [4 Equipment](#Equipment)\n\n  - [4.1 Weapons](#Weapons)\n  - [4.2 Armour](#Armour)\n  - [4.3 Jewelery](#Jewelery)\n  - [4.4 Other](#Other)\n\n- [5 Gods](#Gods)\n\n- [6 Stats](#Stats)\n\n- [7 Summoning](#Summoning)\n\n  - [7.1 General Use](#General_Use)\n  - [7.2 Weak Companions](#Weak_Companions)\n  - [7.3 Summon Elemental](#Summon_Elemental)\n  - [7.4 Haunt](#Haunt)\n  - [7.5 Shadow Creatures](#Shadow_Creatures)\n  - [7.6 Summon Horrible Things](#Summon_Horrible_Things)\n\n- [8 Late Game Skills](#Late_Game_Skills)\n\n## Starting Spellbook\n\nYour starting spellbook will determine what tactics you must employ at the beginning of the game, as well as which spell schools you can train. Deep Elves, with their poor fighting aptitude and low HP, must generally kill foes from afar.\n\nAir Elementalists, who start with a [Book of Air](/Book_of_Air \"Book of Air\"), have the necessary firepower and several spells that greatly enhance survivability. See [Book of Air](/Book_of_Air \"Book of Air\") for an overview of its spells and their uses.\n\n[Wizard](/Wizard \"Wizard\") is also an excellent choice of starting [backgrounds](/Background \"Background\") for this character path; the [Book of Minor Magic](/Book_of_Minor_Magic \"Book of Minor Magic\") is a grab-bag of useful spells including the indispensable [Mephitic Cloud](/Mephitic_Cloud \"Mephitic Cloud\").\n\n## Initial Skills\n\nYour earliest focus should be on [Spellcasting](/Spellcasting \"Spellcasting\"), [Conjurations](/Conjurations \"Conjurations\"), and [Air Magic](/Air_Magic \"Air Magic\"). A few levels of [Charms](/Charms \"Charms\") are sufficient to reliably cast [Swiftness](/Swiftness \"Swiftness\"); additional training should be done later to be able to cast [Haste](/Haste \"Haste\") and [Deflect Missiles](/Deflect_Missiles \"Deflect Missiles\"). You also want a few levels of [Translocations](/Translocations \"Translocations\") to get [Blink](/Blink \"Blink\") up to Excellent after you learn it.\n\n## Melee\n\nDeep Elves are frail, and poor fighters, and are thus best kept out of melee. They are, however, capable users of [Short Blades](/Short_Blades \"Short Blades\"), and are quite proficient at [stabbing](/Stabbing \"Stabbing\"). When [confused](/Confused \"Confused\"), monsters cannot effectively fight back, and are highly vulnerable to [stabbing](/Stabbing \"Stabbing\"). This makes the combination of Mephitic Cloud and daggers worthwhile for Deep Elves, though avoiding melee altogether is a safer strategy. Stabbing also combines modestly well with a summoning strategy, as \"distracted\" monsters are easier to stab, though not as much as confused monsters.\n\nEven if you do not plan to engage in much melee, [Fighting](/Fighting \"Fighting\") skill does offer a modest but important boost to your HP.\n\n## Equipment\n\n### Weapons\n\nDeep Elves' proficiency with short blades and stabbing makes [daggers](/Dagger \"Dagger\") the best choice for them. A dagger of [venom](/Venom \"Venom\") is a good choice, as is one with the [Electrocution](/Electrocution \"Electrocution\") brand. [Quick blades](/Quick_blade \"Quick blade\") are also a good choice. It is useful to carry an extra blade with the [holy wrath](/Holy_wrath \"Holy wrath\") brand to use against [undead](/Undead \"Undead\"). And weapons with the [draining brand](/Draining_\\(brand\\) \"Draining (brand)\") may be the best \"defensive\" weapon in the early game, as they tend to kill weak monsters quickly by lowering their hit dice, at the cost of reduced XP for the kill. Which is reported to be minimal. Much lower than allowing summons to kill for you.\n\nDaggers have one problem, they have a very low base damage. In the later game their damage output each turn is way to low to do any serious damage. You should either rely on stabbing damage (confuse, sleep, etc the monsters first, or be invisible), or ditch the daggers completely. In most cases the xp penalty of increasing the daggers to [minimal delay](/Weapon_Speed \"Weapon Speed\") isn't worth the effort.\n\nThe best brands on low damage weapons are those that do not multiply the base damage (such as [Vorpal](/Vorpal \"Vorpal\") or [Flaming](/Flaming \"Flaming\") do). Aim for [draining](/Draining_\\(brand\\) \"Draining (brand)\"), [Electrocution](/Electrocution \"Electrocution\"), [Venom](/Venom \"Venom\"), and even [Distortion](/Distortion \"Distortion\"). [Antimagic](/Antimagic \"Antimagic\") also has situational uses (Wield it when out of magic and face to face with the enemy caster).\n\nIf you do not plan to engage in much melee, a [magical staff](/Magical_staff \"Magical staff\") is a better choice -- Wizardry if some of your spells have a low [success rate](/Spell_success \"Spell success\"), Power for the extra MP, or Channeling if you do not have Sif Muna's channeling ability.\n\nA [rod](/Rod \"Rod\") is also a good choice, if you can find one. A [Rod of Smiting](/Rod_of_Smiting \"Rod of Smiting\") pairs up well with summoning tactics, since it will not harm your allies. A [Rod of Demonology](/Rod_of_Demonology \"Rod of Demonology\") may allow you to omit [Abjuration](/Abjuration \"Abjuration\") and [Recall](/Recall \"Recall\") from your list, and cast supplemental summoning spells.\n\n### Armour\n\nTraining a couple of levels of [Armour](/Armour \"Armour\") skill is useful for reducing the spellcasting penalty for using heavy armours. It is not reduced by much, however -- spellcasters should generally stick to robes, leather, troll, or mottled dragon armour. With more armour skill they can get away with ring mail or swamp dragon armour, or possibly elven scale mail. With luck, you may find a light [artefact](/Artefact \"Artefact\") armour with several good resistances or other enchantments.\n\nShields and large shields should be avoided, but if your spell success rates are high, you can usually get away with using a buckler, especially an elven one. A buckler of reflection is nice, a buckler of protection better still -- if you can find one.\n\n### Jewelery\n\nAn [amulet of the gourmand](/Amulet_of_the_gourmand \"Amulet of the gourmand\") is quite useful in the early game, when food is tight. Spellcasters have greater food requirements than other character types due to [spell hunger](/Spell_hunger \"Spell hunger\"), and a great way to combat this is to be engorged as often as possible. Having lots of food also lets you aggressively [channel energy](/Channel_energy \"Channel energy\"), although the spell [Sublimation of Blood](/Sublimation_of_Blood \"Sublimation of Blood\") is a good alternative for turning [chunks](/Chunk \"Chunk\") into mana.\n\nAn [amulet of clarity](/Amulet_of_clarity \"Amulet of clarity\") will make you immune to the effects of your mephitic cloud (as will poison resistance). It is nearly a prerequisite for casting [Alistair's Intoxication](/Alistair%27s_Intoxication \"Alistair's Intoxication\").\n\nConventional wisdom would suggest that an [amulet of guardian spirit](/Amulet_of_guardian_spirit \"Amulet of guardian spirit\") is disastrous for spellcasters. However, Deep Elves top out at 124 HP at level 27 (135 with a few levels of Fighting), making them vulnerable to one-shot kills from [Lehudib's Crystal Spear](/Lehudib%27s_Crystal_Spear \"Lehudib's Crystal Spear\") and similar dangers. With maxed spellcasting an amulet of the guardian spirit adds 50 more HP in the form of MP that can be [healed](/Healing \"Healing\") rapidly by channeling energy or using [Sublimation of Blood](/Sublimation_of_Blood \"Sublimation of Blood\"). While this amulet puts you in danger of losing all your MP from a hard hit, this is still preferable to losing all your HP.\n\nAn [amulet of controlled flight](/Amulet_of_controlled_flight \"Amulet of controlled flight\") is good for [the Swamp](/The_Swamp \"The Swamp\"), [the Shoals](/The_Shoals \"The Shoals\"), and [the Abyss](/The_Abyss \"The Abyss\") if you have [levitation](/Levitation \"Levitation\") but not [flight](/Flight_\\(spell\\) \"Flight (spell)\").\n\nA [ring of teleport control](/Ring_of_teleport_control \"Ring of teleport control\") is highly recommended in combination with the spell [blink](/Blink \"Blink\") as a high-reliability means of escape, and to avoid getting surrounded by several dangerous enemies when stumbling upon teleport [traps](/Trap \"Trap\").\n\nA [ring of magical power](/Ring_of_magical_power \"Ring of magical power\") is one of the best choices of rings for aggressive spellcasters; when combined with an amulet of the guardian spirit, it also translates into an effective 9 extra HP.\n\n### Other\n\nResist the temptation to carry lots of spellbooks around with you, as they weigh 7 aum each. Carry the spellbook you'll be memorizing your next spell from, a handful of emergency-use potions, and a couple of rations or other food. Put everything else in your [stash](/Stash \"Stash\").\n\nSpellcasters have limited need for wands, which weigh 10 aum each. A wand of teleportation or healing are good for emergencies, if you can find them; any [conjuration](/Conjuration \"Conjuration\")-type wand is also good against dangerous enemies in the early game.\n\n## Gods\n\n[Sif Muna](/Sif_Muna \"Sif Muna\") is the obvious choice for this character path; Deep Elves' proficiency in all spell schools makes the variety of spell books gifted by Sif quite valuable. [Channel energy](/Channel_energy \"Channel energy\") is also an excellent ability for an aggressive spellcaster, although a Staff of Channeling can substitute for it.\n\nUnfortunately, the spell [Necromutation](/Necromutation \"Necromutation\") -- which is central to the Summoner/Necromancer portion of this character guide -- is rarely found outside the [Necronomicon](/Necronomicon \"Necronomicon\"), which Sif Muna does not grant. The Necronomicon can often be found in the dungeon, a [shop](/Shop \"Shop\"), or in one of Sif's artifact books... but the only *guaranteed* way of getting it is to worship [Kikubaaqudgha](/Kikubaaqudgha \"Kikubaaqudgha\"). Kiku's [corpse](/Corpse \"Corpse\")-granting ability also serves as an alternative to energy channeling when combined with [Sublimation of Blood](/Sublimation_of_Blood \"Sublimation of Blood\"), making Kiku a plausible alternative to Sif.\n\n[Vehumet](/Vehumet \"Vehumet\") is also a good choice, especially to acquire [Mephitic Cloud](/Mephitic_Cloud \"Mephitic Cloud\") early via a [Book of Conjurations](/Book_of_Conjurations \"Book of Conjurations\") gift. Switching from Sif to Vehumet in the late game is also worth considering (once all desired spells have been gained from Sif's gifts); Vehumet boosts the power of conjurations and summonings and grants MP from killing monsters, making him more potent in dangerous settings such as [Ziggurats](/Ziggurat \"Ziggurat\").\n\n## Stats\n\nPut all your stat increases into Strength until you get it up to at least 8, so that you are not encumbered all the time. If you find a strength-granting artefact, you might be able to get away with less, but watch out for stat drains. Later you will have Flight and Necromutation, which will bring your carrying capacity up to about 500 aum.\n\nPut the remaining increases into Intelligence.\n\n## Summoning\n\n### General Use\n\nChanging levels (i.e., going down a stairwell) is one of the most dangerous times for your character. You might find yourself planted right next to a superdangerous [unique](/Unique \"Unique\"), who might take the opportunity to swat at you while you climb back up, then follow you upstairs to finish you off. Therefore, whenever taking a set of stairs for the first time (down *or* up), you should cast all the best [charms](/Charms \"Charms\") on yourself that you can beforehand, and surround yourself with summoned allies that can keep your enemies distracted and distant. You can only take allies with you that are immediately next to you when you change levels. This limits you to eight allies, or fewer if there are walls next to the stairs. Take as many as you can.\n\n[Recall](/Recall \"Recall\") is good for engaging monsters that are around corners; if you have several summoned allies somewhere on the level, they will surround you and extend past the corner, where they will engage the monster. Summoning new monsters can have the same effect -- especially Summon Elemental, which allows you to summon in a specific direction.\n\nDon't forget to 't'alk to your allies; even mindless ones will understand a command to attack. Without that command, most will cluster around you, doing nothing.\n\n### Weak Companions\n\nThe lower-level summoning spells are not that useful, although [Summon Butterflies](/Summon_Butterflies \"Summon Butterflies\") is a fantastic means of escape; it instantly surrounds you with a two-tile deep cloud of butterflies which will get out of your way but not your attackers. The butterflies also interfere with ranged attacks, providing cover while you back away from a centaur or spellcaster. It's also a great means of finding teleport or zot [traps](/Trap \"Trap\") on the lower levels; summon up a cloud, then watch them flutter around a room and see if they hit anything (However, they will not set off dart, blade, alarm, etc. traps, or discover shafts, being flying creatures).\n\nIn a pinch, [Summon Small Mammals](/Summon_Small_Mammals \"Summon Small Mammals\") can protect you in a similar manner; at the very least, they are good for blocking your enemies as you retreat through a corridor.\n\n### Summon Elemental\n\n[Summon Elemental](/Summon_Elemental \"Summon Elemental\") is an excellent mid-game summoning spell. The type of elemental you summon depends on what type of tile is in the direction of your summon. An empty tile will produce an [air elemental](/Air_elemental \"Air elemental\"); a rock (not stone) tile will produce an [earth elemental](/Earth_elemental \"Earth elemental\"); lava or smoke will produce a [fire elemental](/Fire_elemental \"Fire elemental\"); and water will produce a [water elemental](/Water_elemental \"Water elemental\").\n\nFire elementals are weak. Water elementals are good but require a nearby water source. Air elementals are durable, hit hard, and are incredibly fast. A swarm of five or more can overcome just about any mid-game enemy. Being flying creatures, they are useful in any dungeon [branch](/Branch \"Branch\"), such as [The Shoals](/The_Shoals \"The Shoals\") or [The Swamp](/The_Swamp \"The Swamp\"), and as an additional bonus, they're fast enough to keep up with you even when you're swift, flying, *and* hasted.\n\nThe biggest drawback is that you want to have a skill of 15 in Air Magic in order to summon *friendly* air elementals. Deep Elf Air Elementalists can usually achieve this by experience level 10 to 15, at which point they can conjure armies of air elementals. Air elementals are immune to electricity, which means you can fire [Shock](/Shock \"Shock\") and [Lightning Bolt](/Lightning_Bolt \"Lightning Bolt\") through them with impunity. [Airstrike](/Airstrike \"Airstrike\"), another Air spell, is also great in combination with summons; its [smite](/Smite \"Smite\") targeting allows you to avoid hitting your allies. Be careful to not summon air elementals if you do not have a means to defeat them, as you cannot outrun them, and they do hit quite hard. You may be able to get away using haste, [Summon Butterflies](/Summon_Butterflies \"Summon Butterflies\"), and a nearby stairwell. As of 0.9, Airstrike is useless against renegade air elementals.\n\nAn [air elemental fan](/Evocable_items#Air_elemental_fan \"Evocable items\") is a good way to generate lots of elementals without depleting your MP (you can, for instance, use it while waiting for your MP to recover). You must have about 5 levels of [evocations](/Evocations \"Evocations\") before it is useful, as even at that level you will still fail to use it more than 90% of the time.\n\n[Earth elementals](/Earth_elemental \"Earth elemental\") are also good companions; they are slow but hit very hard. Summoning an earth elemental is also a fast way to dig through a single rock (not stone) wall. You only need to have 5 levels of [Earth Magic](/Earth_Magic \"Earth Magic\") skill to maximize your chance of getting a friendly one (and they are easy to run away from anyway). However, earth magic is the opposite [element](/Element \"Element\") from air magic, which means earth magic will train very slowly if you already have a lot of skill with air magic (and vice versa).\n\n### Haunt\n\n[Haunt](/Haunt \"Haunt\") is the unholy grail of summoning spells. It is the only summoning spell in the game that uses [smite](/Smite \"Smite\") targeting: instead of surrounding you with summoned monsters, it surrounds your opponent with them. After 3-5 castings, an opponent is likely to be completely surrounded by nefarious spirits, and quite distracted as a result.\n\nIt comes with several drawbacks: casting it can make you [sick](/Sick \"Sick\"); it has a high mana cost (7); and a high [spell hunger](/Spell_hunger \"Spell hunger\") cost. All of these drawbacks are almost completely negated by using Haunt in concert with [Necromutation](/Necromutation \"Necromutation\"). In lich form, you cannot get sick and do not experience hunger from any source -- which means you can cast Haunt five to eight times in a row, channel energy repeatedly, and repeat the process every couple dozen turns or so. Few opponents will have any chance of resisting such an onslaught.\n\n### Shadow Creatures\n\n[Shadow Creatures](/Shadow_Creatures \"Shadow Creatures\") will summon a single \"random encounter\" appropriate to the level you are on. On levels that have a mix of weak and dangerous monsters, this may or may not be useful. On D:10, for instance, you can get a large band of [ogres](/Ogre \"Ogre\"), including an [ogre mage](/Ogre_mage \"Ogre mage\")... or you can get a single [hobgoblin](/Hobgoblin \"Hobgoblin\"). In the [Realm of Zot](/Realm_of_Zot \"Realm of Zot\"), where every monster is dangerous, it is extremely useful, despite the occasional [moth of wrath](/Moth_of_wrath \"Moth of wrath\").\n\n### Summon Horrible Things\n\n[Summon Horrible Things](/Summon_Horrible_Things \"Summon Horrible Things\") is useful on levels that are home to weak \"random\" encounters but very strong special encounters, such as [The Tomb](/The_Tomb \"The Tomb\") or the last level of [The Vaults](/The_Vaults \"The Vaults\"). Shadow Creatures is not useful on such levels, and Haunt's progeny may struggle to take down [guardian mummies](/Guardian_mummy \"Guardian mummy\") or large numbers of [dragons](/Dragon \"Dragon\").\n\n## Late Game Skills\n\nMost of the focus on necromancy in this character path involves two spells only: [Necromutation](/Necromutation \"Necromutation\") and [Haunt](/Haunt \"Haunt\"). To cast these spells effectively, you should have 15+ Necromancy and [Transmutations](/Transmutations \"Transmutations\") skills (for Necromutation) and 15+ Necromancy and 10+ [Summonings](/Summonings \"Summonings\") (for Haunt).\n\nA modest amount of [Invocations](/Invocations \"Invocations\") skill is desirable once you start using [channel energy](/Channel_energy \"Channel energy\"), and using channel energy is the best way to train it. Note that the only important skill levels here are the multiples of 4; you will get more mana per use at skill 4, 8, 12, and so on. Just 4 levels will let you recover your mana quickly in between fights, more will let you do so faster, perhaps even *during* the fight.\n\n[Spellcasting](/Spellcasting \"Spellcasting\") should be trained all the way up to level 27. It influences your MP, the number of spells you can memorise, and your [spell success](/Spell_success \"Spell success\"). Deep Elves, with +4 proficiency at spellcasting, can reach 27 by the time they get to [Zot:5](/Zot:5 \"Zot:5\").\n\n[Conjurations](/Conjurations \"Conjurations\") will cease to be important once you switch to a summoning-heavy strategy. You can usually turn it off once you've got Haunt mastered. Before then, though, [Orb of Destruction](/Orb_of_Destruction \"Orb of Destruction\") is very, very useful against several dangerous [uniques](/Unique \"Unique\").\n\nGetting [Air Magic](/Air_Magic \"Air Magic\") up to about level 20 will allow you to cast [Tornado](/Tornado \"Tornado\"), one of the most fearsome offensive spells in the game. As a bonus, air elementals are immune to its damage, making summoning and tornadoes an excellent one-two punch.\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\"

Deep Elves, with their poor fighting aptitude and low HP, must generally kill foes from afar.\n</p><p>Air Elementalists, who start with a <a href=\"/Book_of_Air\" title=\"Book of Air\">Book of Air</a>, have the necessary firepower and several spells that greatly enhance survivability. See <a href=\"/Book_of_Air\" title=\"Book of Air\">Book of Air</a> for an overview of its spells and their uses.\n</p><p><a href=\"/Wizard\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wizard\">Wizard</a> is also an excellent choice of starting <a href=\"/Background\" title=\"Background\">backgrounds</a> for this character path; the <a href=\"/Book_of_Minor_Magic\" title=\"Book of Minor Magic\">Book of Minor Magic</a> is a grab-bag of useful spells including the indispensable <a href=\"/Mephitic_Cloud\" title=\"Mephitic Cloud\">Mephitic Cloud</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Initial_Skills\">Initial Skills</span></h2>\n<p>Your earliest focus should be on <a href=\"/Spellcasting\" title=\"Spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a>, <a href=\"/Conjurations\" title=\"Conjurations\">Conjurations</a>, and <a href=\"/Air_Magic\" title=\"Air Magic\">Air Magic</a>. A few levels of <a href=\"/Charms\" title=\"Charms\">Charms</a> are sufficient to reliably cast <a href=\"/Swiftness\" title=\"Swiftness\">Swiftness</a>; additional training should be done later to be able to cast <a href=\"/Haste\" title=\"Haste\">Haste</a> and <a href=\"/Deflect_Missiles\" title=\"Deflect Missiles\">Deflect Missiles</a>. You also want a few levels of <a href=\"/Translocations\" title=\"Translocations\">Translocations</a> to get <a href=\"/Blink\" title=\"Blink\">Blink</a> up to Excellent after you learn it.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Melee\">Melee</span></h2>\n<p>Deep Elves are frail, and poor fighters, and are thus best kept out of melee. They are, however, capable users of <a href=\"/Short_Blades\" title=\"Short Blades\">Short Blades</a>, and are quite proficient at <a href=\"/Stabbing\" title=\"Stabbing\">stabbing</a>. When <a href=\"/Confused\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Confused\">confused</a>, monsters cannot effectively fight back, and are highly vulnerable to <a href=\"/Stabbing\" title=\"Stabbing\">stabbing</a>. This makes the combination of Mephitic Cloud and daggers worthwhile for Deep Elves, though avoiding melee altogether is a safer strategy. Stabbing also combines modestly well with a summoning strategy, as \"distracted\" monsters are easier to stab, though not as much as confused monsters.\n</p><p>Even if you do not plan to engage in much melee, <a href=\"/Fighting\" title=\"Fighting\">Fighting</a> skill does offer a modest but important boost to your HP.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Equipment\">Equipment</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapons\">Weapons</span></h3>\n<p>Deep Elves' proficiency with short blades and stabbing makes <a href=\"/Dagger\" title=\"Dagger\">daggers</a> the best choice for them. A dagger of <a href=\"/Venom\" title=\"Venom\">venom</a> is a good choice, as is one with the <a href=\"/Electrocution\" title=\"Electrocution\">Electrocution</a> brand. <a href=\"/Quick_blade\" title=\"Quick blade\">Quick blades</a> are also a good choice. It is useful to carry an extra blade with the <a href=\"/Holy_wrath\" title=\"Holy wrath\">holy wrath</a> brand to use against <a href=\"/Undead\" title=\"Undead\">undead</a>. And weapons with the <a href=\"/Draining_(brand)\" title=\"Draining (brand)\">draining brand</a> may be the best \"defensive\" weapon in the early game, as they tend to kill weak monsters quickly by lowering their hit dice, at the cost of reduced XP for the kill. Which is reported to be minimal. Much lower than allowing summons to kill for you.\n</p><p>Daggers have one problem, they have a very low base damage. In the later game their damage output each turn is way to low to do any serious damage. You should either rely on stabbing damage (confuse, sleep, etc the monsters first, or be invisible), or ditch the daggers completely. In most cases the xp penalty of increasing the daggers to <a href=\"/Weapon_Speed\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Weapon Speed\">minimal delay</a> isn't worth the effort.\n</p><p>The best brands on low damage weapons are those that do not multiply the base damage (such as <a href=\"/Vorpal\" title=\"Vorpal\">Vorpal</a> or <a href=\"/Flaming\" title=\"Flaming\">Flaming</a> do). Aim for <a href=\"/Draining_(brand)\" title=\"Draining (brand)\">draining</a>, <a href=\"/Electrocution\" title=\"Electrocution\">Electrocution</a>, <a href=\"/Venom\" title=\"Venom\">Venom</a>, and even <a href=\"/Distortion\" title=\"Distortion\">Distortion</a>. <a href=\"/Antimagic\" title=\"Antimagic\">Antimagic</a> also has situational uses (Wield it when out of magic and face to face with the enemy caster).\n</p><p>If you do not plan to engage in much melee, a <a href=\"/Magical_staff\" title=\"Magical staff\">magical staff</a> is a better choice -- Wizardry if some of your spells have a low <a href=\"/Spell_success\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spell success\">success rate</a>, Power for the extra MP, or Channeling if you do not have Sif Muna's channeling ability.  \n</p><p>A <a href=\"/Rod\" title=\"Rod\">rod</a> is also a good choice, if you can find one. A <a href=\"/Rod_of_Smiting\" title=\"Rod of Smiting\">Rod of Smiting</a> pairs up well with summoning tactics, since it will not harm your allies. A <a href=\"/Rod_of_Demonology\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rod of Demonology\">Rod of Demonology</a> may allow you to omit <a href=\"/Abjuration\" title=\"Abjuration\">Abjuration</a> and <a href=\"/Recall\" title=\"Recall\">Recall</a> from your list, and cast supplemental summoning spells.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Armour\">Armour</span></h3>\n<p>Training a couple of levels of <a href=\"/Armour\" title=\"Armour\">Armour</a> skill is useful for reducing the spellcasting penalty for using heavy armours. It is not reduced by much, however -- spellcasters should generally stick to robes, leather, troll, or mottled dragon armour. With more armour skill they can get away with ring mail or swamp dragon armour, or possibly elven scale mail. With luck, you may find a light <a href=\"/Artefact\" title=\"Artefact\">artefact</a> armour with several good resistances or other enchantments.\n</p><p>Shields and large shields should be avoided, but if your spell success rates are high, you can usually get away with using a buckler, especially an elven one. A buckler of reflection is nice, a buckler of protection better still -- if you can find one.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jewelery\">Jewelery</span></h3>\n<p>An <a href=\"/Amulet_of_the_gourmand\" title=\"Amulet of the gourmand\">amulet of the gourmand</a> is quite useful in the early game, when food is tight. Spellcasters have greater food requirements than other character types due to <a href=\"/Spell_hunger\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spell hunger\">spell hunger</a>, and a great way to combat this is to be engorged as often as possible. Having lots of food also lets you aggressively <a href=\"/Channel_energy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Channel energy\">channel energy</a>, although the spell <a href=\"/Sublimation_of_Blood\" title=\"Sublimation of Blood\">Sublimation of Blood</a> is a good alternative for turning <a href=\"/Chunk\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chunk\">chunks</a> into mana.\n</p><p>An <a href=\"/Amulet_of_clarity\" title=\"Amulet of clarity\">amulet of clarity</a> will make you immune to the effects of your mephitic cloud (as will poison resistance). It is nearly a prerequisite for casting <a href=\"/Alistair%27s_Intoxication\" title=\"Alistair&#39;s Intoxication\">Alistair's Intoxication</a>.\n</p><p>Conventional wisdom would suggest that an <a href=\"/Amulet_of_guardian_spirit\" title=\"Amulet of guardian spirit\">amulet of guardian spirit</a> is disastrous for spellcasters. However, Deep Elves top out at 124 HP at level 27 (135 with a few levels of Fighting), making them vulnerable to one-shot kills from <a href=\"/Lehudib%27s_Crystal_Spear\" title=\"Lehudib&#39;s Crystal Spear\">Lehudib's Crystal Spear</a> and similar dangers. With maxed spellcasting an amulet of the guardian spirit adds 50 more HP in the form of MP that can be <a href=\"/Healing\" title=\"Healing\">healed</a> rapidly by channeling energy or using <a href=\"/Sublimation_of_Blood\" title=\"Sublimation of Blood\">Sublimation of Blood</a>. While this amulet puts you in danger of losing all your MP from a hard hit, this is still preferable to losing all your HP.\n</p><p>An <a href=\"/Amulet_of_controlled_flight\" title=\"Amulet of controlled flight\">amulet of controlled flight</a> is good for <a href=\"/The_Swamp\" title=\"The Swamp\">the Swamp</a>, <a href=\"/The_Shoals\" title=\"The Shoals\">the Shoals</a>, and <a href=\"/The_Abyss\" title=\"The Abyss\">the Abyss</a> if you have <a href=\"/Levitation\" title=\"Levitation\">levitation</a> but not <a href=\"/Flight_(spell)\" title=\"Flight (spell)\">flight</a>.\n</p><p>A <a href=\"/Ring_of_teleport_control\" title=\"Ring of teleport control\">ring of teleport control</a> is highly recommended in combination with the spell <a href=\"/Blink\" title=\"Blink\">blink</a> as a high-reliability means of escape, and to avoid getting surrounded by several dangerous enemies when stumbling upon teleport <a href=\"/Trap\" title=\"Trap\">traps</a>.  \n</p><p>A <a href=\"/Ring_of_magical_power\" title=\"Ring of magical power\">ring of magical power</a> is one of the best choices of rings for aggressive spellcasters; when combined with an amulet of the guardian spirit, it also translates into an effective 9 extra HP.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other\">Other</span></h3>\n<p>Resist the temptation to carry lots of spellbooks around with you, as they weigh 7 aum each. Carry the spellbook you'll be memorizing your next spell from, a handful of emergency-use potions, and a couple of rations or other food. Put everything else in your <a href=\"/Stash\" title=\"Stash\">stash</a>.  \n</p><p>Spellcasters have limited need for wands, which weigh 10 aum each. A wand of teleportation or healing are good for emergencies, if you can find them; any <a href=\"/Conjuration\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Conjuration\">conjuration</a>-type wand is also good against dangerous enemies in the early game.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gods\">Gods</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/Sif_Muna\" title=\"Sif Muna\">Sif Muna</a> is the obvious choice for this character path; Deep Elves' proficiency in all spell schools makes the variety of spell books gifted by Sif quite valuable. <a href=\"/Channel_energy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Channel energy\">Channel energy</a> is also an excellent ability for an aggressive spellcaster, although a Staff of Channeling can substitute for it.\n</p><p>Unfortunately, the spell <a href=\"/Necromutation\" title=\"Necromutation\">Necromutation</a> -- which is central to the Summoner/Necromancer portion of this character guide -- is rarely found outside the <a href=\"/Necronomicon\" title=\"Necronomicon\">Necronomicon</a>, which Sif Muna does not grant.  The Necronomicon can often be found in the dungeon, a <a href=\"/Shop\" title=\"Shop\">shop</a>, or in one of Sif's artifact books... but the only <i>guaranteed</i> way of getting it is to worship <a href=\"/Kikubaaqudgha\" title=\"Kikubaaqudgha\">Kikubaaqudgha</a>. Kiku's <a href=\"/Corpse\" title=\"Corpse\">corpse</a>-granting ability also serves as an alternative to energy channeling when combined with <a href=\"/Sublimation_of_Blood\" title=\"Sublimation of Blood\">Sublimation of Blood</a>, making Kiku a plausible alternative to Sif.\n</p><p><a href=\"/Vehumet\" title=\"Vehumet\">Vehumet</a> is also a good choice, especially to acquire <a href=\"/Mephitic_Cloud\" title=\"Mephitic Cloud\">Mephitic Cloud</a> early via a <a href=\"/Book_of_Conjurations\" title=\"Book of Conjurations\">Book of Conjurations</a> gift. Switching from Sif to Vehumet in the late game is also worth considering (once all desired spells have been gained from Sif's gifts); Vehumet boosts the power of conjurations and summonings and grants MP from killing monsters, making him more potent in dangerous settings such as <a href=\"/Ziggurat\" title=\"Ziggurat\">Ziggurats</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stats\">Stats</span></h2>\n<p>Put all your stat increases into Strength until you get it up to at least 8, so that you are not encumbered all the time. If you find a strength-granting artefact, you might be able to get away with less, but watch out for stat drains. Later you will have Flight and Necromutation, which will bring your carrying capacity up to about 500 aum.\n</p><p>Put the remaining increases into Intelligence.  \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summoning\">Summoning</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"General_Use\">General Use</span></h3>\n<p>Changing levels (i.e., going down a stairwell) is one of the most dangerous times for your character.  You might find yourself planted right next to a superdangerous <a href=\"/Unique\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Unique\">unique</a>, who might take the opportunity to swat at you while you climb back up, then follow you upstairs to finish you off. Therefore, whenever taking a set of stairs for the first time (down <i>or</i> up), you should cast all the best <a href=\"/Charms\" title=\"Charms\">charms</a> on yourself that you can beforehand, and surround yourself with summoned allies that can keep your enemies distracted and distant. You can only take allies with you that are immediately next to you when you change levels. This limits you to eight allies, or fewer if there are walls next to the stairs. Take as many as you can.\n</p><p><a href=\"/Recall\" title=\"Recall\">Recall</a> is good for engaging monsters that are around corners; if you have several summoned allies somewhere on the level, they will surround you and extend past the corner, where they will engage the monster. Summoning new monsters can have the same effect -- especially Summon Elemental, which allows you to summon in a specific direction.\n</p><p>Don't forget to 't'alk to your allies; even mindless ones will understand a command to attack. Without that command, most will cluster around you, doing nothing.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weak_Companions\">Weak Companions</span></h3>\n<p>The lower-level summoning spells are not that useful, although <a href=\"/Summon_Butterflies\" title=\"Summon Butterflies\">Summon Butterflies</a> is a fantastic means of escape; it instantly surrounds you with a two-tile deep cloud of butterflies which will get out of your way but not your attackers. The butterflies also interfere with ranged attacks, providing cover while you back away from a centaur or spellcaster. It's also a great means of finding teleport or zot <a href=\"/Trap\" title=\"Trap\">traps</a> on the lower levels; summon up a cloud, then watch them flutter around a room and see if they hit anything (However, they will not set off dart, blade, alarm, etc. traps, or discover shafts, being flying creatures).\n</p><p>In a pinch, <a href=\"/Summon_Small_Mammals\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Summon Small Mammals\">Summon Small Mammals</a> can protect you in a similar manner; at the very least, they are good for blocking your enemies as you retreat through a corridor.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summon_Elemental\">Summon Elemental</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/Summon_Elemental\" title=\"Summon Elemental\">Summon Elemental</a> is an excellent mid-game summoning spell. The type of elemental you summon depends on what type of tile is in the direction of your summon. An empty tile will produce an <a href=\"/Air_elemental\" title=\"Air elemental\">air elemental</a>; a rock (not stone) tile will produce an <a href=\"/Earth_elemental\" title=\"Earth elemental\">earth elemental</a>; lava or smoke will produce a <a href=\"/Fire_elemental\" title=\"Fire elemental\">fire elemental</a>; and water will produce a <a href=\"/Water_elemental\" title=\"Water elemental\">water elemental</a>.\n</p><p>Fire elementals are weak. Water elementals are good but require a nearby water source. Air elementals are durable, hit hard, and are incredibly fast. A swarm of five or more can overcome just about any mid-game enemy. Being flying creatures, they are useful in any dungeon <a href=\"/Branch\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Branch\">branch</a>, such as <a href=\"/The_Shoals\" title=\"The Shoals\">The Shoals</a> or <a href=\"/The_Swamp\" title=\"The Swamp\">The Swamp</a>, and as an additional bonus, they're fast enough to keep up with you even when you're swift, flying, <i>and</i> hasted.\n</p><p>The biggest drawback is that you want to have a skill of 15 in Air Magic in order to summon <i>friendly</i> air elementals. Deep Elf Air Elementalists can usually achieve this by experience level 10 to 15, at which point they can conjure armies of air elementals. Air elementals are immune to electricity, which means you can fire <a href=\"/Shock\" title=\"Shock\">Shock</a> and <a href=\"/Lightning_Bolt\" title=\"Lightning Bolt\">Lightning Bolt</a> through them with impunity. <a href=\"/Airstrike\" title=\"Airstrike\">Airstrike</a>, another Air spell, is also great in combination with summons; its <a href=\"/Smite\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Smite\">smite</a> targeting allows you to avoid hitting your allies. Be careful to not summon air elementals if you do not have a means to defeat them, as you cannot outrun them, and they do hit quite hard. You may be able to get away using haste, <a href=\"/Summon_Butterflies\" title=\"Summon Butterflies\">Summon Butterflies</a>, and a nearby stairwell. As of 0.9, Airstrike is useless against renegade air elementals.\n</p><p>An <a href=\"/Evocable_items#Air_elemental_fan\" title=\"Evocable items\">air elemental fan</a> is a good way to generate lots of elementals without depleting your MP (you can, for instance, use it while waiting for your MP to recover). You must have about 5 levels of <a href=\"/Evocations\" title=\"Evocations\">evocations</a> before it is useful, as even at that level you will still fail to use it more than 90% of the time.\n</p><p><a href=\"/Earth_elemental\" title=\"Earth elemental\">Earth elementals</a> are also good companions; they are slow but hit very hard. Summoning an earth elemental is also a fast way to dig through a single rock (not stone) wall. You only need to have 5 levels of <a href=\"/Earth_Magic\" title=\"Earth Magic\">Earth Magic</a> skill to maximize your chance of getting a friendly one (and they are easy to run away from anyway). However, earth magic is the opposite <a href=\"/Element\" title=\"Element\">element</a> from air magic, which means earth magic will train very slowly if you already have a lot of skill with air magic (and vice versa).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Haunt\">Haunt</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/Haunt\" title=\"Haunt\">Haunt</a> is the unholy grail of summoning spells. It is the only summoning spell in the game that uses <a href=\"/Smite\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Smite\">smite</a> targeting: instead of surrounding you with summoned monsters, it surrounds your opponent with them. After 3-5 castings, an opponent is likely to be completely surrounded by nefarious spirits, and quite distracted as a result.\n</p><p>It comes with several drawbacks: casting it can make you <a href=\"/Sick\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sick\">sick</a>; it has a high mana cost (7); and a high <a href=\"/Spell_hunger\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spell hunger\">spell hunger</a> cost. All of these drawbacks are almost completely negated by using Haunt in concert with <a href=\"/Necromutation\" title=\"Necromutation\">Necromutation</a>. In lich form, you cannot get sick and do not experience hunger from any source -- which means you can cast Haunt five to eight times in a row, channel energy repeatedly, and repeat the process every couple dozen turns or so. Few opponents will have any chance of resisting such an onslaught.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Shadow_Creatures\">Shadow Creatures</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/Shadow_Creatures\" title=\"Shadow Creatures\">Shadow Creatures</a> will summon a single \"random encounter\" appropriate to the level you are on. On levels that have a mix of weak and dangerous monsters, this may or may not be useful. On D:10, for instance, you can get a large band of <a href=\"/Ogre\" title=\"Ogre\">ogres</a>, including an <a href=\"/Ogre_mage\" title=\"Ogre mage\">ogre mage</a>... or you can get a single <a href=\"/Hobgoblin\" title=\"Hobgoblin\">hobgoblin</a>. In the <a href=\"/Realm_of_Zot\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Realm of Zot\">Realm of Zot</a>, where every monster is dangerous, it is extremely useful, despite the occasional <a href=\"/Moth_of_wrath\" title=\"Moth of wrath\">moth of wrath</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summon_Horrible_Things\">Summon Horrible Things</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/Summon_Horrible_Things\" title=\"Summon Horrible Things\">Summon Horrible Things</a> is useful on levels that are home to weak \"random\" encounters but very strong special encounters, such as <a href=\"/The_Tomb\" title=\"The Tomb\">The Tomb</a> or the last level of <a href=\"/The_Vaults\" title=\"The Vaults\">The Vaults</a>. Shadow Creatures is not useful on such levels, and Haunt's progeny may struggle to take down <a href=\"/Guardian_mummy\" title=\"Guardian mummy\">guardian mummies</a> or large numbers of <a href=\"/Dragon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dragon\">dragons</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Late_Game_Skills\">Late Game Skills</span></h2>\n<p>Most of the focus on necromancy in this character path involves two spells only: <a href=\"/Necromutation\" title=\"Necromutation\">Necromutation</a> and <a href=\"/Haunt\" title=\"Haunt\">Haunt</a>. To cast these spells effectively, you should have 15+ Necromancy and <a href=\"/Transmutations\" title=\"Transmutations\">Transmutations</a> skills (for Necromutation) and 15+ Necromancy and 10+ <a href=\"/Summonings\" title=\"Summonings\">Summonings</a> (for Haunt).\n</p><p>A modest amount of <a href=\"/Invocations\" title=\"Invocations\">Invocations</a> skill is desirable once you start using <a href=\"/Channel_energy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Channel energy\">channel energy</a>, and using channel energy is the best way to train it. Note that the only important skill levels here are the multiples of 4; you will get more mana per use at skill 4, 8, 12, and so on. Just 4 levels will let you recover your mana quickly in between fights, more will let you do so faster, perhaps even <i>during</i> the fight.\n</p><p><a href=\"/Spellcasting\" title=\"Spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a> should be trained all the way up to level 27. It influences your MP, the number of spells you can memorise, and your <a href=\"/Spell_success\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spell success\">spell success</a>. Deep Elves, with +4 proficiency at spellcasting, can reach 27 by the time they get to <a href=\"/Zot:5\" title=\"Zot:5\">Zot:5</a>.\n</p><p><a href=\"/Conjurations\" title=\"Conjurations\">Conjurations</a> will cease to be important once you switch to a summoning-heavy strategy. You can usually turn it off once you've got Haunt mastered.

guide details a progression through a set of skills well-suited to [[Deep Elf]] [[Air Elementalist]]s. Other races with similar aptitudes can also follow this path, as can other [[background]]s (such as [[Wizard]]s, other types of elementalists).\n\nThe overall progression outlined here involves heavy use of air magic in the early game, which enables the use of [[Summon Elemental|Summon (air) Elemental]] by the midgame, then a heavy concentration on [[Necromancy]] until [[Necromutation]] can be consistently cast, at which point [[Haunt]] becomes the primary means of offense.\n\n==Starting Spellbook==\nYour starting spellbook will determine what tactics you must employ at the beginning of the game, as well as which spell schools you can train. Deep Elves, with their poor fighting aptitude and low HP, must generally kill foes from afar.\n\nAir Elementalists, who start with a [[Book of Air]], have the necessary firepower and several spells that greatly enhance survivability. See [[Book of Air]] for an overview of its spells and their uses.\n\n[[Wizard]] is also an excellent choice of starting [[background]]s for this character path; the [[Book of Minor Magic]] is a grab-bag of useful spells including the indispensable [[Mephitic Cloud]].\n\n==Initial Skills==\nYour earliest focus should be on [[Spellcasting]], [[Conjurations]], and [[Air Magic]]. A few levels of [[Charms]] are sufficient to reliably cast [[Swiftness]]; additional training should be done later to be able to cast [[Haste]] and [[Deflect Missiles]]. You also want a few levels of [[Translocations]] to get [[Blink]] up to Excellent after you learn it.\n\n==Melee==\nDeep Elves are frail, and poor fighters, and are thus best kept out of melee. They are, however, capable users of [[Short Blades]], and are quite proficient at [[stabbing]]. When [[confused]], monsters cannot effectively fight back, and are highly vulnerable to [[stabbing]]. This makes the combination of Mephitic Cloud and daggers worthwhile for Deep Elves, though avoiding melee altogether is a safer strategy. Stabbing also combines modestly well with a summoning strategy, as \"distracted\" monsters are easier to stab, though not as much as confused monsters.\n\nEven if you do not plan to engage in much melee, [[Fighting]] skill does offer a modest but important boost to your HP.\n\n==Equipment==\n===Weapons===\nDeep Elves' proficiency with short blades and stabbing makes [[dagger]]s the best choice for them. A dagger of [[venom]] is a good choice, as is one with the [[Electrocution]] brand. [[Quick blade]]s are also a good choice. It is useful to carry an extra blade with the [[holy wrath]] brand to use against [[undead]]. And weapons with the [[draining (brand)|draining brand]] may be the best \"defensive\" weapon in the early game, as they tend to kill weak monsters quickly by lowering their hit dice, at the cost of reduced XP for the kill. Which is reported to be minimal. Much lower than allowing summons to kill for you.\n\nDaggers have one problem, they have a very low base damage. In the later game their damage output each turn is way to low to do any serious damage. You should either rely on stabbing damage (confuse, sleep, etc the monsters first, or be invisible), or ditch the daggers completely. In most cases the xp penalty of increasing the daggers to [[Weapon_Speed|minimal delay]] isn't worth the effort.\n\nThe best brands on low damage weapons are those that do not multiply the base damage (such as [[Vorpal]] or [[Flaming]] do). Aim for [[Draining (brand)|draining]], [[Electrocution]], [[Venom]], and even [[Distortion]]. [[Antimagic]] also has situational uses (Wield it when out of magic and face to face with the enemy caster).\n\nIf you do not plan to engage in much melee, a [[magical staff]] is a better choice -- Wizardry if some of your spells have a low [[spell success|success rate]], Power for the extra MP, or Channeling if you do not have Sif Muna's channeling ability.  \n\nA [[rod]] is also a good choice, if you can find one. A [[Rod of Smiting]] pairs up well with summoning tactics, since it will not harm your allies. A [[Rod of Demonology]] may allow you to omit [[Abjuration]] and [[Recall]] from your list, and cast supplemental summoning spells.\n\n===Armour===\nTraining a couple of levels of [[Armour]] skill is useful for reducing the spellcasting penalty for using heavy armours. It is not reduced by much, however -- spellcasters should generally stick to robes, leather, troll, or mottled dragon armour. With more armour skill they can get away with ring mail or swamp dragon armour, or possibly elven scale mail. With luck, you may find a light [[artefact]] armour with several good resistances or other enchantments.\n\nShields and large shields should be avoided, but if your spell success rates are high, you can usually get away with using a buckler, especially an elven one. A buckler of reflection is nice, a buckler of protection better still -- if you can find one.\n\n===Jewelery===\nAn [[amulet of the gourmand]] is quite useful in the early game, when food is tight. Spellcasters have greater food requirements than other character types due to [[spell hunger]], and a great way to combat this is to be engorged as often as possible. Having lots of food also lets you aggressively [[channel energy]], although the spell [[Sublimation of Blood]] is a good alternative for turning [[chunk]]s into mana.\n\nAn [[amulet of clarity]] will make you immune to the effects of your mephitic cloud (as will poison resistance). It is nearly a prerequisite for casting [[Alistair's Intoxication]].\n\nConventional wisdom would suggest that an [[amulet of guardian spirit]] is disastrous for spellcasters. However, Deep Elves top out at 124 HP at level 27 (135 with a few levels of Fighting), making them vulnerable to one-shot kills from [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] and similar dangers. With maxed spellcasting an amulet of the guardian spirit adds 50 more HP in the form of MP that can be [[healing|healed]] rapidly by channeling energy or using [[Sublimation of Blood]]. While this amulet puts you in danger of losing all your MP from a hard hit, this is still preferable to losing all your HP.\n\nAn [[amulet of controlled flight]] is good for [[the Swamp]], [[the Shoals]], and [[the Abyss]] if you have [[levitation]] but not [[Flight (spell)|flight]].\n\nA [[ring of teleport control]] is highly recommended in combination with the spell [[blink]] as a high-reliability means of escape, and to avoid getting surrounded by several dangerous enemies when stumbling upon teleport [[trap]]s.  \n\nA [[ring of magical power]] is one of the best choices of rings for aggressive spellcasters; when combined with an amulet of the guardian spirit, it also translates into an effective 9 extra HP.\n\n===Other===\nResist the temptation to carry lots of spellbooks around with you, as they weigh 7 aum each. Carry the spellbook you'll be memorizing your next spell from, a handful of emergency-use potions, and a couple of rations or other food. Put everything else in your [[stash]].  \n\nSpellcasters have limited need for wands, which weigh 10 aum each. A wand of teleportation or healing are good for emergencies, if you can find them; any [[conjuration]]-type wand is also good against dangerous enemies in the early game.\n\n==Gods==\n[[Sif Muna]] is the obvious choice for this character path; Deep Elves' proficiency in all spell schools makes the variety of spell books gifted by Sif quite valuable. [[Channel energy]] is also an excellent ability for an aggressive spellcaster, although a Staff of Channeling can substitute for it.\n\nUnfortunately, the spell [[Necromutation]] -- which is central to the Summoner/Necromancer portion of this character guide -- is rarely found outside the [[Necronomicon]], which Sif Muna does not grant.  The Necronomicon can often be found in the dungeon, a [[shop]], or in one of Sif's artifact books... but the only ''guaranteed'' way of getting it is to worship [[Kikubaaqudgha]]. Kiku's [[corpse]]-granting ability also serves as an alternative to energy channeling when combined with [[Sublimation of Blood]], making Kiku a plausible alternative to Sif.\n\n[[Vehumet]] is also a good choice, especially to acquire [[Mephitic Cloud]] early via a [[Book of Conjurations]] gift. Switching from Sif to Vehumet in the late game is also worth considering (once all desired spells have been gained from Sif's gifts); Vehumet boosts the power of conjurations and summonings and grants MP from killing monsters, making him more potent in dangerous settings such as [[Ziggurat]]s.\n\n==Stats==\nPut all your stat increases into Strength until you get it up to at least 8, so that you are not encumbered all the time. If you find a strength-granting artefact, you might be able to get away with less, but watch out for stat drains. Later you will have Flight and Necromutation, which will bring your carrying capacity up to about 500 aum.\n\nPut the remaining increases into Intelligence.  \n\n==Summoning==\n===General Use===\nChanging levels (i.e., going down a stairwell) is one of the most dangerous times for your character.  You might find yourself planted right next to a superdangerous [[unique]], who might take the opportunity to swat at you while you climb back up, then follow you upstairs to finish you off. Therefore, whenever taking a set of stairs for the first time (down ''or'' up), you should cast all the best [[charms]] on yourself that you can beforehand, and surround yourself with summoned allies that can keep your enemies distracted and distant. You can only take allies with you that are immediately next to you when you change levels. This limits you to eight allies, or fewer if there are walls next to the stairs. Take as many as you can.\n\n[[Recall]] is good for engaging monsters that are around corners; if you have several summoned allies somewhere on the level, they will surround you and extend past the corner, where they will engage the monster. Summoning new monsters can have the same effect -- especially Summon Elemental, which allows you to summon in a specific direction.\n\nDon't forget to 't'alk to your allies; even mindless ones will understand a command to attack. Without that command, most will cluster around you, doing nothing.\n\n===Weak Companions===\nThe lower-level summoning spells are not that useful, although [[Summon Butterflies]] is a fantastic means of escape; it instantly surrounds you with a two-tile deep cloud of butterflies which will get out of your way but not your attackers. The butterflies also interfere with ranged attacks, providing cover while you back away from a centaur or spellcaster. It's also a great means of finding teleport or zot [[trap]]s on the lower levels; summon up a cloud, then watch them flutter around a room and see if they hit anything (However, they will not set off dart, blade, alarm, etc. traps, or discover shafts, being flying creatures).\n\nIn a pinch, [[Summon Small Mammals]] can protect you in a similar manner; at the very least, they are good for blocking your enemies as you retreat through a corridor.\n\n===Summon Elemental===\n[[Summon Elemental]] is an excellent mid-game summoning spell. The type of elemental you summon depends on what type of tile is in the direction of your summon. An empty tile will produce an [[air elemental]]; a rock (not stone) tile will produce an [[earth elemental]]; lava or smoke will produce a [[fire elemental]]; and water will produce a [[water elemental]].\n\nFire elementals are weak. Water elementals are good but require a nearby water source. Air elementals are durable, hit hard, and are incredibly fast. A swarm of five or more can overcome just about any mid-game enemy. Being flying creatures, they are useful in any dungeon [[branch]], such as [[The Shoals]] or [[The Swamp]], and as an additional bonus, they're fast enough to keep up with you even when you're swift, flying, ''and'' hasted.\n\nThe biggest drawback is that you want to have a skill of 15 in Air Magic in order to summon ''friendly'' air elementals. Deep Elf Air Elementalists can usually achieve this by experience level 10 to 15, at which point they can conjure armies of air elementals. Air elementals are immune to electricity, which means you can fire [[Shock]] and [[Lightning Bolt]] through them with impunity. [[Airstrike]], another Air spell, is also great in combination with summons; its [[smite]] targeting allows you to avoid hitting your allies. Be careful to not summon air elementals if you do not have a means to defeat them, as you cannot outrun them, and they do hit quite hard. You may be able to get away using haste, [[Summon Butterflies]], and a nearby stairwell. As of 0.9, Airstrike is useless against renegade air elementals.\n\nAn [[evocable items#Air elemental fan|air elemental fan]] is a good way to generate lots of elementals without depleting your MP (you can, for instance, use it while waiting for your MP to recover). You must have about 5 levels of [[evocations]] before it is useful, as even at that level you will still fail to use it more than 90% of the time.\n\n[[Earth elemental]]s are also good companions; they are slow but hit very hard. Summoning an earth elemental is also a fast way to dig through a single rock (not stone) wall. You only need to have 5 levels of [[Earth Magic]] skill to maximize your chance of getting a friendly one (and they are easy to run away from anyway). However, earth magic is the opposite [[element]] from air magic, which means earth magic will train very slowly if you already have a lot of skill with air magic (and vice versa).\n\n===Haunt===\n[[Haunt]] is the unholy grail of summoning spells. It is the only summoning spell in the game that uses [[smite]] targeting: instead of surrounding you with summoned monsters, it surrounds your opponent with them. After 3-5 castings, an opponent is likely to be completely surrounded by nefarious spirits, and quite distracted as a result.\n\nIt comes with several drawbacks: casting it can make you [[sick]]; it has a high mana cost (7); and a high [[spell hunger]] cost. All of these drawbacks are almost completely negated by using Haunt in concert with [[Necromutation]]. In lich form, you cannot get sick and do not experience hunger from any source -- which means you can cast Haunt five to eight times in a row, channel energy repeatedly, and repeat the process every couple dozen turns or so. Few opponents will have any chance of resisting such an onslaught.\n\n===Shadow Creatures===\n[[Shadow Creatures]] will summon a single \"random encounter\" appropriate to the level you are on. On levels that have a mix of weak and dangerous monsters, this may or may not be useful. On D:10, for instance, you can get a large band of [[ogre]]s, including an [[ogre mage]]... or you can get a single [[hobgoblin]]. In the [[Realm of Zot]], where every monster is dangerous, it is extremely useful, despite the occasional [[moth of wrath]].\n\n===Summon Horrible Things===\n[[Summon Horrible Things]] is useful on levels that are home to weak \"random\" encounters but very strong special encounters, such as [[The Tomb]] or the last level of [[The Vaults]]. Shadow Creatures is not useful on such levels, and Haunt's progeny may struggle to take down [[guardian mummy|guardian mummies]] or large numbers of [[dragon]]s.\n\n==Late Game Skills==\nMost of the focus on necromancy in this character path involves two spells only: [[Necromutation]] and [[Haunt]]. To cast these spells effectively, you should have 15+ Necromancy and [[Transmutations]] skills (for Necromutation) and 15+ Necromancy and 10+ [[Summonings]] (for Haunt).\n\nA modest amount of [[Invocations]] skill is desirable once you start using [[channel energy]], and using channel energy is the best way to train it. Note that the only important skill levels here are the multiples of 4; you will get more mana per use at skill 4, 8, 12, and so on. Just 4 levels will let you recover your mana quickly in between fights, more will let you do so faster, perhaps even ''during'' the fight.\n\n[[Spellcasting]] should be trained all the way up to level 27. It influences your MP, the number of spells you can memorise, and your [[spell success]]. Deep Elves, with +4 proficiency at spellcasting, can reach 27 by the time they get to [[Zot:5]].\n\n[[Conjurations]] will cease to be important once you switch to a summoning-heavy strategy. You can usually turn it off once you've got Haunt mastered. Before then, though, [[Orb of Destruction]] is very, very useful against several dangerous [[unique]]s.\n\nGetting [[Air Magic]] up to about level 20 will allow you to cast [[Tornado]], one of the most fearsome offensive spells in the game. As a bonus, air elementals are immune to its damage, making summoning and tornadoes an excellent one-two punch.\n\n[[Category:Character guides]]"}

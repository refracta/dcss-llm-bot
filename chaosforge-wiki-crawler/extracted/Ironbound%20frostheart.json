{"title":"Ironbound frostheart","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ironbound_frostheart","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful info==\n'''Ironbound frosthearts''' are threatening ice mages guarding the [[Vaults]]. Like the player spell [[Frozen Ramparts]], Frosthearts can freeze the walls adjacent to the player to harm them. They inflict the [[Frozen]] status, slowing down player movement.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nThese enemies are dangerous when faced in conjunction with other Vaults denizens, who will swarm you or pelt you with missiles if you leave a corridor or chokepoint to avoid Creeping Frost. Disable them with hexes or break LOS with them to buy some time to deal with other enemies first. \n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|ironbound frosthearts will have HD 11 instead of 12, to compensate a buff to the Frozen status.}}\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Creeping Frost ignored cold resistance entirely.\n*Ironbound frosthearts were added in [[0.27]]."}

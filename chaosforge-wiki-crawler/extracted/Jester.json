{"title":"Jester","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Jester","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n'''Jester''' was a [[background]] that was briefly available in [[trunk]] for the week following April Fool's Day in 2013, shortly before the release of [[0.12]]. Their most distinct feature was that they started off worshiping [[Nemelex Xobeh]] while simultaneously being under penance from [[Xom]]. Starting equipment included a [[cap]], [[robe]], [[Book of Party Tricks]], [[quarterstaff]] of [[chaos]], and a stack of pies (see below for details).\n\nWhile jesters only existed briefly, many players pulled off successful jester ascensions, including a number of all-runers. Strangely enough, [[demigod]]s were able to select this background in spite of their normal religious restrictions. While not every species saw an ascending jester, most did.\n\n'''Jester''' is also a [[skill title|piety title]] for [[Nemelex]].\n\n==Unique Items==\nThe jester came with two items not available to any other character:\n\n*[[File:Cap Jester.png]] A +0 cap with a unique tile.\n\n*[[File:Pie.png]] A stack of 4 pies. Although they primarily functioned as [[food]] items which restored 1500 [[nutrition]], they also functioned as [[Throwing]] weapons which dealt damage on par with a [[dart]], weighed 0.6 [[aum]] each, and would temporarily [[blind]] the target you struck.\n\n{{flavour|A custard pie. It appears anachronistically dangerous.\n\n----\n\n\"And from that moment on I could not banish Oedipus's terrible end from my mind: putting his own eyes out with a pin after hearing those fateful words that Tiresias had uttered and being present when his mother hanged herself.\"\n\n-- Fernando Vidal Olmos, Report on the Blind Ernesto Sabato, On Heroes and Tombs, Translated by Helen R.

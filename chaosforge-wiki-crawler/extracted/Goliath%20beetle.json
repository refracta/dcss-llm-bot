It has high durability and a brutal attack, but can easily be outrun.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Low-level characters should [[kite]] it in order to avoid melee, or flee it outright if you don't have the patience to whittle it down with ranged attacks. If you need to melee one, attack and step back, forcing it to waste its turn catching up to you.\n*They are vulnerable to [[poison]], so hitting it with a few levels of poison will kill it more quickly than bashing away at it will. They also have low [[magic resistance]], making them easy to disable via [[Hexes]] or [[wand]]s.\n\n==History==\nGoliath beetles were removed in [[0.17]]."}

{"title":"Detect Creatures","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Detect_Creatures","type":"raw","data":"{{Obsolete}}\n\n'''Detect Creatures''' was a level 2 [[Divinations]] spell which allowed you to see monsters located beyond your field of vision within a certain radius. It wasn't entirely accurate, however; positions could be off by a tile, and it would only display the type of monster, not the specific monster ([[Sigmund]] would be displayed as a [[human (monster)|human]], an [[anaconda]] would be displayed as a snake, etc.). The spell would also reveal [[mimic]]s.\n\nIt was formerly found in the following [[spellbook]]s:\n*[[Book of Wizardry]]\n*[[Book of Divinations]]\n*[[Monster Manual]]\n\n==History==\nDetect Creatures was removed in [[0.6]] with the removal of the Divinations school of magic.\n\n[[Category:Spells]][[Category:Obsolete spells]][[Category:Divination]][[Category:Level 2 Spells]][[Category:Obsolete]]"}

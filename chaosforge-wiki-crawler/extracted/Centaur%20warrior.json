{"title":"Centaur warrior","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Centaur_warrior","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | centaurs}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Centaur warriors''' fight using the same tactics as standard [[centaur (monster)|centaurs]], but are an order of magnitude more dangerous. They have enough HP to take a few hits, and can easily deal over 30 damage per shot. They can be found in the mid-late [[Dungeon]] (usually accompanied by lesser centaurs) and [[the Vaults]] (in large packs of warriors).\n\nAs an enemy with the [[:Category:Archer flag|archer flag]], centaurs warriors deal up to 13 extra damage with ranged weapons.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They're gruesome at range, so lure them into melee to remove their biggest advantage. Take advantage of corners, [[confuse]] them, or use other tricks to make this less suicidal.\n*[[Repulsion]] can be a lifesaver for fragile characters here, if you have it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], centaur warriors did not have a kick attack in melee. \n:Unlike regular centaurs, their ranged damage wasn't reduced between versions. So due to the removal of monster weapon penalties in 0.27, centaur warriors became more dangerous."}

It doesn't work on you, so don't even try.}}\n\nA '''wand of polymorph other''' will attempt to transform the creature it hits into another form. Unless resisted, the creature will evaporate and reform as another random creature. The new form will be of similar (but on average slightly higher) HD to the old one, and be of the same holiness. Polymorph has no effect on undead, but demons can be affected (turning into other demons).\n\nNormal casters will lose their spells when polymorphed, and polymorph will never turn a monster into an \"actual\" spellcaster: you can get monsters with innate magical abilities such as [[dragon]]s, but not casters such as [[orc wizard]]s. Note that most demons' spells are considered innate abilities. Uniques will retain their name, and they will also retain their spells as long as they are polymorphed into a form that can speak.\n\nIt is very dangerous when used by monsters against the player since it causes one random bad [[mutation]] to be inflicted. This can only be resisted by [[mutation resistance]]; magic resistance has no effect.\n\n==Strategy==\nUse with caution. While this wand ''can'' turn dangerous monsters into creatures that are easier to deal with, it will backfire with some by turning them into even ''worse'' monsters.  Some examples of good and bad targets are:\n\n'''Good targets'''\n*[[Oklob plant]]s: You're likely to get a [[wandering mushroom]], which is generally much easier to deal with.\n*[[Yellow wasp]]s and [[red wasp]]s: For how dangerous they are, both of these monsters have fairly low HD and MR.\n*[[Harpy|Harpies]]: Another low-HD, low-MR annoyance, although considerably less dangerous than wasps.\n*[[Orc wizard]]s and [[orc priest]]s: Usually you'll have better ways to deal with these guys, but polymorph will tend to make them into something less dangerous.\n*[[Anaconda]]s: They have moderately high HD, but low MR, and whatever they polymorph into is at least likely to be something you can more easily escape from.\n*[[Unseen horror]]s: If you can get them in a corridor to line up the shot, this is a good way to make them visible.  Despite their name and glyph, they are natural monsters, and have only modest HD, making polymorph pretty safe.\n*[[Moth of wrath|Moths of wrath]]: They have ''very'' low MR for a Zot monster, and can be quite dangerous when they start berserking [[Orb Guardian]]s right next to you.  Polymorph is a good option for characters needing an instant way to take one out at range.\n\n'''Bad targets'''\n*[[Hydra]]s: High HD, meaning that it's not at all unlikely you could get a [[dragon]].  Most characters can run away from hydras, and should if they lack a means to kill them.\n*[[Death yak]]s: Also high HD, and have high magic resistance as well.\n*[[Ghost moth]]s: High enough MR that it's better to just kill them.\n*[[Grinder]]: You're fairly unlikely to make him lose his spells, and [[tormentor]]s and [[hellion]]s are probable results of polymorphing him.  Even [[hellephant]]s are possible.\n*[[Elephant slug]]s (including [[Gastronok]]).  They have HD 20.  This means you can produce [[titan]]s.  You don't want to produce titans.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.12]], the wand of polymorph other was replaced with the [[wand of polymorph]], a nicer version that did not inflict bad mutations.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Polymorph Other]]"}

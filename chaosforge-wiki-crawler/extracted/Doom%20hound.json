{"title":"Doom hound","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Doom_hound","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Doom hounds''' are [[demon]]ic [[list of canines|canines]] that roam the realm of [[Tartarus]] or under the companionship of [[Grunn]]. \n\nThey can use Doom Howl, which gives you the Howl status condition. For the next several turns, other denizens of Tartarus (such as [[putrid mouth]]s, [[shadow dragon]]s, [[tormentor]]s, or even [[Tzitzimimeh]]) will be called in to near your location. These reinforcements are not [[summon]]s, immune to [[abjuration]] and worth XP and [[piety]]. \n\nEach particular hound can only affect you once with Doom Howl. If you resist it with [[willpower]], the hound can continue to Doom Howl until it succeeds.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*With Will++++, Doom Howl has a <10% chance of success. With max willpower (Will+++++), Doom Howl can never succeed. But in Tartarus, willpower is halved - you won't have this amount of will in practice.\n*Doom hounds have very low will themselves, especially for the Hells. A simple [[wand of paralysis]] will shut them down long enough to smash them.\n*If you can't kill them before they get a howl off, try to retreat to an area where you can duck out of sight of any particularly nasty summons.\n*A [[potion of cancellation]] will remove the Howl status, if you're in a pinch.\n*Despite being named Doom ''Howl'', [[silence]] will not prevent this ability.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Doom Howl was not resisted by [[willpower]].\n*Doom hounds were introduced in [[0.18]]."}

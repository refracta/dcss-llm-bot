{"title":"Ogre","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ogre","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n''This page is about the player [[species]]. For the monster, see [[Ogre (monster)]]. For a list of all monstrous ogres, see [[List of ogres]].''\n{{flavour|Ogres are huge, chunky creatures who are very strong and robust, but are not nimble at all. They possess a raw talent for magic, but are poor at making use of magical devices. Ogres mature almost as quickly as Humans.\n\nTheir preferred methods of avoiding beatings are dodging and the use of shields, but they can also use armours made from magical hides, since these accommodate their large frames. Ogres are proficient at using all types of melee weapons, yet all sophisticated forms of missile combat are too awkward for them. They are, however, good at throwing things, in particular boulders.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*Ogres are '''[[Size#Player Sizes|large]]''' species:\n**Like all large creatures, they receive an [[EV]] and [[Dodging]] penalty.\n**Unlike regular sized species, they can use [[giant club]]s,  [[giant spiked club]]s, and [[large rock]]s.\n**Their bodies do not fit into [[boots]], [[gloves]], [[helmet]]s, or most [[body armour]] (they can only wear [[robe]]s, [[animal skin]]s, [[troll leather armour]], and [[dragon scales]]). In addition, [[buckler]]s are too small for them to use.\n**They can attack and move normally in [[shallow water]].\n*'''[[Tough_Skin|Tough Skin 1]]''': Ogres have +1 [[AC]].\n\nOgres have a base [[Strength]] of 11, [[Intelligence]] of 9, and [[Dexterity]] of 4 (before Background modifiers) and normal base [[magic points]].\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Warriors:''' [[Gladiator]]\n*'''Zealots:''' [[Berserker]], [[Cinder Acolyte]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Hedge Wizard]], [[Fire Elementalist]], [[Air Elementalist]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[strength]] every 3rd level.\n*30% more [[hit points]] than average.\n*+4 [[willpower]] per level.\n\n==Starting Skills and Equipment==\nOgres start with the skills and equipment listed for their background, with the following exceptions:\n*Incompatible body armour is replaced with an [[animal skin]] or [[robe]]. \n*[[Helmet]]s are replaced with [[hat]]s.\n*[[Buckler]]s are replaced with [[kite shield]]s.\n*Any [[Armour]] skill is replaced by [[Dodging]].\n*[[Javelin]]s are replaced with [[large rock]]s.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Moderate}}\n\nOgres have a number of advantages, offset by a similar amount of disadvantages. They have immense HP, and train Fighting faster than any other species. But for a good chunk of the game, Ogres have miserable [[AC]] (can't wear most armour) and [[EV]] (large size, poor dex). On the flip side, they are one of the few species that can wield [[giant club]]s and throw [[large rock]]s.\n\nOgres make for good spellcasters, being a large, +30% HP race which is adept at learning magic. They learn all schools equally well, with good Spellcasting skill, and a very minor (-1) aptitude penalty to the other magic schools.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Ogre}}\n\n==Strategy==\nOgres have many different options for skill training:\n\n*[[Large rock]]s are deadly. An unskilled user takes 20 aut to throw one - that's 2 full turns. But even at 0 skill, they can be used to kill melee enemies (just mind the delay). A highly skilled user will throw large rocks quickly, which can be devastating. As a side benefit, large rocks are more common and less likely to [[mulch]] than [[javelin]]s and [[boomerang]]s, ''combined''.<ref>[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-SfdqTkjUkQ9kB9hyJTqt7grYzSDibv-XpPbEEFinCQ/edit#gid=523653744 Objstats 0.29 (Spider + Shoals)]</ref>\n\n*[[Giant club]]s and [[giant spiked club]]s are the strongest melee weapons, but they aren't without drawbacks. Giant clubs are two-handed, which means no shield. This can be an issue, especially as Ogres are often stuck with low AC and low EV. They also take considerable skill training to use effectively.\n\n*Ogres are one of the best choices for a high-durability caster. They have +30% HP, but limited body armour, as well as decent magical aptitudes. They work well as both \"pure\" casters and hybrids.\n\nOther than that, Ogres generally like [[shield]]s, as their high strength helps deal with the encumbrance.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], Ogres were replaced with [[Oni]], a similar large-sized species.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], [[size#Large|large]] species, including ogres, could wield [[shield]]s more easily, received slightly less SH from [[kite shield]]s, and moved slowly in shallow water. \n*Prior to [[0.29]], Ogres had a -2 [[Shields]] aptitude. This was buffed due to the nerf to large-size shield wearing in 0.28.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], Ogres had +3 [[Maces & Flails]] aptitude, and were much worse with magic skills.  In 0.20 they were reworked to make their weapon choice less of a \"no-brainer\" and allow easier access to magic skills.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Ogres started with an extra [[bread ration]]. Also, ogre hunters and artificers began with a [[club]] instead of a [[short sword]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Ogres had [[Saprovore]] 1 and [[Fast Metabolism]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Ogre Hunters and Artificers began with a [[short sword]] instead of a [[club]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{species}}"}

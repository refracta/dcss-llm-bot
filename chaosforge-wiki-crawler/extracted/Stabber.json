{"title":"Stabber","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Stabber","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\nMonsters with the '''Stabber''' flag will try to maintain their distance (using ranged attacks) until such a time as their target is incapacitated, at which time they switch to melee to attack their target. Stabbers without a means of ranged attack will assume normal monster behavior. These monsters also bypass half the target's [[AC]] on stabs.\n\nIn past versions, [[spriggan enchanter]]s and [[spriggan assassin]]s had this flag.\n\n*[[:Category:Stabber|List of monsters with this flag]]\n\n==History==\nThis flag was added in [[0.13]]."}

{"title":"Speed running","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Speed_running","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n'''Speed running''' is a type of informal conduct designed to test a player's skill, creativity, resourcefulness, or, perhaps most importantly, luck. There are two types of speedruns: real time (clock time) and turn count. Either way, you try and [[Ascension|ascend]] with the fastest/lowest time possible.\n\n==How Fast is Fast?==\nAscensions are typically completed in 60,000 to 160,000 turns and can take a few hours to days depending on the play style. A speed run in real time will aim for less than 3 hours of play time. Turn count speed runs are typically below 30,000 turns. This, of course, is where you obtain only 3 runes.\n\n==Real Time==\n*Melee is heavily prefered - Spells are just way too thoughtful, and MP runs out too quickly, to really consider. Meanwhile, melee has access to [[Axes]], whose 8-tile [[cleave]] mows down monsters even in the most crowded situations. Traditionally \"overpowered\" species like [[Minotaur]] and [[Gargoyle]] reign supreme.\n*[[o|Autoexplore]] and [[tab|autofight]] are your friends!\n*You don't have to explore every level; even when autoexploring, it wastes valuable time.\n**''Exactly'' how much have to explore is fairly arbitrary - it depends on lots of luck!\n**In a similar vein, the [[Orcish Mines]] and even [[Vaults]] are completely optional to clear. You might visit them to get a specific item, or if you are ill-prepared for the challenges ahead.\n*Use [http://crawl.akrasiac.org/docs/macros_guide.txt macros] and [http://crawl.akrasiac.org/docs/options_guide.txt rc file options] in order to automate less useful tasks. For example, you can set emergency items like [[scrolls of blinking]] and [[potions of haste]] to specific keys with either <code>item_slot ^= <item>:<letter></code> or <code>autoinscribe += <item>:@<command><key></code>.\n*Don't be afraid of dying (unless this is for a tournament). The best runs were done over and over again, hoping for a good enough RNG to pass through.\n\n===Top Runs & Version===\n*[[Deep Dwarf]] [[Fighter]] of [[Makhleb]] of [[0.26]] and earlier is a popular choice, and one that currently holds the [http://crawl.xtahua.com/crawl/morgue/EnegeticOcto/morgue-EnegeticOcto-20201105-111727.txt world record], by EnegeticOcto. It lasted 17:37 and was done on Nov. 5, 2020.\n**Deep Dwarves' stats and heal wounds ability lets you win fights otherwise much too [[out of depth]], Fighter gives immediately strong gear and a one time out in a [[potion of might]], and Makhleb makes up for your lack of passive regeneration. Deep Dwarf was removed in [[0.29]].\n**\" Turns out d4 [[arga]] into d7 [[Gauntlets of War|gauntlets of war]] is good... who knew :) \"\n'''Version:'''\n*0.27 buffed monster weapon speed & damage (most impactful early), but more importantly, ''halved'' Makhleb's healing rate.\n*0.26 was the latest [[trunk]] version at the time, but also removed the marginally annoying [[food]] system.\n\n==Low Turn Count==\n* Health is an incredibly valuable resource; [[wait|resting]] takes up hundreds of turns normally. Try to avoid that as much as possible by exploring, potentially at floors you've skipped, at low health. [[Meteorae]] regenerate rapidly by exploring, and dominate as a result. The fast-regenerating [[Vine Stalker]] is helpful, but most other melee races can still do fine. [[Jiyva]], if you are lucky enough to find it early, greatly boosts regeneration.\n**For normally regenerating species, [[bread swinging]] - or swinging a non-weapon over and over - will cause you to waste more time (regenerating more) for the same amount of turns.\n**[[Cheibriados]] lets you explore to the same effect, with a noticeable stat boost and [[LOS]]-wide attack in Slouch. However, its impact matters less for a 3 rune game. \n*Careful movement is a must; autoexplore is very inefficient.\n**Even when scrounging for resources, it isn't good to travel over half the floor for a few segments of unexplored dungeon.\n**Skipping floors is even more important than during real time runs. Floors will always take hundreds of turns to clear.\n* Try to avoid backtracking. The best runs should try and go from the Lair immediately to the rune branches, with all the skill/items that requires.\n**The [[Delver]] class allows you find an altar quickly, and even skip the first 4 floors entirely - at least, until the [[orb run]]. However, it's very unreliable, especially without the power of [[Deep Dwarf]].\n\n===Top Runs & Version===\n*The current [https://crawl.xtahua.com/crawl/morgue/Sapher/morgue-Sapher-20230311-174230.txt world record run], done in 0.29.1 by Sapher on March 11 2023, was a [[Meteoran]] [[Earth Elementalist]]. Sapher won in 4603 turns, improving the [https://cbro.berotato.org/morgue/FizzleBangTC/morgue-FizzleBangTC-20230215-062950.txt previous world record] by 239 turns.\n**[[Meteoran]] is a species that focuses on turn count, due to its ultra-fast explore regeneration of HP and MP and, also, amazing stats and aptitudes.\n**[[Cheibriados]] was used for boosting the stats and for Slouch/Step from Time abilities.\n**Unlike the previous world record, this run had only 33 casts of [[Simulacrum]]. Sapher didn't use allies much and relied on [[Storm Form]] and [[Manifold Assault]] for dealing damage instead.\n**Extensive use of [[Passwall]] and [[Passage of Golubria]] allowed to shave the number of turns even further.\n\n==Rune Strategy==\n*The Slimy rune is often the most reliable 3rd rune. Even low level players can tackle [[The Royal Jelly]] with items like [[throwing net]]s, [[javelin]]s, and/or a [[scroll of immolation]]. See [[TRJ]]'s page for more details.\n*The Abyssal rune is convenient if you happen to get [[banish]]ed. Forceful banishment (including from [[distortion]]) also plunges you deeper into the Abyss. If you've preserved a few [[scrolls of blinking]], grabbing the rune should be possible. Finding the rune itself is a measure of luck, but its potential speed might make it even faster than Slime.\n*Most of the time, the Silver (Vaults) rune is inefficient. Not only do you have to go through all 5 floors of a fairly large branch, but even if you cleared Vaults:1-4, V:5 isn't easy to skip. [[Vault warden]]s might lock out the stairs above, while fake runes serve to deter ninjas even more.\n\n==See Also==\n*For an up to date list of speedruns see the following links:\n** [http://crawl.akrasiac.org/scoring/fastest-wins-time.html Fastest wins (time)]\n** [http://crawl.akrasiac.org/scoring/fastest-wins-turns.html Fastest wins (turns)]\n*[[Score]] - turn count speedruns, for all 15 runes.\n*Top Runs:\n**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X0y6V2Iemg Video of current Time WR]\n**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpNFG42ZSd0 Replay of a former Turn Count WR (DDDe)]\n*Commentary:\n**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPRtaH7EJ0 Video commentary of another former WR run (DDDe, turn count)]\n\n==History==\n*[[0.29]] Removed [[Deep Dwarf]], added turn-count focused [[Meteoran]]. [[Ranged weapon]]s reworked and no longer need [[ammo]]. [[Abyss]]' rune location now sensed instead of being pure RNG. [[Lair]] shortened a floor. Introduction of [[attacks of opportunity]] as well as background/consumable drop buffs and a few new items.\n*[[0.28]] Reworked [[Jiyva]] gives regeneration, even to DD. Spider reworked. The Depths shortened by a floor. Fixed quiver bug.\n*[[0.27]] [[Makhleb]] healing dramatically nerfed, impacting the heavily reliant Deep Dwarf. Equipment now autoidentified, [[curse]]s and negative gear removed. Weapon-wielding monsters don't attack slower anymore. Throwing ammunition reduced in quantity.\n*[[0.26]] Tedious [[food]] system removed. Addition of [[Delver]], which skips the first 5 floors of the Dungeon. New [[quiver]] introduces bug where a quivered god ability can be used even if you switch gods (say, to [[Uskayaw]]). Swamp reworked. Removal of [[Sticks to Snakes]] (and [[scroll of immolation|immolation]] \"snakebombing\"), [[Summon Butterflies]]. [[Scrolls of blinking]] usable as an escape while in [[Zot]]/[[orb run]].\n*[[0.25]] All [[summon]]s can be [[scroll of immolation|immolated]]. Removal of (most) dangerous [[amulet]]s.\n*[[0.24]] [[Throwing]] rework gives [[javelin]]s piercing and [[boomerang]]s returning, further buffed with the [[silver]] brand.\n*[[0.21]] [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]] introduced; in this version only, was stronger and available to the [[Necromancer]] start.\n*[[0.19]] [[Lair]] shortened 2 floors, [[Slime Pits]] shortened by 1.\n*[[0.12]] introduced [[cleaving]] to all Axes.\n*Autoexplore was conceptualized in the roots of ''Stone Soup'', while [[0.6]] introduced autofight.\n\n[[Category:Strategy_Guides]]"}

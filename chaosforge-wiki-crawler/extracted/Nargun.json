{"title":"Nargun","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Nargun","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Narguns''' are found in [[Cocytus]]. They have high melee damage, but tend to have their ability to use it restricted by Cocytusâ€™s layout of [[deep water]] lakes and rivers. Instead, they prefer to attempt to [[petrify]] you, causing almost certain death if other dangerous Cocytus enemies (such as [[hellion]]s and [[wendigo]]s) surround you.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Petrification immunity (granted by [[Statue Form]], [[Storm Form]] or being a [[gargoyle]]) will render them utterly trivial.\n*Otherwise, stacking Willpower is extremely important to avoid the extreme amounts of damage caused by being pelted with [[seracfall]]s and AC-ignoring [[damnation]] while you are forced to stand still.\n*Narguns ''can'' be irresistibly damaged by [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]], but the shrapnel they spray deals [[cold]] damage, which is virtually useless against most denizens of Cocytus.\n\n==History==\nNarguns were added in [[0.28]]."}

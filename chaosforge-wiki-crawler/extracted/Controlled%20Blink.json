Be wary that controlled translocations will cause the subject to become contaminated with magical energy.}}\n\n'''Controlled Blink''' is a level 8 [[Translocations]] spell which warps you to a nearby open space of your choice in your [[line of sight]]. The space must be somewhere visible, not deep water or lava, and cannot be behind a translucent wall. \n\nWhile exploring the [[Realm of Zot]] or while carrying the [[Orb of Zot]], Controlled Blink functions like a plain, uncontrolled [[Blink]].\n\n==Strategy==\nUsually too expensive to train for a 3 rune game, but it's an excellent escape spell for [[extended]]. Keep in mind that [[Passage of Golubria]] exists, and with a bit of pre-planning, can be used to a similar effect. The benefit of Controlled Blink is that it works in emergencies.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n* For stabbers, it can be very useful to know the noise grid of this spell. The \"@\" character is the position where you land after blinking, and the \"§\" characters are cells where the noise will be heard.\n\n<pre>\n<nowiki>\n.........\n....§....\n..§§§§§..\n..§§§§§..\n.§§§@§§§.\n..§§§§§..\n..§§§§§..\n....§....\n.........\n</nowiki>\n</pre>\n\n== History ==\n*Controlled Blink was removed in [[0.26]]. Controlled Blink's effect can still be found on the [[scroll of blinking]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Controlled Blink was a level 7 spell. Additionally, use of this spell on levels that prevented [[teleport control]], such as [[The Tomb]] and final levels of a [[Ziggurat]], resulted in an uncontrolled Blink. \n*In [[0.6]], you couldn't blink into deep water even as a [[merfolk]] unless you were levitating.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], Controlled Blink was noisier than [[Blink]] and could wake everything within radius 7."}

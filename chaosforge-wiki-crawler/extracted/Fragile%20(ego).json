{"title":"Fragile (ego)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fragile_(ego)","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n{{flavour|It will be destroyed if unequipped.}}\n[[Fragile]] is a negative [[property]] that generates exclusively on some powerful [[artefacts]]. Unequipping or unwielding an item with this property will permanently destroy it.\n\nThe game will display a warning prompt before attempting to remove or unwield a fragile item.\n\n==Desirability==\nFragile artefacts tend to have more powerful properties than similar artefacts of the same type, but their obvious downside is their inability to swap them out for other items. This makes them a poor choice for [[ranged]] weapons and some [[melee]] weapons, but a potential option for some [[jewellery]] and [[armour]]s, depending on the other properties or egos that generate alongside it.\n\nWhile this property is fairly uncommon, it is a good practice to [[scroll of identify|identify]] any desirable unknown artefact before equipping it; once a fragile item is removed, it is unrecoverable. \n\n==See Also==\n*[[Randart]]\n\n==History==\n*Fragile was added in [[0.18]]."}

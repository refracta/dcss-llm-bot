{"title":"Komodo dragon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Komodo_dragon","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Komodo dragons''' are somewhat dangerous lizards with a vicious bite. They are commonly found in [[the Lair]] and around its entrance.\n\nKomodo dragons are a species of reptile, not an actual [[dragon]]. They don't have a [[breath]] attack and aren't affected by [[Wyrmbane]]'s [[dragon slaying]] brand.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Komodo dragons can prove dangerous for characters first entering the Lair. Soften them up from a distance, particularly if you have [[poison]] available.\n*Heavily armored characters can go toe-to-toe with them relatively easily, though their bites can still take a sizable chunk of HP off. Consider backing away if you encounter them with another threat, like a herd of [[yak]]s or a [[hydra]].\n*Alternatively, if you lack the killing power to take them out swiftly, this is a perfect time to exercise discretion and leave it for later. It moves as fast as the average player on land, so escaping before the fight breaks out shouldn't be too hard.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.15]], komodo dragons did less damage, but could quickly make you extremely [[sick]]."}

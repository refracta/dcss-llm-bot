With 10,000 [[HP]] and extreme defenses, it probably won't die anytime soon. Test spawners only exist when manually generated in [[Wizard mode]] or [[the Arena]].\n\n<!--spl-bot-begin-->\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster3\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Shadow Creatures]]\n|flags1={{Demonic slot flag}}\n|slot2=[[Plane Rend]]\n|flags2={{Demonic slot flag}}\n|slot3=[[Phantom Mirror]]\n|flags3={{Demonic slot flag}}\n}}\n{{clear}}\n<!--spl-bot-end-->\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The developer [[Devteam|sorear]] once killed one in the Arena with 99 [[daeva]]s. Being completely surrounded by a horde of creatures prevented the test spawner from summoning, at which point the daeva army just gradually wore it down with irresistible [[Smite|smiting]] attacks.\n*Test spawners aren't immune to [[instakill]] attacks. The [[Axe of Woe]] does the trick, as will [[Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling]], [[Uskayaw]]'s Grand Finale, etc.\n*If you want 2 test spawners to fight each other in the Arena, try using arena:small. You may need to spawn multiple test spawners so that they are actually in [[LOS]] of each other."}

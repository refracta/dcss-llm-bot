{"title":"Large abomination","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Large_abomination","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Large abominations''' are enormous piles of roughly connected humanoid body parts, and much more dangerous than their [[small abomination|smaller]] counterparts. They spawn with haste, might, or regeneration as a permanent buff. No matter their buff, they always deal significant damage in melee. They are often found in [[the Abyss]] and occasionally in parts of [[Pandemonium]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Their [[willpower]] is moderately high: don't expect [[Hexes]] or hex [[wand]]s to do much unless they are at high power.\n*They are vulnerable to [[Dispel Undead]].\n\n==Alternate Tiles==\nBeing haphazard collections of random body parts, large abominations can take many forms:\n\n[[Image:Abomination large.png]]  [[Image:Abomination large1.png]] [[Image:Abomination large2.png]] [[Image:Abomination large3.png]] [[Image:Abomination large4.png]] [[Image:Abomination large5.png]] [[Image:Abomination large6.png]] [[Image:Abomination large7.png]] [[Image:Abomination large8.png]] [[Image:Large abomination.png]]\n\nIn console, they can be any manner of colors. Neither the alternate tiles nor colors indicate anything about their stats.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], large abominations had randomized attributes instead of spawning with a permanent buff. Also, they did not regenerate.\n*Prior to [[0.31]], large abominations had randomized speed (6-12).\n*Prior to [[0.27]], large abominations could heal by merging with [[crawling corpse]]s and [[macabre mass]]es. Also, monsters could cast [[Twisted Resurrection]] to create large abominations.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], players could also cast Twisted Resurrection.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], abominations could regenerate naturally."}

{"title":"Summon Spectral Orcs","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summon_Spectral_Orcs","type":"raw","data":"{{version017}}\n{{flavour|Summons between one and three spectral orcs, specialised for melee combat and equipped with spectral weaponry and armour.}}\n\n'''Summon Spectral Orcs''' is a monsters-only spell which functions like a weakened [[Haunt]], summoning 1-3 [[orc]]ish [[spectral thing]]s into existence. Like Haunt, the spell spawns the resulting monsters centered upon on its targets' tile:\n*Spectral [[orc warrior]] (50% chance)\n*Spectral [[orc]] (30%)\n*Spectral [[orc knight]] (16.7%)\n*Spectral [[orc warlord]] (3.3%)\n\nThe threat posed by these specters varies greatly based on what gets summoned; a few orc warriors are nothing to worry about, but a single orc warlord can be devastatingly powerful, especially considering that it comes with [[draining (brand)|draining]]-[[brand]]ed attacks. Annoying though it may be, examine the creatures this spell summons before deciding how to act.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

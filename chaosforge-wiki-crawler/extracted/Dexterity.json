{"title":"Dexterity","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dexterity","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n\n'''Dexterity''' (or DEX) is one of a character's three main [[attributes]], along with [[strength]] and [[intelligence]]. It is important if you want to have high evasion.\n\nDexterity affects the following:\n*Increases damage of certain weapons ([[Short Blades]], [[Long Blades]], [[Ranged Weapons]]).\n*Increases the effect of [[Dodging]] skill on evasion.\n*Increases the chances to [[stab]] monsters.\n*Slightly increases your [[SH]] bonus with [[shields]].\n*Slightly increases [[stealth]].\n*Very slightly increases [[to-hit|accuracy]] in combat.\n\nDexterity is a generally useful defensive stat, though strength is often more impactful for heavy armour characters, and intelligence for dedicated spellcasters.\n\nIf your dexterity is ever reduced to 0 or lower, you will suffer [[stat zero]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nIn detail, dexterity does the following:\n\n* Weapon damage: +2.5% damage per point, where 100% damage = 10 DEX.\n* Dodging: Dodging skill gives a bonus of <code>0.8 * DEX * Dodging / (20 - size)</code> EV, i.e. dexterity acts as a multiplier.\n* Stabbing: The chance to make a low-tier stab is increased by +(DEX)%.\n* Stealth: +3 to stealth score per point. For reference, boots of [[Ego#Stealth|stealth]] give +50.\n* Shields: Bonus of <code>DEX * 38 * (base_SH + 13) / 5200</code> SH. Roughly equal to (7.3% of base SH) + 0.95 SH every 10 points.\n* Accuracy: +0.5 [[to-hit]] per point.\n\nUnlike strength and intelligence, dexterity has no diminishing return - every point of DEX gives the same benefit. Also, the effect of dexterity scales with your [[Dodging]] skill. At 5 Dodging skill, you might get 5 DEX = 0.2 EV; at 25 skill, that increases to 1 DEX = 1 EV.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Short Blades, Long Blades, and [[ranged weapons]] scaled with strength instead of dexterity.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], dexterity increased the chance of doing [[auxiliary attack]]s, and DEX was not the sole stat to increase [[SH]] with [[shield]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], dexterity had a stepdown; DEX values above 24 were less effective at raising EV. In addition, EV had another stepdown; getting EV values above 30 was more difficult. See [[Dodging#History|Dodging]] and [[Evasion#History|Evasion]] for more details.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], each weapon type had a strength weight that determined how much dexterity contributed to damage and accuracy. Now dexterity increases accuracy equally for all weapons, and does not affect damage.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Dexterity affected the chance of [[door]]s [[noise|creaking]].\n\n[[Category:Stats]]"}

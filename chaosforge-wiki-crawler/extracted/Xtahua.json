{"title":"Xtahua","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Xtahua","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | dragons}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Xtahua the Ancient''' is a [[unique]] [[fire dragon]], much more durable than normal and with upscaled physical and fire attacks. Unlike standard fire dragons, Xtahua can destroy any [[door]]s in their way, and their breath attack leaves a [[cloud]] of fire at the end of its range. If Xtahua drops [[fire dragon scales]] when they are killed, they will be inscribed and pre-enchanted.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Depths]]:3-5\n*[[The Vaults]]:2-5\n*[[The Crypt]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Xtahua can conceivably one-shot fragile, unprepared characters, and even beefier characters can't stand up to too much of their fire breath. Pile on the fire resistance and deal your damage quickly, as they're still a menace in melee range.\n*Xtahua's searing breath will leave a cloud of fire at the end of its path. Try not to get backed against a wall or into a corner unless you think you can handle fighting while standing in fire. Also, be aware that Xtahua can and will trample you backwards into the flames.\n*If at all possible, use [[freezing]] weapons or [[Ice Magic]] to take advantage of Xtahua's vulnerability, but avoid fire and [[poison]].\n*Make sure you have enough [[willpower]] to avoid getting paralyzed; Will+++ is generally enough.\n*[[Repel Missiles#Player sources|RMsl]] can come in handy here, if you have it to hand.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.31|Xtahua will get stronger melee attacks (35 and 17 -> 44 and 20 damage), almost double HP, and more defenses (15 -> 18 AC).}}\n*Xtahua was female before version [[0.24]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Xtahua's breath attack did not leave a fire cloud, and she only opened doors instead of destroying them.\n*In an ancient version of Crawl, Xtahua was male."}

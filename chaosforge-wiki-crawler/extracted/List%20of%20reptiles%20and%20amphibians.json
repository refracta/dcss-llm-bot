{"title":"List of reptiles and amphibians","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_reptiles_and_amphibians","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\nWhile most adventurers dream of engaging in thrilling battle with [[list of dragons|dragons]], the many '''reptiles and amphibians''' of the [[Dungeon]] are still fierce foes for the aspiring hero. While they don't have any breath weapons, their bites are usually dangerous, and many of them are comfortable swimming through [[water]]. Fortunately, they are all [[cold-blooded]], making [[cold]] damage particularly useful for fighting them.\n\nReptiles and amphibians are most common around the [[Lair]] and its branches, being replaced by greater, more intelligent threats later in the dungeon. The [[Snake Pit]] is, unsurprisingly, full of snakes in addition to their [[list of nagas|snakemen]] masters.\n\n==Amphibian Types==\n{{monsterlink|Bullfrog}} - Although fast, these oversized frogs are more often delicacies than dangers.\n\n{{monsterlink|Cane toad}} - Slower and tougher than frogs, their powerful attacks are laced with deadly [[poison]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Blink frog}} - Interdimensional pack hunters who swarm and devour careless players while [[blink]]ing incessantly.\n\n{{monsterlink|Goliath frog}} - These [[swamp]]-dwellers lash prey from afar with their [[acid]]ic tongues.\n<div id=\"Amphibians\"></div>\n\n===Unique Amphibian===\n{{monsterlink|Prince Ribbit}} - A human prince who was cursed to be a frog... and was also cursed to blink between dimensions? Regardless, he's got a vicious bite.\n\n==Lizard Types==\n{{monsterlink|Frilled lizard}} - One of the flimsiest opponents in the game, the only thing separating them from [[rat]]s is their ability to swim.\n\n{{monsterlink|Iguana}} - These ill-tempered reptiles pack a bite worth keeping clear of.\n\n{{monsterlink|Basilisk}} - Dreaded creatures of legend with a [[petrify]]ing gaze.\n\n{{monsterlink|Komodo dragon}} - Oversized lizards with a particularly powerful bite.\n\n{{monsterlink|Alligator}} - Enormous beasts capable of surprising speed; their jaws and tail make short work of the poorly defended.\n\n==Snake Types==\n{{flavour|\"The latter lived in the country, and before his house there was an oak, in which there was a lair of snakes. His servants killed the snakes, but Melampus gathered wood and burnt the reptiles, and reared the young ones. And when the young were full grown, they stood beside him at each of his shoulders as he slept, and they purged his ears with their tongues. He started up in a great fright, but understood the voices of the birds flying overhead, and from what he learned from them he foretold to men what should come to pass.\"\n\n-Apollodorus (apocryphal), Library and Epitome, 1.9.11. circa 150 BC.

Moderately dangerous alone, but can [[Blink Other Close|teleport their allies]] to surround their foes.\n\n{{monsterlink|Lava snake}}- Unnatural magma-dwelling snakes that spit globs of molten stone at passing adventurers.\n\n===Unique Snake===\n{{monsterlink|Aizul}}- A dishonoured guardian serpent who fell asleep on the job.

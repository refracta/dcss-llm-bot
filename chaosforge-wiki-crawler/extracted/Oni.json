{"title":"Oni","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Oni","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|Oni are large, rowdy creatures who love a good fight. They are exceptionally strong and robust, and their fondness for drink allows them to heal twice as much from healing potions and even perform free melee swings around themselves while they chug them.\n\nThey are proficient with most melee weapons and forms of magic, but lack the dexterity or inclination to use ranged weapons or magical devices well. They are, however, good at throwing things, in particular large rocks.\n\nTheir large size prevents them from wearing most forms of armour, and are poor at dodging, relying on their enormous bulk to survive battles instead.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*Oni are '''[[Size#Player Sizes|large]]''' species:\n**Like all large creatures, they receive an [[EV]] and [[Dodging]] penalty.\n**Unlike regular sized species, they can use [[giant club]]s,  [[giant spiked club]]s, and [[large rock]]s.\n**Their bodies do not fit into [[boots]], [[gloves]], [[helmet]]s, or most [[body armour]] (they can only wear [[robe]]s, [[animal skin]]s, [[troll leather armour]], and [[dragon scales]]). In addition, [[buckler]]s are too small for them to use.\n**They can attack and move normally in [[shallow water]].\n*'''[[Horns|Horns 1]]''': Oni can make an [[auxiliary]] headbutt attack in melee.\n*'''[[Tough_Skin|Tough Skin 1]]''': Oni have +1 [[AC]].\n*'''[[Double Potion Healing]]''': Oni restore twice as much health and magic when drinking potions. [[Potion of mutation|Potions of mutation]] are also slightly improved.\n*'''[[Drunken Brawling]]''': When drinking a potion that restores HP or MP, Oni make a free melee attack against all adjacent enemies. This includes [[potions of curing]], [[potion of heal wounds|heal wounds]], [[potion of magic|magic]], and [[potion of ambrosia|ambrosia]]. Unlike [[cleaving]], there is no damage penalty. \n\nNote that effects from [[Gozag]]'s Potion Petition are not doubled, nor do they trigger Drunken Brawling.\n\nOni have a base [[Strength]] of 11, [[Intelligence]] of 9, and [[Dexterity]] of 4 (before Background modifiers) and normal base [[magic points]].\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Warriors:''' [[Gladiator]]\n*'''Zealots:''' [[Berserker]], [[Cinder Acolyte]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Hedge Wizard]], [[Fire Elementalist]], [[Air Elementalist]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[strength]] every 3rd level.\n*30% more [[hit points]] than average.\n*+4 [[willpower]] per level.\n\n==Starting Skills and Equipment==\nOni start with the skills and equipment listed for their background, with the following exceptions:\n*Incompatible body armour is replaced with an [[animal skin]] or [[robe]]. \n*[[Helmet]]s are replaced with [[hat]]s.\n*[[Buckler]]s are replaced with [[kite shield]]s.\n*Any [[Armour]] skill is replaced by [[Dodging]].\n*[[Javelin]]s are replaced with [[large rock]]s.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Moderate}}\n\nOni have a number of advantages, offset by a similar amount of disadvantages. They have immense HP, heal more from potions, and train Fighting faster than any other species. But for a good chunk of the game, Oni have miserable [[AC]] (can't wear most armour) and [[EV]] (large size, poor dex). On the flip side, they are one of the few species that can wield [[giant club]]s and throw [[large rock]]s.\n\nOni make for good spellcasters, being a large, +30% HP race which is adept at learning magic. They learn all schools equally well, with good Spellcasting skill, and a very minor (-1) aptitude penalty to the other magic schools.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Oni}}\n\n==Strategy==\nOni have many different options for skill training:\n\n*[[Large rock]]s are deadly. An unskilled user takes 20 aut to throw one - that's 2 full turns. But even at 0 skill, they can be used to kill melee enemies (just mind the delay). A highly skilled user will throw large rocks quickly, which can be devastating. As a side benefit, large rocks are more common and less likely to [[mulch]] than [[javelin]]s and [[boomerang]]s, ''combined''.\n*[[Giant club]]s and [[giant spiked club]]s are the strongest melee weapons, but they aren't without drawbacks. Giant clubs are two-handed, which means no shield. This can be an issue, especially as Oni are often stuck with low AC and low EV. They also take considerable skill training to use effectively.\n*Oni are one of the best choices for a high-durability caster. They have +30% HP, but limited body armour, as well as decent magical aptitudes. They work well as both \"pure\" casters and hybrids.\n\nOther than that, Oni generally like [[shield]]s, as their high strength helps deal with the encumbrance.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Oni will no longer gain an extra benefit from potions of mutation.}}\n*In [[0.31]], Oni were added, replacing [[Ogre]]s.\n\n{{species}}"}

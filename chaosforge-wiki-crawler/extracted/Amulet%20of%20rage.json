This vastly increases your combat capabilities for a short while, but leaves you penalized afterwards (see the [[berserk]] article for more details).\n\n{{crawlquote|'''Success Rate''': 50 + 2Ã—[[Evocations]] > (3d100)/3<br>'''Cost''': 2 MP, and you lose 600 [[nutrition]] when it ends}}\n\n[[File:rage_evoc.png]]\n\n[[Formicid]]s, [[mummies]], and [[ghoul]]s can never go berserk, and thus have no use for this amulet. Bloodless [[Vampire]]s also cannot go berserk, nor can other species that are Starving. [[Cheibriados]] disapproves of going berserk and will impose [[penance]] upon followers that do so.\n\n==Strategy==\nFor users with a decent Evocations skill, this amulet is a reliable and renewable source of berserking. For non-[[Trog]] followers, this is amazingly useful, especially in the early game. Even without Evocations skill, however, it is far from useless; at no skill, you have a 50% chance of activating it. Simply start making activation attempts when the enemy is two or three tiles away, and if you activate early, simply pass a turn or move to meet it. This will reduce the duration of your berserk slightly, but you should still have plenty of time to crush your opponent. See the [[Berserk]] article for advice on intelligent berserking.\n\nBe aware that monsters can use amulets of rage against you, if they happened to find one somewhere.\n\n==History==\n*Amulets of rage were removed in [[0.25]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], wearing this amulet had a tiny chance of extending your berserk each time you killed an enemy.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], this amulet also decreased the odds of you passing out after your berserk state ends.\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

{"title":"Flying skull","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Flying_skull","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Flying skulls''' are weak pack monsters, fast and prone to [[noise|noisy]] shrieking. They are found in [[the Crypt]], [[the Tomb]], the [[Hell]]s, [[the Abyss]], and [[Pandemonium]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Although mostly harmless, they attract enough attention to be a pest to [[stealth]]y characters.\n*If you know [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]], they make excellent sources of shrapnel. Of course, by using LRD, you'll be abandoning stealth entirely.\n\n==History==\n*Flying skulls were removed and replaced with [[laughing skull]]s and [[weeping skull]]s in [[0.31]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], they were even weaker and punier."}

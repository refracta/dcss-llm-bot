And this note, that theſe lengths will commonly fall out to be eight or nine foor long, and will fit, although not iuſt, the ſtatures of all men, without any hindrance at all vnto them in their fight, becauſe in any weapon wherin the hands may be remoued, and at libertie, to make the weapon lõger or ſhorter in fight at his pleaſure, a foot of the ſtaffe behind the backmost hand doth no harme.\"<br>\n-George Silver, _Paradoxes of Defence_, 1599}}\n\n{{crawlquote|This weapon falls into the '[[Polearms]]' category. It is a two handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''glaive''' is the largest of the \"common\" polearms. While weaker than a [[bardiche]], a glaive can deal respectable damage from a [[reaching|distance]].\n \nAs a chopping weapon, it'll cut off [[hydra]] heads. It is also too large for [[kobold]]s and [[spriggan]]s to use at all.\n\n==Strategy==\nGlaives are considerably more common than bardiches or [[demon trident]]s. If you're stuck with a regular [[trident]], you may want to consider a glaive, even if you were using a shield.\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Glaive1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Glaive2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Glaive3.png]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || [[Unrandart]]s\n|-\n| '''[[Glaive of Prune]]''' || [[File:Glaive of prune.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Glaive of the Guard]]''' || [[File:Glaive of the guard.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.10]], glaives lacked innate reaching and had a greater (18) base delay.\n\n{{weapons}}\n\n[[Category:Polearms]]"}

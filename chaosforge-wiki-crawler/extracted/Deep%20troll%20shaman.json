They are every bit as competent in melee as their uneducated brethren, but their real danger lies in their ability to quickly [[haste]] and [[might]] the other trolls they lead. They can be found in [[the Depths]] and [[the Vaults]], as well as a [[Lair]]:5 end [[vault]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Deep troll shamans are by far the most dangerous members of any deep troll band, as even a single hasted, mighted deep troll can deal massive damage in melee. If the opportunity to do so presents itself, kill them first, and definitely avoid try to avoid getting surrounded.\n*If you find one in the Lair, note that it can't haste or might animals; shamans can only buff other trolls. For the Lair end vault, the shaman just serves as a moderately dangerous melee enemy. [[Curare]] darts, [[wand]]s, etc. can work against it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.13]], deep troll shamans had the [[Haste]] spell.\n*Deep troll shamans were added in [[0.12]].\n\n[[Category:Troll]]"}

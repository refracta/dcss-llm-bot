This links your [[HP]] and [[MP]], causing all damage you take to be split proportionally between your HP and MP pools. Spirit shield has no impact on [[poison]] or ability costs.\n\n[[Djinn]] have no MP, so are unaffected. [[Vine Stalker]]s and [[Demonspawn]] with the [[Mana Shield]] mutation innately have spirit shield, so gain no further benefit from wearing this amulet.\n\n==Strategy==\nThis amulet is best suited for those with low HP-to-MP ratio, namely casters and low-HP species like [[Spriggan]] and [[Felid]]. For them, guardian spirit gives the greatest benefit - preventing one-shot (or two-shot) deaths from, say, [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] is very helpful.\n\nThe main \"risk\" of guardian spirit is that you can run out of MP. Casters may not have the MP to finish off a monster. More importantly, it can prevent you from using [[god]] abilities; [[Zin]]'s Sanctuary is likely more valuable than 8 HP. At the same time, careful/proactive play can mitigate that risk, and having an extra 30 or so HP is quite valuable.\n\nIronically, [[Berserker]]s and other characters with little use of MP can benefit - it's free HP. If you don't have a better amulet, you might as well use it.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*If you plan on using guardian spirit long-term, note that [[Spellcasting]] and [[Invocations]] skill increase max MP. Only one skill counts; only the higher of (Spellcasting, Invocations/2) has an effect.\n*Remember to re-assess the priority for killing MP-draining monsters (such as [[ghost moth]]s) while wearing this amulet, as their ability to drain your MP is often rapid and irresistible.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], equipping this amulet drained all your MP, as it took only 0.5 turns to wear. Past 0.26, the [[Deep Dwarf]] species would still lose MP when putting on this amulet.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], spirit shield would fully consume MP before you started losing health, making it less useful for casters.\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

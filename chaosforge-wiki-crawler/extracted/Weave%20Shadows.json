More powerful creatures are summoned with higher power.\n\nYou can sustain at most four creatures summoned by this spell.}}\n\n'''Weave Creatures''' is a spell only accessible through use of a [[rod of shadows]]. Akin to the spell [[Shadow Creatures]], it temporarily creates a random creature (including their full band if possible), yet rather than choose those appropriate to the branch and floor it is cast in the spell will call forth monsters from a given floor of [[The Dungeon]] or, with sufficient power, [[the Depths]]. The floor of the Dungeon or the Depths from which the monsters are taken from scales with spellpower.\n\n==History==\n*Weave Shadows was removed in [[0.20]], along with the rod of shadows.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], the spell could not summon monsters from the Depths.\n*Weave Shadows was added in [[0.14]], as part of the rod of shadows's replacing of the [[rod of demonology]]."}

{"title":"Hound","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hound","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | canines}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Hounds''' are the second sorts of canines you are likely to encounter. They are fast enemies that are bigger and stronger than [[jackal]]s, although they don't travel in packs. They can be found in the early portions of [[the Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*A hound can manage to chew up a fragile caster, but that's only if you let it get close enough to hit you. \n*For melee characters, they are moderately tough threats. Not especially difficult, but their speed makes it difficult to retreat. Don't fight (or explore) at low HP if you can at all help it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], players could summon them via [[Call Canine Familiar]]."}

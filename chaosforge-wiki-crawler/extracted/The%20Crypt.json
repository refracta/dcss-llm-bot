Unfortunately, not everything that was buried there had the decency to stay dead.}}\n\n[[File:Crypt entry.png]] '''The Crypt''' is a 3-floor [[branch]], found between [[the Vaults]]:2 and 3. It is filled with all manner of [[undead]] opponents, and although it does not contain a [[rune of Zot]], it does hold the [[list of mummies|mummy]]-guarded entrance to [[the Tomb]], as well as a significant amount of treasure guarded by powerful undead foes on the final floor.\n\n==Layout==\nThe Crypt is made up of claustrophobic, winding hallways and large open chambers, all of which are built of [[wand of digging|undiggable]] stone or metal [[wall]]s.\n\nThe Crypt is also a [[Noise#Ambient noise|very silent place]], so noise carries farther than usual. Most residents are dead quiet, but even the noise made by your weapons will attract attention.\n\n===Crypt:3===\nThe third floor of the Crypt always has a treasure [[vault]], which can be sized anywhere from a modest room to all of the map. These always contain some of the most powerful undead enemies in the game, but often hold living and [[list of constructs#Golems|golem]] opponents as well. \n\nSome of the treasure vault loot will be Necromancy themed loot, such as [[draining]], [[vampiric]], or [[pain]]-[[brand]]ed weapons, [[ring of positive energy|rings of positive energy]], the [[Necronomicon]], [[staff of death|staves of death]], or one of several similarly themed [[unrand]]s.\n\n==Strategy==\nCrypt is almost entirely filled with undead creatures, so [[holy wrath]] and [[Dispel Undead]] are more useful here. Likewise, [[negative energy]] and [[torment]] are common, so bring rN+.\n\nThe following monsters deserve special attention:\n*{{monsterlink|Ancient champion}} - These foes can fire [[Iron Shot]]s and have decent damage. When [[haste]]d, they can deal good damage against any character.\n*{{monsterlink|Bone dragon}} - A high damage, highly durable undead enemy. Simple, but threatening.\n*{{monsterlink|Curse skull}} - These fast-moving and high [[AC]] skulls can [[torment]] you and [[Summon Undead]].\n*{{monsterlink|Ancient lich}} & {{monsterlink|Dread lich}} - top-tier spellcasters. Ancient liches deal massive damage with their spells, dread liches can paralyse you or summon dangerous demons.\n*{{monsterlink|Phantasmal warrior}} - not terribly dangerous on their own, but they halve your [[willpower]], making you vulnerable to being hexed by [[vampire knight]]s, liches, or other enemies.\n\n===Useful Traits===\n*A [[holy wrath]] weapon\n*[[Dispel Undead]]\n*Strong physical defenses\n*[[Negative energy]] resistance\n*[[See invisible]]\n<!--\n==Crypt:3 vaults==\n'''Eye to Eye With the Devil''': A small chamber which forces you to deal with multiple [[ancient lich]]es, [[curse skull]]s, and other potent threats before reaching the loot.\n\n'''Haunted Forest''': A full-floor graveyard, filled with dead [[tree]]s, gravestones, and mausoleums, each of which contains a variety of angry inhabitants.\n\n'''Cryptofortress''': A full-floor undead fortress, guarded by [[iron golem]]s. Exploration will reveal powerful liches, mummies, and vampires guarding the various loot heaps.\n\n'''Church of pain''': A cross-shaped map with 4 different monster sets: skeletons, vampires, ghosts, and mummies.\n\n'''Quadcrypt''': A full-floor vault divided in four quadrants: burial hoard (NE), chapel of [[Kikubaaqudgha]] (NW), catacombs (SE), and crematory (SW).\n\n'''Elkab''': A triparte Egyptian temple. Like the church of pain, it has four sets of monsters: skeleton, ghost, vampire, and mummy.\n\n'''The death's head''': A full-floor skull-shaped vault.\n\n'''Unholy cathedral''': A very compact vault with altars to [[Yredelemnul]] and [[Kikubaaqudgha]].\n-->\n==Monsters==\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Wraith}} || {{monsterlink|Flayed ghost}} || {{monsterlink|Soul eater}} || {{monsterlink|Reaper}} \n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Freezing wraith}} || {{monsterlink|Shadow wraith}} || {{monsterlink|Phantasmal warrior}} || {{monsterlink|Eidolon}} \n|-\n| {{Red|n}} [[File:Ghoul (monster).png]] '''[[Ghoul (monster)|Ghoul]]''' || {{monsterlink|Bone dragon}} || {{monsterlink|Flying skull}} || {{monsterlink|Curse skull}}\n|-\n| {{White|p}} [[File:Necromancer (monster).png]] '''[[Necromancer (monster)|Necromancer]]''' || {{monsterlink|Death knight}} || {{monsterlink|Deep elf death mage}} || {{monsterlink|Skeletal warrior}} \n|- \n| {{monsterlink|Vampire mage}} || {{monsterlink|Vampire knight}} || {{monsterlink|Jiangshi}} || {{monsterlink|Revenant}}\n|- \n|{{monsterlink|Lich}} || {{monsterlink|Ancient lich}} || {{monsterlink|Dread lich}} || {{monsterlink|Ancient champion}}\n|}\n\n===Placed by vaults===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Dancing weapon}} || {{monsterlink|Iron golem}} || {{monsterlink|Crystal guardian}} || {{monsterlink|Curse toe}} || {{monsterlink|Hell knight}} ||{{monsterlink|Profane servitor}}\n|-\n| {{LightGrey|M}} [[File:Mummy (monster).png]] '''[[Mummy (monster)|Mummy]]''' || {{monsterlink|Guardian mummy}} ||  {{monsterlink|Mummy priest}} || {{monsterlink|Royal mummy}} || {{monsterlink|Khufu}} || {{monsterlink|Sphinx}}\n|}\n\n===Uniques===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Aizul}}\n| {{monsterlink|Bai Suzhen}}\n| {{monsterlink|Boris}}\n| {{monsterlink|Donald}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Frederick}}\n| {{monsterlink|Grunn}}\n| {{monsterlink|Jory}}\n| {{monsterlink|Josephina}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Khufu}}\n| {{monsterlink|Mara}}\n| {{monsterlink|Margery}}\n| {{monsterlink|Mennas}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Saint Roka}}\n| {{monsterlink|Sojobo}}\n| {{monsterlink|Vv}}\n| {{monsterlink|Xtahua}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Zenata}}\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.17]], you could find [[Unborn]] in this branch.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the Crypt was 5 floors deep.

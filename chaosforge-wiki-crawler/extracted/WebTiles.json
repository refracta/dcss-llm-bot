{"title":"WebTiles","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/WebTiles","type":"raw","data":"'''WebTiles''' is the latest online tile-based interface for ''Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup'', as well as the offshoot minigame ''[[Dungeon Sprint]]''. It replaces the traditional Crawl ASCII presentation with tile graphics.\n\nWebtiles is by and large the most popular way to play ''Crawl'' online; the [[0.28]] tournament saw 96.6% of players using Tiles. There is no need for an [[SSH]] cilent, unlike console. Tiles are also generally seen as a useful way to introduce new players to the game, as images are much more intuitively informative than characters. \n\nOnce logged in, you may spectate on any ongoing game, and a basic chat feature allows you to communicate with the player and other spectators in real time. This makes it a great tool for giving advice to new players as they encounter dangerous situations (though general trolling is not unheard of). There is currently no way to play in a Private mode, apart from downloading the game and playing offline.\n\nWebTiles is currently available on [https://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/howto most official servers]. In general, playing on the server geographically closest to you will help reduce in-game lag, though heavy traffic can also be a major factor. These servers always host the latest stable release of ''Crawl'', as well as the current [[trunk]] release and several of the more recent older versions.\n\nRegardless of which server you play on, your play statistics will be recorded across all servers and can be viewed at <nowiki>http://crawl.akrasiac.org/scoring/players/</nowiki>'''''YOUR ACCOUNT NAME'''''<nowiki>.html</nowiki>. Because all saves are kept in cloud storage, you can log in from any computer to continue any of your ongoing games.\n\n==History==\n*WebTiles was introduced in [[0.8]].\n*[[NetTiles]] was introduced in [[0.6]].\n*Tiles were introduced to Stone Soup in [[0.4]]."}

It provides great protection from cold, while rendering its wearer more susceptible to fire.}}\n\n'''Ice dragon scales''' are a medium-weight body armour. They provide 2 ranks of [[cold resistance]] (rC++), but 1 rank of fire vulnerability (rF-).\n\nThis item has a 33% chance to generate when you slay an [[ice dragon]].\n\n==Desirability==\nIce dragon scales offer almost as much AC as a [[plate armour]], but with much lower encumbrance. Therefore, they are good for casters/[[EV]]-based fighters who can afford the weight, or melee brutes with no heavier scales available. It's often best to wait until you have a source of fire resistance, as taking 150% damage from fire can be dangerous.\n\nThis item has better stats than [[fire dragon scales]]: ice scales offer +1 base AC (and +1 max [[enchant]]ment) with no extra encumbrance. However, players may prefer fire resistance over cold resistance. This mostly applies to [[Zot]], as [[orbs of fire]] exist, but orbs of ice don't.\n\nParadoxically, a [[Fire Magic]] specialist may actually find these scales useful: combined with a [[staff of fire]] and a [[ring of fire]], such a character would have two spell enhancers, and a level each of fire and cold resistance.\n\n[[Troll]]s and [[Oni]], unable to wear normal [[plate armour]], may want to wear these even without fire resistance. Just be careful with it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], ice dragon scales were called ice dragon armour, and it was obtained by using a [[scroll of enchant armour]] on a [[ice dragon hide]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

This also results in a small increase to MP regeneration. The effects of multiple rings of magical power and other +MP items stack.\n\nWhen removing the ring, 9 MP will retroactively be removed, even if you weren't at maximum MP. There is no extra penalty when removing this ring at 0 MP.\n\n==Desirability==\nCasters will appreciate having this ring, since extra MP can make the difference between winning the fight and being forced to run away. It's most useful in the early game, as it gives a flat +9 MP bonus. Going from 10 MP -> 19 MP is a much bigger jump than 50 -> 59 MP. As the value of magical power decreases throughout the game, don't be afraid to switch to a different ring eventually.\n\nCan also be good for [[spirit shield]], especially for low HP species like [[Vine Stalker]] and [[Felid]]. A [[ring of protection]] may be stronger on average, but the extra +9 HP can ''always'' prevent one-shots - AC only has a ''chance'' to. \n\nFor non-casters without spirit shield, MP is generally unimportant. Can be helpful for [[infusion]] or when spamming [[god]] abilities, but other rings are generally better.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], MP-increasing items did not decrease MP when removed (beyond lowering the maximum).\n*Prior to [[0.17]], raising MP over a certain limit had diminishing returns. Any max MP over 50 was halved, so 52 MP would be reduced to 51, 54 to 52, and so on.\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

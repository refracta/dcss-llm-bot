{"title":"Jackal","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Jackal","type":"raw","data":"{{version021}}\n{{list of | canines}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Jackals''' are one of the earliest pack hunters you are likely to encounter, spawning as early as [[Dungeon]]:1 and attempting to surround you and pick you apart. They are weak, such that any level 1 character can take them on individually, but should they surround a careless starting character on all sides they can be a serious menace.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*On the first floor of the [[Dungeon]], jackals are a very scary threat. As such, you should make sure to fight them one at a time, by luring them backwards as soon as you see one member of the pack, to avoid other members being alerted and you having to fight multiple at once.\n*If you are forced to fight multiple at once, try to fight in one tileâ€“wide corridors to reduce the rate at which you take damage.\n*Since they are fast, there is no point trying to outrun them unless you are a [[Centaur]] or [[Spriggan]], however, it can be advisable to move to fight in a corridor.\n*Once you reach D:3, jackals will most likely no longer be a threat."}

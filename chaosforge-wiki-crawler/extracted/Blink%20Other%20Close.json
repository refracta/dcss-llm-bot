It cannot be resisted by willpower.}}\n\n'''Blink Other Close''' is a monster-only spell which forces the target to [[blink]], ignoring the victim's [[willpower]]. Unlike the similarly named spell [[Blink Other]], this blink always moves the target closer to the caster, placing the target within range of the caster's powerful attack spells.\n\n[[Formicid]]s and creatures in [[Tree Form]] cannot blink and are immune to this spell.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.12]], Blink Other Close could be negated if the spell failed to beat the target's magic resistance.\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

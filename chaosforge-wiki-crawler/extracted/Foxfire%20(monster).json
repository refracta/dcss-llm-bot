{"title":"Foxfire (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Foxfire_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version|028}}\n''This page covers the wisp. For the spell, see [[Foxfire]].\n{{monster info|Foxfire}}\n{{stub}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Foxfires''' are magical entities created by casting the spell [[Foxfire]]. They will home in on monsters, dealing damage and destroying themselves in the process.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Foxfires are fleeting 'monsters'. Upon collision, or after 8 turns, they will dissipate harmlessly.\n*Because foxfires technically count as creatures, this spell can help block line of effect to monsters with dangerous spells like [[Banishment]], [[Petrify]], or [[Malmutate]]. However, this is not as effective as simply [[summon]]ing a meat shield, as foxfires move quickly and erratically and disappear once they strike something.\n\n==History==\nFoxfires were added in [[0.25]]."}

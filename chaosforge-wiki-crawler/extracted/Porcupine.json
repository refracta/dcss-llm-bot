They're somewhat tougher than [[quokka]]s, and they deal 5d4 physical damage any time you hit them in melee due to their [[spiny]] nature, but they are still one of the easiest opponents you'll encounter by the time they start generating.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Any attempt at [[constriction|constricting]] a porcupine immediately fails. Guess why!\n*If you really don't want to take damage from their spines, use [[reaching]] attacks from [[polearms]].\n\n==History==\n*Porcupines were removed in [[0.26]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], their bite attack dealt only 7 damage."}

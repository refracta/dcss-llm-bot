Its blade is so sharp that it can cut through space itself.}}\n[[File:Autumn_katana.png]] '''''the +8 autumn katana'''''\n\n+8 katana (modified [[long sword]]: 14 base damage, +3 base accuracy, 12 base delay)<br>\n20% chance: may cast [[Manifold Assault]] on hit.<br>\n(The target/targets of your melee attack cannot be hit by the Manifold Assault)\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''autumn katana'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|1205}}</ref> is a nice weapon for [[Long Blades]] users, with better base stats than a [[demon blade]]. However, note that the extra attacks from Manifold Assault only proc when there's more than 1 target on the screen. Therefore, a +9 [[brand]]ed demon blade will be stronger against single targets. That being said, the autumn katana shines against multiple opponents, as it can hit up to 4 extra targets at once.\n\nThe spell Manifold Assault still works with this weapon (\"Space folds impossibly around your blade!\"), allowing you to sometimes get one layer of recursion.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the autumn katana had the [[vorpal]] brand and [[clarity]] instead of the ability to cast Manifold Assault. It also had -1 base damage, but had [[riposte]]. Note that the game falsely states it has the vorpal brand in [[0.28]] and [[0.29]].\n*The autumn katana was added in [[0.10]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Long blades]]"}

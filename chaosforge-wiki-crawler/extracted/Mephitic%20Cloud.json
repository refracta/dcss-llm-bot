{"title":"Mephitic Cloud","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mephitic_Cloud","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Mephitic Cloud''' is a Level 3 [[Conjurations]]/[[Alchemy]]/[[Air Magic]] spell that creates up to a 3x3 [[cloud]] of noxious fumes, which will linger for several turns. \n\n[[Alchemist]]s and [[Hedge Wizard]]s start with this spell.\n\n==Useful Info==\nCreates a bank of [[Cloud#Noxious fumes|noxious fumes]], affecting random tiles within a 3x3 radius from its release point. Higher [[spell power]] increases the amount of tiles affected. The clouds stay for a duration of <code>1d(power / 50)</code> turns. \n\nAnything standing in noxious fumes has a <code>(21 - [[hit dice]]) / 21</code> chance per turn to become [[confused]]. Monsters with 21 or more hit dice have a flat 2% chance to be affected. Creatures that are resistant or immune to [[poison]] are immune to noxious fumes, anything with [[clarity]] is also immune.\n\nMephitic Cloud is very loud, making as much noise as [[Fireball]]. Since it can be targeted at an empty square, this increases the effective range by one.\n\n==Strategy==\n[[Confusion]] is a powerful effect: it prevents enemy [[spell]]casting, gives a ~60% chance for melee attacks to target a wrong tile, and allows [[stab]]bing. Clouds last for multiple turns, so each cast can give multiple chances to confuse. And because it's a level 3 spell, it doesn't take that much investment to cast. Overall, despite Mephitic Cloud checking two properties (rPois and HD), it is a strong spell. Many of the most dangerous enemies in the early game, such as [[orc priest]]s, [[centaur (monster)|centaurs]], and all sorts of early [[unique]]s, are vulnerable. \n\nIn the late-game, this spell is less effective: more and more monsters have poison resistance, and the rest have high [[HD]]. But, by then, a level 3 spell will have done its work.\n\n===Aiming===\nIf you are adjacent to a target, you can aim ''diagonally behind'' the target in order to not hit yourself (i.e. aim at the *):\n .........  .........\n ...###...  ....###..\n ...#*#...  ....#*#..\n ...##Y...  ....Y##..\n ....@....  ....@....\n .........  .........\n\nBy targeting diagonally behind the yak, you can catch it in the cloud radius without catching yourself.\n\nIf you have poison resistance, [[clarity]], or are worshipping [[Qazlal]], you are immune to clouds, so don't be afraid to blast yourself. Even if you aren't immune, risking self-confusion can be worth it. You can drink a [[potion of curing]] to end it; most enemies can't.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*If you come across [[Ignite Poison]], you can use Mephitic Cloud to create clouds of flame. You can confuse your enemies, then ignite them to inflict extra damage.\n*Clouds cannot be placed on tiles that already have a cloud. So if you're immune to noxious fumes, you can cast Mephitic Cloud to prevent [[Petrifying Cloud]] or [[Chaos Breath]] clouds from affecting you.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], noxious fumes would deal minor (0-2) [[poison]]-based damage while in them.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], [[unbreathing]] creatures were immune to noxious fumes.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], Mephitic Cloud guaranteed a 3x3 cloud."}

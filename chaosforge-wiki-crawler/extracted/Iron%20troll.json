{"title":"Iron troll","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Iron_troll","type":"raw","data":"{{version|025}}\n{{list of | trolls}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Iron trolls''' are the largest and most exaggerated of the [[list of trolls|trolls]]. Their metal flesh regenerates quickly, and they can both give and take the most abuse in combat. Fortunately, they move slowly, and apart from partial fire and ice resistance have no other distinguishing features.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you can comfortably melee a deep troll, you can probably manage one of these. Any ranged character should simply [[kite]] it.\n\n[[Category:Troll]]"}

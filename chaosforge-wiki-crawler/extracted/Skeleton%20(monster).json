As a type of [[derived undead]], their stats are based on what the monster had in life.\n\n==Useful Info==\nSkeletons are slower, stupider, and clumsier than their alive counterparts. Skeletons are weaker versions of [[zombie]]s.\n\n*'''HP:''' (HD)d4 + 5*HD\n*'''AC:''' Original - 6\n*'''EV:''' Original - 7\n*'''Speed:''' Original - 2 (at least 3)\n*'''Attack flavour:''' None\n*'''Special:''' Does not regenerate, cannot traverse stairs\n\nSkeletons may be created with the [[Necrotise]] spell. They can also be found in a couple [[vault]]s. A newly-animated skeleton will drop weapons and armour that they were wearing.\n\n==Identifying Skeletons==\nDifferent monsters will leave behind skeletons with differing stats, but ''Crawl'' tends to lump them all together, making identifying them at a glance difficult. Console mode will display skeletons as either '''z''' or '''Z''', depending on their size. Tiles mode provides different tiles for several different kinds of skeletons, but there are still many different monsters that fall under each type. In any case, if you want to find out exactly what you'll be fighting, simply hit '''x''' and highlight the skeleton in question.\n\nBelow are all the categories of skeletons in tiles mode:\n\n[[Image:Bat skeleton.png]] [[Bat]]s\n\n[[Image:Skeleton bird.png]] [[List of birds|Birds]]\n\n[[Image:Skeleton centaur.png]] [[List of centaurs|Centaurs]]\n\n[[Image:Skeleton draconian.png]] [[List of draconians|Draconians]]\n\n[[Image:Skeleton dragon.png]] [[List of dragons|Dragons]]\n\n[[Image:Skeleton drake.png]] [[List of dragons#Drakes|Drakes]]\n\n[[Image:Skeleton fish.png]] Fish\n\n[[Image:Skeleton frog.png]] [[List of reptiles and amphibians#Amphibian Types|Frogs]]\n\n[[Image:Skeleton small humanoid.png]] Humanoids (small)\n\n[[Image:Skeleton medium humanoid.png]] Humanoids (medium)\n\n[[Image:Skeleton large humanoid.png]] Humanoids (large)\n\n[[Image:Skeleton hydra 1.png]] [[Image:Skeleton hydra 2.png]] [[Image:Skeleton hydra 3.png]] [[Image:Skeleton hydra 4.png]] [[Image:Skeleton hydra 5.png]] [[Hydra]]s\n\n[[Image:Skeleton lernaean 1.png]] [[Image:Skeleton lernaean 2.png]] [[Image:Skeleton lernaean 3.png]] [[Image:Skeleton lernaean 4.png]] [[Image:Skeleton lernaean 5.png]] [[Image:Skeleton lernaean 6.png]] [[Image:Skeleton lernaean 7.png]] [[Image:Skeleton lernaean 8.png]] [[Image:Skeleton lernaean 9.png]] [[Image:Skeleton lernaean 10.png]] [[The Lernaean hydra]]\n\n[[Image:Skeleton lizard.png]] [[List of reptiles and amphibians#Lizard types|Lizards]]\n\n[[Image:Skeleton naga.png]] [[List of nagas|Nagas]]\n\n[[Image:Skeleton small quadruped.png]] Quadrupeds (small)\n\n[[Image:Skeleton large quadruped.png]] Quadrupeds (large)\n\n[[Image:Skeleton winged quadruped.png]] Quadrupeds (winged)\n\n[[Image:Skeleton snake.png]] [[List of snakes|Snakes]]\n\n[[Image:Skeleton troll.png]] [[List of trolls|Trolls]]\n\n[[Image:Skeleton turtle.png]] [[List of reptiles and amphibians#Turtle Types|Turtles]]\n\n[[Image:Skeleton ugly thing.png]] [[Ugly thing]]s\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], skeletons on the ground could be re-animated using [[Animate Skeleton]] or [[Animate Dead]]. Reanimated monsters kept their weapons and armour. Skeletons were also removed from the main [[Dungeon]]'s spawn table.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], skeletons were more important. You could butcher a corpse to [[food|eat]] its [[chunk]]s, then animate it into a skeleton. You could not do this with [[zombie]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], butchering a corpse did not always leave a skeleton item, though Animate Skeleton always left chunks.\n\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Undead holiness]]"}

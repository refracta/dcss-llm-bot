{"title":"Sphinx","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sphinx","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Sphinxes''' are hefty beasts with a large variety of [[Hexes]]. Their [[paralysis]] is a big threat if you don't have willpower, though their melee isn't bad either. They can be found in [[the Depths]], [[the Vaults]], or in a large pack inside [[Tomb]]:1. [[Out-of-depth]] sphinxes can rarely show up in the main [[Dungeon]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*High [[willpower]] (at least +++, preferably ++++) will render them almost incapable of disabling you.\n**It takes 154 willpower in order to have a 0% chance to be hexed. (See the [[Paralysis#Paralysis Spell Table]] for what's needed to reach this.)\n*Strong summoned allies can usually take out a sphinx without trouble. In the worst case, you may be incapacitated by a spell, but your allies will kill or distract it until the effect wears off.\n*If you see a sphinx with several strong allies that you're not ready for, consider [[teleport]]ing or using a [[scroll of fog]] and running away immediately. You may not get a second chance.\n*You can summon your own friendly sphinxes with the spell [[Monstrous Menagerie]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], sphinxes had 11 speed, but were slightly more likely to cast spells."}

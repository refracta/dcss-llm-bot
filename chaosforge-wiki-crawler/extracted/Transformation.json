Most forms are willingly caused to help the player, but a few [[bad form]]s exist.\n\n==Useful Info==\nThere are two major types of transformations:\n*[[Talisman]] forms: Forms that use [[Shapeshifting]] skill. These are permanent, but can be overridden by a temporary form, and manually ended at will. \n*Temporary forms: Includes [[bad form]]s and [[Shadow Form]]. These forms end after a certain amount of time - they cannot be ended manually. However, they can be ended early by a [[potion of cancellation]] and [[Quicksilver Bolt]] (the latter leaves 1 turn left on the duration).\n\nTransmutations can cause the following changes, depending on the form:\n*Modify [[Unarmed Combat]]\n*Have innate properties, like bonus HP, AC, stats, or resistances.\n*Have a different [[size]] or [[movement speed]] to your base form\n*Meld certain types of equipment. Melded equipment ceases to have any effect, positive or negative. Melded items are not unequipped, rendering you safe from an [[artefact]]'s Drain and Contam.\n\nBeing in any form will also make you vulnerable to [[silver]] weaponry (+75% damage from silver weapons)\n\n[[Undead]] creatures cannot be transformed ''except for [[Shadow Form]]. For players, this means that [[Ghoul]]s and [[Mummies]] can never be transformed, while [[Vampire]]s can only be transformed when Alive. [[Death Form]] renders you immune to temporary forms, but you can still use other talismans.\n\nMonsters cannot transform; any transformation effect will instead [[polymorph]] the creature permanently.\n\n==Table of Transformations==\n===Talisman Forms===\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n!

[[Transmutations]] magic was replaced by [[talisman]]s, which use [[Shapeshifting]] skill. Removed forms include [[Beastly Appendage]], [[Spider Form]], and [[Ice Form]]; the other good forms were largely overhauled.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], plant based forms had 3 levels of [[Life Protection]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], many forms had dedicated [[GDR]] ratios. Also, [[Hydra Form]] was replaced with Storm Form.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], most forms could not use wands.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], wands of polymorph could polymorph the player into most forms, not just the five bad forms. Porcupine form was removed in 0.20.\n*Hydra Form was added in [[0.16]].\n*Shadow Form was added with [[Dithmenos]] in [[0.14]].\n\n{{forms}}\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

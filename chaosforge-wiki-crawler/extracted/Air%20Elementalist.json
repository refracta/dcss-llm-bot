Later on, their selection of Air Magic spells provides them with the flexibility to survive.}}\n'''Air Elementalists''' are mages who have chosen [[Air Magic]] for their specialization. Air Magic is not as purely destructive as [[Fire Magic]], but offers a variety of other useful effects for [[Dungeon]]-delvers.\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Deep Elf]], [[Naga]], [[Tengu]], [[Draconian]], [[Djinni]], and [[Vine Stalker]] are the recommended species if you pick an Air Elementalist Background.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\n*+0 [[robe]]\n*[[Potion of magic]]\n\n==Available Spells==\n*[[Shock]]\n*[[Static Discharge]]\n*[[Swiftness]]\n*[[Airstrike]]\n\nAir Elementalists start with the [[Shock]] spell memorised.\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Stealth]]: 2\n*[[Spellcasting]]: 2\n*[[Conjurations]]: 1\n*[[Air Magic]]: 3\n\nChoosing Air Elementalist adds 7 to your starting [[Intelligence]] and 5 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nAir Elementalists start with three offensive spells, with three unqiue means of targeting. Along with a great utility spell in Swiftness, AE provides clever players with lots of options, though not all of them are reliable.\n\n===Spell Details===\n[[Shock]] is inaccurate, but hits twice as hard thanks to its ability to bounce and [[doublezap]] in walls. It'll also pierce through enemies with no range reduction. The targeter will try to attempt to calculate a good angle, though perhaps not always the best angle available. Read the [[doublezap]] article for more details.\n\n[[Static Discharge]] creates an arc that travels through adjacent targets. Spreading to multiple monsters, discharges are a somewhat effective way to control crowds. These arcs can harm you, but at a heavily reduced rate. When monsters happen to get in melee range to you, it's a good spell for general damage.\n\n[[Airstrike]] increases in effectiveness when its target has open space around it; you, other monsters, and walls count as obstructions. It's a bit too MP expensive to cast at first, while Shock is sufficient for a while. Once you can afford multiple castings, Airstrike remains useful for its perfect accuracy and [[smite-targeting]], able to hit pesky enemies no matter the circumstance. \n\n[[Swiftness]], by increasing your movement speed, can be a lifesaver -- but only if you have enough MP to cast it! Always keep an eye out on your MP; even more so than other casters. And try to keep an escape route ''somewhat'' close by; once the enchantment runs out, your movement speed will be slowed, instead.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*In Tiles, the aiming tracer will be bright yellow if the square will be affected by a doublezap. \n*Like most mage starts, [[Sif Muna]] or [[Vehumet]] are gods that offer help with magic, but you are by no means limited to worshiping either of them.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], most backgrounds were buffed; all Mage backgrounds gained a [[potion of magic]]. Both [[Static Discharge]] and [[Airstrike]] gained buffs this version.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Air Elementalists started with the [[book of Air]], and had [[Lightning Bolt]].\n*Prior to [[0.20]], the [[book of Air]] contained [[Repel Missiles]] instead of [[Airstrike]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], targeters did not attempt to calculate angles for a [[multizap]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the starting book, [[Book of Air]] contained the [[Flight_(spell)|flight]] spell.\n*It used to be possible to triplezap and even quadrizap, but zapping was limited to twice in some earlier version of the game.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Air Elementalists started with only 1 level of Spellcasting and 20 gold.\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

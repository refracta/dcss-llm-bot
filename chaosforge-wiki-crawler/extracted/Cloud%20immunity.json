{"title":"Cloud immunity","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cloud_immunity","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|It completely protects its wearer from the effects of clouds.}}\n\nCloud immunity is an [[ego]] which protects the wearer from the effects of all clouds in the same way as [[Qazlal]]. It can only be found on the [[robe of Clouds]].\n\nNote that some cloud-generating breath weapons deal impact damage when they hit you; cloud immunity does not protect you from this damage, or statuses directly from that damage. Examples of this include [[catoblepae]]'s [[Petrifying Cloud]], [[swamp dragon]]s' [[Poisonous Cloud]], and [[ushabti]]u's [[Death Rattle]].\n\n==Strategy==\nCloud immunity is fairly niche overall. It allows you to use clouds from the [[Freezing Cloud]] spell or [[scroll of poison|scrolls of poison]] without harming yourself, making them much easier to use. However, this should be weighed with other, alternate armour options, such as [[troll leather armour]] and [[swamp dragon scales]].\n\nCloud immunity is especially useful in [[the Swamp]], where the two main poison threats ([[swamp drake]]s and [[swamp dragon]]s) use cloud breath attacks in order to poison you. Swamp also has [[death drake]]s and [[ghost crab]]s, which have cloud attacks. It can also be useful in the [[Volcano]], [[Ice cave]], or for the occasional vault that generates hazardous clouds.\n\n==History==\n* Prior to [[0.25]], the cloud immunity ego could be found on [[scarf|scarves]].\n* Added in [[0.20]] with [[scarf|scarves]]."}

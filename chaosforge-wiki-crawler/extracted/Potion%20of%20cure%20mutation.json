{"title":"Potion of cure mutation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Potion_of_cure_mutation","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|A potion which removes some or all of any mutations which may be afflicting you.}}\n{{item\n |itemtype=Potion\n |name=Potion of Cure Mutation\n |cost=180\n |weight=4.0\n}}\nQuaffing a '''potion of cure mutation''' will immediately remove 0-7 random [[mutations]], heavily weighted towards 3-5, from your character:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" cellpadding=\"8\" border=\"1\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n! # Removed\n! 0 !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7\n|-\n! Probability (%)\n| 0.05 || 1.0 || 6.3 || 19.8 || 32.2 || 27.4 || 11.4|| 1.8\n|}\n\nIt removes both good and bad mutations, but mutations innate to your species (e.g. [[Draconian]]'s scales, [[Naga]]'s slow movement, [[demonspawn mutation]]s) can never be removed.\n\n==Strategy==\nThese potions are very rare and very valuable. Some bad mutations, such as [[teleportitis]] and [[Blurry Vision]], can outright kill you. Save these potions for when you have unbearable mutations - don't waste them trying to cure -2 Str or -2 Int (unless you're at risk of [[stat zero]]).\n\nPrevention is better than the cure. You might not find any cure mutation potions for a long time, and even if you do, there's a chance it might not remove the mutation you want. The less mutations you receive, the less you'll need to rely on these potions.\n*Try to prevent [[Malmutate]] from targeting you, e.g. have [[allies]] between you and the malmutator. See the [[Malmutate#Strategy|Malmutate]] article for more details.\n*Have sources of [[mutation resistance]] in places where malmutation is common.\n\nIf you don't have any cure mutation, and desperately need a mutation gone, you can try quaffing [[potions of mutation]]. This might result you being even worse off than you are, characters with many bad mutations are more likely to have ''some'' removed.\n\n== History ==\n*Potions of cure mutation and [[potions of beneficial mutation]] were merged into [[potions of mutation]] in [[0.20]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], potions of cure mutation were slightly less common.\n\n[[Category:Mutations]]\n\n{{potions}}"}

{"title":"Summon Hydra","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summon_Hydra","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n[[Summon Hydra]] is a level 7 [[Summonings|Summoning]] spell which summons a friendly [[hydra]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nA hydra with 4 to 12 heads is summoned. The number of heads depends on [[spell power]]; the hydra will have <code>(1d<power> - 1) / 6</code> heads, but there is an 83% chance that its heads are capped at 8.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-summoning.cc|268}}</ref> \n\nThe duration of the summon does not depend on the spell power and is always very short, around 9 turns. \n\nThere is a summon limit of 2; additional summons will cause the oldest to very quickly time out. \n\n==Strategy==\nSummon Hydra effectively takes the role of a [[Conjurations]] spell to a summoner. Hydras offer a high damage per turn, but since they time out very quickly, this spell has a relatively poor MP efficiency. Useful if you want to kill something quickly.\n\n==Monster Version==\n{{monsters with spell}}\nNote that [[Bai Suzhen]] cannot cast this spell while in the storm dragon form.\n\n==History==\n*Summon Hydra was added in [[0.8]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

Be wary that controlled translocations will cause the subject to become contaminated with magical energy, and that controlled teleports will take longer to trigger than uncontrolled ones.}}\n\n'''Control Teleport''' is a level 4 [[Charms]]/[[Translocations]] spell which temporarily grants the caster the [[teleport control]] (cTele) [[status effect]]. When [[teleport]]ing with this status, you can choose a specific location, and you will land within 2 tiles of that square (heavily favoring 1 tile away). However, the teleport is delayed by <code>1d3</code> turns. When making an uncontrolled [[blink]], you'll be sent 2-7 squares in a direction of your choosing.\n\nThe status wears off after you make 1 teleport or blink. Be aware that it will cause some [[magic contamination]].\n\n==History==\n* This spell was removed in [[0.17]].\n* Prior to [[0.13]], the cTele status didn't wear off after a teleport/blink; you could perform multiple controlled teleports with a single cast. Also, controlled teleports didn't delay teleports.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

Note that unlike all randart blowguns, it does not have a speed brand (nor any brand, for that matter). It's a decent tool, but one can often find or enchant better.\n\n==History==\nThe blowgun of the Assassin was removed in [[0.14]], added back in [[0.15]], and removed once again in [[0.16]].\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Throwing]]\n[[Category:Obsolete items]]"}

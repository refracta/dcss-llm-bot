A more specialized pair of [[randart]] gloves might be better overall, but these are still pretty good gloves for high-[[EV]] or -[[SH]] melee characters.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], riposte did not trigger on blocked attacks.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the fencer's gloves would stack with the riposte of [[Long Blades]], for a total of 66% to activate per miss.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the fencer's gloves gave +4 boosts to Long Blades and [[Short Blades]] skills and increased [[EV]] by 3. They were also +2 gloves.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], these gloves gave +2 [[slaying]] instead of the skill bonuses.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], these gloves gave only +3 to dexterity, and added +8 to [[accuracy]] rather than +2 slaying.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Gloves]]"}

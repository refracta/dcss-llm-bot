{"title":"Deep elf sorcerer","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Deep_elf_sorcerer","type":"raw","data":"{{version|026}}\n{{list of | deep elves}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Deep elf sorcerers''' are deadly deep elven casters with a deadly variety of spells. They are commonly found in the lower portions of the [[Elven Halls]], particularly within the massive treasure vault, but they may also be found in the upper portions of that branch and wandering [[the Vaults]] and [[the Depths]] in deep elf bands.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Like most of the more powerful deep elf opponents, deep elf sorcerers should be a high priority. They might deal less direct damage than a [[deep elf annihilator]], but they can still pile on damage quickly with damnation, [[corrode]] you with Corrosive Bolt, and if you aren't high enough level to deal with [[the Abyss]], treat them with caution and pile on whatever sources of additional willpower you can.\n*If you can get close enough to [[silence]] one, you can tear it apart in melee. Just be prepared to take heavy damage from acid or damnation or a sudden trip to the Abyss if you have to charge in. Lure the sorcerer around corners or nuke it at range as fast as you can if you don't think you can close the distance quickly.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.18]], Deep elf sorcerers knew [[Summon Demon]].\n\n[[category:Elf]]"}

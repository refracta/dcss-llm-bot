You'll gain the following:\n\n'''Combat'''\n* '''HP Bonus:''' 120% HP\n* '''Innate AC:''' <code>5 + 12 * pow/100</code> [[AC]] (5-17 AC)\n* '''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' 12 base damage, with an added [[freezing]] brand.\n\n'''Resistances'''\n*[[Cold resistance|rC+++]]\n*[[Fire resistance|rF-]]\n*[[Poison resistance]]\n*[[Amphibious]]: can swim through [[deep water]], resists [[Primal Wave]]\n*[[Unbreathing]] and lacks [[blood]]\n*Vulnerable to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] \n\n'''Restrictions'''\n*'''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' All [[armour]], [[weapon]] and [[shield]]. (Can only wear [[jewellery]])\n*Cannot [[throw]] items.\n\n'''Other'''\n*Ice Form is '''[[large]]'''-sized. Species smaller than large will have reduced [[EV]] in this form.\n*Suppresses many mutations. Has 1.0 [[movement delay]], even if your [[species]] is faster or slower. \n\nLike all form changing spells, [[mummies]], [[ghoul]]s, and bloodless [[vampire]]s cannot use this spell.\n\n==Strategy==\nA moderately strong UC form on its own. It's near-perfect for taking on [[the Lair]]. Freezing attacks will [[slow]] [[cold-blooded]] creatures like [[cane toad]]s, [[hydra]]s, and [[skyshark]]s. Plus, because of the lack of blood, Ice Form is immune to skysharks' bloodzerk attacks. The most noticeable downside is the low AC, at least when compared to a regular melee character. Ice Form also has merit for the four [[Lair]] branches, though the AC (and your [[silver]] vulnerability, for [[Shoals]]) is a bigger issue.\n\nIce Magic users may want to pick up this spell for some extra AC, even if they aren't specializing into Transmutations. The resistances can help with spells like [[Mephitic Cloud]] and [[Freezing Cloud]].\n\nIf you are not already using Ice Magic, Transmutations, or Unarmed Combat, Ice Form often isn't worth the skill investment.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*[[Ozocubu's Armour]] can be used to shore up you relatively low AC.\n*Note that Ice Form is still considered a [[natural]], living form. E.g. you are still vulnerable to [[sleep]] from [[dream sheep]] or the spell.\n\n==History==\n*Ice Form was removed in [[0.31]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Ice Form received less AC (5-12) as the spell gained power.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], Ice Form prevented usage of [[wand]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Ice Form increased the AC bonus from Ozocubu's Armour.\n*Prior to the changes to butchering in [[0.12]], Ice Form was an option for players that needed to butcher a corpse but were unable to (due to a cursed blunt weapon).\n*Prior to [[0.9]], Ice Form also provided [[conservation]] for the player's currently held [[potion]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], Ice Form did not allow you to butcher while unarmed.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

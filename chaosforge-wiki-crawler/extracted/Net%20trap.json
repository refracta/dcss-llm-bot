{"title":"Net trap","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Net_trap","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|A large concealed net launcher hanging from the dungeon's ceiling, enchanted by the powers of Zot to land only on intruders.}}\n\n{{Trap\n|name=Net Trap\n|difficulty=5\n|ammo=Infinite\n|effect=[[Held]]\n}}\n\nThe '''net trap''' is a [[trap]] which has a 33% chance to drop a [[throwing net]] on the player if any [[monster intelligence|intelligent]] monster steps on it in the player's [[LOS]]. The trap always triggers if the player steps on it. If hit by the net, the victim becomes [[held]] and cannot move or attack until they break the net. The net cannot be recovered, even if you teleport out.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Net traps can be dodged with high [[EV]].\n*While moving and attacking are impossible while trapped in a net, you can still cast [[spells]], use [[wands]], drink [[potions]], or read [[scrolls]].\n*[[Blink]]ing or [[scroll of teleportation|teleporting]] out of the net frees you immediately. The [[Ru]] abilities, Draw Out Power and Power Leap, will do so too.\n*The [[slick slippers]] [[unrand]] grants immunity to net traps.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Throwing net]]\n*[[Trap]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], net traps could fire only once. Their nets didn't always mulch and could be picked up. Also, the trap always fired a net when any creature stepped on it.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], net traps had a chance of not triggering when the player stepped on them.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], net traps would only affect the creature that stepped into them. Also, their [[accuracy]] did not scale with floor depth.\n\n[[Category:Traps]]"}

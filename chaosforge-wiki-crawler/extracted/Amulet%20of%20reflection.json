When projectiles (either ranged weapons or certain types of spells like [[Stone Arrow]]) are blocked, they are always reflected back at the attacker.\n\n==Strategy==\nThis amulet's +5 SH is a fairly strong bonus to your defense. Unlike other amulets, the SH bonus is consistent: it doesn't wear off like [[acrobat]], or require MP as with [[guardian spirit]]. Therefore, it is a strong option for just about any character. But certain characters may want another amulet for its properties.\n\nThe ability to reflect projectiles can be useful, particularly against ranged enemies like [[centaur (monster)|centaurs]] and [[yaktaur]]s. But the reflection is a minor benefit when compared to the SH bonus. Note that players with higher SH (from [[shield]]s or other sources) will block more often, so will reflect projectiles more often. \n\n==See Also==\n*[[Brooch of Shielding]] - [[unrand]] amulet that grants more SH, but with [[guardian spirit]] instead of reflection.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], in order to function, the amulet had to attune itself to the wearer at full health.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], amulets of reflection provided 2 to 6 SH and did not require attunement at full HP.\n*The amulet of reflection was added in [[0.18]].\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

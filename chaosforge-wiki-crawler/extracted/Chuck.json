{"title":"Chuck","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Chuck","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | giants}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Chuck''' is a [[unique]] [[stone giant]] found only in the [[Dungeon Sprint]] map, [[The Ten Rune Challenge]]. Although not much beefier than a standard stone giant, he is a crack shot with his [[large rock]]s of [[chaos]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Every time a chaos-branded large rock hits you, there's a (very small) chance for you to be [[paralysed]] for 5 turns and immediately die. At the very least, Chuck won't fire rocks past other monsters.\n\n==History==\n*When monsters gained infinite ammo in [[0.27]], Chuck's rock of [[returning]] was replaced with chaos."}

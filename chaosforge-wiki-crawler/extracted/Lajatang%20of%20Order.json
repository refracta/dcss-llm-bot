It became the most prized weapon of the many priests of Zin. After their order was destroyed, it fell into disuse and vanished from history.}}\n[[File:Lajatang_of_Order.png]] '''''the +7 lajatang of Order'''''\n\n+7 [[lajatang]]\n\n[[Silver]] brand<br>\n[[Mutation resistance]] (66% chance to resist hostile mutations.)\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''lajatang of Order'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|1374}}</ref> is a good weapon, with high damage output in general, and outstanding damage against [[:Category:Silver vulnerability|silver-vulnerable]] enemies. Just as impressive is the fact that it is one of a few sources of [[mutation resistance]] (ironically, this also makes it much less desirable for actual worshipers of [[Zin]]).\n\nThis weapon largely follows the same benefits and pitfalls as a regular lajatang; it offers great damage for low skill, in exchange for requiring 2 [[hand]]s and comparatively low late-game damage. Hybrids might like this weapon, but a heavy melee brute may prefer another weapon. Regardless, it can be used as a swapout against monsters who cast [[Malmutate]] (all of which are chaotic, and will thus suffer heavy damage from the silver brand).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.24]], the [[silver]] brand offered no damage bonus to monsters not vulnerable to silver.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], rMut provided a 90% chance to resist hostile mutations. But there were [[amulet of resist mutation|amulets of resist mutation]] in the game, which also provided this resistance, so having rMut was less special.\n*The lajatang of Order was added in [[0.14]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Staves]]\n[[Category:Magical staves]]"}

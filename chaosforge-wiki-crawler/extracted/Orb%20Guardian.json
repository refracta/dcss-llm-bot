{"title":"Orb Guardian","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Orb_Guardian","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Orb Guardians''' are enormous creatures which prowl the chambers of the [[Orb of Zot]]. They lack any special abilities, but are fast, come in large numbers, are durable enough to handle a few turns of abuse, and often wander into combat as you're fighting the scarier monsters of [[Zot]]. Normally, they are only found in Orb chamber of [[Zot:5]], though they can spawn anywhere during the [[ascension]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you're encountering Orb Guardians, you're almost there! Please be careful.\n*Although by no means harmless, Orb Guardians are normally one of the least threatening enemies found on Zot:5. Try not to fight them near a [[moth of wrath]]- a [[berserk]] Orb Guardian hits ''much'' harder and faster than normal.\n*Orb Guardians are natural animals with no resistances, average defenses, and only moderate [[hit dice]], so almost any means of disposing of enemies will work on them. Being loud will attract more enemies, though."}

{"title":"Sixfirhy","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sixfirhy","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Sixfirhies''' are [[electricity]]-themed [[tier-3 demon]]s. With a speed of 40 - and even faster when moving - they are easily the fastest creatures in the game. Getting hit 4 times by (15 + 9-12 elec damage) is very painful. \n\nFortunately, sixfirthies pass 2/3 of their actions; they'll move in bursts of a few turns every now and then. They can be found in [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], or created by the [[Summon Demon]] spell.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Sixfirhies are big threats for something that [[kobold demonologist]]s and [[orc sorcerer]]s can summon. In theory, their melee can deal 108 damage per [[decaAut]], and as they move 6.6 tiles per turn, it's nearly impossible to run from them. A sixfirthy will only move 1/3rd of the time, but there's always a chance that it gets to act every time. Treat them with respect.\n*Since they rely on fast, but weak attacks, [[AC]] is a very effective defense (especially if you have rElec).\n\n==Trivia==\n*The sixfirhy's name comes from a cat walking across a keyboard. (The original string of characters was \"''sxFR:?)hyyyyyyyy-\\-''\".)\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], sixfirhies could heal from electrical damage, although overcharging could kill them. Also they were [[tier-4 demon]]s.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

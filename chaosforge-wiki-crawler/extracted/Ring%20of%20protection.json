Unlike most [[amulet]]s, you can quickly swap rings, easily switching between them at need. \n\nRings of protection are  relatively stronger on characters with low AC. There's a somewhat larger difference between 5 and 9 AC compared to 25 and 29. In particular, characters that cannot wear some or all types of armour ([[Spriggan]]s, [[Ogre]]s, [[Troll]]s, [[Octopode]]s, [[Felid]]s) will appreciate having a ring of protection.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], you could find rings of protection with a -4 enchantment; such rings were always [[curse]]d.\n*Prior to [[0.25]] enchantments were random values between 1 and 6 (positive and negative).\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

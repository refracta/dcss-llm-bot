{"title":"Glaive of Prune","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Glaive_of_Prune","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|The glaive of Prune carries a terrible and insidious curse. Unless its wielder maintains firm self-control, they are doomed to succumb, undergoing a horrifying (albeit temporary) transformation. This is normally trivial to resist, but incapacitated wielders are certain to succumb, finding themselves nightmarishly purple, squishy, and delicious. They can take comfort in learning that it's surprisingly hard to injure a giant prune.}}\n\n[[File:Glaive_of_prune.png]] '''''the glaive of Prune'''''\n\n+12 [[glaive]]\n\n[[Freezing]] brand<br>\n[[Transformation|Transforms]] the user into a prune if they are [[paralysed]], [[petrified]], or [[asleep]], halving damage taken<br>\n[[Chaotic]]\n\n==Desirability==\nIn most situations, the '''glaive of Prune'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|228}}</ref> is just a +12 freezing glaive. It's around the level of a +9 [[bardiche]] of freezing (slightly weaker), but takes less skill to wield effectively. Characters who use two-handed [[Polearms]] will find it a good weapon.\n\nIn addition, the prune \"curse\" reduces damage when afflicted with some of the most dangerous status conditions in the game. It takes a large amount of [[willpower]] to completely resist enemy [[Hexes]], so this glaive is quite useful as another safeguard. There are also [[hornet|some]] [[air elemental|partially]] [[floating eye|irresistible]] [[sleepcap|ways]] to be paralyzed or [[Dream Dust|put to sleep]], assuming you aren't a [[Formicid]] with [[clarity]]. (Certain methods listed are stopped by other species-specific resistances, but are not available to most players).\n\nAs it is a transformative artifact, followers of [[Zin]] will incur [[penance]] when using the glaive of Prune.\n\nThe prune curse will also activate if and when you die, but at that point, there's no saving you.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the Glaive of Prune had the [[vorpal]] brand instead of [[freezing]].\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the prune curse had no in-game effect.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the glaive of Prune had a +4,+12 enchantment.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Polearms]]"}

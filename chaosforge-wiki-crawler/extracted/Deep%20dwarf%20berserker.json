When generated with decent weapons and armour, they can be very durable, deadly opponents. They are occasionally found in packs of other [[deep dwarf (monster)|deep dwarves]] in [[the Abyss]].\n\n<!--spl-bot-begin-->\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Brothers in Arms]]\n|slot2=''none''\n|slot3=[[Trog's Hand]]\n|slot4=[[Berserker Rage]]\n|slot5=''none''\n|slot6=''none''\n}}\n{{clear}}\n<!--spl-bot-end-->\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Once they go berserk, focus on taking them down quickly. Their damage output can be scary, especially when armed with [[brand]]ed weapons.\n*If you intend to attack with [[Hexes]], do so ''before'' they use Trog's Hand and gain doubled [[magic resistance]].\n*When low on [[HP]], they'll use Brothers in Arms to suddenly add a [[berserk]] ally to the list of monsters you need to worry about. Don't leave them wounded.\n\n==History==\nDeep dwarf berserkers were removed in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Dwarf]]\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

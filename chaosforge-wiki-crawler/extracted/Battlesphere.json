They don't have any melee attacks, but each time you cast a [[destructive spell]] at a monster, they will shoot a barrage of energy at a random target. The power of the beam depends on the [[spellpower]] (for the spell) or your skill in [[Conjurations]] (for the sphere of Battle).\n\nYou can fire through your own battlesphere. However, your battlesphere cannot fire through you.\n\nBeing a conjured monster, battlespheres cannot be ordered around via the [[t]] command.\n\n==History==\n*Battlespheres were added in [[0.12]].\n\nFor more history, see [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere#History|Iskenderun's Battlesphere]]."}

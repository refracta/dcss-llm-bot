This page probably contains spoilers.*\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Round 1](#Round_1)\n\n  - [1.1 D:1](#D:1)\n  - [1.2 D:3](#D:3)\n  - [1.3 D:4](#D:4)\n  - [1.4 D:6](#D:6)\n  - [1.5 D:7](#D:7)\n  - [1.6 D:8](#D:8)\n  - [1.7 D:9](#D:9)\n\n# Round 1\n\n## D:1\n\nSince Elyvilon has no interests in corpses, the centaur chopped up all of them except poisonous ones. You know, centaurs get hungry FAST. Contaminated chunks was not a big problem, thanks to Ely's purification.\n\nAs centaurs are excellent at ranged weapons, especially bows, I let the centaur collects all darts, arrows, and poison needles, for some ranged attacks against fleeing enemies. Nevertheless, most of the times he can just ran up to them.\n\n## D:3\n\nA good kobold lent the naga his uncursed glowing blowgun. I could see this device come handy against innocent orges. Running away from them and watching the toxin kicking in is always fun.\n\nThe centaur had accumulated 3 amulets at the end of this level. Luckily, although he got few scrolls, one of the was a scroll of identify and revealed a amulet of the gourmand. Hopefully, this thing and purification could cancel the centaur's disadvantage of fast metabolism.\n\n## D:4\n\nHere comes Sigmund. I want to test my glowing blowgun on him, but a gnoll came for the centaur from the other way. I didn't know whether he's attracted by Sigmund's shout or the centaur's clip-clop, but that didn't matter. It's time to retreat!\n\nIt look much longer time for the centaur than my NaVM to kill Sigmund with poison. That's just fair, I guess, considering the fact that VM had invested much time practicing poison magic, while the centaur was just a casual needle blower.\n\n## D:6\n\nA troll noticed the centaur. With only 7 AC, it was better for the centaur not to get involved in melee combat with a troll for a long time. I decided to dump it on D:5. The centaur ran to the nearest stairs, prayed to Elyvilon for divine protection, and waited for the troll to get close in. Once the troll got near, the centaur started climbing up. Meanwhile, the troll was busy biting and clawing the centaur, reduced his hp from 50 to 6. Wow, that hurt much more than what I thought.\n\nOther than poison needles, my tactics against hard-hitting enemies was a loop of hit and run. Orc warriors equipped with stones, however, proved to be a troublesome opponent. Never did I know that stones could do so much damage! Fortunately, we were fighting in a tunnel with lots of corners, which gave the centaur (barely) enough time to be healed by Ely.\n\nThe centaur's first artefact was an amulet of conservation with dex+3 modifier. However, it seemed to me that gourmand was more important for the centaur at the time, so I decided to leave that amulet in his pack, and switch when needed.\n\nSome killer bees caught up the centaur. Being deft and fast (even faster than me!), the centaur almost died to them. Even Elyvilon stopped curing him, maybe because he resorted to purification too much. It's just pure luck that he finally landed some blows on them before he was poisoned to death.\n\n## D:7\n\nThe centaur noticed a smoking ring mail near the stairs. However, it was guarded by a band of orcs. After the centaur cleared the orcs, I realized that he didn't have any scrolls of detect or remove curses at hand. To play it safely, the ring mail had to be tried out later.\n\n## D:8\n\nBeing cornered by a killer bee and another centaur, I decided to experiment with nutralizing monsters. It worked like a charm on the killer bee. Unfortunately for that other centaur, instead of collecting more data, I just socked him to death.\n\nLater, Prince Ribbit came to see if the centaur could break his bewitchment. Out of altruism, the kind centaur promised the prince that he'd do whatever he can to break this curse. He recalled that in some fairy tale, there's a frog who turned to a prince after being thrown against a well. After some trial and error, Prince Ribbit was angered (possibly by the violent involved in the process) and teleported himself away. Nevertheless, a promise is a promise. The centaur went to find out the prince, and made his wish come true.\n\n## D:9\n\nThe centaur met his demise when he was badly damaged by a big kobold, and Psyche came from behind zapping a wand of negative energy. In retrospect, maybe the free healing provided by Elyvilon had gave me a false sense of security; the centaur's AC was low and didn't have any resistance, which could be fatal for a melee combatant. With his low aptitude in dodging, the skill wasn't trained enough as well.\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<meta

1=\n==D:1==\nSince Elyvilon has no interests in corpses, the centaur chopped up all of them except poisonous ones. You know, centaurs get hungry FAST. Contaminated chunks was not a big problem, thanks to Ely's purification.\n\nAs centaurs are excellent at ranged weapons, especially bows, I let the centaur collects all darts, arrows, and poison needles, for some ranged attacks against fleeing enemies. Nevertheless, most of the times he can just ran up to them.\n\n==D:3==\nA good kobold lent the naga his uncursed glowing blowgun. I could see this device come handy against innocent orges. Running away from them and watching the toxin kicking in is always fun.\n\nThe centaur had accumulated 3 amulets at the end of this level. Luckily, although he got few scrolls, one of the was a scroll of identify and revealed a amulet of the gourmand. Hopefully, this thing and purification could cancel the centaur's disadvantage of fast metabolism.\n\n==D:4==\nHere comes Sigmund. I want to test my glowing blowgun on him, but a gnoll came for the centaur from the other way. I didn't know whether he's attracted by Sigmund's shout or the centaur's clip-clop, but that didn't matter. It's time to retreat!\n\nIt look much longer time for the centaur than my NaVM to kill Sigmund with poison. That's just fair, I guess, considering the fact that VM had invested much time practicing poison magic, while the centaur was just a casual needle blower.\n\n==D:6==\nA troll noticed the centaur. With only 7 AC, it was better for the centaur not to get involved in melee combat with a troll for a long time. I decided to dump it on D:5. The centaur ran to the nearest stairs, prayed to Elyvilon for divine protection, and waited for the troll to get close in. Once the troll got near, the centaur started climbing up. Meanwhile, the troll was busy biting and clawing the centaur, reduced his hp from 50 to 6. Wow, that hurt much more than what I thought.\n\nOther than poison needles, my tactics against hard-hitting enemies was a loop of hit and run. Orc warriors equipped with stones, however, proved to be a troublesome opponent. Never did I know that stones could do so much damage! Fortunately, we were fighting in a tunnel with lots of corners, which gave the centaur (barely) enough time to be healed by Ely.\n\nThe centaur's first artefact was an amulet of conservation with dex+3 modifier. However, it seemed to me that gourmand was more important for the centaur at the time, so I decided to leave that amulet in his pack, and switch when needed.\n\nSome killer bees caught up the centaur. Being deft and fast (even faster than me!), the centaur almost died to them. Even Elyvilon stopped curing him, maybe because he resorted to purification too much. It's just pure luck that he finally landed some blows on them before he was poisoned to death.\n\n==D:7==\nThe centaur noticed a smoking ring mail near the stairs. However, it was guarded by a band of orcs. After the centaur cleared the orcs, I realized that he didn't have any scrolls of detect or remove curses at hand. To play it safely, the ring mail had to be tried out later.\n\n==D:8==\nBeing cornered by a killer bee and another centaur, I decided to experiment with nutralizing monsters. It worked like a charm on the killer bee. Unfortunately for that other centaur, instead of collecting more data, I just socked him to death.\n\nLater, Prince Ribbit came to see if the centaur could break his bewitchment. Out of altruism, the kind centaur promised the prince that he'd do whatever he can to break this curse. He recalled that in some fairy tale, there's a frog who turned to a prince after being thrown against a well. After some trial and error, Prince Ribbit was angered (possibly by the violent involved in the process) and teleported himself away. Nevertheless, a promise is a promise. The centaur went to find out the prince, and made his wish come true.\n\n== D:9 ==\nThe centaur met his demise when he was badly damaged by a big kobold, and Psyche came from behind zapping a wand of negative energy. In retrospect, maybe the free healing provided by Elyvilon had gave me a false sense of security; the centaur's AC was low and didn't have any resistance, which could be fatal for a melee combatant. With his low aptitude in dodging, the skill wasn't trained enough as well."}

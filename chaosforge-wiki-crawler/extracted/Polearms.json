Polearms tend to deal less damage than other weapon types, but have an innate [[reaching]] ability, allowing them to attack from 2 tiles away. It [[cross-train]]s with the [[Axes]] skill and the [[Staves]] skill.\n\nYou may reach with a polearm by pressing '''v''', and any form of [[tab|autofight]] ('''Tab''') will do it for you.\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n==List of Polearms==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

An extra tile of reach means you'll get 1 \"free\" hit against a melee enemy. If you are concerned about early Dungeon survival, then start with a polearm (spear or trident).\n\nPolearms can reach over [[deep water]], [[summon]]s, and other [[allies]]. If you have a consistent source of allies, such as [[Summonings]] spells or the [[Hepliaklqana]] ancestor, then these weapons can do you well.\n\nThere is an odd lack of one-handed polearms. Until you have access to a [[demon trident]], your next best option is the regular [[trident]].\n\n==History==\n* Prior to [[0.10]], polearms could only reach if they had the [[reaching]] brand, but polearms dealt more damage overall.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Melee_weapon#Polearms|List of polearms]]\n*[[Species#Melee_.26_Ranged_Combat|Table of species aptitudes]]\n\n{{Skills}}\n[[Category:Polearms|*]]\n[[Category:Weapon skills]]"}

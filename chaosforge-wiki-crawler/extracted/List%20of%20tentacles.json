{"title":"List of tentacles","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_tentacles","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n'''Tentacles''' are an unusual type of monster that span more than one tile. The most common tentacles count as parts of larger creatures (such as [[kraken]]s), so harming them will also harm their owner.\n\n==Tentacle types==\n*{{monsterlink|Kraken tentacle}}- The great crushing limbs of a terrible kraken.\n*{{monsterlink|Snaplasher vine}}- A tentacle-like plant controlled by a [[dryad]] which can be summoned by [[Summon Forest]].\n*{{monsterlink|Starspawn tentacle}}- Tentacled starspawn ensnare those who wander [[the Abyss]] in an endless barrage of tentacles, then pull them into their waiting maw.\n*{{monsterlink|Eldritch tentacle}}- A curious, nightmarish thing of chaos from beyond our reality, summoned through a [[malign gateway]].\n\n==Strategy==\nIn order to deal maximum damage to the monster, try to hit as many tentacle segments as possible at once. A [[wand of iceblast]] or the [[Fireball]] spell can help you fight tentacles from a safe distance. [[Cleaving]] attacks are especially useful when fighting tentacles in melee.\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

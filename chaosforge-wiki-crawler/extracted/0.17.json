The Rot status is also gone, with rot taking place immediately.\n* Stat loss is no longer regenerated over time; instead, it's restored by XP.\n* The [deterioration][29] mutation is now only 2 levels, and has a chance of causing stat loss whenever the player takes damage, rather than over time.\n* Being at 0 in a stat no longer causes direct damage to the player.\n* Undead stat gain: [Mummies][30] get one of Str, Int, or Dex every 5 levels, and [Vampires][31] get either Int or Dex every 5 levels.\n* Vampires can now drink from anything that has blood, regardless of their chunk type.\n* Headbutt aux attacks no longer apply a small stun and the hooves aux kicks no longer bypass AC.\n* Unarmed attacks no longer have a speed penalty when attacking with a shield.\n* Cleaving attacks now function even under [confusion][32].\n* Control-attacking &amp; manipulating doors are no longer permitted under confusion.\n* Confusion will never cause characters to stumble into deep water/lava.\n* [Corrosion][33] can affect characters not using weapons or armour, and applies -4 to both armour and slaying (instead of -5/-3).\n* Multi-turn actions, other than climbing/descending stairs, no longer reduce EV by 5 for their duration.\n* Poison-immune characters (e.g. gargoyles, mummies) no longer take poison damage.\n* Draconian Fighters no longer start with extra equipment.\n* [Teleportitis][34] only triggers when it would land the player in LOS of enemies. It triggers slightly more frequently as a result, but no longer triggers in Labyrinths or the Abyss.\n* The 'spiny' mutation is now dramatically stronger.\n* Powered by Death is now triggered by kills, instead of corpses.\n* Black Mark no longer gives vampirism; its other effects are now stronger.\n* Clawed attacks no longer have bleeding-over-time damage effects.\n* There's now a distinct hunger state of Fainting and appropriate warning messages for when the player is so low on nutrition that they might become paralyzed.\n* The Breathe Flames and Spit Poison mutations are now mutually exclusive.\n* [Demonspawn][35] can shoot through their own demonic guardians.\n* Ability scores now cap at 125, up from 72.\n* Some species now have lower Throwing aptitudes: \n  * [Centaur][36], [Halfling][37], and [Kobold][38] go from +3 to +1;\n  * [Ogre][39], [Spriggan][40], [Tengu][41], [High Elf][42], and [Deep Elf][43] go from +1 to 0;\n  * [Hill Orc][44] and [Gargoyle][45] go from 0 to -1.\n## Geometry \n\n* All range-based mechanics now treat diagonals identically to orthogonal directions.

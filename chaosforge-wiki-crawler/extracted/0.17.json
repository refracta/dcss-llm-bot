The Rot status is also gone, with rot taking place immediately.\n\n- Stat loss is no longer regenerated over time; instead, it's restored by XP.\n\n- The [deterioration](/Deterioration \"Deterioration\") mutation is now only 2 levels, and has a chance of causing stat loss whenever the player takes damage, rather than over time.\n\n- Being at 0 in a stat no longer causes direct damage to the player.\n\n- Undead stat gain: [Mummies](/Mummies \"Mummies\") get one of Str, Int, or Dex every 5 levels, and [Vampires](/Vampire \"Vampire\") get either Int or Dex every 5 levels.\n\n- Vampires can now drink from anything that has blood, regardless of their chunk type.\n\n- Headbutt aux attacks no longer apply a small stun and the hooves aux kicks no longer bypass AC.\n\n- Unarmed attacks no longer have a speed penalty when attacking with a shield.\n\n- Cleaving attacks now function even under [confusion](/Confusion \"Confusion\").\n\n- Control-attacking & manipulating doors are no longer permitted under confusion.\n\n- Confusion will never cause characters to stumble into deep water/lava.\n\n- [Corrosion](/Corrosion \"Corrosion\") can affect characters not using weapons or armour, and applies -4 to both armour and slaying (instead of -5/-3).\n\n- Multi-turn actions, other than climbing/descending stairs, no longer reduce EV by 5 for their duration.\n\n- Poison-immune characters (e.g. gargoyles, mummies) no longer take poison damage.\n\n- Draconian Fighters no longer start with extra equipment.\n\n- [Teleportitis](/Teleportitis \"Teleportitis\") only triggers when it would land the player in LOS of enemies.

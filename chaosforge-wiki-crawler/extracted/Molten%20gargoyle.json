{"title":"Molten gargoyle","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Molten_gargoyle","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n{{list of|constructs}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Molten gargoyles''' are the rarest of the [[gargoyle]] types. They aren't much stronger than a standard gargoyle, but their attacks inflict additional [[fire]] damage, and their [[Bolt of Magma]] can hurt. They can be found in [[Gehenna]], the [[Desolation of Salt]], some [[volcano]] layouts, and certain fire-themed [[vault]]s.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Fire resistance will help reduce the damage you take.\n*Unlike [[gargoyle (monster)|regular gargoyle]]s or [[war gargoyle]]s, molten gargoyles are not susceptible to [[LRD]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], molten gargoyles knew no spells, wielded no weapons, and were mostly harmless to anything but your scrolls."}

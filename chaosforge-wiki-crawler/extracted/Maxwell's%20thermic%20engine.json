When it hits its target the thermal gradient increases. What causes this effect is unknown but it is rumored that otherworldly forces are involved.\n\nIt becomes more effective when it hits something. This effect fades over time.}}\n[[File:Maxwells thermic engine.png]] '''the +2 Maxwell's thermic engine'''\n\n+2 [[double sword]]\n\nSimultaneous [[Flaming]] and [[Freezing]] brands (applies both)<br>\nEnchantment increases as you land hits and decreases over time\n__NOTOC__\n==Mechanics==\nThe engine's enchantment increases by 1 or 2 each time its wielder lands a hit (including those from ripostes from the [[fencer's gloves]]), up to a maximum of +14. It decreases by 1 for each turn spent not hitting a creature (i.e. not attacking, moving, waiting, missed swings, etc.), but will not decrease past the base level of +2. The enchantment immediately drops to +2 if the sword is unwielded.\n\nThis weapon will cauterize a [[hydra]]'s heads like any other edged weapon of flaming, then apply freezing for the chance to slow (without cutting another head).\n\n==Desirability==\nHigh. Double swords are one of the best one-handed [[Long Blades]], and flaming and freezing are great brands on their own. So, as a double sword with both brands, and the potential for high enchant, '''Maxwell's thermic engine'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|1543}}</ref> is among the strongest one-handers before [[extended]]. (As extended is filled with evil, a [[holy wrath]] weapon will usually come out ahead.)\n\nDo note that, in order to increase the enchantment, you actually need to hit. If you're facing high-[[EV]] creatures, it can take a while to get this sword going; a more conventionally enchanted sword may perform better in this circumstance.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.22]], Maxwell's thermic engine gave its wielder rF- and rC-.\n*Maxwell's thermic engine was added in [[0.20]], replacing both the [[Dagger of Chilly Death]] and [[Scimitar of Flaming Death]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

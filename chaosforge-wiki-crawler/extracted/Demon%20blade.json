A.D.<br>\ntrans. Richard Mott Gummere, 1917.}}\n\n{{crawlquote|This weapon falls into the [[Long Blades]] category. It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Demon blades''' are one of the best one-handed Long Blades you can find. Although [[double sword]]s deal more damage, demon blades are slightly faster, with roughly the same damage/turn.\n\nWorshippers of [[good]] [[god]]s cannot attack with them without suffering [[penance]]. However, worshippers [[the Shining One]] can convert a demon blade into a [[eudemon blade]], with better stats and the [[holy wrath]] brand. You can reverse the process with [[Kikubaaqudgha]]'s or [[Lugonu]]'s blessing.\n\n==Strategy==\nDemon weapons are often found on the [[hell knight]]s in the [[Depths]] and the [[Vestibule of Hell]], often with good [[enchant]]ment levels and [[brand]]s.\n\n===Compared to double sword===\nOn most species, [[double sword]]s are mostly equivalent to demon blades. If both weapons are at minimum delay, a +0 demon blade is 1% stronger than a +0 double sword against a 0 AC opponent. As the demon blade attacks faster, it is penalized more by [[AC]], though it benefits more from [[slaying]] and [[auxiliary attack]]s. \n\nOverall, the differences are too small to make an impact. A +9 demon blade is enough to win you the game, as is a +9 double sword. Generally, the sword you get ''first'' should be the sword that you use. (The sword you get first can benefit first from [[scrolls of enchant weapon]]).\n\nFor small species ([[Kobold]] and [[Spriggan]]), the demon blade will usually come out ahead, because it does not use the shield slot.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

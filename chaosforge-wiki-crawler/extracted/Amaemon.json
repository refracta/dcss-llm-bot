{"title":"Amaemon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Amaemon","type":"raw","data":"{{version|030}}\n{{list of|demonspawn}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Amaemon the Diabolical Poisoner''' is a [[unique]] [[demonspawn]] with an [[orange demon]] friend, the ability to summon [[scorpion]]s, and a weakly enchanted [[demon whip]] of [[venom]] (with a 1% of instead being [[Snakebite]]). He tops this off with Concentrate Venom, increasing the power of all this poison.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Location==\n*[[Dungeon]]: 8-12\n*[[The Lair]]\n*[[Orcish Mines]]:1\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Poison resistance is highly recommended. If you don't have it, consider avoiding Amaemon until you find some; if that isn't an option, do your best to kill him as quickly as possible, preferably from a distance.\n** A [[potion of resistance]] will help in a pinch. A [[potion of lignification]] will also grant you rPois, but be careful where you turn into a tree -- you won't be able to move afterwards, and the orange demon can strike you from a distance.\n*Much like other summoner/ally-focused monsters, aim to limit how many things can strike you during the fight. Retreating to a corridor or a [[kill hole]] will cut down on the poison you'll take. Killing Amaemon will remove the main threat from the fight -- an orange demon on its own tends to be a fairly easy foe.\n*If you focus on using physical attacks, try not to close to melee range with Amaemon's orange demon ally; being [[weak]]ened means you'll take longer to kill Amaemon, giving him and his scorpions that much more time to inject lethal amounts of poison.\n*Many characters, whether they were using [[Maces & Flails]] or not, will appreciate getting an early [[demon whip]] off of Amaemon. It might come with a small negative enchantment, but it's well worth using some [[scrolls of enchant weapon]] to beef it up.\n\n==History==\n*Amaemon was introduced in [[0.29]]."}

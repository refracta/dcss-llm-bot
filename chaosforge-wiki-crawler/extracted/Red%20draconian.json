{"title":"Red draconian","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Red_draconian","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n{{list of | draconians}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Red draconians''' are the [[fire]]-themed members of the [[list of draconians|draconian]] family. Although their fire breath attacks are fairly powerful (3d18) and leave flame [[cloud]]s where they land, you should probably be prepared for fire already due to the [[draconian scorcher]]s and [[orbs of fire]] you can also find in the area. They can be found primarily in [[the Realm of Zot]], but occasionally appear in [[the Abyss]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Fire resistance helps defend against their breath attacks. [[Freezing]]-[[brand]]ed weapons help make combat against them much easier.\n*Monstrous red draconians are far less effective with their fire breath than a competent player, as they always aim it to go as far as possible, rather than at the feet of their target. When fighting red draconians, just avoid standing with your back to a wall."}

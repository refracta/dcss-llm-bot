Thankfully, they are not especially durable. They can be found in [[the Abyss]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The duration of sickness depends on how long the zyme remains in LOS, so destroying it quickly will make sickness less of an issue.\n*[[Undead]] and [[nonliving]] characters are immune to the passive sickness and can largely ignore ancient zymes. For everyone else, a [[potion of cancellation]] or [[Elyvilon]]'s Purification ability will remove the status if necessary.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], ancient zymes could [[see invisible]].\n*[[Sickness]] was made more difficult to deal with in [[0.27]].\n*Ancient zymes were added in [[0.12]]."}

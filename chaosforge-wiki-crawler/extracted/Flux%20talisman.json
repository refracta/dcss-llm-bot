Its user becomes unstable at a fundamental level, inflicting dangerous levels of magical contamination on foes with each touch. Sufficient contamination causes a highly localized meltdown, dealing enormous damage which increases with the user's Shapeshifting skill.\n\nHowever, this instability makes the user unable to use weapons, shields or body armour. They also glow, reducing stealth and preventing invisibility, and their melee damage is reduced, as their limbs sometimes destabilize mid-swing.}}\n\n[[File:flux talisman.png]] A '''flux talisman''' is a [[talisman]] that changes you into '''Flux Form'''.\n\n[[Shapeshifter]]s start with this item.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen e'''V'''oked, a flux talisman turns you into Flux Form, which lasts until you end the form. Entering or exiting a form takes 5 turns.\n\nFlux Form has the following effects:\n\n'''Combat Bonuses'''\n*'''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' 3 base damage (''no boost'').\n*'''Contaminating attacks:''' When you hit an enemy, you contaminate them. The first hit inflicts [[Corona]]. The third hit inflicts [[malmutate]], deals heavy damage, and resets contamination. This deals (0 to 10) damage at 0 skill, (0 to 30) damage at 7 skill, (0 to 50) damage at 14 or more skill, with linear scaling in-between.\n*'''Bonus EV:''' +4 EV.\n*All melee damage is reduced by -33%.\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n*'''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' [[Weapon]], [[shield]], [[body armour]].\n*You cannot [[throw]] items.\n*'''Glowing:''' You are revealed if [[invisible]], and your [[stealth]] is greatly reduced.\n\nFlux Form does not block any [[mutation]]s, does not change your [[size]], and gives no innate bonus to HP / [[AC]].\n\nFlux Form has a minimum of 7 [[Shapeshifting]] skill, below which you get an [[Talisman#Skill|HP penalty]], and the contamination effect scales down. It has a maximum skill of 14; further skill has no further impact.\n\n==Strategy==\nA form that's between [[Beast Form]] and the stronger forms. At the min. skill of 7, the contam proc is better than having [[electrocution]]. While your actual melee damage is reduced, your overall damage output is still good, and the Corona / malmutate status are very nice to have.\n\n==History==\n*Flux talismans were introduced in [[0.31]], along with talismans themselves.\n\n{{Forms}}\n\n[[Category: Transformation]]"}

This halves the resilience of all living creatures, although it is never directly fatal.}}\n\nReading a [[scroll of torment]] inflicts [[torment]] on yourself and all monsters in your [[line of sight]], cutting their HP in half. Monsters that are [[demonic]], [[undead]], [[nonliving]], or [[holy]] are immune. For players, only undead are immune. Each rank of rN+ offers 10% damage reduction (-5% max HP lost). Only undead players are immune to torment.\n\nThis scroll is considered [[evil]], so the [[good god]]s forbid its intentional use.\n\n==Strategy==\nScrolls of torment are inherently dubious: reading the scroll will halve your HP, and monsters get a turn to attack as you read the scroll. However, it ''does'' have uses: \n\n*If you're [[Torment Immunity|immune to torment]], these scrolls are obviously useful. [[Undead]] species ([[Ghoul]], [[Mummy]], bloodless [[Vampire]]) are naturally immune; for other species, [[Tree Form]] confers immunity, but prevents you from moving.\n*If you have healing items, torment can be an excellent ace-in-the-hole item, allowing you to kill things above your league.\n**If monsters can't attack you, tormenting yourself can be \"safe\" without healing. You can torment an [[out-of-depth]] melee monster, attack it before it gets in range, and go up the stairs if it fails.\n*Torment can be great for taking out [[the Royal Jelly]]. Tormenting TRJ still creates high-level jellies, but you can follow up with a [[scroll of immolation]], [[Ignition]], or a number of strategies mentioned in [[The Royal Jelly#Strategy|TRJ's page]]. A second torment may be necessary.\n*Worshippers of [[Kikubaaqudgha]] with sufficiently high [[piety]] have a chance to receive some protection from torment effects, sometimes preventing the damage altogether.\n\nWithout a means of healing and/or escape, you'll want some form of heavy torment resistance ([[Gargoyle]]s, [[Statue Form]], [[Kiku]] protection...) before using this scroll. Usually, there are better last resorts than torment.\n\nOnce you reach [[Zot:5]] and [[extended]], almost all monsters are immune to torment, making this scroll nearly pointless.\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

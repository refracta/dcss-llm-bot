Rock is the only material for which the [Passwall](/Passwall \"Passwall\") spell functions, allowing you to slip through it. Destroyed by:\n\n- [Formicids](/Formicid \"Formicid\")' digging ability\n- [Dig](/Dig \"Dig\") (or a [wand of digging](/Wand_of_digging \"Wand of digging\"))\n- [Shatter](/Shatter \"Shatter\")\n- [Fedhas](/Fedhas \"Fedhas\")' Overgrowth\n- [Lugonu](/Lugonu \"Lugonu\")'s Corruption\n- [Dissolution](/Dissolution \"Dissolution\")\n\n### Translucent Rock\n\n> The mineral this rock consists of is as translucent as good quality glass. Whether it is natural or magical, you can't tell.\n\nIdentical to rock walls, except they don't block sight.\n\nFor the purposes of attacking and other abilities, translucent walls are treated as solid walls. You can't attack or blink through these walls, even with piercing or [smite-targeted](/Smite-targeted \"Smite-targeted\") attacks.\n\n### Stone\n\n> A harder obstacle than rock walls. Only the mightiest magic can shatter stone walls.\n\nMore durable than rock walls, these require stronger magic to remove. Destroyed by:\n\n- Shatter\n- Overgrowth\n- Corruption\n\n### Translucent Stone\n\n> It has been imbued with arcane magics which render it translucent.\n\nThe stone analog to transparent rock.\n\n### Metal\n\n> A wall of bluish-grey metal. As every dungeon electrician knows, this stuff will ground even magical bolts of lightning.\n\nMetal walls are similar to stone walls. The metal prevents [Shock](/Shock \"Shock\") and [Lightning Bolt](/Lightning_Bolt \"Lightning Bolt\") from bouncing off it. [Lee's Rapid Deconstruction](/Lee%27s_Rapid_Deconstruction \"Lee's Rapid Deconstruction\") is stronger when used on a metal wall. Destroyed by:\n\n- Shatter\n- Overgrowth\n- Corruption\n\n### Crystal\n\n> A wall made from polished crystal and imbued with arcane magics. They prevent its easy destruction, and make it reflect heat and cold.\n\nCrystal walls are also similar to stone walls. They will reflect [fire](/Fire \"Fire\") and [cold](/Cold \"Cold\"), the same way stone walls reflect [Shock](/Shock \"Shock\"). [Lee's Rapid Deconstruction](/Lee%27s_Rapid_Deconstruction \"Lee's Rapid Deconstruction\") is stronger when used on a crystal wall. Destroyed by:\n\n- Shatter\n- Overgrowth\n- Corruption\n\n### Trees\n\n[![Tree1.png](/images/7/7e/Tree1.png)](/File:Tree1.png)[![Tree2.png](/images/5/52/Tree2.png)](/File:Tree2.png)[![Tree3.png](/images/5/58/Tree3.png)](/File:Tree3.png)[![Tree4.png](/images/6/62/Tree4.png)](/File:Tree4.png)[![Tree5.png](/images/0/02/Tree5.png)](/File:Tree5.png)[![Tree6.png](/images/9/9c/Tree6.png)](/File:Tree6.png)[![Tree7.png](/images/a/ab/Tree7.png)](/File:Tree7.png)[![Tree8.png](/images/4/4d/Tree8.png)](/File:Tree8.png)[![Tree9.png](/images/f/fc/Tree9.png)](/File:Tree9.png)[![Tree10.png](/images/b/bd/Tree10.png)](/File:Tree10.png)[![Tree11.png](/images/9/9e/Tree11.png)](/File:Tree11.png)[![Tree12.png](/images/2/23/Tree12.png)](/File:Tree12.png)[![Tree13.png](/images/3/3b/Tree13.png)](/File:Tree13.png)[![Tree14.png](/images/3/3f/Tree14.png)](/File:Tree14.png)[![Tree15.png](/images/1/15/Tree15.png)](/File:Tree15.png)[![Tree16.png](/images/2/2b/Tree16.png)](/File:Tree16.png)[![Tree1Dead.png](/images/d/df/Tree1Dead.png)](/File:Tree1Dead.png)[![Tree1LightRed.png](/images/8/8f/Tree1LightRed.png)](/File:Tree1LightRed.png)[![Tree2Dead.png](/images/d/df/Tree2Dead.png)](/File:Tree2Dead.png)[![Tree2LightRed.png](/images/c/c0/Tree2LightRed.png)](/File:Tree2LightRed.png)[![Tree2Yellow.png](/images/7/73/Tree2Yellow.png)](/File:Tree2Yellow.png)[![Tree6Yellow.png](/images/6/61/Tree6Yellow.png)](/File:Tree6Yellow.png)[![Tree7Red.png](/images/6/61/Tree7Red.png)](/File:Tree7Red.png)[![Tree10Red.png](/images/4/4f/Tree10Red.png)](/File:Tree10Red.png)\n\n> While the dungeon is filled with dim magic light, in most places it is not bright enough to sustain any larger plants. It is uneven, though, and there are spots where, with the grace of Fedhas, trees as big as those on the surface can grow underground.  \n>   \n> \"Only YOU can prevent forest fires!\"  \n> -Smokey the Bear\n\nFunctionally walls, these block movement and LOS. Despite having the ability to walk through [plants](/Plant \"Plant\"), followers of [Fedhas Madash](/Fedhas_Madash \"Fedhas Madash\") cannot pass through trees. If lit ablaze, they cause forest fires that spread fire to the spaces (and other trees) around them. Unlike walls, they cannot be affected by [Lee's Rapid Deconstruction](/Lee%27s_Rapid_Deconstruction \"Lee's Rapid Deconstruction\") or [Frozen Ramparts](/Frozen_Ramparts \"Frozen Ramparts\"). Destroyed by:\n\n- Player-castable fire spells:\n\n  - [Inner Flame](/Inner_Flame \"Inner Flame\") explosions (including from [scroll of immolation](/Scroll_of_immolation \"Scroll of immolation\"))\n  - [Flame Wave](/Flame_Wave \"Flame Wave\")\n  - [Fireball](/Fireball \"Fireball\")\n  - [Starburst](/Starburst \"Starburst\")\n  - [Ignition](/Ignition \"Ignition\")\n  - [Fire Storm](/Fire_Storm \"Fire Storm\")\n\n- Monster-only fire spells:\n\n  - [Bolt of Magma](/Bolt_of_Magma \"Bolt of Magma\")\n  - [Bolt of Fire](/Bolt_of_Fire \"Bolt of Fire\")\n  - [Lightning Bolt](/Lightning_Bolt \"Lightning Bolt\")\n\n- Nearby [spreading flames](/Cloud#Spreading_flames \"Cloud\")\n\n- [Polar Vortex](/Polar_Vortex \"Polar Vortex\")\n\n- [The Lernaean hydra](/The_Lernaean_hydra \"The Lernaean hydra\")\n\n- Shatter\n\n- Overgrow\n\n- Corruption\n\nIf you are worshipping Fedhas, none of your spells are able to destroy trees (Fedhas actively protects them). Overgrow still works, however. Trees created by [Summon Forest](/Summon_Forest \"Summon Forest\") cannot be destroyed as easily; only Shatter / Overgrow / Corruption work.\n\n### Demonic Trees\n\n[![Tree demonic1.png](/images/a/a3/Tree_demonic1.png)](/File:Tree_demonic1.png)[![Tree demonic2.png](/images/b/bf/Tree_demonic2.png)](/File:Tree_demonic2.png)[![Tree demonic3.png](/images/c/c3/Tree_demonic3.png)](/File:Tree_demonic3.png)[![Tree demonic4.png](/images/b/b3/Tree_demonic4.png)](/File:Tree_demonic4.png)[![Tree demonic5.png](/images/b/b4/Tree_demonic5.png)](/File:Tree_demonic5.png)[![Tree demonic6.png](/images/b/b2/Tree_demonic6.png)](/File:Tree_demonic6.png)[![Tree demonic7.png](/images/f/f7/Tree_demonic7.png)](/File:Tree_demonic7.png)[![Tree demonic8.png](/images/6/65/Tree_demonic8.png)](/File:Tree_demonic8.png)[![Tree demonic9.png](/images/0/04/Tree_demonic9.png)](/File:Tree_demonic9.png)[![Tree demonic10.png](/images/a/a4/Tree_demonic10.png)](/File:Tree_demonic10.png)[![Tree demonic11.png](/images/4/44/Tree_demonic11.png)](/File:Tree_demonic11.png)[![Tree demonic12.png](/images/4/4f/Tree_demonic12.png)](/File:Tree_demonic12.png)[![Tree demonic13.png](/images/d/d9/Tree_demonic13.png)](/File:Tree_demonic13.png)[![Tree demonic14.png](/images/e/e0/Tree_demonic14.png)](/File:Tree_demonic14.png)[![Tree demonic15.png](/images/4/4f/Tree_demonic15.png)](/File:Tree_demonic15.png)[![Tree demonic16.png](/images/1/11/Tree_demonic16.png)](/File:Tree_demonic16.png)\n\n> A tree hideously warped by the demonic forces of chaos. Despite its bizarre appearance and occasional, unsettling movement, it seems harmless.\n\nBurning a demonic tree produces a [cloud of seething chaos](/Cloud#Seething_chaos \"Cloud\") instead of fire.\n\n### Petrified Trees\n\n[![Tree petrified1.png](/images/2/20/Tree_petrified1.png)](/File:Tree_petrified1.png)[![Tree petrified2.png](/images/d/dd/Tree_petrified2.png)](/File:Tree_petrified2.png)[![Tree petrified3.png](/images/4/43/Tree_petrified3.png)](/File:Tree_petrified3.png)\n\n> An ancient tree, long ago passed from biology into geology. While no longer wooden in a material sense, it retains the spiritual qualities of a tree.\n\nUnlike other trees, petrified trees can be [dug](/Wand_of_digging \"Wand of digging\") through.\n\n### Mangroves\n\n[![Mangrove1.png](/images/0/0b/Mangrove1.png)](/File:Mangrove1.png)[![Mangrove2.png](/images/3/3a/Mangrove2.png)](/File:Mangrove2.png)[![Mangrove3.png](/images/0/03/Mangrove3.png)](/File:Mangrove3.png)\n\n> This tree is specially adapted for growing in swampy conditions. Its vines are too thick to see through.\n\nThese function identically to trees, save that they grow in [shallow water](/Shallow_water \"Shallow water\").\n\n### Slime Covered Rock\n\n> This wall is thickly coated with bright green slime. Ewwwwww.\n\nFound only in [the Slime Pits](/The_Slime_Pits \"The Slime Pits\"), these inflict [corrosion](/Corrosion \"Corrosion\") to any adventurer adjacent to one. Every slime wall currently adjacent to you inflicts 1 stack of corrosion (-4 damage and [AC](/AC \"AC\")). Otherwise the same as rock wall.\n\nFollowers of [Jiyva](/Jiyva \"Jiyva\") are immune to the effects of slime walls, and at 3\\* piety, can temporarily turn walls into slime. Jiyva-created walls deal [acid](/Acid \"Acid\") damage to every enemy adjacent to them.\n\nDestroyed by:\n\n- Formicid's digging ability\n- Dig\n- Shatter\n- Overgrowth\n- Corruption\n- Dissolution\n\n### Rune-Carved Stone\n\n> A strangely slime-free wall, carved all over with countless protective runes. One often repeated set of runes seems to refer to 'the royal jelly.'\n\nThese walls make up the outside portions of the central chamber of the bottom of the [Slime Pits](/Slime_Pits \"Slime Pits\"). They are otherwise identical to stone walls. Destroyed by:\n\n- Shatter\n- Overgrowth\n- Corruption\n\n### Rune-Carved Clear Stone\n\n> A strangely slime-free stone wall, with strange lights twinkling within its airy confines. Mystical runes are scattered across its surface, seemingly referring to a 'Royal Jelly'.\n\nThese transparent walls make up the interior of the central chamber of Slime:5. If [the Royal Jelly](/The_Royal_Jelly \"The Royal Jelly\") is dead (or if you have high [piety](/Piety \"Piety\") with [Jiyva](/Jiyva \"Jiyva\")), these walls will vanish, allowing easy access to the Slimy [Rune of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\"). Without these methods, these walls can only be destroyed with:\n\n- Shatter\n- Overgrowth\n- Corruption\n\n### Iron Grate\n\n> A rusted iron grate, brittle enough to be disrupted with a spell or a wand quite easily. It's too strong to be breakable by hand, though.\n\nThese block movement and line of fire, but they do not block [LOS](/LOS \"LOS\") or line of effect, so [smite-targeted](/Smite-targeted \"Smite-targeted\") attacks can get through. They are usually found in special vaults, often sealing away monsters with smite-targeted attacks. Destroyed by:\n\n- Formicid's digging ability\n- Dig\n- Shatter\n- Overgrowth\n- Corruption\n- Dissolution\n\nYou can use [Blink](/Blink \"Blink\"), [Passage of Golubria](/Passage_of_Golubria \"Passage of Golubria\"), or [dispersal traps](/Dispersal_trap \"Dispersal trap\") to pass in or out of grates. You can also use [Dispersal](/Dispersal \"Dispersal\") or [Disjunction](/Disjunction \"Disjunction\") to bring enemies out of grates.\n\n### Large Window\n\n> A window embedded in the side of an enormous metal pipe, allowing observation of the water flowing inside.\n\nLarge windows are found in certain [Sewers](/Sewers \"Sewers\") maps, and function identically to transparent rock walls.\n\n### Unnaturally Hard Wall\n\n> You cannot affect this wall by any means.\n\nWalls which are described as unnaturally hard are completely indestructible. The only way past them is to go around.\n\n### Translucent Unnaturally Hard Wall\n\n> This wall is imbued with magic that not only makes it indestructible but also makes it translucent like glass.\n\nThe indestructible variant of translucent rock.\n\n## Map boundaries\n\nThe following \"walls\" are found on the edges of certain floors.\n\n### Open Sea\n\n> Nothing but endless wind and waves, and not a lighthouse in sight. You'd be lost beyond all hope in short order - better not risk it.  \n> The ferocious winds and tides of the open sea thwart your progress.\n\nWhile not walls in the traditional sense, these impassable tiles mark the outer borders of the [Shoals](/Shoals \"Shoals\") and certain [Sewers](/Sewers \"Sewers\") layouts.\n\n### Endless Lava\n\n> A sea of fire and brimstone that goes as far as you can see. Which is not far because of the thick smoke.  \n> Unlike small pools of lava where flight or levitation may allow short trips, floating above this inferno would cook you in no time thanks to runaway convection.  \n> The endless sea of lava is not a nice place.\n\nThe fiery equivalent of the open sea tiles, these mark the outer borders of a floor across lava pools.\n\n### Endless Salt\n\n> A seemingly endless, flat plain, wracked by blinding salt storms. Anyone venturing across it would be lost beyond all hope in short order.\n\nMuch like open sea and endless lava, these mark the outer borders of the [Desolation of Salt](/Desolation_of_Salt \"Desolation of Salt\").\n\n### Dimension's Edge\n\n> The edge of this tiny, isolated plane, where space itself dissolves into oblivion. Entering or affecting this black void is impossible.\n\nYet another impenetrable level border, this time bordering the [Roulette of Golubria](/Roulette_of_Golubria \"Roulette of Golubria\").\n\n## History\n\n- In [0.32](/0.32 \"0.32\"), new decorative walls will be added.\n- Prior to [0.30](/0.30 \"0.30\"), slime-covered walls would damage players and monsters with acid damage.\n- In [0.27](/0.27 \"0.27\"), demonic and petrified trees were added. Initially, burned demonic trees released durably summoned demons in addition to chaos clouds, but this was removed before the release.\n- Prior to [0.22](/0.22 \"0.22\"), [Lee's Rapid Deconstruction](/Lee%27s_Rapid_Deconstruction \"Lee's Rapid Deconstruction\") could destroy walls, doors, iron grates and statues.\n- Prior to [0.20](/0.20 \"0.20\"), [wands of disintegration](/Wand_of_disintegration \"Wand of disintegration\") could destroy rock walls and some other obstacles in the dungeon ([doors](/Door \"Door\"), [iron grates](/Iron_grate \"Iron grate\"), [trees](/Tree \"Tree\"), orcish idols, and most kinds of [statues](/Statue \"Statue\")). Also, [eyes of devastation](/Eye_of_devastation \"Eye of devastation\") could disintegrate rock walls with their [Energy Bolt](/Energy_Bolt \"Energy Bolt\") spell.\n- Prior to [0.17](/0.17 \"0.17\"), you could find [boring beetles](/Boring_beetle \"Boring beetle\"), [arthropods](/List_of_arthropods \"List of arthropods\") capable of digging rock walls.\n- Prior to [0.11](/0.11 \"0.11\"), you could find **walls of solid wax**:\n\n> These walls are built by bees. Occasionally a dungeon architect will manipulate bees into building wax walls for aesthetic reasons. (Theirs, not the bees'.) They are susceptible to fire and will melt and burn, given sufficient heat.\n\n- Wax walls were frequently found in [killer bee](/Killer_bee \"Killer bee\") [vaults](/Vault \"Vault\"), though they could also appear near [altars](/Altar \"Altar\") to [Xom](/Xom \"Xom\") or in [the Abyss](/The_Abyss \"The Abyss\"). They often hid treasure, in particular royal jelly and honeycombs.\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\"/>\n<title>Wall -

In general, destroying or bypassing them requires one of a few specific abilities.\n\n==Wall Varieties==\n===Rock===\n{{crawlquote|This wall consists of simple rock.}}\nVery common walls made from unworked stone which block LOS, but relatively easy to remove. Rock is the only material for which the [[Passwall]] spell functions, allowing you to slip through it. Destroyed by:\n*[[Formicid]]s' digging ability\n*[[Dig]] (or a [[wand of digging]])\n*[[Shatter]]\n*[[Fedhas]]' Overgrowth\n*[[Lugonu]]'s Corruption\n*[[Dissolution]]\n\n===Translucent Rock===\n{{crawlquote|The mineral this rock consists of is as translucent as good quality glass. Whether it is natural or magical, you can't tell.}}\nIdentical to rock walls, except they don't block sight. \n\nFor the purposes of attacking and other abilities, translucent walls are treated as solid walls. You can't attack or blink through these walls, even with piercing or [[smite-targeted]] attacks.\n\n===Stone===\n{{crawlquote|A harder obstacle than rock walls. Only the mightiest magic can shatter stone walls.}}\nMore durable than rock walls, these require stronger magic to remove. Destroyed by:\n*Shatter\n*Overgrowth\n*Corruption\n\n===Translucent Stone===\n{{crawlquote|It has been imbued with arcane magics which render it translucent.}}\nThe stone analog to transparent rock.\n\n===Metal===\n{{crawlquote|A wall of bluish-grey metal. As every dungeon electrician knows, this stuff will ground even magical bolts of lightning.}}\nMetal walls are similar to stone walls. The metal prevents [[Shock]] and [[Lightning Bolt]] from bouncing off it. [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] is stronger when used on a metal wall. Destroyed by:\n*Shatter\n*Overgrowth\n*Corruption\n\n===Crystal===\n{{crawlquote|A wall made from polished crystal and imbued with arcane magics. They prevent its easy destruction, and make it reflect heat and cold.}}\nCrystal walls are also similar to stone walls. They will reflect [[fire]] and [[cold]], the same way stone walls reflect [[Shock]]. [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] is stronger when used on a crystal wall. Destroyed by:\n*Shatter\n*Overgrowth\n*Corruption\n\n===Trees===\n[[File:tree1.png]][[File:tree2.png]][[File:tree3.png]][[File:tree4.png]][[File:tree5.png]][[File:tree6.png]][[File:tree7.png]][[File:tree8.png]][[File:tree9.png]][[File:tree10.png]][[File:tree11.png]][[File:tree12.png]][[File:tree13.png]][[File:tree14.png]][[File:tree15.png]][[File:tree16.png]][[File:tree1Dead.png]][[File:tree1LightRed.png]][[File:tree2Dead.png]][[File:tree2LightRed.png]][[File:tree2Yellow.png]][[File:tree6Yellow.png]][[File:tree7Red.png]][[File:tree10Red.png]]\n{{crawlquote|While the dungeon is filled with dim magic light, in most places it is not bright enough to sustain any larger plants. It is uneven, though, and there are spots where, with the grace of Fedhas, trees as big as those on the surface can grow underground.<br><br>\n\"Only YOU can prevent forest fires!\"<br>-Smokey the Bear}}\nFunctionally walls, these block movement and LOS. Despite having the ability to walk through [[plant]]s, followers of [[Fedhas Madash]] cannot pass through trees. If lit ablaze, they cause forest fires that spread fire to the spaces (and other trees) around them. Unlike walls, they cannot be affected by [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] or [[Frozen Ramparts]]. Destroyed by:\n\n*Player-castable fire spells:\n**[[Inner Flame]] explosions (including from [[scroll of immolation]])\n**[[Flame Wave]]\n**[[Fireball]]\n**[[Starburst]]\n**[[Ignition]]\n**[[Fire Storm]]\n*Monster-only fire spells:\n**[[Bolt of Magma]]\n**[[Bolt of Fire]]\n**[[Lightning Bolt]]\n*Nearby [[Cloud#Spreading flames|spreading flames]]\n*[[Polar Vortex]]\n*[[The Lernaean hydra]]\n*Shatter\n*Overgrow\n*Corruption\n\nIf you are worshipping Fedhas, none of your spells are able to destroy trees (Fedhas actively protects them). Overgrow still works, however. Trees created by [[Summon Forest]] cannot be destroyed as easily; only Shatter / Overgrow / Corruption work.\n\n===Demonic Trees===\n[[File:tree_demonic1.png]][[File:tree_demonic2.png]][[File:tree_demonic3.png]][[File:tree_demonic4.png]][[File:tree_demonic5.png]][[File:tree_demonic6.png]][[File:tree_demonic7.png]][[File:tree_demonic8.png]][[File:tree_demonic9.png]][[File:tree_demonic10.png]][[File:tree_demonic11.png]][[File:tree_demonic12.png]][[File:tree_demonic13.png]][[File:tree_demonic14.png]][[File:tree_demonic15.png]][[File:tree_demonic16.png]]\n{{crawlquote|A tree hideously warped by the demonic forces of chaos. Despite its bizarre appearance and occasional, unsettling movement, it seems harmless.}}\n\nBurning a demonic tree produces a [[cloud#Seething_chaos|cloud of seething chaos]] instead of fire.\n\n===Petrified Trees===\n[[File:tree_petrified1.png]][[File:tree_petrified2.png]][[File:tree_petrified3.png]]\n{{crawlquote|An ancient tree, long ago passed from biology into geology. While no longer wooden in a material sense, it retains the spiritual qualities of a tree.}}\n\nUnlike other trees, petrified trees can be [[wand of digging|dug]] through.\n\n===Mangroves===\n[[File:Mangrove1.png]][[File:Mangrove2.png]][[File:Mangrove3.png]]\n{{crawlquote|This tree is specially adapted for growing in swampy conditions. Its vines are too thick to see through.}}\nThese function identically to trees, save that they grow in [[shallow water]].\n\n===Slime Covered Rock===\n{{crawlquote|This wall is thickly coated with bright green slime. Ewwwwww.}}\nFound only in [[the Slime Pits]], these inflict [[corrosion]] to any adventurer adjacent to one. Every slime wall currently adjacent to you inflicts 1 stack of corrosion (-4 damage and [[AC]]). Otherwise the same as rock wall.\n\nFollowers of [[Jiyva]] are immune to the effects of slime walls, and at 3* piety, can temporarily turn walls into slime. Jiyva-created walls deal [[acid]] damage to every enemy adjacent to them.\n\nDestroyed by:\n*Formicid's digging ability\n*Dig\n*Shatter\n*Overgrowth\n*Corruption\n*Dissolution\n\n===Rune-Carved Stone===\n{{crawlquote|A strangely slime-free wall, carved all over with countless protective runes. One often repeated set of runes seems to refer to 'the royal jelly.'}}\nThese walls make up the outside portions of the central chamber of the bottom of the [[Slime Pits]]. They are otherwise identical to stone walls. Destroyed by:\n*Shatter\n*Overgrowth\n*Corruption\n\n===Rune-Carved Clear Stone===\n{{crawlquote|A strangely slime-free stone wall, with strange lights twinkling within its airy confines. Mystical runes are scattered across its surface, seemingly referring to a 'Royal Jelly'.}}\nThese transparent walls make up the interior of the central chamber of Slime:5. If [[the Royal Jelly]] is dead (or if you have high [[piety]] with [[Jiyva]]), these walls will vanish, allowing easy access to the Slimy [[Rune of Zot]]. Without these methods, these walls can only be destroyed with:\n*Shatter\n*Overgrowth\n*Corruption\n\n===Iron Grate===\n{{crawlquote|A rusted iron grate, brittle enough to be disrupted with a spell or a wand quite easily. It's too strong to be breakable by hand, though.}}\nThese block movement and line of fire, but they do not block [[LOS]] or line of effect, so [[smite-targeted]] attacks can get through. They are usually found in special vaults, often sealing away monsters with smite-targeted attacks. Destroyed by:\n*Formicid's digging ability\n*Dig\n*Shatter\n*Overgrowth\n*Corruption\n*Dissolution\n\nYou can use [[Blink]], [[Passage of Golubria]], or [[dispersal trap]]s to pass in or out of grates. You can also use [[Dispersal]] or [[Disjunction]] to bring enemies out of grates.\n\n===Large Window===\n{{crawlquote|A window embedded in the side of an enormous metal pipe, allowing observation of the water flowing inside.}}\nLarge windows are found in certain [[Sewers]] maps, and function identically to transparent rock walls.\n\n===Unnaturally Hard Wall===\n{{crawlquote|You cannot affect this wall by any means.}}\nWalls which are described as unnaturally hard are completely indestructible. The only way past them is to go around.\n\n===Translucent Unnaturally Hard Wall===\n{{crawlquote|This wall is imbued with magic that not only makes it indestructible but also makes it translucent like glass.}}\nThe indestructible variant of translucent rock.\n\n==Map boundaries==\nThe following \"walls\" are found on the edges of certain floors.\n\n===Open Sea===\n{{crawlquote|Nothing but endless wind and waves, and not a lighthouse in sight. You'd be lost beyond all hope in short order - better not risk it.<br>The ferocious winds and tides of the open sea thwart your progress.}}\nWhile not walls in the traditional sense, these impassable tiles mark the outer borders of the [[Shoals]] and certain [[Sewers]] layouts.\n\n===Endless Lava===\n{{crawlquote|A sea of fire and brimstone that goes as far as you can see. Which is not far because of the thick smoke.<br>\nUnlike small pools of lava where flight or levitation may allow short trips, floating above this inferno would cook you in no time thanks to runaway convection.<br>The endless sea of lava is not a nice place.}}\nThe fiery equivalent of the open sea tiles, these mark the outer borders of a floor across lava pools.\n\n===Endless Salt===\n{{crawlquote|A seemingly endless, flat plain, wracked by blinding salt storms. Anyone venturing across it would be lost beyond all hope in short order.}}\nMuch like open sea and endless lava, these mark the outer borders of the [[Desolation of Salt]].\n\n===Dimension's Edge===\n{{crawlquote|The edge of this tiny, isolated plane, where space itself dissolves into oblivion. Entering or affecting this black void is impossible.}}\nYet another impenetrable level border, this time bordering the [[Roulette of Golubria]].\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|new decorative walls will be added.}}\n*Prior to [[0.30]], slime-covered walls would damage players and monsters with acid damage.\n*In [[0.27]], demonic and petrified trees were added. Initially, burned demonic trees released durably summoned demons in addition to chaos clouds, but this was removed before the release.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] could destroy walls, doors, iron grates and statues.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], [[wand of disintegration|wands of disintegration]] could destroy rock walls and some other obstacles in the dungeon ([[door]]s, [[iron grate]]s, [[tree]]s, orcish idols, and most kinds of [[statue]]s). Also, [[eye of devastation|eyes of devastation]] could disintegrate rock walls with their [[Energy Bolt]] spell.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], you could find [[boring beetle]]s, [[List of arthropods|arthropods]] capable of digging rock walls.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], you could find '''walls of solid wax''':\n{{crawlquote|These walls are built by bees. Occasionally a dungeon architect will manipulate bees into building wax walls for aesthetic reasons. (Theirs, not the bees'.) They are susceptible to fire and will melt and burn, given sufficient heat.}}\n:Wax walls were frequently found in [[killer bee]] [[vault]]s, though they could also appear near [[altar]]s to [[Xom]] or in [[the Abyss]]. They often hid treasure, in particular royal jelly and honeycombs.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

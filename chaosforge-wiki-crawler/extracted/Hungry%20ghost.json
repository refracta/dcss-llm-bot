It drains sustenance from the bodies of its victims, hoping to inflict its own miserable fate on others.}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Hungry ghosts''' are the vengeful spirits of adventurers who starved to death, armed with [[satiation]]-draining attacks. Although not too strong, they have frustratingly high [[EV]]. They are found in the early- to middle-[[Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Characters with hunger issues should avoid melee combat with hungry ghosts as much as possible. [[Kite]] them if you're fast enough, or at least attack them at range as they approach.\n*Their hunger effect triggers each time they hit in melee, even when they deal no damage. Characters with high [[EV]] have less to worry about.\n*[[Dispel Undead]] and [[Airstrike]] take them out quickly, but any spell with high accuracy that affects the undead will work.\n*You can summon your own hungry ghosts with the [[Haunt]] spell.\n\n==History==\n*Hungry ghosts were removed in [[0.26]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the hunger-draining effect of their attacks only applied when they dealt damage. Additionally, hungry ghosts could eat [[corpse]]s they passed over, leaving [[skeleton]]s behind when applicable.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], they would not eat [[corpse]]s.\n\n==Trivia==\nIn the tiles version of ''Stone Soup'', hungry ghosts bear a striking resemblance to the gluttonous character Slimer from ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters Ghostbusters]''."}

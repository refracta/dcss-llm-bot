{"title":"Orc warrior","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Orc_warrior","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{list of | orcs}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Orc warriors''' are powerful melee combatants who often lead packs of weaker orcs. They wear decent armour and tend to favor two-handed weapons such as [[great sword]]s and [[glaive]]s. They are found throughout the [[Dungeon]], starting as early as D:3, and are especially common in the [[Orcish Mines]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Don't think an orc warrior is just an [[orc]] in [[scale mail]]; orc warriors are one of the deadlier melee threats in the early Dungeon. They can take out frail characters in 2-3 hits, and even a melee character can have trouble. \n**In addition to melee, they can come with nasty ranged weapons. An orc warrior with an [[arbalest]] does up to 28 damage from full screen range. [[Boomerang]]s and even [[stone]]s can hurt quite a bit.\n*Definitely try to avoid facing multiple orcs at once. Use corridors / hallways to your advantage. Remember that [[orc priest]]s can smite you past other orcs, even in a hallway.\n*Orc warriors are standard, average speed melee enemies with few resistances. The following can work well:\n**[[Hexes]] and other sorts of statuses. [[Tukima's Dance]] gets rid of their weapon, while [[Mephitic Cloud]] will cause the orc to be a bigger threat to its allies. For non-casters, wands work well. A [[wand of polymorph]] will get rid of their weapon and armour (just watch for the new form). A few successful uses of a [[wand of mindburst]] will work, bypassing any armour it's wearing. [[Curare]] darts work great, too.\n**For summoners, [[Summon Guardian Golem]] usually can take out the orc (and whatever's behind) in 1-2 blasts.\n**Most damaging spells work well on them, though staying in melee range can be risky. Spells like [[Swiftness]] and [[Blink]] can be used to get out of [[attack of opportunity]] range. Since orc warriors have high AC, level 1 spells like [[Magic Dart]] and [[Sandblast]] fare poorly against them.\n:If nothing else, running away works just fine. Just don't be [[confuse]]d by an [[orc wizard]] on your way back.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], orc warriors dealt 15 damage.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], orc warriors dealt 20 damage. However, all monsters had hidden weapon penalties, so they attacked slower and weaker with any weapon.\n\n[[Category:Orc]]"}

{"title":"Wyvern","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wyvern","type":"raw","data":"{{version|023}}\n''For a list of all reptiles, see [[list of reptiles and amphibians]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Wyverns''' are fast, flying [[list of dragons|dragon]]-like creatures that have a painful bite, but little durability and no other special traits. They can most commonly be found in the late portions of [[the Dungeon]], as well as [[the Lair]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They're too fast to run away from easily, but don't forget how flimsy they are. They may look like dragons, but they don't stand up to abuse nearly as well.\n*Low-level characters should hit them with whatever ranged attacks they have available to minimize time spent in melee, and should avoid engaging them at all when at less than full health."}

{"title":"Conjurer statue","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Conjurer_statue","type":"raw","data":"{{version017}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n'''Conjurer statues''' are dangerous [[statue]]s which have a 33% chance of casting [[Orb of Destruction]] against you each time you move or take an action. They are generally positioned in order to force you to charge down open hallways to reach them, and they are nearly immune to all elemental damage. Conjurer statues are only found in particular [[vault]]s.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Physical attacks, [[Earth Magic]], and non-elemental [[Conjurations]] all work well against them. [[Blink]]ing into melee range lets you avoid getting hammered with magic as you charge in, and Orb of Destruction is much less effective when cast at point-blank range.\n\n==Trivia==\nIskenderun is one of the few [[wizlab]] wizards with any back story revealed. One of the earlier version of its flavour text revealed that Iskenderun was a female [[felid]]. This is an in-joke regarding the source of her name: Van Iskenderun Guzelli, the first cat used in breeding the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Van Turkish Van] cat breed."}

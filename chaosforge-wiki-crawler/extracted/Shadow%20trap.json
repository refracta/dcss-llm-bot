{"title":"Shadow trap","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shadow_trap","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|This magical trap creates replicas of creatures native to its location, weaving them from shadows and threads of Abyssal matter. Its magics are sensitive enough that any non-summoned creature entering it will set it off, as long as you are in sight.}}\n\n[[File:Shadow trap.png]] Stepping on a '''shadow trap''' will immediately result in you being the target of a long-duration [[Shadow Creatures]] spell; essentially, you will be assaulted by a summoned band of monsters appropriate for the floor you are currently on. The strength of this band can vary significantly, but they will always be summoned hostile. Much like a [[Zot trap]], if this [[trap]] is triggered by a monster, the effects will still target you so long as you're within [[line of sight]].\n\nIn order to avoid [[batty]] opponents from triggering shadow traps multiple times in a single turn, activating a shadow trap turns it into a '''dormant shadow trap''' for 2-4 turns.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The creatures summoned by this trap will time out after enough time has passed. If you don't want to deal with the results, feel free to [[teleport]] away and let them naturally unsummon. Just be aware that they're rather long-lived for summons.\n*Stepping on a shadow trap will not disarm it, only disable it for a few turns. Make sure to avoid luring large groups of enemies into an area with a known shadow trap in order to avoid complicating already difficult battles.\n\n==History==\n*Shadow traps were removed in [[0.17]].\n*Shadow traps were added in [[0.16]].\n\n[[Category:Traps]]"}

{"title":"Dungeon branches","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dungeon_branches","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\nThe page provides a map of the various dungeon branches and how they interconnect. For tips and tricks on surviving the individual branches, see the [[walkthrough]] and the branches' individual pages. You can bring up an in-game overview of the Dungeon and its various branches and portals by pressing Ctrl-O.\n\n==Dungeon Overview==\nNew characters start on level one of [[the Dungeon]], except for [[Delver]]s, who begin on level 5.\n*[[File:Dungeon exit.png]] '''[[The Dungeon]]''' (15 levels)\n**[[File:Temple entry.png]] '''[[Ecumenical Temple]]''' (Dungeon Level 4-7, 1 level)\n**[[File:Lair entry.png]] '''[[The Lair]]''' (Dungeon Level 8-11, 5 levels)\n***[[File:Swamp entry.png]] '''[[The Swamp]]''' (The Lair Level 2-3, 4 levels, rune [[File:Decaying rune.png]])\n***[[File:Shoals entry.png]] '''[[The Shoals]]''' (The Lair Level 2-3, 4 levels, rune [[File:Barnacled rune.png]], may replace the Swamp)\n***[[File:Snake entry.png]] '''[[The Snake Pit]]''' (The Lair Level 2-3, 4 levels, rune [[File:Serpentine rune.png]])\n***[[File:Spider entry.png]] '''[[The Spider's Nest]]''' (The Lair Level 2-3, 4 levels, rune [[File:Gossamer rune.png]], may replace the Snake Pit)\n***[[File:Slime entry.png]] '''[[The Slime Pits]]''' (The Lair Level 4-5, 5 levels, rune [[File:Slimy rune.png]])\n**[[File:Orc entry.png]] '''[[Orcish Mines]]''' (Dungeon Level 9-12, 2 levels)\n***[[File:Elf entry.png]] '''[[Elven Halls]]''' (Orcish Mines Level 2, 3 levels)\n**[[File:Vaults entry.png]] '''[[The Vaults]]''' (Dungeon Level 14-15, 5 levels, rune [[File:Silver rune.png]])\n***[[File:Crypt entry.png]] '''[[The Crypt]]''' (The Vaults Level 2-3, 3 levels)\n****[[File:Tomb entry.png]] '''[[The Tomb]]''' (The Crypt Level 3, 3 levels, rune [[File:Gold rune.png]])\n*[[File:Depths entry.png]] '''[[The Depths]]''' (Dungeon Level 15, 4 levels)\n**[[File:Abyss entry.png]] '''[[The Abyss]]''' (Portals in The Depths or [[Banishment]], 7 endless toroidal levels, rune [[File:Abyssal rune.png]])\n**[[File:Hell entry.png]] '''[[The Vestibule of Hell]]''' (Portals in The Depths, 1 level)\n***[[File:Cocytus entry.png]] '''[[Cocytus]]''' (7 levels, rune [[File:Icy rune.png]])\n***[[File:Gehenna entry.png]] '''[[Gehenna]]''' (7 levels, rune [[File:Obsidian rune.png]])\n***[[File:Tartarus entry.png]] '''[[Tartarus]]''' (7 levels, rune [[File:Bone rune.png]])\n***[[File:Dis entry.png]] '''[[The Iron City of Dis]]''' (7 levels, rune [[File:Iron rune.png]])\n**[[File:Pandemonium entry.png]] '''[[Pandemonium]]''' (Portals in The Depths, infinite number of non-revisitable levels, 5 runes [[File:Demonic rune 1.png]] [[File:Glowing rune.png]] [[File:Magical rune.png]] [[File:Dark rune.png]] [[File:Fiery rune.png]])\n*[[File:Zot entry.png]] '''[[The Realm of Zot]]''' (The Depths level 4, 5 levels, Orb of Zot [[File:Orb of Zot.png]])\n\nIn any one game, there is a total of 88 finite levels, plus two infinite realms (Abyss, Pandemonium).\n\nIn addition to the standard dungeon branches, all dungeons will contain a randomly selected variety of [[vault]]s with a specific design and theme, and [[portal]]s to fantastic extra-dimensional realms.\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/Ens4iz2.png Version 0.19 Dungeon Map Diagram]\n\n==Miscellaneous Portals==\nOptional [[portals]] to fantastic extra-dimensional realms can be randomly found throughout the Dungeon and its branches. While none of these contain runes, they nearly always contain above-average loot and useful experience. If you know how to handle each one's theme, they can often be cleared without excessive risk. All such portals are single-entry only, and after you exit their realm, they will be gone along with anything you left inside.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all these portals are temporary, and will disappear if not entered within a certain length of time. There are actually two clocks running: a shorter countdown while you're on the level with the portal, and a longer one when you've gone to another level. If you stay on the level, you'll receive increasingly urgent messages as the timer runs out, and the portal's appearance (check with 'x', then 'v') may indicate how much of the timer has expired. When a portal on your current level expires, you will get a message to the effect of, \"The walls and floor of the dungeon suddenly vibrate!\" Portals will not start closing until you reach the floor that they are on, so there's no need to rush through early floors in order to access them.\n\n*[[File:Bailey portal.png]] '''[[Bailey]]''' - A keep guarded by [[gnoll (monster)|gnolls]], [[goblin]]s, and/or [[orc]]s.\n*[[File:Bazaar portal.png]] '''[[Bazaar]]''' - Shopping spree! Portals to bazaars are usually temporary but may rarely be permanent. Permanent ones will not be announced.\n*[[File:Desolation portal.png]] '''[[Desolation of Salt]]''' - A crumbling wasteland filled with unique [[nonliving|constructs]] and other guardians lurking among its salt clouds.\n*[[File:Ice cave portal.png]] '''[[Ice Cave]]''' - Freezing [[cloud]]s, wild animals, and occasionally icy [[demon]]s.\n*[[File:Gauntlet portal.png]] '''[[Gauntlet]]''' - A choice between several arenas. Taking the challenge will get you some loot, but also pits you against a deadly [[minotaur (monster)|minotaur]].\n*[[File:Ossuary portal.png]] '''[[Ossuary]]''' - A small tomb filled with [[mummy (monster)|mummies]] and their [[undead]] guardians.\n*[[File:Sewer portal.png]] '''[[The Sewers]]''' - Fetid waterways teeming with [[list of rats|rats]], [[list of snakes|snakes]], and occasionally nastier things.\n*[[File:Treasure trove portal.png]] '''[[Treasure trove]]''' - Contains several [[acquirement]]-level items, but getting in requires giving up a rare and valuable item in return. Is always permanent.\n*[[File:Volcano portal.png]] '''[[Volcano]]''' - Fire and lava everywhere. Also lava-dwelling creatures.\n*[[File:Wizlab portal.png]] '''[[Wizard Laboratory]]''' - The abandoned laboratory of one of several famous mages.\n*[[File:Ziggurat portal.png]] '''[[Ziggurat]]''' - The ultimate challenge: [[27]] floors of increasingly difficult battles, but with riches untold for those who win through. Ziggurat portals are permanent, but only one spawns naturally in the Depths. They are also created from evoking a [[figurine of a ziggurat]], which can be found on Tomb:3 and on level 27 of a previous ziggurat.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the [[Lair]] had 6 levels. Also, the [[Abyss]] was only 5 levels deep.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the [[Depths]] were 5 levels long.\n*[[0.23]] replaced [[Labyrinth]]s with the [[Gauntlet]].\n*The Desolation of Salt was added in [[0.19]], and the Lair was shortened to 6 levels and the Slime Pits to 5 levels.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], [[ziggurat]] portals spawned randomly in [[Pandemonium]].\n*The lair branches were shortened from 5 to 4 levels in [[0.17]].\n*The [[Hall of Blades]] was reduced to a subvault in Elf:2 in [[0.15]].\n*The [[Enchanted Forest]] was considered for inclusion in [[0.14]], but was eventually rejected after several months of play-testing in [[trunk]]. This branch would have occasionally replaced [[the Crypt]].\n*The [[Spider's Nest]] was made a full-fledged branch in [[0.11]].\n*The [[Hive]] was removed in [[0.10]].\n\n[[Category:World]]"}

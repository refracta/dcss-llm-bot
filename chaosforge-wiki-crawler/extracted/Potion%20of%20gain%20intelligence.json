Hard to find, and useful for spellcasters or characters dangerously low on intelligence.\n\nThe mutation can be removed by the normal means (eg, a [[potion of cure mutation]], Zin's [[Zin#Given Abilities|Cure All Mutations]] ability). Unlike other sources of mutations, the potion isn't hindered by an [[amulet of resist mutation]] (but ''is'' by the [[Good mutations#Mutation Resistance|Mutation Resistance]] mutation). Use of this potion does not offend [[Zin]].\n\n{{crawlquote|''You feel clever.''}}\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.13]] this potion was replaced with the [[potion of beneficial mutation]]."}

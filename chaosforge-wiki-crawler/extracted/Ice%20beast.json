{"title":"Ice beast","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ice_beast","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ice beasts''' are one of the more threatening early game creatures. Their icy bodies are resistant to [[cold]] and [[poison]], and their attacks can deal a significant amount of cold damage with each hit. Fortunately, they are vulnerable to fire. They are occasionally found in the early [[Dungeon]], showing up as early as D:5 or 6, and they can be summoned by [[ice statue]]s or the [[unique]] elf ice mage [[Fannar]].\n\nPlayers can use the spell [[Summon Ice Beast]] to call an ice beast into existence to fight for them.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Ice beasts introduce new players to the danger of elementally-charged attacks - their [[cold]] damage bypasses AC. Melee characters should show more caution than usual around these creatures, softening them up at a distance if possible.\n**Note that, while the cold damage itself bypasses AC, the physical attack does not. If an ice beast does 0 damage with its physical hit, it is unable to deal any \"additional cold damage\". High AC characters have less to fear, and low AC characters, more. \n*Their immunity to cold and poison can be a problem for some characters. Characters who have been kiting dangerous foes with poison or curare [[dart]]s will suddenly find that trick useless. \n**The best spell that [[Ice Elementalist]]s have is Summon Ice Beast itself. When you're fighting ice beasts, Summon Ice Beast will be a bit hard to cast, but it does the job. [[Hailstorm]] (if found) can work, though it doesn't hit targets at melee range.\n*If you have a [[wand of flame]], now's not a bad time to use it.\n*If you don't have any good means of fighting an ice beast, then don't fight an ice beast -- a [[wand of polymorph]] is a good choice to change them into something more manageable.\n*Ultimately, it might not be a bad idea to just avoid ice beasts until you're ready to deal with them. Not killing one rare enemy here and there will hardly leave you underleveled.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], you could make ice beast [[skeleton]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], creatures made of ice (such as ice beasts) were completely immune to [[Hailstorm]]."}

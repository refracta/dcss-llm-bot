{"title":"Banishment","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Banishment","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Banishes a creature into the Abyss.}}\n'''Banishment''' is a spell, ability, and general effect that sends a creature to [[the Abyss]]. Although it deals no damage, the Abyss is dangerous for underleveled characters.\n\n==Useful Info==\n===Against the Player===\nSends you to [[the Abyss]]. The destination floor is determined by your [[XL]]; the higher it is, the deeper you go. Note that if you have visited the Abyss before, you will always be sent, at least, to the deepest floor you had visited. If you are already in the Abyss, you'll be sent a floor deeper.\n\nWhen leaving the Abyss after being banished, you will return to the [[Dungeon]] level, floor of [[Pandemonium]], or [[Ziggurat]] level that you were formerly on. This is different from entering an Abyss portal, as a portal lets you escape Pandemonium, but Banishment does not.\n\nAfter escaping the Abyss via a gate out, you are immune to banishment (from distortion, chaos, or spell) for the next 10-19 [[decaAut]].<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|stairs.cc|796}}</ref> This does not render immunity to [[Xom]].\n\n===Against Monsters===\nBanishes a monster and its items. Banished monsters can be found roaming the Abyss, and any [[artefact]]s lost to the Abyss will eventually generate there.\n\n==Sources==\nThe player can be banished by the following ways:\n*The [[#Spell|Banishment]] spell (checks [[willpower]])\n*Being hit by a [[distortion]] attack (5% chance)\n*Unwielding a weapon of distortion (25% chance)\n*[[Chaos]], [[chaotic]] effects, and [[Xom]]\n*The [[divine retribution|wrath]] of [[Lugonu]]\n\nLugonu gives worshippers the Banishment ability, which works like the monster spell, except it inflicts the [[malmutate]] status if it fails the willpower check. Also, Lugonu will banish nearby monsters whenever another god's wrath occurs.\n\nA full list of monsters which banish can be seen [[#Monsters|below]].\n\n==Strategy==\nBanishment is very dangerous to low level characters; you could be face-to-face with an [[ancient lich]] at XL 9. Around XL 15 - 20 is where the Abyss becomes survivable. An XL 27 character should have no problems in Abyss:3, but can still struggle at Abyss:6-7.\n\nIf you get banished early, don't lose hope yet. You can worship [[Lugonu]] (if an [[altar]] is found) for an immediate way out. You will receive [[penance]] from your previous god, but Lugonu provides some protection against that. Otherwise, getting [[XP]] will eventually force a way out, and you can also find an exit by walking around.\n\nGenerally, prevention is better than the cure. The methods to avoid banishment depend on the source:\n*Distortion/chaos attacks can be avoided by avoiding melee with the enemy. Using ranged attacks are obvious - just about any character can use [[wand]]s. If it is a weapon, you can use [[Tukima's Dance]] to disarm the enemy.\n*The spell \"Banishment\" can be resisted by [[willpower]]. Having Will+++ is usually sufficient (often gives a 0-1% chance to banish); Will++++ gives immunity to all sources of the spell. You can also block its line of fire (e.g. stand behind other monsters, hostile or friendly), block its [[line of sight]], or [[silence]]/[[waterlog]] the caster.\n\n==Monsters==\n===Spell===\n'''Banishment''' is a monster-only spell. It must have a line of fire to the target, and must overcome the target's [[willpower]]. It can be used from any distance within [[LOS]]. Casters with higher [[HD]] are more likely to succeed, and are more likely to send you deeper.\n\n{{monsters with spell|Banishment}}\n\n===Distortion===\nThese monsters generate with [[distortion]] or [[chaos]] weapons, or have innate attacks with these traits. A hit by a distortion weapon has a 5% chance of banishment; chaos weapons have a 0.135% chance. Note that these brands do work with the [[reaching]] of Polearms.\n\n<!-- placed roughly in order you'll encounter them in the dungeon -->\n{{monsterlink|Crazy Yiuf}} (quarterstaff of chaos, 100% chance of possession) <br>\n{{monsterlink|Psyche}} (dagger of distortion, 25%; dagger of chaos, 75%) <br>\n{{monsterlink|Sonja}} (dagger or short sword of distortion, 50%) <br>\n{{monsterlink|Donald}} (distortion, 4%) <br>\n{{monsterlink|Frederick}} (distortion, 4%) <br>\n{{monsterlink|Margery}} (distortion, 4%) <br>\n{{monsterlink|Hell knight}} (distortion, 4%) <br>\n{{monsterlink|Spriggan defender}} (distortion, 10%) <br>\n{{monsterlink|The Enchantress}} (distortion, 25%) <br>\n\nThese monsters have innate distortion or chaotic melee attacks:\n\n{{monsterlink|Spatial vortex}} <br>\n{{monsterlink|Spatial maelstrom}} <br>\n{{monsterlink|Chaos spawn}} (also trails [[cloud]]s of chaos) <br>\n{{monsterlink|Apocalypse crab}} (can breathe clouds of chaos) <br>\n{{monsterlink|Eldritch tentacle}} <br>\n\nNote that any other monster capable of wielding weapons can pick up a distortion weapon and use it. This can result in even lowly monsters such as [[goblin]]s banishing you, albeit very rarely. Also, [[pandemonium lord]]s and [[player ghost]]s may come with distortion/chaos attacks.\n<!-- Useful to see probability of distortion weapons in Hall of Blades? Code-divers, here's your opportunity! -->\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], banished monsters appeared only on Abyss:1 instead of following the player into deeper levels.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], more monsters, such as [[lich]]es, had Banishment in one of their spellbooks.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], banishment didn't give full [[XP]]. Also, weapons of [[distortion]] had a 10% chance to banish the target, instead of 5%. Followers of [[Nemelex]] had a chance to banish themselves by drawing the [[Exile card]].\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the player could be banished via [[Zot trap]]s or a severe [[Translocations]] or [[Summoning]] [[miscast effect]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], all [[ogre magi]] could cast Banishment. Also, the [[Xom card]] existed, which had a chance of banishing the player.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], banishment could send the player only to Abyss:1. The depth of the banishment didn't depend on the banisher's [[HD]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], draconian shifters were able to banish you. Also, attempting to use a [[scroll of vorpalise weapon]] to make a temporary distortion brand permanent could also result in banishment.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], being banished while in the Abyss had no effect.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], self-banishment would cause you to leave a [[Ziggurat]] (once you got out of the Abyss).\n*Prior to [[0.9]], one of the possible outcomes of [[Hell's mystical force]] was banishment.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], there was a resistible player version of this spell which sent one target to the Abyss. It was a level 4 Translocations spell. Renouncing Lugonu, Makhleb or Vehumet could result in immediate banishment.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Gameplay]]\n[[Category:Strategy]]"}

{"title":"Dread lich","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dread_lich","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|liches}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful info==\n'''Dread liches''' are powerful [[undead]] summoners with a wide array of resistances. They appear in [[the Realm of Zot]], [[Hell|the Hells]], the last floor of [[the Vaults]] and rarely in [[the Crypt]] and [[the Tomb]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile not as immediately threatening as an [[ancient lich]], dread liches are scary in their own way:\n*They can summon multiple [[greater demon]]s, which can quickly spiral out of control. Fiends can freely [[torment]] you, since their summoner is immune.\n*They also can inflict [[paralysis]], which is a ''very'' dangerous effect. Being next to a fiend for 2-5 turns can outright kill you.\n:It takes 172 [[willpower]] in order for Paralyse to reach 0% success. A [[human]] needs 3 external stacks of Will+ (that's Will+++++ at XL27, Will++++ below that) to fully resist paralysis.\n\nDread liches resist most elements and have infinite will themselves. Blaster casters should use pure [[Conjurations]] or [[Earth Magic]], Necromancy specialists can use [[Dispel Undead]], and hexers can try disabling it with [[Enfeeble]]. Melee fighters should lure them around corners, or use [[scrolls of fog]], to limit the amount of summons. [[Holy wrath]] and [[antimagic]] work well as brands.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Dread liches can be [[silence]]d, preventing them from casting any spells. However, silence does nothing to any existing demons. If you need to silence, do so early in the fight.\n*As always, remember that killing a summoner destroys all its summons. If you are confident you can finish off a dread lich before its summoned fiends can tear you to pieces, go for it. If you ''aren't'' confident of that, consider what safe escape routes you have available.\n*Like most enemies in Crawl, liches are vulnerable to [[throwing net]]s. Throwing a net at the edge of [[LOS]] guarantees that you can run away. Nets also allow for [[stab]] attempts.\n*Absurdly dangerous in [[Tartarus]], a realm which halves willpower. Even at max will, it has a 27% chance to paralyse you.\n*Also, watch out for [[cacodemon]]s. Their [[Energy Bolt|Bolt of Devastation]] halves your willpower, making you vulnerable to paralysis from the lich.\n\n==History==\n*Dread liches were added in [[0.27]] as a summoning-focused version of the [[ancient lich]]."}

{"title":"Rot","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Rot","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n'''Rot''' damages your maximum [[HP]]. The damage can be fixed with [[potions of curing]] or [[potion of heal wounds|heal wounds]], which remove rot before restoring HP, or with [[Elyvilon]]'s [[purification]]. Rot effectively reduces the effectiveness of healing until cured.\n\nAll [[undead]], [[nonliving]], [[demonic]], [[holy]], and [[insubstantial]] species and monsters are immune to rotting attacks, as are [[Gargoyle]]s and [[Vine Stalker]]s. This also confers immunity to [[sickness]] and [[miasma]]. [[Zin]]'s Vitalisation, [[Dithmenos]]' [[Shadow Form]], [[Statue Form]], and [[Necromutation]] also grant immunity to rotting attacks, and [[demonspawn]] with the [[Foul Stench]] mutation eventually gain rot resistance.\n\n==Sources of Rot==\nRotting can be inflicted by:\n*[[Miscast]]ing [[Necromancy]] spells (and by extension, possibly from [[Zot trap]]s, [[Hell]] effects, and acts of [[Xom]])\n*Attacks from [[necrophage]]s and [[death ooze]]s.\n*Advanced [[list of mummies|mummies]]' [[death curse]]s may inflict rot.\n*[[Ghoul]]s periodically lose max HP, with a greater chance if they are hungry; this bypasses their normal immunity to rot. They can restore current and max HP by eating [[chunk]]s.\n*Standing in [[miasma]] without rotting resistance has a 50% chance to drain 1 max HP every turn you do so. It also [[poison]]s and [[slow]]s you. Poison resistance only protects against the poison effect.\n\n==Curing Rot==\nRot can be fixed by [[potions of curing]], [[potions of heal wounds]], or by invoking [[Elyvilon]]'s Purification. [[Ghoul]]s can restore rotted HP by eating [[chunk|chunks of flesh]].\n\n==History==\n*Rot was removed in [[0.26]]. The maximum HP reduction was moved to [[draining]] instead.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], [[wand of heal wounds|wands of heal wounds]] could also be used to cure rot.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], mummies had a self-restoration ability that allowed them to cure rot at the cost of 1 permanent MP.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], rot was healed by using healing potions or wands at full HP. Additionally, there was a rotting [[status effect]] which would inflict rot over time until it wore off or was cured by a [[potion of curing]], [[ghoul (monster)|ghoul]]s had a rot-inducing attack, and [[potions of decay]] existed, which would inflict rot when drunk.\n*''Crawl'' used to have a \"rotting\" spell, which caused the flesh of all those near the caster to rot. It affected the living and many of the corporeal undead.\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]\n[[Category:Threats]]"}

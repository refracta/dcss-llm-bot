{"title":"Cigotuvi's Fleshworks","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cigotuvi%27s_Fleshworks","type":"raw","data":"{{version024}}\n{{flavour|This slick floor seems to pulse to an unknown beat.}}\n\nCigotuvi has mastered the art of manipulating flesh, and his lab is a living testament to this fact, seeming like the interior of some vast, ghastly beast. The walls and floor are slick and membranous, pulsing to an unheard heartbeat and oozing thick, green ichor from every inch.\n\nThe bulk of Cigotuvi's Fleshworks is devoted to cells that house test subjects in various stages of degeneration. Several are mutated humanoids; most are ugly things, shapeshifters, and abominations. While the walls of the Fleshworks are as hard as stone, the fleshy membranes that allow you to see into the cells are merely as tough as rock and can easily be dug through.\n\nThe entrance hall consists of several short rooms with cells on either side containing abominations, deformed humanoids and some ugly things. After that lies a central, circular chamber that houses Cigotuvi's flesh golem.\n\nOne side of the lab is dominated by a snaking passageway filled with shapeshifters in various guises. Several of them are likely to start off in the forms of various varieties of [[list of eyeballs|eyeball]]. There are also a few true [[floating eye]]s interspersed among the shapeshifters that are particularly hazardous. The final room on that side holds a pack of ugly/very ugly things that guard a portion of the lab's treasure.\n\nThe other side of the lab contains more cells holding test subjects as well as some abominations. There are three rooms of note on this side: one holds four [[large abomination]]s, one holds more treasure, and the last contains yet more treasure guarded by several more large abominations and the terrible \"Cigotuvi's Monster\", a 250 HP [[mutant beast]] whose glyph changes color over time.\n\nBeware: several rooms contain mutagenic fog, which will gradually [[magic contamination|contaminate]] you if you stand in it; you have a good chance of being [[Magic_contamination#Dissipation|mutated]] if you aren't careful about where you stand.  Wearing a [[scarf of cloud immunity]] will allow you to avoid the effects of mutagenic fog. Alternatively, it might be wise to bring a couple [[potion of mutation|potions of mutation]] to clear out particularly deleterious mutations before the boss fight. [[potion of cancellation|Potions of cancellation]] also work if used to reduce your contamination level, but they are relatively rare and it's a waste to use them unless you already have some [[good mutations]] you don't want to lose.\n\nSuccessfully looting Cigotuvi's Fleshworks will net you some gold, an [[artefact]] [[ring]] or the [[hat of the Alchemist]], some [[spell book]]s on [[Transmutations]], a [[staff of death]], several [[scrolls of summoning]], and a whole bunch of [[potion of mutation|potions of mutation]]. If you aren't confident in your ability to take on a variety of powerful monsters while avoiding heavy mutations, feel free to skip this area. If you want to play mutation roulette, Cigotuvi's Fleshworks is one of the best places to acquire the supplies to do so.\n\nNote: in 0.27 trunk, you are basically never forced to walk through mutagenic clouds - so you can clear the entirety of this lab without contamination. \n\n==Monsters==\n{{flavour|This poor creature looks hideously deformed.}}\n\n{{LightGrey|@}}[[File:Deformed human.png]] {{Red|e}}[[File:Deformed elf.png]] {{LightRed|o}}[[File:Deformed orc.png]] '''Deformed [[human (monster)|humans]], [[elf|elves]], and [[orc]]s''' - These unfortunate beings are almost harmless. You need to [[dig]] them out of their cells to face them, and even then they aren't any more dangerous than their base types.\n\n{{monsterlink|Ugly thing}}and {{monsterlink|Very ugly thing}}- Pack melee monsters with randomly determined elemental attacks and resistances.\n\n{{monsterlink|Shapeshifter (monster)}} and {{monsterlink|Glowing shapeshifter}} - Found in the corridors on either side of the lab. They rarely appear in their base forms and will shift unpredictably between various types of monsters.\n\n{{monsterlink|Floating eye}}- Found among the horde of shapeshifters in the winding corridor, they can [[paralyze]] you as long as they can see you. Duck around a corner or use smite-targeted attacks to kill them quickly.\n\n{{monsterlink|Small abomination}}and {{monsterlink|Large abomination}}- [[Demonic]] [[undead]] with slightly randomized stats. The big ones hit much harder, but tend to move slower.\n\n===Miniboss: Flesh Golem===\n{{flavour|An animated mound of misshapen flesh, sculpted over an iron skeleton.}}\n{{Red|8}} [[Image:Flesh golem.png]] You will encounter a '''flesh golem''' in the large circular chamber once you pass the prison cells. This is nothing more than a reskinned [[iron golem]]; it's strong and durable (not to mention immune to virtually all forms of magical attack), but it's slow enough to kite easily.\n\n===Boss: Cigotuvi's Monster===\n{{flavour|A terrifying creation that appears to have been constructed from the body parts of every monstrous creature imaginable, with writhing tentacles sprouting from its form.}}\n{{Magenta|X}} [[Image:Cigotuvis monster.png]] The last chamber on the left side of the Fleshworks will contain several [[large abomination]]s and '''Cigotuvi's Monster''', a primal [[mutant beast]] with increased durability and an extra trait. It has four attacks; one deals 40 damage without additional effect, but it also has the ability to [[constrict]] for 25 damage, [[reach]] for 25 damage and [[poison]], and [[trample]] for 25 damage.\n\n'''[[HP]]''': 250<br>\n'''[[HD]]''': 23<br>\n'''Recommendations''': Fast movement speed and a source of ranged damage will make [[kiting]] it fairly easy. It has resistances to almost everything, so using non-elemental [[Conjurations]] will help. Hit it hard to make sure you don't run out of room to safely retreat, and avoid melee unless you're playing a brute tank. If you have a source of [[silver]] damage, it can be very effective.\n\n<pre>\nMAP\nccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\nccjjjcccc|cccccccccccAccccccccccccWWWW~5hcccc\nc|...|c....|ccc---ccc+cccccccccccWh~~~.45hccc\nc|8........|cc-I---m...m--ccccccW~.....845hcc\nc.&5.......cc---G--m.7.m-F-cccccW~........hcc\nc.8........cc---H--m...m-I--ccccW~.......~Wcc\nc|.........cc-cccccm...mc---ccccc.......~Wccc\nc|...|ccc+ccccc--cccc+cccccccccccc.....hWcccc\nccjjjccc..ccccIII-cm...m--H--ccccc+cccccccccc\ncccccccc..ccc--P---m.7.m-F--cccccc\"\"ccccccccc\ncceecccc..ccc-III--m...m---ccccccc\"\"cc$$g$$cc\nceddecc...cccc----cm...m-cccRccccc\"\"c...c...c\ncedde+...cccccc--cccc+cccc---Rcccc\"\"c...c...c\nceddec...ccccccccc-m...m-KK---Rccc\"\"ccc+c+ccc\ncceccccc+cccccccc--m.7.m---I--Rccc\"\"c...9...c\nccccccc...cccc---F-m...m----K-ccgc\"\"c...6...c\ncccc.........c--G--m...mc----cc$$c\"\"c..6669.c\nc.67...ccc...cc--cccc+cccc--ccc+cc\"\"c..66..cc\nc...ccccccc+cccccc.m.....cccc.666c\"\"+.....ccc\ncc...ccccc'''cccc..m.....4cc9.666c\"\"ccccccccc\ncc...ccc''''''cc.!.m.....<4c9....+\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"cc\nc..cccc''''''''cc.......c4ccc....cc\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"c\nc..ccc'''''''''cccccc+cccccccccccccccccccc\"\"c\nc..cc''''''''''ccccc...ccccccc\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"c\nc..cc''''''''''ccc.......cccc\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"cc\nc..c'''''''''''cc.........ccc\"\"cccccccccccccc\nc..c'c'c'c'c'ccc...........cc\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"cc\nc..c8c8c'c8c8ccc...........ccc\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"c\nc..cccccccccccc.....c.c.....cccccccccccccc\"\"c\nc...76........+......?......+\"\"\"\"\"ccc\"\"\"\"\"\"\"c\nc...76........c.....c.c.....c\"\"\"\"\"\"c\"\"\"\"\"\"\"cc\nccmmmccccmmmcccc...........cccccc\"\"c\"\"ccccccc\nc-----cc-----cccWW.......WWcc\"\"\"\"\"\"c\"\"\"\"\"\"ccc\ncc-JJccccIIIcccccWW..0..WWcc\"\"\"\"\"\"ccc\"\"\"\"\"\"cc\nccJJ-cccc-F-ccccccWWWWWWWccc\"\"ccccccccccc\"\"cc\ncc-HccccccIIccccccccWWWccccc\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"cc\nccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"ccc\nccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\nENDMAP\n</pre>\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.15]], this place had a lot of [[pulsating lump]]s.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Branches]]"}

{"title":"Acid dragon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Acid_dragon","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | dragons}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Acid dragons''' are one of the easier dragons you'll encounter. They can breathe [[acid]], dealing significant damage and possibly corroding you. As with other dragons, their breath attacks have a cooldown.\n\nLike other dragons, killing it may drop [[acid dragon scales]] (33% chance).\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Corrosion resistance]] will reduce the damage of its acid breath, though it's reasonable to fight acid dragons without.\n*If you do get corroded, reassess the situation. If you're confident you can kill the dragon even with the penalties to AC and weapon attacks, do so, but if you were having difficulty before getting hit in the face with acid, or if there are other dangerous monsters about, it might be a good idea to [[scroll of teleportation|teleport]].\n**Spellcasting and Evocations aren't hindered by corrosion, so if your weapons aren't working anymore, try switching tactics.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Spit Acid only had 3d7 base damage, but dealt an extra 4d5 \"acid splash\" damage to players.\n*Acid dragons were introduced in [[0.20]], replacing [[mottled dragon]]s."}

{"title":"Wrath card","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wrath_card","type":"raw","data":"{{Version028}}\n{{flavour|The card depicts the hand of the divine, reaching down from the heavens to hurl furious lightning.}}\nThe Wrath card invokes the wrath of a randomly chosen god against the player. There is an extraordinarily tiny, but non-zero, chance that one could bypass this card, as the game tries \"only\" 100 times to find the first random god willing to punish the player by divine retribution. Should all 100 attempts be a god that doesn't retaliate, then nothing happens.\n\n==History==\nThe Wrath card can be found in the following [[Decks|decks]] over the past several versions.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.11]]-[[0.18]]\n![[0.19]] and beyond\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of oddities|Oddities]]\n<br>[[Deck of punishment|Punishment]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of punishment|Punishment]]\n|----\n|}\n\n==History==\nThis card was removed from the deck of oddities in the deck simplification of [[0.19]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n{{cards}}\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

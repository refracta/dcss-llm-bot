They began with a furious attack, and laid hands on a good mare well trained both for sport and battle. Her rider, Pedro de Moron, was a fine horseman; and as he charged with three other horsemen into the enemy ranks-they had been instructed to charge together for mutual support-some of them seized his lance so he could not use it, and others slashed at him with their broadswords (maquahuitl), wounding him severely. Then they slashed at his mare, cutting her head at the neck so that it only hung by the skin. The mare fell dead, and if his mounted comrades had not come to Moron's rescue, he would probably have been killed also.\"\n\n-Bernal DÃ­az del Castillo, _The Conquest of New Spain_. 1623<br>\ntrans.

They're good for players who are just branching out into Long Blades, but a [[scimitar]] or [[demon blade]] are (almost) direct upgrades.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], Long Blades lost [[riposte]]. Damage was increased back to pre-riposte levels.\n*In [[0.19]], Long Blades gained riposte. Long swords were reduced by 1 base damage to compensate.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Long sword1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Long sword2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Long sword3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]s\n|-\n| '''[[Autumn Katana]]''' || [[File:Autumn_katana.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Throatcutter]]''' || [[File:Throatcutter.png]]\n|}\n\n{{weapons}}\n\n\n[[Category:Long blades]]"}

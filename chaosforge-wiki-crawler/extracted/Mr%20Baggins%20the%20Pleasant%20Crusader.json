You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.' - A relative\n\n'''Floor 1'''\n\nAn uninspiring room that smells of old meat. Rather dark already, save for the light from above. Already I regret my decision to adventure. Probably the worst I've made yet. I've seen 2 far more adventurous Halflings come in and not come back. Oh well... \n\nMy my my, is that a freezing saber i see? What a pleasant surprise. Wonderful craftsman- WORM!\n\n''OOC:''Halflings need to be named _____ Baggins. It's a law. Look it up!\n\n'''Floor 2'''\nHastily descending the stairs with my chilling blade i am greeted by a host of rather unhappy kobolds. Dear me, perhaps I shall find another way down. Nay, I'll stand and fight. I once knew a rather nice kobold. A traveler, and a bit odd. Stayed with me for a week one winter. Hope these fellows weren't related.\n\n''OOC:'' The rat and snake populations are outrageous. They don't need a hero they need an exterminator\n\n\n'''Floor 3'''\nI kindly looking fellow in a well knit cap greets me as I stumble down post haste. He said something in koboldese, or whatever it is their native toungue. I assume it a greeting and extend my hand in a way to reciprocate his fine greeting. It appears I was incorrect in the assessment of this fellows intentions. What a bother this is.\n\nI'd like to say I went down in a blaze of glory, with a fantastical swashbuckling match. Sadly this is not the case. He just stabbed me and is now rifling through my belongings. I do hope they have tea in heaven...\n\n''OOC:'' Freaking Ijyb, man. And honestly, they better have tea in heaven. I'll cry if they don't.\n\n\n\n'''153 Mr Baggins the Cutter (level 4, -2/26 HPs)'''\n             Began as a Halfling Crusader on Jan 4, 2011.\n             Slain by Ijyb\n             ... wielding a +1,+1 orcish dagger of distortion\n              (24 damage)\n             ... on Level 3 of the Dungeon.\n             The game lasted 00:18:44 (1916 turns)."}

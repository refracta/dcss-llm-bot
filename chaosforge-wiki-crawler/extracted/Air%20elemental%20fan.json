It is rather unreliable, and usually requires several attempts to function correctly. Using it carries an element of risk, which is reduced if one is skilled in the appropriate elemental magic.}}\n\nAn '''air elemental fan''' is an evocable item which summons an [[air elemental]] from an adjacent air-containing tile as though you'd cast the [[Summon Elemental]] spell. The higher your [[Evocations]] skill, the more likely the device is to work, while having a high [[Air Magic]] skill increases the likelihood of the air elemental being allied to you instead of hostile:\n\n[[File:Dcss-datachart-airelementalfan-friendly-summon-percentage.png|center|Selecting the skills you want to be trained]]\nGetting one friendly summons is guaranteed by Air Magic skill 15, two are guaranteed by 18, etc. up to an effective max of five summons at Air Magic skill 27.\n\n==Strategy==\nAir elemental summoning requires the most elemental skill for successfully using an elemental evocation device. This makes them less than ideal for players looking to gain a few levels in a secondary skill in order to gain access to some allies; a [[lamp of fire]] only requires 10 Fire Magic skill, while a [[stone of earth elementals]] only requires 5 Earth Magic skill.  That being said, an air elemental fan and enough skill to summon at least a few friendly air elementals is enough to take down a [[diamond obelisk]], though it'll still take several hundred turns.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.13]] this item was replaced by the [[fan of gales]]."}

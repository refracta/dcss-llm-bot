{"title":"Brimstone Fiend","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Brimstone_Fiend","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n'''Brimstone Fiends''' are truly brutal demons, even among other [[Tier-1 demon|greater demons]]. Like all [[Fiend]]s, they are capable of [[torment]]ing victims, and their powerful Damnation attacks make them a threat even to prepared adventurers. They are immune to most [[fire]] attacks, but are vulnerable to [[cold]]. Brimstone Fiends can be found in [[Gehenna]] and [[Pandemonium]], and may be summoned by [[lich]]es, demon lords, and other powerful casters.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*All fiends are very dangerous; their combination of torment and high-powered attacks can lead to a very quick death. The Brimstone Fiend is one of the more dangerous members of this family, especially at range. Use cold spells, or a [[freezing]]- or [[holy wrath]]-[[brand]]ed weapon (the latter is more effective), to take it out as quickly as possible. \n*If you lack ranged abilities, lure it around a corner into melee rather than risking several turns of torment and damnation.  Its melee attacks hurt a lot less than its spells.\n*If you are undead or in [[lichform]], the Brimstone Fiend will forego torment and just cast Damnation. Damnation never misses and ignores AC, making it very deadly, especially for low-HP characters such as [[deep elves]], [[felid]]s, or casters who haven't built up their [[Fighting]] skill.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], they were [[:Category:Water_vulnerability|vulnerable to water]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], you could summon your own Brimstone Fiend with the [[Summon Greater Demon]] spell. Its loyalty was not guaranteed, however.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], \"Brimstone Fiends\" were named \"Fiends.\"\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

{"title":"Trog","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Trog","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n[[File:Trog altar.png]] \"Kill them all!\"''\n\n{{flavour|Trog is an ancient god of anger and violence. Followers are expected to kill in Trog's name, and especially to slay wizards. In return, worshippers of Trog gain the ability to go berserk at will in combat, and will be granted assistance in the form of powerful weapons and mighty allies. Followers are absolutely forbidden the use of spell magic.\n\nTrog offers various powers to help followers in battle. Followers will gain the ability to go berserk at will, and to rapidly heal their wounds while fortifying their willpower. Later, followers may call in powerful raging allies. Eventually, Trog will gift followers with weapons, often with antimagic effects.\n\nTrog likes it when you kill living beings, you destroy the undead, you kill demons, you kill holy beings and you destroy nonliving beings. Trog especially likes it when you kill wizards and other users of magic.\n\nTrog's powers are based on piety instead of Invocations skill.}}\n\n[[Berserker]]s begin play worshiping Trog.\n\n==Racial Restrictions==\n[[Demigod]]s cannot worship Trog (or any other deity). \n\nThe [[undead]] are not banned from worship, but do suffer certain limitations. [[Mummies]] and [[Ghoul]]s, along with [[Formicid]]s, cannot go [[berserk]] and thus lose much of the benefit of this religion. [[Vampire]]s also cannot go berserk while in their bloodless state.\n\n==Appreciates==\n*You or your allies killing living, [[demonic]], [[holy]], [[undead]], or [[nonliving]] monsters, especially [[Spell slot flags#Wizard flag|spellcaster]]s.\n\n==Deprecates==\n*Inactivity: You lose 1 piety per 340 turns, on average (1/17 chance every 20 turns).\n*Memorizing or casting spells.\n*Devoting skill points to magic skills, including [[Spellcasting]] (be careful with auto-training enabled!).\n*Using weapons that rely on magical skill, such as [[magical staves]], weapons of [[pain (brand)|pain]], or orbs of [[energy]].\n*Abandonment.\n\nTrog does ''not'' mind other \"magical\" items, such as [[wand]]s or [[ring]]s.\n\n==Given Abilities==\n'''[[Piety|Piety level -]]''': \"Troglodyte\"\n*'''Protection From Abjuration''' - [[Abjuration]]s cast against your servants are 20% less effective. (Passive)\n*'''Extend Rage''' - If you kill a monster while berserk, you have a Piety/10% chance of adding 4-13 more turns to your rage.(Passive)\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level *]]:''' \"Angry Troglodyte\"\n*'''Berserk''' - Go [[berserk]]. Berserk increases HP by 1.5x and gives the [[haste]] (1.5x action speed) and [[might]] (+1d10 damage/hit) statuses. However, you restricted from most actions other than move and attack, runs out quickly if you aren't attacking, and are [[slow]]ed after it ends. You cannot go berserk if you are still recovering from a previous rage. (0-1 Piety)\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level **]]:''' \"Frenzied\"\n*'''Trog's Hand''' - Provides +1 HP/turn [[regeneration rate|regeneration]] and +80 [[willpower]] for a number of turns depending on piety. (2-3 Piety)\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ***]]:''' \"[Species Name] of Prey\"\n*No new abilities.\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ****]]:''' \"Rampant\"\n*'''Brothers In Arms''' - Summons a powerful berserk ally, the species of which depends on piety. At low piety levels (****), you get [[ogre (monster)|ogre]]s, [[two-headed ogre]]s, [[black bear]]s, and [[polar bear]]s, while at high levels (***** or ******) you get [[troll (monster)|troll]]s, [[iron troll]]s, [[deep troll]]s, [[ettin]]s and [[stone giant]]s. They are always friendly. Their rage can expire, although this generally occurs shortly before they time out. Brothers In Arms has a high chance of failure, but this falls as piety rises. (5-8 Piety)\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level *****]]:''' \"Wild [Species Name]\"\n*No new abilities.\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ******]]:''' \"Bane of Scribes\"\n*No new abilities.\n\nUnlike most other gods, Trog's powers do not require the [[Invocations]] skill. Their chance of success is determined solely by your piety.\n\n==Gifts==\n'''[[Piety|Piety level *****]]''':\n*'''Weapons''' - Whenever you gain piety, if gift timeout equals 0, you have a <code>25% * (piety - 121) / piety</code> chance to gain a weapon. The weapon created will be enchanted, similar to using a [[scroll of acquirement]], and possibly an [[artefact]]. Trog will only gift weapons with the [[antimagic]], [[flaming]], [[heavy]], or [[speed brand|speed]] brands. The weapon chosen is weighted based on your weapon skills, though there is always a chance of receiving a weapon for which you have no skill.\n:After receiving a gift, the [[gift timeout]] increases to <code>29 + (2d19)/2</code> (30-48) piety. Gaining piety will lower the gift timeout. Note that when you have a gift timeout with Trog, piety gain for all purposes except gifts is reduced.\n\n==Punishments==\n{{flavour|Trog strongly dislikes it when you memorise spells, you attempt to cast spells, you train magic skills or you use magical staves or pain-branded weapons.\n\nTrog does not appreciate abandonment, and will call down fearful punishments on disloyal followers!\n\nTrog's wrath is incandescent. Offenders find themselves swarmed by berserkers â€” from packs of bears to, for the most powerful, mobs of giants and trolls. The bodies of those who anger Trog begin to decay, slow, and collapse, and Trog may simply smite them directly with fiery rage.\n\nTrog's wrath lasts for a relatively long duration.}}\nDuring penance or following desertion, you'll occasionally experience one of the following forms of [[divine retribution]]:\n* '''50%''' - Summons multiple hostile, berserked Brothers In Arms against you. Note that these are [[durably summoned]], so you cannot escape them by using stairs, and they will not disappear over time. However, their berserk rage will eventually expire, and they will briefly slow down as normal. They do not re-berserk unless they are already capable of doing so (e.g. [[black bear]]s or [[polar bear]]s).\n**If there is no room for Trog's minions to spawn, a message will appear saying \"Trog has no time to punish you...now.\"\n* '''33%''' - Gives you a weakening effect, which can take the form of [[drain]], stat decay, [[slow]]ing, or [[paralysis]].\n* '''16%''' - Trog casts [[Fireball]] on you.\n\n==Strategy==\nTrog is a great god for pure melee warriors, like [[Minotaur]]s, [[Troll]]s, and other monstrous [[species]] who won't miss their pathetic spellcasting abilities. When you consider that [[Berserker]]s start with Trog from D:1, along with the incredibly potent [[Berserk]] ability, it's even stronger. Berserk's damage, HP, and speed boosts are extremely handy for pulverizing enemies. Berserk is such a powerful ability that most species (with the possible exception of [[Deep Elves]]) shouldn't really mind getting Trog from a [[faded altar]], even if they started with magic.\n\nEven in the lategame, Trog remains viable, largely thanks to Brothers in Arms. While easy to underestimate, a berserk [[deep troll]] or two are enough to handle most threats up to and inside the [[Realm of Zot]], including the dreaded [[orb of fire]]. Like other [[summon]]s, Brothers in Arms will not follow you up or down stairs, so be sure to use them when enemies are in sight. Unlike [[Makhleb]]'s demons, brothers will never spawn hostile. \n\nThe Trog's Hand ability is less impressive, but the [[willpower]] is very useful against dangerous enchantments (such as [[Banishment]], [[Sentinel's Mark]], or [[Petrify]]), and increased regeneration is always useful.\n\nWrath is particularly dangerous; characters that only plan to obtain 3 [[rune]]s before going after the [[Orb of Zot]] have minimal reason to switch to a different god. Only the extended endgame -- areas such as [[Pandemonium]] or the [[Hell]]s -- is challenging enough that the inability to cast magic is a true liability; wait to switch to a different god until you feel yourself ready to handle such dangerous locations. You still keep Trog's [[weapon]]s after abandonment.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Remember that even Trog's abilities '''are unusable while berserk'''! Should you need Trog's Hand or Brothers in Arms, make sure to use them before entering a rage. Berserk also cuts off a lot of options, such as all [[potion]]s and [[scroll]]s.\n*Berserk runs out ''very'' quickly if you are not attacking. However, the [[haste]] it provdes can still help get away from trouble. If a stair is close by (3-4 tiles), you can run up and escape before it runs out.\n*One of Trog's altar [[vault]]s contains a [[spellbook]], but it will always be an artefact spellbook containing only the [[Apportation]] spell. As Apportation is the only way to obtain this spellbook (Trog ignites the book if you approach physically), there's no point in trying to grab it.\n*Trog's Hand can be used to counteract a lethal dose of poisoning in a pinch.\n*If you plan to leave Trog, a way to gain invisibility can make the hostile summons a lot less threatening: only [[deep troll]]s have see invisible.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Trog's Berserk did not have a piety cost, and Brothers in Arms was cheaper.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Trog's Berserk did not have any failure rate. Instead, [[berserk]]ing would have chance to paralyze you after it ends, with Trog lowering and eventually eliminating that (scaling with piety).\n*Prior to [[0.26]], troglodytes would often have to watch out for their [[food]] early on, due to the high hunger cost of going berserk. Wrath could also inflict [[rot]] instead of the mostly equivalent [[drain]].\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Trog could gift weapons of any brand and would also gift ammunition. Trog would also inflict fire [[miscast effects]] as part of wrath and did not object to using magical staves or the pain brand.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], Trog granted the ability to burn books for piety and to create [[cloud]]s of flames.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Trog allowed followers to gain piety by sacrificing [[corpse]]s (by standing over them and [[praying]]).\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Trog's wrath summons weren't [[durable summon]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Trog's weapon gifts tended to have higher damage enchantments than accuracy.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], burning unidentified books gave more piety, and [[rock troll]]s were in the list of possible Brothers in Arms.\n\n{{gods}}"}

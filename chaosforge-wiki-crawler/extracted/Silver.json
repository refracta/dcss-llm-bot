It also inflicts extra damage against mutated beings, according to how mutated they are.}}\n'''Silver''' is a [[brand]] which does the following:\n*Deals an average of +16.6% untyped damage (100% - 133%) to any creature.\n*Deals up to +75% untyped damage against [[shapeshifter|shapeshifting]], [[mutation|mutated]], and [[chaotic]] creatures, including players. Against players, the damage scales with how mutated you are - see below for details.\n\nIf you are struck by a silver projectile and are especially vulnerable to silver, you will see the message:\n{{crawlquote|The silver sears you!}}\n\nSilver can appear on [[javelin]]s and the [[unrand]] [[lajatang of Order]].\n\n==Silver Damage Calculation==\n===Chaotic monsters and shapeshifted characters===\nIf the target is chaotic or shapeshifted, the damage is:\n (normal_damage * 7) / 4  [rounded down]\nor roughly 175% damage. Unlike most other brands, there's no random component. Although the player can never be chaotic, they do count as shapeshifted when in any of the following [[transformation]]s: [[Beastly Appendage]], [[Spider Form]], [[Ice Form]], [[Statue Form]], [[Storm Form]], [[Dragon Form]], [[Bat Form]], [[Tree Form]], [[Fungus Form]], [[Wisp Form]], or [[Pig Form]].\n\n===Mutated Players===\nFor non-shapeshifted players who have [[mutation]]s, the damage varies by how much you are mutated. All external sources of mutation count, and for [[demonspawn]], all [[demonspawn mutation]]s count. Otherwise, mutations innate to species (e.g. Octopode tentacles) don't count. The amount of mutations is tallied and converted to damage (max. 15 mutations):\n\n normal_damage * ( 5 * mutations + 100 ) / 100  [rounded down]\n\nThe silver damage thus varies from 105% to 175%, for 1 to 15+ mutations. All mutated monsters are considered chaotic, so they'll always get max damage from silver.\n\n===Final Calculation===\nAny extra silver damage is then compared to a [[vorpal|random multiplier]] from 100% to 133%. The higher result is applied.\n\n==See Also==\n[[:Category:Silver vulnerability|List of silver vulnerable monsters]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], silver could be found on [[boomerang]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], silver only did extra damage to chaotic and mutated creatures, with [[steel]] dealing extra to all monsters.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], [[sling bullet]]s and [[bolt]]s could have brands, one of which was silver.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], you could find silver [[dart]]s.

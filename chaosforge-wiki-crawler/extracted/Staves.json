{"title":"Staves","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Staves","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\nThe '''Staves''' skill denotes how proficient your character is wielding all manner of staves. Most of these weapons can deal moderate damage when wielded with two hands, and are easy enough to use that even [[spriggan]]s can wield them. Casters may find this skill especially appealing, as it improves the usefulness of their magical staves. It [[crosstrain]]s with the [[Polearms]] skill and the [[Maces & Flails]] skill. \n\nNote that [[magical staves]] fight like +0 [[staff|staves]], though they enhance a certain school of [[spell]]s and deal bonus damage based on Evocations and the relevant skill. Some also offer a resistance.\n\n{{skill_aptitudes}}\n\n==List of Staves==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Name || Dam || Hit || Delay || Min delay || Hands || Size || Cuts Hydras?\n|-\n| [[Magical staff]] || 5 + Special || +5 || 12 || 6 (12 skill) || One || Medium+ for 1H || No\n|-\n| [[Quarterstaff]] || 10 || +3 || 13 || 6 (14 skill) || Two || Any || No\n|-\n| [[Lajatang]] || 16 || -3 || 14 || 7 (14 skill) || Two || Any || Yes\n|-\n|}\n\n==Strategy==\nBoth quarterstaves and lajatangs are \"skill-friendly\"; they offer high damage relative to their base [[attack delay]]. A lajatang requires 14 skill to reach mindelay, but a similar damage [[battleaxe]] or [[great mace]] would require 20 skill. However, they have several downsides:\n*They are two-handed, preventing use of a shield.\n*Once your character obtains a high skill level, the fact that staves are \"skill-friendly\" doesn't matter. I.e. if you have 20 weapon skill, you'll do more damage with a great mace than with lajatang.\n*Lajatangs are rare. You may be stuck with a quarterstaff for a long time.\n\nOn the flip side, staves are one of the few weapons that can spawn with the [[spectral]] or [[speed brand]]s, and as mentioned, work well at low skill. If you find a particularly good lajatang early on, it may be worthwhile to switch to it.\n\n[[Magical staves]] are in a completely different ballpark. As melee weapons, they rely on three skills: Staves, Magical skill, and Evocations. Thus, they are impractical as \"main\" weapons, but casters can use them to defeat weak enemies. They also boost the power of spell magic, and most staves give an elemental resistance.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[weapon#Staves|List of staves]]\n*[[Species#Melee_.26_Ranged_Combat|Table of species aptitudes]]\n\n{{Skills}}\n\n[[Category:Staves]]\n[[Category:Weapon skills]]"}

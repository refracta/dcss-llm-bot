{"title":"Edmund","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Edmund","type":"raw","data":"{{version024}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Edmund the Younger''' is a weak unique who appears in the early game. Although he's [[Sigmund]]'s brother, he is not nearly as lethal. He generates with a decent [[flail]] (often [[holy wrath]] [[brand]]ed), a well-enchanted suit of medium-weight armour, and (occasionally) a random attack [[wand]], making him a threat to low-level characters.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:4-6\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If discovered early on, he can be an overwhelming melee opponent, but even then he lacks any real tricks. Intelligent use of ranged attacks can take him out fairly easily, but don't be overconfident. You can always come back later when he's a pushover.\n*[[Undead]] characters should be mindful of his weapon. Holy wrath can make short work of careless players.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

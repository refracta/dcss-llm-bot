{"title":"List of demonspawn","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_demonspawn","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n''This page is about the various demonspawn [[monster]]s. For the player species, see [[demonspawn]].''\n{{flavour|A half-mortal, half-demonic creature, with its hellish heritage asserting itself through a certain devilish cast to its features.}}\n\n'''Demonspawn''' are the accursed offspring of [[demon]]s and mortals, seemingly ordinary in youth, but gradually showing more and more of their infernal heritage as they grow. These beings wander the halls of [[Pandemonium]], serving the [[Pandemonium lord]]s and assaulting anyone foolish enough to invade.\n\nUnlike their demonic brethren, demonspawn lack any guaranteed immunities; [[poison]] and [[torment]] affect them like they would any mortal being. They have occupations that enhance their deadliness. The sheer variety of demonspawn you can encounter requires you to be ready for a little bit of everything, though they are by no means the most dangerous inhabitants of Pandemonium.\n\n==Base Demonspawn==\n{{Brown|6}} [[File: Demonspawn (monster).png]] '''[[Demonspawn (monster)|Demonspawn]]''' - Basic demonspawn whose heritage hasn't come in yet. A somewhat dangerous melee enemy, at least for the [[Orcish Mines]].\n\n==Demonspawn Occupations==\n{{monsterlink|Demonspawn blood saint}}- Demonspawn that can temporarily bolster their allies and hurl wild blasts of magic at their foes.\n\n{{monsterlink|Demonspawn black sun}}- Powerful necromancers that enable their allies' attacks to drain various energies from their foes.\n\n{{monsterlink|Demonspawn warmonger}}- Powerful warriors who can quash enemy spellcasters while hasting their allies.\n\n{{monsterlink|Demonspawn corrupter}}- Demonspawn that corrode their enemies and call powerful monsters from elsewhere in the dungeon.\n\n==Unique Demonspawn==\n{{monsterlink|Amaemon}} - A diabolic poisoner with a venomous whip and retinue of toxic friends.\n\n==Retired Demonspawn==\n\n{{monsterlink|Infernal demonspawn}}- Fiery demonspawn who infuse their attacks with flames and shrug off your own [[fire]]-based attacks.\n\n{{monsterlink|Gelid demonspawn}}- Icy demonspawn that protect themselves with their [[icemail]] and resist [[cold]] damage well.\n\n{{monsterlink|Monstrous demonspawn}}- Bestial demonspawn who throw themselves into combat in a frenzy of claws and horns. They have more durability than their brethren and deal more damage in melee.\n\n{{monsterlink|Torturous demonspawn}}- [[Spiny|Spine-covered]] demonspawn who wound those who attack them and grow stronger as they take damage.\n\n{{monsterlink|Putrid demonspawn}}- Foul-smelling demonspawn that drew strength from the corpses of the fallen; they were nearly immune to [[poison]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Chaos champion}}- Unpredictable combatants that smote opponents with [[chaos]] and could shuffle the positions of all creatures nearby.\n\n==History==\n*Amaemon was added in [[0.29]].\n*Prior to [[0.28]], classed demonspawns could spawn with a varying base (monstrous, gelid, infernal, or torturous).\n*Putrid demonspawn and chaos champions bit the dust in [[0.19]].\n*All non-base demonspawn monster varieties were added in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

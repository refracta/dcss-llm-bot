{"title":"Might","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Might","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|You are unnaturally mighty, doing significantly more damage in physical combat.}}\n\n'''Might''' is a [[status effect]] and monster-only spell that increases melee damage for its duration.\n\n==Effect==\n===Player===\nAdds +1d10 damage to melee and each [[auxiliary attack]], except [[constriction]].\n\nThis is considered separate from the effective enchantment roll ([[slaying]] + to-damage of your weapon). When compared to having +10 slaying, might gives a more consistent roll. Having 10 slay and might (1d10 + 1d10) is more consistent than 20 slaying (1d20). However, unlike slaying, might does not give an [[accuracy]] bonus, thus making it weaker than +10 slay.\n\n===Monster===\nMonsters get +50% damage in melee. This is often stronger than the player effect, so exercise caution around mighted monsters.\n\n==Sources==\nThe possible sources for Might are:\n*[[Potions of might]].\n**Also available through Gozag's [[Gozag#Given Abilities|Potion Petition]].\n*The [[Demonspawn mutation]] [[Powered by Pain]] can cause a might effect.\n*[[Xom]] and [[chaos]] effects can inflict might.\n\n[[Berserk]] includes a might effect. While berserk, might has no additional effect.\n\n==Strategy==\nMight is useful for dealing with monsters that are troublesome, but for which [[berserk]] or [[haste]] would be overkill and/or unsafe - compared to those, might has no real drawbacks and is safe to use. Unfortunately, as it is only easily available through a [[potion]], the uses are limited. Since might increases your combat ability, use it early in a fight - you'll get more out of might at 100% HP than 50% HP.\n\nMight is a 'flat' damage boost, so it has a more pronounced effect on [[Short Blades]] and other fast weapons. It can let a [[quick blade]] punch through high [[AC]] foes, for instance. It's also disproportionately strong with [[auxiliary attack]]s; e.g. monstrous [[Demonspawn]] and worshippers of [[Jiyva]] can get +2d10 to +4d10 damage per round.\n\nEven casters will want to keep around potions of might, in cases where they run out of MP.\n\n==Monster Spell==\nMonsters can cast the Might spell to induce the effect on themselves. They can also use [[Might Other]] to induce it on a single other monster, or [[Battlecry]] to induce it on all nearby monsters of the same [[type|genus]].\n\n{{monsters with spell|Might}}\n\n{{monsters with spell|Might Other}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Might provided a +5 bonus to [[Strength]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the player could get the Might status effect by drawing a [[Potion card]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], extending might through further quaffing of potions would inflict one point of [[magic contamination]].\n*Prior to [[0.8]], you could get Might as an [[Okawaru]] ability.\n*Prior to [[0.3]], you could get Might as a [[Trog]] ability.\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

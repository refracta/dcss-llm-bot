{"title":"Illusion card","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Illusion_card","type":"raw","data":"{{Version027}}\n{{flavour|The card depicts someone standing in a hall of mirrors, surrounded by their own reflections.}}\nThe Illusion card summons an illusion of the player to fight alongside them, much like [[Mara]]'s [[Summon Illusion|ability]]. The illusion is armed identically to the player. Higher card power increases the duration of the illusion.\n\nIt could be found in the following [[decks]] over the past several versions. \n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.15]]\n![[0.16]]\n![[0.17]]\n![[0.18]]\n![[0.19]] and beyond\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of summoning|Summoning]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of summoning|Summoning]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of summoning|Summoning]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of summoning|Summoning]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of summoning|Summoning]]\n|----\n|}\n\n==History==\n*This card was one of 23 cards to be kept in the deck simplification of [[0.19]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], decks needed to be wielded to be evoked, so this card prompted the player to choose a weapon for the illusion to wield.\n*The Illusion card was added in [[0.15]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n{{cards}}\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

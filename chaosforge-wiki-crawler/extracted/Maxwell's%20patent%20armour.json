His unorthodox materials left it with certain shortcomings, but he's yet to have anyone come back for a refund.}}\n[[File:Maxwell's_patent_armour.png]] '''''the +15 Maxwell's patent armour'''''\n\n+15 [[plate armour]]\n\n[[Acid#Corrosion_Resistance|rCorr]]<br>\n[[Electricity#Electricity_Resistance|rElec]]<br>\n[[Will]]+<br>\nPrevents spellcasting<br>\nPrevents [[teleportation]]\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Maxwell's patent armour'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|968}}</ref> is great for melee [[Formicid]]s. For other characters, wearing it means losing the ability to [[blink]] or [[teleport]], two of the strongest escape options in the game. Other than -Tele, it's a very strong armour, with high enchantment, the ever-useful [[willpower]], and 2 rare resistances. For non-Formicids, it might have merit if you have great [[god]] abilities to get you out of trouble, such as [[Zin]]'s Sanctuary.\n\nAs an artefact with -Tele, it can see use in [[Zot:5]]. Getting [[sourceless malevolence|teleported]] into the Orb chamber is one of the most dangerous things that can happen in Zot:5, and -Tele prevents just that. Also, it prevents [[dispersal trap]]s from blinking you, which is a nice bonus. Remember to remove -Tele before picking up the Orb, though. If so desired, you can use it in other branch ends (like [[Elven Halls|Elf]]:3) in a similar manner. Use this armour for exploring everything outside the end vault, then switch when tackling the vault.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Maxwell's patent armour came cursed.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Maxwell's patent armour offered resistance to [[Fire|rF+]] and [[Cold|rC+]] instead of corrosion and electricity.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Maxwell's patent armour offered the [[preservation]] [[ego]] instead of fire and cold resistance.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

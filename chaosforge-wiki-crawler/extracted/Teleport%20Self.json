{"title":"Teleport Self","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Teleport_Self","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|Teleports the caster to a random location.}}\n'''Teleport Self''' is a monster-only spell which causes the caster to randomly [[teleport]] a few turns after the spell is cast, much like if it had read a [[scroll of teleportation]]. Monsters usually only use this spell after taking significant damage, as an emergency escape maneuver.\n\nThe following enemies could cast Teleport Self:\n*{{monsterlink|Sonja}}\n*{{monsterlink|Maurice}}\n*{{monsterlink|Prince Ribbit}}\n\n==History==\n*Teleport Self was removed in [[0.28]].\n*A number of monsters had Teleport Self removed from their spell sets in [[0.17]].\n*Prior to [[0.9]], Teleport Self was also a level 5 [[Translocations]] player spell. It functioned just like any other source of teleportation, and the fact that it took up no [[inventory]] space almost made up for the fact that its [[miscast effect]]s were potentially very lethal ([[banish]]ment was not uncommon).\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]][[Category:Monster spells]]"}

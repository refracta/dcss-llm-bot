{"title":"Disjunction","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Disjunction","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Disjunction''' is a level 8 [[Translocations|Translocation]] spell which [[blink]]s away nearby monsters for a short time.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen cast, an [[aura]] of disjunction with radius of 4 appears. The duration of the aura is randomized and depends on [[spell power]] (min. 6 turns).\n\nThe chance of a monster blinking away depends on how close it is to the center. [[Willpower]] isn't effective against Disjunction; if the monster is able to blink, it can be blinked away.\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile Disjunction is active, it's almost impossible for monsters to stay in melee range for more than 1 turn.\n\nAs a level 8 utility spell, it's a big investment for most characters doing a 3-rune game. Species with amazing Translocations aptitude ([[Felid]]s, [[Spriggan]]s) can find it reasonable to cast, especially if you've trained the skill for a spell like [[Malign Gateway]]. In [[extended]], there's infinite XP, so anyone can cast it eventually.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Dispersal]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Disjunction caused 750 - 1250 points of [[magic contamination]] per cast.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the aura was circular and had radius of 5.\n*Disjunction was added in [[0.12]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

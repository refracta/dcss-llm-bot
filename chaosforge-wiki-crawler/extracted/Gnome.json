They were a small race, and aptitude-wise, shared many characteristics with [[halfling]]s.  However, they advanced slightly more slowly in [[experience]] levels, and were somewhat more competent casters.  In particular, they could be excellent [[Earth Magic|Earth mages]], having a superlative aptitude for that skill and good aptitude for [[Conjurations]], though they were somewhat held back by their poor [[Spellcasting]] aptitude.  They had an innate [[magic mapping]] ability.\n\n==Preferred Classes==\nGnomes were among the least versatile races in the game, usually becoming [[Chaos Knight]]s, [[Crusader]]s, [[Enchanter]]s, [[Earth Elementalist]]s, [[Stalker]]s, and [[Assassin]]s.\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*-1 [[HP]] every level until character level 13.\n*-1 [[HP]] every 3rd level.\n*Average [[MP]].\n*+1 [[dexterity]] or [[intelligence]] every 4th level.\n\n{{Old_Apts\n|arm = 150\n|ddg = 70\n|sth = 70\n|stb = 80\n|shd = 120\n|t&d = 60\n|inv = 90\n|evo = 45\n|exp = 110\n|fgt = 100\n|sbl = 75\n|lbl = 100\n|axs = 100\n|m&f = 130\n|pla = 140\n|stv = 130\n|u_c = 110\n|thr = 100\n|slg = 80\n|bws = 100\n|crb = 90\n|drt = 60\n|spc = 156\n|coj = 100\n|enc = 100\n|sum = 110\n|nec = 130\n|trl = 130\n|trm = 120\n|div = 120\n|fir = 100\n|ice = 100\n|air = 170\n|ear = 60\n|poi = 130\n}}\n\n==History==\n\nGnomes were removed in [[0.5]].  [[Deep Dwarves]], introduced in [[0.6]], co-opted a few of the features of gnomes, notably the aptitudes for [[Evocations]] and [[Earth Magic]], and the ability to sense their surroundings.\n\nInterestingly, they also bear some resemblance to [[Gargoyle]]s: strong defense but low HP, and great earth casters but also competent physical fighters.  It is not known whether or not this was intentional.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete species]]"}

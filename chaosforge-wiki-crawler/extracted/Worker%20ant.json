{"title":"Worker ant","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Worker_ant","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Worker ants''' are tasty insects that behave much like [[adder]]s: they are fast, poisonous, and only a real threat to low-level characters. Expect them to hit somewhat harder though. They can be found in the early [[Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Wounding or killing them at range will minimize their ability to poison you in melee.\n*They are vulnerable to poison. [[Poisonous Vapours]] and other [[Poison Magic]] work very well against them, as do [[venom]]-branded weapons and [[dart]]s.\n\n==History==\n*Worker ants were removed in [[0.27]]."}

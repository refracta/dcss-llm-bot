{"title":"Doom Howl","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Doom_Howl","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Unleashes a piercing howl that catches and echoes in victims' minds. While those echoes linger, nightmarish creatures will hear and track them to their source. It can only be used once by a given creature.}}\n\n'''Doom Howl''' is a monster-only ability that inflicts the Howl status on the target; it is smite-targeted and cannot be silenced. [[Willpower]] may resist this spell, though at 96 [[enchantment power]], it requires Will+++++ in order to resist 100% of the time.\n\nWhile the Howl status is active, monsters from the following list will spawn around the player every 2-4 turns<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|spl-summoning.cc|429}}</ref>:\n\n{{monsterlink|Bone dragon}}\n\n{{monsterlink|Reaper}}\n\n{{monsterlink|Tormentor}}\n\n{{monsterlink|Tzitzimitl}}\n\n{{monsterlink|Putrid mouth}}\n\nThese monsters are \"real\" and do not count as summons. Because of that, they are not susceptible to [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]] and killing the monster that inflicted the status will not despawn them, but they ''will'' grant experience when slain.\n\nThe Howl status effect lasts for 12-18 turns<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|mon-cast.cc|7131}}</ref>. Drinking a [[potion of cancellation]] ends the status early.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nDoom hounds can only ''succeed'' with Doom Howl once. If it fails due to willpower, the doom hound can continue to cast until it succeeds.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Doom Howl was not resisted by [[willpower]].\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Doom Howl could call in [[shadow dragon]]s and [[shadow demon]]s instead of putrid mouths.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

{"title":"Yaktaur","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Yaktaur","type":"raw","data":"{{version|025}}\n''For a list of all centaur-type creatures, see [[list of centaurs]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Yaktaurs''' are half-[[yak]], half-[[human]] hybrids; essentially stronger, more dangerous relatives of [[centaur (monster)|centaurs]]. Yaktaurs have more [[HP]], wield [[crossbow]]s instead of [[bow]]s (for higher damage and accuracy), and usually travel in packs, but lack a centaur's speed. They are common menaces throughout [[the Vaults]] and [[the Depths]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Treat them like you would centaurs: lure them into melee range around corners and be prepared for [[fire]] or [[cold]] damage if they have [[brand]]ed weapons (which they often do). In spite of their flavour text, they are not actually very menacing in melee.\n*The biggest change in strategy is to try not to get into melee with one or two yaktaurs while the rest of the pack gets time to shoot at you. Giving yaktaurs a few turns to pepper you with bolts can be surprisingly lethal.\n**Fortunately, they won't try to shoot past their brethren, so you can hide behind a couple yaktaurs while you wait for the rest of the pack to move up to you.\n*Unlike centaurs, yaktaurs are easy to run from. If you encounter a pack and don't have a chokepoint to force them through, feel free to flee.\n*Yaktaurs are a good reason to have a source of [[Repel Missiles#Player sources|RMsl]] while exploring the Vaults or Depths, but they're not insurmountable without one."}

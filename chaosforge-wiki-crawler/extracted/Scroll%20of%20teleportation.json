{"title":"Scroll of teleportation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Scroll_of_teleportation","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{item\n |itemtype=Scroll\n |name=Scroll of teleportation\n |cost=30\n}}\n{{flavour|A scroll that translocates the reader to a random position after a short delay.}}\n\nReading a '''scroll of teleportation''' will cause the player to [[teleport]] to a random location after several turns have passed.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen read, it inflicts the {{lightBlue|Tele}} status if you don't already have it.\n{{crawlquote|You feel strangely unstable.}}\n\nAfter a set duration, you will be teleported. Teleports send you to any random location on the floor, that 1. you can move to, 2. does not contain a dangerous [[cloud]], and 3. is outside of certain \"no teleport\" [[vault]]s. This includes the tile you are currently on.\n\nIf you already have the {{lightBlue|Tele}} status, then using another scroll will cancel it.\n{{crawlquote|You feel strangely stable.}}\n\n===Duration===\nThe duration (in [[decaAut]], i.e. \"turns\") depends on where you are and if you have the '''Orb''' status:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|spl-transloc.cc|837}}</ref>\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n! Circumstance || Duration\n|-\n| Normal || 3-5 turns\n|-\n| In [[the Realm of Zot]] or when carrying [[Orb of Zot|the Orb]] || 8-14 turns\n|-\n| In [[the Abyss]] (even when carrying the Orb) || 8-19 turns\n|}\n\t\nThe duration is always a whole number of turns. Note that the time spent reading the scroll counts towards the timer. See below for an example:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n!Action || Acculmulated Time || Teleport eligible?\n|-\n|Read scroll of teleport (1.0 turn) || 1.0 turn || No\n|-\n|Wait (1.0 turn) || 2.0 turns || No\n|-\n|Wait (1.0 turn) || 3.0 turns || '''Yes'''\n|-\n|Wait (1.0 turn) || 4.0 turns || '''Yes'''\n|-\n|Wait (1.0 turn) || 5.0 turns || '''Yes''' (forced)\n|}\n\n===Order of Events===\nOn the turn you teleport, the following happen, in order:\n# You get the full effect of whatever action you did.\n# You are teleported instantly to the new destination\n# You [[wait]] for the time of the action\n\nFor example, say you cast [[Fireball]] with the Tele status. If you teleport, you get the effects of Fireball, then teleport, then wait 1.0 turn in the post-teleport location.\n\n==Strategy==\nScrolls of teleport are powerful and reasonably common escape tools. In just a few turns, you can be sent dozens of tiles away from your original destination. However, since the teleport is entirely random, there's always a risk of a 'backfire'. You might only be teleported a few tiles away, or you could end up in a whole new can of worms! Therefore, you should try to initiate teleports earlier rather than later.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*A [[potion of cancellation]] will also end a teleport (along with any other effects you may have).\n**Monsters with [[Quicksilver Bolt]] or a [[wand of quicksilver]] can also cancel your teleportation, whenever you'd like it or not.\n*\"[[Identification|Blind reading]]\" a scroll of teleport is safe if you are on a cleared level.\n**If you are on an [[stairs|upstairs]] that leads to a cleared level, blind reading is also safe. If you read a teleport scroll, and your very next action is to start going up the stairs, the teleport will always happen at the destination floor.\n*Watch out for [[vault]]s gated by [[runed door]]s or [[transporter]]s. While you can never teleport inside a [[ghost vault]], you ''can'' teleport into many other types of \"sealed\" vault. The chance of actually teleporting in will be low, but be wary of the risk.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], scrolls of teleportation worked normally in [[The Realm of Zot]], before picking up the Orb of Zot.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], it was possible to perform [[controlled teleport]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], there was a 20% chance that the Abyss would not add time to teleportation.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], controlled teleports did not have a longer delay.  In older versions, the Orb did not add time to teleportation.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

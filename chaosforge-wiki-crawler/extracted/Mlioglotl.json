{"title":"Mlioglotl","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mlioglotl","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Mlioglotl, the Unformed Horror''' is a [[thrashing horror]] of [[Lugonu]] that can corrupt the floor around him, summoning monsters from [[the Abyss]].\n\nMlioglotl can appear in the following locations:\n* [[The Swamp]]\n* [[The Shoals]]\n* [[The Snake Pit]]\n* [[The Spider's Nest]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Mlioglotl is a ''very'' high-tier threat for the places he spawns in, similar to [[Mara]]. Alone, he is naturally fast, hits hard (especially when [[might]]ed), is resistant to many elements, and is quite durable. But he can summon creatures from the Abyss, which can be far [[out-of-depth]]. If he summons too many creatures, consider [[teleport]]ing away (or any other method of escape).\n**Remember you don't have to kill everything in ''Crawl''! Skipping the floor he's on is perfectly reasonable.\n*Unlike most demonic abilities, Mlioglotl's Corrupt ''is'' stopped by [[silence]] and [[waterlog]], since it's considered \"[[Lugonu|priestly]]\". With high Evocations skill, a [[phial of floods]] can give you enough time to kill him before any summons appear. Strong melee/ranged fighters can buff up, use a [[scroll of silence]], and fight. He can still Might when silenced, however.\n*Mlioglotl is weak to [[silver]] and [[holy wrath]].\n*Mlioglotl has good [[willpower]], but a [[scroll of vulnerability]] will make it reasonable for a [[wand of paralysis]] or [[Hexes]] spells to work. However, use this with ''extreme'' caution, since Corrupt can create [[great orbs of eyes]], [[dread lich]]es, and other will-checking threats. It's heavily recommended to have a way to silence/waterlog him when using vulnerability.\n*Followers of [[Yredelemnul]] can convert him into a powerful bound soul. Mlioglotl's abyssal summons include [[lich]]es and [[starcursed mass]]es, which makes him strong enough for the late game.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Mlioglotl was considered [[nonliving]], and both Cause Fear and Corrupt were considered \"[[spell slot flag|Magical]]\" instead of Priestly.\n*Mlioglotl was added in [[0.28]]."}

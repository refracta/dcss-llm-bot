{"title":"Holy spell school","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Holy_spell_school","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\nThe '''holy spell school''' only existed in pre-DCSS versions of ''Crawl''.  Its spells provided a wide variety of useful effects, very few of which can still be found as spells.  Among its spells were:\n* Lesser/Greater Healing: acted just like a [[potion of curing]]/[[potion of heal wounds]] (neither cured status effects, though).\n* [[Purification]]: Similar to the Zin ability.\n* Restore Strength/Dexterity/Intelligence: These were very useful if you found them, since in early versions, stats did not heal naturally, and [[potion of restore abilities|potions of restore abilities]] could be quite rare.\n* [[Smiting]]: Back when this was available to players as a spell effect, it was, appropriately a holy spell.\n* [[Cure Poison]]: The only holy spell that remained player-castable after holy's removal, albeit under a different school.\n\n==History==\nHoly spells still existed in the code for a long time after they were removed, although they could never be generated in DCSS except through bugs.  However, before the advent of gods in pre-DCSS Crawl, they filled the niche that the [[good gods]] now fill.  Indeed, the abilities provided by holy spells were generally parceled off to the good gods.\n\nHoly spells never had any [[miscast]]s associated to them, unlike the [[Divinations]] school."}

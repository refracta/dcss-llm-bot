Their weapons are often [[brand]]ed, and they are usually positioned somewhere that is difficult to engage them at range. However, once you move away from them, they are harmless. They can be found defending the treasure vault in the [[Volcano]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*When you find yourself low on [[HP]], just walk away and heal; the statues won't flee or regenerate during this time.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], they could be found in a [[Volcano]] layout."}

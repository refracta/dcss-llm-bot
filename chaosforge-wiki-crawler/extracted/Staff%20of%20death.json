If the wielder is skilled in Evocations and Necromancy, they can inflict great pain on those living souls they strike, dealing negative energy damage which bypasses armour.}}\n\nA '''staff of death''' is a [[magical staff]]. It gives a [[spell enhancer]] to [[Necromancy]], and gives the wielder one rank in [[negative energy resistance]].\n\nThe staff can also be used in combat, functioning as a +0 [[staff]] that may deal additional negative energy damage.\n\n{{crawlquote|'''Negative Energy Damage''': 0 to 1.25×(Evocations/2 + Necromancy)<br>'''Chance to Activate on a Hit:''' (Evocations + Necromancy/2)×6.66% per hit}}\n\nIn addition, the [[Staves]] and [[Fighting]] skills will increase the damage done by the staff itself.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|the maximum negative energy damage in melee will be increased to <code>1.575×(Evocations/2 + Necromancy)</code> and be reduced by AC.}}\n*Prior to [[0.19]], a single rank of negative energy resistance (rN+) would prevent all additional negative energy damage from this staff.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], the chance of a staff of death auto-identifying when wielded depended on the Necromancy skill of the wielder."}

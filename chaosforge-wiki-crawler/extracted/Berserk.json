The status will wear off very quickly unless you are attacking other monsters, and when it expires you will be slowed and unable to berserk again for a short duration.}}\n\n'''Berserk''' is a [[status effect]] which fills you with overwhelming rage. It makes you significantly deadlier in combat, but disables most actions. Afterwards, you are left severely handicapped.\n\n==Useful Info==\nBerserk has the following effects:\n\n'''Pros'''\n*Current and max [[HP]] increase by 50%\n*[[Might]] (+1d10 melee attack damage)\n*[[Haste]] (+50% action speed)\n*Immunity to [[sleep]]\n\n'''Cons'''\n*Cannot do anything except for attacking, moving, opening or closing [[door]]s, shouting, and wielding, unwielding, dropping, or picking up items.\n**Doing anything but attacking will reduce the duration further.\n*Sets your [[stealth]] score to 0.\n*Causes you to make lots of [[noise]] when opening [[door]]s (''You throw open the door with a bang!'').\n\nMonsters also get immunity to [[fear]], and gain +50% damage instead of +1d10, but don't get the HP boost.\n\nOnce it ends, you are left [[slow]]ed for <code>12 + 2d12</code> turns. You also get the -Berserk status for twice as long, preventing repeated rages.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|player.cc|8560}}</ref>\n\n===Duration===\nBy default, berserk has a duration of <code>(19 + 1d19) / 2</code> turns (10-19 turns, weighted towards 15).<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|player-act.cc|828}}</ref> However, doing anything but attack will quickly reduce the duration, lasting as few as 3 turns if you do nothing.\n\n[[Trog]] enhances berserk. Regardless of the source, you have a <code>piety/10</code>% chance of extending your rage by 4 - 13 turns each time you kill something.\n\n===Restrictions===\n[[Formicid]]s and the [[undead]] ([[Ghoul]], [[Mummy]], bloodless [[Vampire]], those in [[Death Form]]) are unable to berserk. Players under -Berserk, [[Cause Fear|fear]], [[mesmerise]], or [[Death's Door]] are also unable.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|player-act.cc|851}}</ref> (Wielding the [[obsidian axe]] lets you berserk while mesmerised.)\n\n[[Cheibriados]] allows berserking, but suppresses the haste effect of berserk.\n\nHaving [[clarity]] will prevent unintentional berserk, but you can still use potions or [[Trog]]'s ability to berserk yourself.\n\nBerserk does not stack with other sources of might or haste.\n\n==Sources==\n'''Intentional'''\n*[[Potions of berserk rage]].\n*[[Trog]]'s Berserk ability.\n\n'''Unintentional'''\n*Items with *Rage or [[wrath]] ego have a chance to inflict berserk whenever you make a melee attack. Most items have a 20% chance, but certain [[unrand]]s have a 50% chance.\n*The [[Bad mutations#Berserk|Berserk]] mutation has a chance (3% or 9%) to inflict berserk, like items of *Rage.\n*Getting attacked by a [[moth of wrath]].\n*[[Chaos]] effects and [[Xom]]\n*When a player is hit by a [[datura]] dart, you are sent berserk.\n\n==Strategy==\nBerserk is an inherently risky status. If you can't defeat your opponent in time, you'll be [[slow]]ed (and likely stuck at low HP) while next to the enemy. Moreover, while you're berserk, you cannot use valuable [[potion]]s, [[scroll]]s, or [[god]] abilities until it runs out. Not even [[Trog]]'s abilities can be used while berserking.\n\nAt the same time, berserk gives a lot of power, allowing you to win fights. Don't assume that ''only'' heavy melee brutes use berserk. Nimble, dexterous characters with [[Short Blades]] benefit from the flat +1d10 damage; the faster you attack, the more 1d10 damage boosts you apply. Even casters, ''in the early game'', can use berserk as a last-ditch resort.\n\nBerserking is best done with the following precautions:\n*Be on top of, or very close to (no more than 2 tiles away), an [[stairs|upstair]]. If new monsters appear, or if the fight is going poorly, you can always [[stair dance]] the monster up. Try luring monsters to a staircase before activating berserk.\n*If you're going to berserk, do it early. Berserking at 50% HP is likely to be fatal.\n*You shouldn't berserk enemies that can [[blink]]. As time spent chasing a blinking enemy is time spent not attacking, the berserk will run out.\n\nTake these precautions with a grain of salt. If you don't have a better option, e.g. when against a D:3 [[water moccasin]] as a melee character, go berserk; being near a staircase does not matter in these situations.\n\nYou can negate the slow by having [[haste]], quaffing a [[potion of cancellation]], or using a few god abilities ([[Elyvilon]]'s Purification, [[Ru]]'s Draw Out Power). Even this can be a liability, since it'll take 1.5 turns to cure the slowing.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Keep in mind that berserk sets your [[stealth]] to 0. A [[Minotaur]] or [[Troll]] in heavy armour probably won't care, but stealthier characters should berserk in explored areas, and shouldn't try to berserk-stab things.\n*[[Summon]]ing allies (incidentally, another of Trog's abilities) will increase your chance of survival if the rage expires early.\n*You can't cast spells or fire [[Ranged Weapons]] while berserk.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.33|berserking players will be immune to [[fear]].}}\n*Prior to [[0.28]], some [[artefact]]s let you manually invoke berserk, but *Rage only provided a 5% chance to berserk. [[Cheibriados]] forbid intentional berserk, but still suppressed [[haste]] from berserk forced on you.\n*In [[0.27|0.27.1]] only, [[Clarity]] did not prevent berserk from *Rage.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], berserking had a chance to paralyze you after it ends, and both [[Trog]] and berserkitis would protect you from it.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the high hunger cost made it prohibitive to constantly go berserk.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], there were two more sources of the berserk effect: [[amulet of rage]] and [[miscast effect]]s from the [[Charms]] magic school. Also, berserk gave the player a +5 bonus to [[Strength]].\n*Prior to [[0.20]], berserk gave the [[exhausted]] status effect after wearing off instead of -Berserk, which also stopped [[Death's Door]] and [[Ru]]'s active abilities. Also, players and monsters were unable to (un)wield things while berserk.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], players could not go berserk if they were Very Hungry or worse; the hunger cost was applied at the end. Also, butchering corpses would sustain your rage the same way as attacking.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], an amulet of rage also reduced the risk of you passing out after your berserk ended.\n*The [[Berserker Rage]] spell used to allow the caster to go berserk at will (and reduced the risk of passing out afterwards), but it was removed from the spells players could use in [[0.9]].\n*Prior to [[0.9]], Berserk made players 2* as fast.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Abilities]]\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

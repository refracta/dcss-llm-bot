{"title":"Neverdies, the Minotaur Berserker","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Neverdies,_the_Minotaur_Berserker","type":"raw","data":"{{diary}}\n\nThis is the story of Neverdies, my MiBe. (Note: I never get past exp level 12, and very rarely up to 11.)\n\nLevel 1: Disabled Dodging, as always. I find it awful compared to just finding plate. I LOVE the innate racial of horns. Roflstomped everything, nothing too eventful. I did find a Royal Jelly (The food version), so I'm saving that for a pinch.\n\nLevel 2: Upon going down, I find the hardest enemies so far, the worm and a snake. I stomped both without berserk. After this I level to 3. Found Jessica. Killed Jessica. Found a kobold with a dagger of electrocution, but since I'm used to stomping them I didn't realize I had almost no health until it was almost too late. Reminder: Be more careful. Found Terrence. Killed Terrence. \n\nLevel 3: Greeted by a worm, and a band of orcs. The second band of orcs contained 3 orc priests. They still couldn't stop a berserked Minotaur. I am now up to 4 piety stars.\n\nLevel 4: Greeted by an Ogre, and his pet (I'm assuming) and a bat, and from this I gained level 7. I walk 6 steps, and find 2 more ogres. I headed upstairs to rest after the first one, but was greeted by a snake which then poisoned me. Almost dead, I scrambled through my potions. I found the one I wanted, and quaffed it. Refreshed, I killed the ogre. Found Sigmund, while I was starving. Had to eat my Royal Jelly, and then Sigmund turned invisible. I walked up and he died from my axe. \n\nLevel 5: Greeted by a Red Slime. Went to go and kill it, but got teleported by a trap. Found Prince Ribbit, killed Prince Ribbit. Found a shop with the randart Shoar, a cursed +10 plate armor with SInv, and +Inv. Costs 2.5k. Found my first Centaur, which failed.\n\nLevel 6: Greeted by an Orc Wizard, priest and a Centaur, an imp, and a zombie dog. All fell to my blade, without a berserk. HOLY CRAP WIN! Found the randart \"Duronadu\", a +1 plate armor with RC+, RN+, MR, and a sad -4dam. That's pretty sweet, now I need to find a good weapon and I'm set. I found I cannot take on a simple Orc Warrior, probably because of the -4dam. So I got chased around a while, blowing the rest of my potions and still not getting him. \n\nLevel 7: Greeted by a Kobold, 2 hobgoblins and 2 centaurs. I'm at the level to be gifted with a battleaxe soon, so fingers crossed from now. I died to a hunger ghost (Collateral), as I was starving after the fight and I had just prayed away an ogre body. I bolted down the corridor to find food and subsequently died to an orc warrior after fainting.This concludes the tale of Neverdies, the guy who died."}

Each casting will noisily launch several weak iron shots, randomly aiming them within a narrow cone in front of you. Higher Evocations skill will result in more individual shots and a wider cone of coverage.\n\n==Strategy==\n*While the individual projectiles from Scattershot don't deal terribly much damage on their own, you can fire it at point blank range to increase the chance of multiple shots hitting a single target.\n*This spell is very effective at taking down opponents with low [[AC]], but as the enemy's defense is applied to each shot, high-AC opponents will drastically reduce the damage dealt.\n\n==History==\n[[0.20]] moved scattershot into [[wand of scattershot]].\n\nScattershot was added in [[0.16]].\n\n[[Category:Attack spells]]"}

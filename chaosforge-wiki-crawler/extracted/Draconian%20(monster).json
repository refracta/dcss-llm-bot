{"title":"Draconian (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Draconian_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version017}}\n''This page is about the immature draconian [[monster]].  For the player species, see [[Draconian]].''<br>\n''For a list of draconian monsters, see [[List of draconians]].''\n{{monster info|draconian}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nUncolored '''draconians''' are immature members of the [[list of draconians|draconian]] family. They lack any sort of breath weapon, and are generally no more threatening than any other generic humanoid monster. They are extremely rare, so much so that if you encounter one, it is almost certainly a [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They're one of the stronger monsters based off of playable [[species]], but like many other, similar creatures, they're only dangerous if they pick up dangerous equipment. Shapeshifters posing as draconians won't even do that."}

As a type of [[derived undead]], their stats are based on what the monster had in life.\n\n==Useful Info==\nSimulacrum are the most fragile type of derived undead. They are slower, stupider, and with less HP than their living counterparts, but gain [[cold]] damage.\n\n*'''HP:''' ([[HD]])d4 + 1*HD\n*'''AC:''' Original - 2\n*'''EV:''' Original - 5\n*'''Speed:''' Original - 2 (at least 3)\n*'''Melee attacks:''' 80% of original\n*'''Attack flavour:''' [[Cold]] - does an extra (HD to 3*HD - 1) cold damage per attack\n*'''Special:''' Leaves behind a freezing [[cloud]] when destroyed, does not regenerate, cannot traverse stairs\n\nSimulacra are immune to poison, negative energy, torment, and cold damage, but are vulnerable to [[fire]] and [[holy]].\n\nSimulacra are usually created by the player's [[Sculpt Simulacrum]] spell or monsters' [[Bind Souls]] spell. You may also find them in [[Ice cave]]s, around [[necromancer]]s and [[Josephina]], and in certain [[vault]]s.\n\n==Strategy==\nSimulacra can deal ''brutal'' amounts of cold damage, depending on the monster. Every one of a monster's attacks gets the cold attack flavour. For example, a regular [[hydra]] deals up to 18 damage per head. A hydra simulacrum deals up to {14 physical + 39 cold} = ''53'' damage per head (over twice as much!).\n\nNeedless to say, if you're facing down a simulacrum or two, protect yourself with [[cold resistance]]. Simulacra are frail, so most types of ranged attacks can destroy them. Also, as they have poor [[willpower]], a [[wand of paralysis]] can be very effective.\n\nAs player allies, simulacrum are some of the most powerful undead minions available. While they fall apart quickly, the damage can be astounding. Try to target foes with high [[HD]] or multiple attacks.\n\n==Identifying Simulacra==\nThough simulacra of different monsters have different stats, ''Crawl'' tends to lump them together, making identification at a glance difficult. In console mode, simulacra will be separated into '''z'''s and '''Z'''s, representing large or small simulacra. Tiles mode is more specific, providing unique tiles for several categories of monster, but there is still considerable variation within those categories. In either mode, you can always press '''x''' and highlight the simulacrum in question to determine exactly what type of monster you are dealing with.\n\nBelow are all the categories of simulacra in tiles mode:\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum bat.png]] - Bat\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum bee.png]] - [[List of arthropods#Flying insects|Bee]]\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum centaur.png]] - [[List of centaurs|Centaur]]\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum dragon.png]] - [[List of dragons|Dragon]]\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum drake.png]] - Drake\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum fish.png]] - Fish\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum small humanoid.png]] - Humanoid (small)\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum large humanoid.png]] - Humanoid (large)\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum hydra 1.png]] [[Image:Simulacrum hydra 2.png]] [[Image:Simulacrum hydra 3.png]] [[Image:Simulacrum hydra 4.png]] [[Image:Simulacrum hydra 5.png]] - [[Hydra]]\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum ant.png]] - [[List of arthropods|Insect]]\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum jelly.png]] - [[List of jellies|Jellies]]\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum kraken.png]] - [[Kraken]]\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum lizard.png]] - [[List of reptiles and amphibians#Lizard types|Lizards]]\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum naga.png]] - [[List of nagas|Naga]]\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum small quadruped.png]] - Quadruped (small)\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum large quadruped.png]] - Quadruped (large)\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum snake.png]] - [[List of snakes|Snake]]\n\n[[Image:Simulacrum spider.png]] - [[List of arthropods#Spiders|Spider]]\n\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Undead holiness]]"}

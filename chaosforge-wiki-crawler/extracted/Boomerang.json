More damaging than [[stone]]s, but less so than [[javelin]]s, a skilled user can deal good damage. Boomerangs [[returning|return]] to the user; when throwing a boomerang, if it didn't [[mulch]], it returns back to the user. It cannot hit targets on the return trip. They are the largest throwing weapon that [[small]] races can use.\n\nBoomerangs have a 5% chance of [[mulch]]ing (breaking) when thrown. When a boomerang is mulched, it deals 33% more damage.\n\n==Strategy==\nIn the early game, boomerangs are useful finds. Even at 0 skill, throwing a boomerang is better than nothing. It can be used to soften up dangerous enemies like [[adder]]s, [[ogre (monster)|ogres]], or [[jelly|jellies]].\n\nBoomerangs remain useful to [[Throwing]] specialists throughout the game. \n*While [[javelin]]s are stronger throwables, they are limited by quantity. Boomerangs are more common, and can be used to conserve javelins.\n*Since boomerangs always return to you, you won't have to worry about picking ammo mid-fight. Plus, you can't toss boomerangs into [[deep water]] or [[lava]].\n*Throwing skill has a great impact on Throwing weapons' performance. If you have a high Throwing skill, even boomerangs can severely damage late game enemies.\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

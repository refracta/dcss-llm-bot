Eventually the status effect will end, dismissing all spirit wolves not currently in your [[line of sight]], and there is a fixed cap on how many spirit wolves you can face in a given game.\n\nThe following enemies cast Spirit Howl:\n*[[Spirit wolf]]\n\n==History==\nThis spell was added in [[0.13]], but only existed in wizard mode.

{"title":"Wasp","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wasp","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Wasps''' are fast, flying insects with an especially nasty [[poison]]ous sting; along with dealing damage over time, it also [[slow]]s you down until you're completely paralyzed. They are thankfully rare, only occasionally appearing in [[the Dungeon]], [[the Lair]], the [[Spider's Nest]], and [[the Swamp]] (often emerging from [[treant]]s or as [[spriggan rider]] mounts).\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They're almost harmless if you have poison resistance, but if not, try to take them out from range. They don't have that much HP by the time you meet packs of them.\n*Alternatively, their terrible [[magic resistance]] makes it easy to affect them with [[Hexes]] or [[status effect]]-inflicting [[wand]]s.\n*Wasps are vulnerable to poison, so [[Mephitic Cloud]] is almost guaranteed to render them confused and easy to defeat, and poison [[needle]]s will deal heavy damage to them quickly.\n\n==History==\n*Wasps were replaced with [[hornet]]s in [[0.19]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], this monster was known as ''yellow wasp''."}

This spell deals full damage regardless of how far a target is or how many targets are hit. As a spell dealing <code>BEAM_ELEC</code> damage, it also ignores half of any target's [[AC]].\n\nMonsters [[electricity resistance|who are immune to electricity]] are not considered targets, and do not extend the spell's area. Allies protected from harm (such as the [[Hepliaklqana]] ancestor or [[plant]]s under [[Fedhas]]) are also not targets.\n\n==Strategy==\nArcjolt can hit huge packs of clumped enemies. Remember that you'll be close to said enemies; don't get too greedy with your arcs. Helpful against packs of enemies, such as [[yak]]s and [[list of arachnids|spiders]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Arcjolt only hit targets that were 1 tile away from the caster or another target. However, allies protected from harm counted as targets.\n*Arcjolt was added in [[0.30]].\n*During its initial implementation, Arcjolt would conduct through metal walls with infinite range. In levels with metal walls, you could use Arcjolt to hit things from the other side of the floor."}

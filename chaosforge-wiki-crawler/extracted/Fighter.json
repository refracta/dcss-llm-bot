{"title":"Fighter","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fighter","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|Fighters usually start with a good weapon, a suit of heavy armour, a shield and a potion of might. They have a good general grounding in the arts of fighting.}}\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Hill Orc]], [[Minotaur]], [[Gargoyle]], [[Troll]], [[Armataur]] and [[Formicid]] are the recommended races if you pick a Fighter Background.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[weapon of choice]] ([[rapier]], [[flail]], [[war axe]], [[trident]], [[long sword]], or [[unarmed]])\n**[[Formicid]]s can choose to receive a [[quarterstaff]] (as it is one-handed to them).\n*+0 [[scale mail]]\n*+0 [[buckler]]\n*[[Potion of might]]\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nAdjusted for your species' aptitudes:\n*[[Fighting]]: 3\n*Chosen Weapon's Skill: 2\n*[[Armour (skill)|Armour]]: 3\n*[[Shields (skill)|Shields]]: 3\n\nChoosing Fighter adds 8 to your starting [[Strength]] and 4 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile Fighters may seem weak or \"generic\" compared to the more exotic [[backgrounds]], remember that your background is only your starting package. Unlike, say, [[Berserker]]s, Fighters are free to choose any god they like, like all those you cannot start the game with!\n\n==History==\n*Fighters were unchanged in the mostly-global background buff of [[0.29]] (they already had a potion of might).\n*Prior to [[0.28]], fighters started with a [[kite shield]] instead of a [[buckler]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], [[kobold]]s (and [[halfling]]s) started with a kite shield instead of a buckler.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], fighters did not start with a [[potion of might]] and most starting weapons were of a lower tier: [[short sword]] instead of [[cutlass]], [[mace]] instead of [[flail]], [[hand axe]] instead of [[war axe]], and [[falchion]] instead of [[long sword]]. They also started with 20 [[gold]].\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

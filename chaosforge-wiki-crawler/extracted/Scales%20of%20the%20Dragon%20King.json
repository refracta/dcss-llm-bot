In his time, titans and lesser dragons struggled with him in vain â€” but as with all things, even he was eventually cast down and undone.

Any character that doesn't care much about [[encumbrance]] will greatly appreciate this armour. While you can get better [[AC]] by enchanting a mundane set of GDS, using this artefact saves [[scrolls of enchant armour]] for other purposes. The willpower helps, too.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], this item was called the '''armour of the Dragon King'''.\n*This armour's [[encumbrance rating]] (along with all gold dragon scales in general) has eased from -27 (prior to [[0.14]]), and -25 (prior to 0.16), to its present rating of 23.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the armour of the Dragon King gave +50 [[MR]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

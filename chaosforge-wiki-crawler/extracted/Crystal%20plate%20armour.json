It has the highest base [[AC]] in the game, but also severe [[encumbrance]] penalties. It is very rare.\n\n==Strategy==\nFor a strong melee brute, crystal plate is a strong endgame armour. Many characters will prefer gold dragon scales' resistances, but GDS is similarly rare until you find [[golden dragon]]s to slay. For other characters, the encumbrance is too high - even [[extended]] characters will have trouble casting in it.\n\nBut, by the time you usually find crystal plate, you might've found a great [[artefact]] armour, or a highly [[enchant]]ed set of a 'lesser' armour ([[plate armour]], etc.). These tend to outperform a plain +0 crystal plate armour. Ending the game with a regular plate armour is perfectly reasonable.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the crystal plate armour's encumbrance rating was 24.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], crystal plate armour was known as crystal plate mail.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Crystal plate.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Crystal plate2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Crystal plate3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]\n|-\n| '''[[Orange crystal plate armour]]''' || [[File:Orange crystal plate armour.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

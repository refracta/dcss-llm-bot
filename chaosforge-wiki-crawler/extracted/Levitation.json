{"title":"Levitation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Levitation","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n'''Levitation''' is a [[status effect]] that lets you hover over the ground, ignoring most [[trap]]s, water, and [[lava]] tiles, and gaining a bonus to [[stealth]] and carrying capacity. However, it does come with some drawbacks: you are more vulnerable to the [[Airstrike]] spell, you cannot pick up items or butcher corpses, and you cannot descend [[stairs]] until the effect wears off. If you have the [[controlled flight]] [[intrinsic]], you will [[fly]] instead, allowing you to ignore the last two of those handicaps.\n\nYou can achieve levitation through a [[potion of levitation]], [[ring of levitation]], [[boots]] of [[levitation (ego)|levitation]] or some [[artifact]]s.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.10]], the [[Levitation (spell)|Levitation]] spell allowed you to levitate.\n\nIn [[0.12]], levitation was completely replaced with flight.\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]\n[[Category:Movement]]\n[[Category:Monster flags]]"}

{"title":"Swamp worm","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Swamp_worm","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of|worms}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Swamp worms''' are quick-acting, amphibious predators that can drag their enemies toward them. Their melee bite is nasty enough to be a threat to lightly-armored characters. They are common pests in [[the Swamp]], and appear in a handful of other water-themed [[vault]]s.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Thanks to Harpoon Shot, swamp worms can be big threats. They can pull you off the [[stairs]], and/or pull you towards a pack of dangerous enemies. If you get pulled into a bad situation, don't be afraid to burn consumables or use [[god]] abilities.\n*Due to their low [[willpower]], [[Hexes]] are very effective. A [[scroll of fear]] will prevent them from using Harpoon Shot.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.22]], they could not use [[Harpoon Shot]], but would [[submerge]] in water, rendering them invisible unless you were right next to them.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], they were unable to leave the water and follow you. They could also [[submerge]] again if you walked away from them."}

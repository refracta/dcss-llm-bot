The exact effect this has varies by aura.\n\n==Halo==\nHalo auras emanate forth from certain holy weapons, monsters, and characters. It has the following effects:\n*Negates [[invisibility]] of anything inside.\n*Makes everything inside easier to hit. Attackers gain <code>1 + 1d8</code> [[to-hit]] against anything inside. However, when players emit a halo, they aren't any easier to hit.\n*Players have their [[stealth]] reduced by a factor of x40%.\n\n'''Sources:'''\n*Worshipers of [[the Shining One]] receive a halo with range based on [[piety]] (very small to nearly your entire [[line of sight]])\n*Characters wielding an [[light|orb of light]] or the unrand artifact morningstar [[Eos]] receive a medium halo.\n*[[Wu Jian]]'s Heavenly Storm causes a 2-tile halo for its duration.\n*Most [[List of holy monsters|holy monsters]] have halos, the size of which depends on the monster in question. Weaker creatures like [[holy swine]] and [[sun moth]]s have tiny halos while powerful creatures like [[seraph]]im and [[ophan]]im have extremely large halos.\n\n==Umbra==\nThe opposite of a halo, umbras emanate forth from unholy angelic beings. It has the following effects:\n\n*Reduces the accuracy of all within the aura. [[Demon]]s, [[undead]], and worshippers of [[Dithmenos]] and [[Yredelemnul]] are immune to this effect.\n*When players emit an umbra, their [[stealth]] increases by a factor dependent on source. ×1.5 for the [[ring of Shadows]], ×1.0 to ×2.0 (depending on piety) for Dithmenos worshippers.\n*Allows use of Dithmenos' Shadow Step ability.\n*Negates the effect of any halo they overlap with.\n\n'''Sources:'''\n*[[Profane servitor]]s have a large umbra.\n*Wearers of the [[ring of Shadows]] have a medium umbra.\n*Worshipers of [[Dithmenos]] receive an umbra with range based on piety (very small to your entire line of sight)\n\n==Ring of Flames==\nThe [[Ring of Flames]] emanates one tile all around their source, creating [[flame cloud]]s. These clouds linger for a few turns even after the source moves away. It has the following effects:\n\n*Negates any [[Ice Magic]] that strikes the clouds.\n*Deals [[fire]] damage to anything standing in the clouds (but does not injure the source).\n\n'''Sources:'''\n*Players can wear the [[salamander hide armour]] to gain this aura.\n*[[Asmodeus]] has a permanent Ring of Flames aura surrounding him.\n\n==Polar Vortex==\nThe [[Polar Vortex]] aura emanates when you cast the spell of the same name. It has the following effects:\n\n*Deals heavy, partially irresistible cold damage to everything (except the source) within the aura.\n*Moves all affected targets (monsters, items, clouds, etc.) counterclockwise around the source each turn.\n\n'''Sources:'''\n*Players and monsters can cast the spell to temporarily gain this aura.\n*[[Diamond obelisk]]s and [[twister]]s have permanent Polar Vortex auras surrounding them.\n\n==Silence==\nWhen [[Silence]] auras emanate from a monster or the player, most creatures within the aura lose the ability to make any noise, including speech. This prevents:\n*Reading scrolls\n*Casting spells (all spells for the player)\n*Using [[god|divine]] abilities\n*[[T|Shouting]]\n\nMonsters are unable to use spells/abilities with the \"Wizard\", \"Divine\", or \"Vocal\" [[spell slot flag]]s. Monsters can use \"Magical\" or \"Natural\" abilities in silence (most [[demon]]s use \"Magical\" abilities, for instance).\n\nWhen players emit the aura, their [[stealth]] is reduced by 50.\n\n'''Sources:'''\n*Players can cast the [[Silence]] spell or use a [[scroll of silence]] to temporarily gain this aura.\n{{monsters with spell|Silence}}\nThe following enemy inherently radiates Silence:  \n* {{monsterlink|Silent spectre}} (as a permanent 12-tile aura, whether awake or [[dormant]])\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], [[Tornado]] was replaced with the cold themed, functionally similar [[Polar Vortex]].\n*In [[0.26]], the [[Ring of Flames]] spell and aura is now triggered by the [[salamander hide armour]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], [[Powered by Death]] gave regeneration from nearby corpses, relying on an aura to do so.\n*The [[Moth of suppression]] and [[Suppression]] auras were added in [[0.12]], and removed in [[0.14]]."}

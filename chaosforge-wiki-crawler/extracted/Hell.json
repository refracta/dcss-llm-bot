Few would go there voluntarily.\n\nThe Vestibule of Hell is guarded by Geryon, along with various denizens of each of the hells themselves.\n\nPortals to the Vestibule of Hell are found abundantly in the Depths.}}\n{{flavour|Welcome to Hell! Please enjoy your stay.}}\n'''Hell''' is a forbidding domain, crawling with demonic entities of all shapes and sizes. It is actually comprised of five separate branches: the [[Vestibule of Hell]] and its four sub-branches. \n\n==The Vestibule of Hell==\n[[File:Hell entry.png]] You're guaranteed to find multiple portals to the Vestibule throughout the [[Depths]], though there is a [[Lair]]:5 vault that has a portal to Hell.\n\n[[Geryon]], the three-headed gatekeeper of the Hells, always appears. He is accompanied by all sorts of demons. The unique [[curse skull]] [[Murray]] will also be there 25% of the time.\n\n==Hell's Branches==\nThere are four branches accessible from the Vestibule of Hell:\n*[[File:Gehenna entry.png]] [[Gehenna]], the [[fire]] branch, contains the obsidian rune of Zot.\n*[[File:Cocytus entry.png]] [[Cocytus]], the [[cold]] branch, contains the icy rune of Zot.\n*[[File:Tartarus entry.png]] [[Tartarus]], the [[undead]] branch containing [[negative energy]] damage, contains the bone rune of Zot.\n*[[File:Dis entry.png]] [[The Iron City of Dis]], the iron branch containing physical damage, contains the iron rune of Zot.\n\nEach branch of Hell is 7 levels deep. Floors 1-6 are all about a quarter the size of a regular floor, containing only one gateway out and downstair. Notice how there isn't an ''upstair'' - instead, there are portals leading directly to the Vestibule.\n\nThe final level of each houses a [[unique]], named [[demon]] lord protecting several treasure vaults, a [[rune of Zot]], and in some cases an [[unrandart]] weapon. These floors are often very large in comparison, even to regular dungeon floors.\n\nThe [[Zot clock]] is shared between the Vestibule and the four branches.\n\n===Hell Effects===\nEach Hell, excluding the Vestibule, will inflict a persistent effect on any who dare venture into them. \n*'''Gehenna''' prevents [[scroll]] use (-Scroll)\n*'''Cocytus''' prevents [[potion]] use (-Potion)\n*'''Tartarus''' halves [[willpower]] (Will/2)\n*'''Dis''' inflicts irresistible [[corrosion]] (Corr-8).\n\nThese effects last for as long as you remain in their respective Hell.\n\n===Hell's Mystical Force===\nIn Hell's branches, every time you go down a staircase, Hell's \"mystical force\" may lash out at you:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|stairs.cc|484}}</ref>\n*25% - A transient bad [[mutation]]\n*25% - Temporary [[stat drain]] (1-5 points of a random [[stat]])\n*25% - Temporary [[Drain|HP drain]] (~13.3% max HP)\n*25% - No effect\n\nIn addition to this, there is a 16.67% chance of making [[Noise | noise]] (loudness 15), unless you are [[silence]]d.\n\n[[Zin]] will sometimes protect you from the forces of Hell. The chance to prevent an effect scales linearly, up to a 50% chance at maximum (200) piety. In addition, Zin's mutation protection will work as normal, even if the initial prevention fails; this leads to a true rate of 62.5% to prevent an effect at max piety.\n\n==Strategy==\nHell is generally considered part of the [[extended game]]. You shouldn't intend to clear the four branches unless you want all 15 runes, or otherwise want a challenge.\n\nThat being said, most characters ready for [[Depths]] can complete the Vestibule in reasonable safety. This is often done for the [[Horn of Geryon]], obtained when you kill Geryon. For more details on completing the Vestibule, see [[Vestibule of Hell#Strategy|Vestibule of Hell]].\n\nIt technically isn't required to defeat Geryon to enter the four sub-branches, but it is recommended. A character who can't defeat Geryon probably isn't ready for the other Hell branches.\n\n===Clearing Hell Branches===\nYou may be tempted to 'dive' each of the hell branches, rushing straight to the downstairs. However, XP is used to cure the effects of Hell's mystical force. Thus, clearing the floors is recommended if possible. \n\nIdeally, you have high resistances to counteract each branch's element: rF+++ for Gehenna, rC+++ for Cocytus, rN+++ for Tartarus, and a little bit of everything for Dis. Weapons with the [[holy wrath]] brand are effective against all manners of demons and undead.\n\nThe portals out make [[stair dancing]] harder, but make escape easier. Should you take a nasty beating or realize you're under-prepared, simply take a portal back to the Vestibule, keeping whatever map knowledge you've had. Going back will make you experience more Hell effects, though.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Hell's Mystical Force happened over time, rather than when descending stairs.\n*The Hells received a rework in [[0.28]]; introducing many new monsters and the unique branch-wide forces of each Hell. Prior to this version, Hell's Mystical Force was slower, but more varied, with miscasts and monster spawns. In addition, Hell's floors were normal sized, with 3 stairs in each direction.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], players needed to evoke Geryon's horn to access the branches of Hell.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], a frequent Hell effect was banishment. This was replaced with Malign Gateway, mostly to reduce annoyance to the player.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{branches}}"}

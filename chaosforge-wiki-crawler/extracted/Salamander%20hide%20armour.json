{"title":"Salamander hide armour","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Salamander_hide_armour","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|Most salamanders' bodies are consigned to the fiery depths from which they sprang. Rarely, though, salamanders preserve the skins of those that have passed. The runes and decorations of the hide suggest that it once belonged to a respected warrior or priest - perhaps even a king. The fiery spirit remains in the skin, enhancing the fire magic of the wearer and surrounding them with a continous ring of flame. }}\n[[File:Salamander_hide_armour.png]] '''''the +3 salamander hide armour'''''\n\n+3 [[leather armour]]\n\n[[Fire resistance|rF++]]<br>\n[[Cold|rC--]]<br>\nSurrounds the wearer with a ring of flame [[clouds]]<br>\nEnhances [[Fire Magic]]<br>\nImmunity to flame clouds<br>\n\n==Mechanics==\nWhile worn, this armour grants the following additional effects:\n*Constantly spawns clouds of flame in the eight squares directly adjacent to the wearer. If the wearer moves, existing clouds that are no longer adjacent will linger for a few turns.\n*One [[spell enhancer]] for [[Fire Magic]], similar to a [[ring of fire|ring]] or [[staff of fire]].\n*Immunity to clouds of flame regardless of source. Walking into a square containing a cloud of flames while wearing the salamander hide armour will cause it to disappear.\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''salamander hide armour'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|922}}</ref> is a decent-to-good unrand for those focused on [[Dodging]] or spellcasting, in large part because of the flames.\n*Most early-game monsters will refuse to enter the flames, or are weak enough to get annihilated by them. This makes it easy to run away and [[kite]] melee enemies. Even as you progress, monsters like [[hydra]]s can waste turns trying to avoid the clouds, so you'll gain distance eventually.\n*Against tougher foes, the ring of flame deals significant damage in melee; the damage is the same as [[Freezing Cloud]], a level 5 spell.\nFire Magic specialists obviously benefit the most, but even users of Ice Magic can make good use of this armour.\n\nHowever, be wary of the armour's [[cold]] vulnerability. While flame clouds can absorb [[Throw Frost]], [[Bolt of Cold]] and other \"beams of pure ice\", it won't block partially physical beams like [[Throw Icicle]], [[Flash Freeze]], or [[iceblast]]. It also does nothing against [[:Category:Cold flavour|cold-flavoured]] melee attacks (though most icy creatures will melt in the flames). Depending on how many sources of cold resistance you've found, you may wish to use a different set of armour without such a glaring drawback.\n\nNote that the player's Ice Magic won't be affected by the flames; no player-castable Ice spell can be absorbed by flame clouds.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the salamander hide armour provided an evocable [[berserk]] instead of a [[Ring of Flames]] effect, and did not have cold vulnerability.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

It may fail to affect those who are already heavily mutated.}}\n\n'''Alter Self''' is a level 7 [[Transmutations]] spell which gives random [[mutation]], much like eating a fresh mutagenic chunk. This spell also damages your health, but could not kill you directly. You cannot cast this spell if your HP was too low.\n\n==Strategy==\nThis spell is tedious; the best way to use this spell is to go to the [[Temple]], cast it, cast [[Necromutation]] (so you don't starve), rest, and repeat, until you get a decent mutation set.\n\nAlternatively, you can [[Fulsome Distillation|distill]] a few mutation potions (gives more than 1 at a time), draw a [[Helix card]] (better chance of a good mutation), or worship [[Jiyva]], who tends to give good mutations and a way to get rid of bad mutations.\n\n==History==\n*Alter Self was removed in [[0.9]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

This benefit becomes less pronounced as your max HP rises, but its effect is always substantial. When natural healing is unavailable, the ring's effects are less impressive; [[deep dwarves]] and bloodless [[vampire]]s gain no HP regeneration whatsoever from wearing it, but it does help you recover from [[sickness]] significantly faster.\n\nHowever, this healing comes at a cost. Every turn that the ring provides any HP- or sickness-recovery effect, your metabolism is increased by 3 (twice that of the average character). This metabolism increase does not apply when you are at full health and not sick, so there's no need to fear it starving you when you don't even need healing. Also, characters that have no hunger clock to speak of ([[mummies]] and [[lichform]]) can wear them without fear, enjoying the benefits at no cost.\n\n==Desirability==\nSources of regeneration are generally very welcome. Reducing the time spent recovering between battles makes it less likely for new enemies to spawn on your current floor or find you while wandering, and is very welcome for players looking to maximize their [[score]]. Don't be afraid to swap it out for a needed resistance, however, if you suddenly find yourself facing down a particularly dangerous foe; regenerating a couple HP is much less critical than preventing a massive amount of damage in the first place.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.16]], the ring of regeneration was replaced with the [[amulet of regeneration]].\n\n[[Category:Ring]]"}

{"title":"Lava snake","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lava_snake","type":"raw","data":"{{version024}}\n{{list of | snakes}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Lava snakes''' are [[lava]]-dwelling [[list of snakes|snakes]] that spit [[fire]] at you if you come within their [[line of sight]], much like a fiery equivalent to [[electric eel]]s. They can be found anywhere that lava occurs except for the early portions of [[the Dungeon]], but are particularly common in [[Volcano]]s.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Lava snakes are weak to [[cold]], so [[Ice Magic]] or weapons of [[freezing]] work particularly well, but they're weak enough that any form of attack that doesn't involve [[fire]] will suffice.\n*Spit Lava is only partially resistible; fire resistance certainly helps, but won't render them entirely impotent.\n*They can't leave their lava pools. If things go south, don't hesitate to retreat out of their range."}

All effects have an equal chance to be selected.\n\nUsing a wand of random effects may risk [[penance]], depending on your [[god]]'s restrictions: all of the [[good god]]s punish [[draining]], [[Zin]] punishes [[malmutate|mutating]], [[Cheibriados]] punishes haste.\n\n==Strategy==\nIn most combat scenarios, this wand is risky. There's a good chance you harm the opponent, but you could also [[haste]] them or make them invisible. However, there are uses for random effects.\n\n*Random effects is best used on top of a [[stair]]case. If the wand does something damaging, good. If the wand ends up buffing your opponent, you can go up the stairs, rest, and the buff will wear off. Make sure to always leave at least 2 tiles of space before using the wand (since a hasted foe can move 2 spaces).\n*If you shoot at the further possible distance, you'll get multiple shots off. Even if you buff the enemy, the other shots may finish them off. You can use [[throwing net]]s, [[slow]], etc. to hinder enemy before firing the wand, making it relatively safe to use,\n*If you have charges to burn, you can aim at an unoccupied square adjacent to the monster, and not the monster itself. You will have a 15% chance of (only) fireball or iceblast, and an 85% chance of no effect.\n\nIn any case, always have an escape plan for the worst possible effect. Stairs are the best escape, as mentioned above, but you can use other things too.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Using the wand against an adjacent monster is almost never a good idea, given that the fireball and iceblast effects will harm you as well. For the same reason, always be aware of any potentially adjacent invisible creatures (eg, a newly invisible [[orc wizard]]).\n\n==History==\n*The wand of random effects was replaced with the [[piece from Xom's chessboard]] in [[0.27]].\n*In [[0.21]], [[malmutate]] was added to the random effects to discourage using the wand as a source of [[haste]] and [[invisibility]] in the late game.\n*It was completely reworked in [[0.20]] to the present list of effects, minus malmutate.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], wands of random effects could produce digging and disintegration.\n*Some wands were removed in [[0.18]], though the wand of random effects kept a few of the removed ones. As a result the chance to deal direct damage with a wand of random effects dropped by about 11%.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], gods would forgive the player for disliked effects produced by evoking an already identified wand of random effects.\n\n{{wands}}"}

{"title":"Warding","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Warding","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n'''Warding''' is an [[intrinsic]] that sometimes causes the melee and ranged weapon attacks of summoned monsters against you to fail:\n\n{{crawlquote|''(Monster) tries to attack you, but flinches away.''}}\n\nThe chance of the attack being prevented is based on the monster's [[magic resistance]]. Each attack forces a roll of the monster's MR vs. 1d60; if the monster's roll wins, the attack goes through as normal.\n\nHowever, it will not prevent summoned monsters from casting [[spell]]s or using abilities such as [[torment]] or [[hellfire]] against you. This makes it much more useful against such spells as [[Summon Horrible Things]] and [[Haunt]] than against [[Summon Greater Demon]], for example.\n\nWarding will not provide protection against monsters that are [[durably summoned]].\n\nWarding can be obtained through:\n*[[Amulet of warding]]\n*[[Staff of summoning]]\n*[[Macabre finger necklace]]\n*Some [[randart]]s\n\n==History==\n*Removed in [[0.18]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], warding didn't apply to ranged attacks.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], you could have up to two ranks of warding by wearing an amulet of warding while wielding a [[staff of summoning]]. Each rank of the old warding intrinsic was worth half of what current warding provides.\n\n[[Category:Intrinsic]]"}

{"title":"Soul eater","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Soul_eater","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Soul eaters''' are moderately powerful [[tier-3 demon]]s, boasting decent durability and an annoying [[line of sight]] draining attack. They can be found in [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], or created by [[Summon Demon]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Like an [[orc priest]], they can slowly whittle you down from behind their friends as you fight a group of enemies. \n*When fighting users of Summon Demon, it's often best to take out the summoner. Soul eaters have good durability and constantly steal HP, but killing the summoner causes the summon to vanish.\n*If you have full [[negative energy resistance|rN+++]], they are nothing more than boring melee attackers. Even with rN+, they become fairly weak monsters.\n*Soul eaters have surprisingly high [[willpower]]. All but the strongest hexes are likely to fail against them.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

Drinking the potion when already agile will increase the duration, but never to over 80 turns.\n\nAlthough the benefits of a potion of agility are less dramatic than those of a [[potion of might]], the added evasion can prove useful in combat against monsters with powerful physical attacks, and extra stealth is always welcome to stabbers, making it a fairly useful combat buff in the early- and mid-game.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.25]], potions of agility were replaced by [[potions of stabbing]].\n\n{{potions}}"}

{"title":"Killer Klown","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Killer_Klown","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Killer Klowns''' are powerful humanoid monsters found only in [[the Realm of Zot]]. Armed with highly enchanted and branded [[club]]s, they have decent [[HP]], the speed of an [[adder]], the sporadic [[blink]]ing of a [[blink frog]], and the ability to inflict various [[status effects]] by [[Throw Klown Pie|throwing pies]]:\n*[[Vertigo]]\n*[[Silence]]\n*[[Fire#Fire Vulnerability|Fire vulnerability]]\n*[[Potion of degeneration|Stat drain]]\n*Inability to drink [[potions]]\n*[[Fragile]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Despite them being one of the weaker Zot monsters \"on average\", do ''not'' take Killer Klowns lightly! They are deadly support monsters. Silence and -Potion prevent you from using most of your emergency escape options. If you've taken too much damage, losing access to [[scrolls of blinking]] and [[god|god abilities]] is practically a death sentence.\n*[[Repulsion]], [[shield]]s, and/or high [[EV]] can help prevent you from getting hit by Throw Klown Pie.\n*They have excellent willpower, but lack any elemental resistances, so it's not too hard to pile up damage. Try to blast them at range before they can reach you. They are weak to [[silver]], so silver [[javelin]]s are very effective.\n\n==Trivia==\nKiller Klowns were originally murderous extraterrestrial pranksters in the 1988 Academy AwardÂ® winning comedy horror sci-fi film, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_Klowns_from_Outer_Space Killer Klowns from Outer Space].\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Throw Klown Pie will be able to [[blind]] the player.}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Throw Klown Pie could polymorph the player into [[Bat Form]], [[Pig Form]], or [[Wisp Form]], instead of inflicting Fragile. This was notable as a major source of '''[[instant death]]'''. If you were [[teleport]]ed into [[Zot:5]]'s lungs, a klown could cause you to turn into a bat ''before you got a chance to move'', losing all your resistances. (You could then be [[paralysed]], mauled by an [[orb of fire]], etc.)\n*Killer Klowns gained Throw Klown Pie in [[0.23]]. Prior to that, Killer Klowns were unarmed and used a special Klown attack flavor that could choose randomly between [[Fire]], [[Cold]], [[Electricity]], [[Poison|Strong poison]], [[Slow|Drain speed]], [[Pain (brand)|Pain]], or [[Antimagic]]. Also, they had fast regeneration.\n*Prior to [[0.14]] Klowns had a different set of damage brands for their melee attack: [[fire]], [[cold]], nasty [[poison]], [[drain experience|drain XP]], [[rot]], [[blink]], [[anti-magic]]."}

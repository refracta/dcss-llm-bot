They have multiple attacks that can add up damage fast against lightly armoured opponents, but aren't particularly threatening otherwise. They can be found in [[the Dungeon]] and [[Lair]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nHippogriffs, like most \"natural\" creatures, are susceptible to [[poison]] and easy to [[Hexes|hex]].\n\n==History==\n*Hippogriffs were removed in [[0.26]].\n*In [[0.19]], they were merged with [[griffon]]s, which slightly buffed hippogriffs' HP and damage."}

{"title":"Goliath frog","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Goliath_frog","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Goliath frogs''' are [[acid]]ic amphibians that attack from [[reaching|two tiles away]], possibly [[corrode|corroding]] you. They are found primarily in the [[Swamp]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*A source of [[corrosion resistance]] is helpful, though you need not keep it on after killing the frogs -- you are unlikely to encounter other sources of acid damage in the Swamp.\n*Unlike most other threats in the Swamp, these frogs are not resistant to [[poison]]. [[Curare]] [[dart]]s or [[Mephitic Cloud]] work well to slow them down.\n\n==Trivia==\nMuch like real-life [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath_frog goliath frogs], Dungeon Crawl's goliath frogs lack vocal cords and are silent.\n\n==History==\n*Goliath frogs were added in [[0.26]]."}

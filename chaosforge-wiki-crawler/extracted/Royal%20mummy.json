{"title":"Royal mummy","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Royal_mummy","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|mummies}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Royal mummies''' are the most powerful and durable mummies, the bane of unprepared adventurers. They can [[torment]] you, have great HP, and cause the most powerful [[death curse]]s. They can be found in [[the Tomb]], on Tomb-themed [[Ziggurat]] floors, and in the company of [[Khufu]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Royal mummies are extremely dangerous: they can [[torment]] and smite from a safe distance, summon [[slow]]ing death scarabs, and have ''amazing'' durability. They'll often survive multiple casts of mid-power [[Fire Storm]], [[Ignition]], [[Shatter]], [[Dispel Undead]], etc., so it's tough to take them down quickly.\n*Catching them with [[Silence]] will shut down all of their spells, making them much more manageable.\n*Being [[undead]] (through [[Death Form]] or species) will take much of the sting out of their death curse.\n*For such a strong monster, they have decidedly a lackluster [[HD]] of 15. Unfortunately, their high [[willpower]] and undead resistances make this mostly irrelevant, but it does make them vulnerable to [[Zin]]'s Recite.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], royal mummies could have one of four possible spell sets:\n**[[Smiting]] (7-17), [[Symbol of Torment]], [[Summon Demon]], and [[Summon Emperor Scorpions]]\n**[[Smiting]] (7-17), [[Symbol of Torment]], [[Summon Demon]], and [[Summon Undead]]\n**[[Smiting]] (7-17), [[Symbol of Torment]], [[Summon Emperor Scorpions]], and [[Summon Scarabs]]\n**[[Smiting]] (7-17), [[Symbol of Torment]], [[Summon Mana Viper]], and [[Summon Undead]]\n*Prior to [[0.26]], royal mummies were known as '''greater mummies'''.\n\n[[Category:Mummy]]"}

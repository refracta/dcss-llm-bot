{"title":"Iron elemental","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Iron_elemental","type":"raw","data":"{{version023}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Iron elementals''' are lumbering brutes with powerful spells and significant melee capabilities. They only naturally occur in the [[Dungeon Sprint]] mode.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Iron elementals are thankfully very slow, and while their magic immunity and broad array of elemental immunities will make things difficult for casters, their physical defenses aren't insurmountable for a good melee fighter. Casters with non-elemental [[Conjurations]] should use those; [[Airstrike]] and [[Earth Magic]] such as [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] will also work.\n**Using Lee's Rapid Deconstruction will create blasts of metal shrapnel, which can deal heavy damage to anything next to the elemental.\n*Their spells, though damaging, have fairly short range. [[Kiting]] them is a decent strategy, considering their slow movement speed. A source of [[Repel Missiles|Repel]] or [[Deflect Missiles]] will also help, as will having high defenses.\n*High magic resistance will help you avoid getting slowed.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.18]], they could be summoned by [[the Iron Giant]], a [[unique]] [[stone giant]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], iron elementals could be found in [[Dis]] and a rare mid-game [[vault]].\n*Iron elementals were added in [[0.7]]."}

{"title":"Unbreathing","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Unbreathing","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Unbreathing''' creatures do not require air to survive. For monsters, these include [[undead]], [[nonliving]], and [[plant]]-type enemies. For players, being undead ([[Ghoul]], bloodless [[Vampire]], [[Mummy]]), a [[Gargoyle]] or [[Djinni]], or certain forms ([[Ice Form]], [[Statue Form]], [[Lich Form]], [[Tree Form]], or [[Wisp Form]]) makes you unbreathing.\n\nUnbreathing creatures are immune to [[engulf]] and [[asphyxiation|drowning]] damage. They are also immune to \"spore\" effects: the sleep of [[sleepcap]]s, and the confusion of [[ballistomycete spore]]s, [[wandering mushroom]]s, and players in [[Fungus Form]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], unbreathing gave explicit immunity to [[curare]]'s damage (but not the poison/slow), [[Mephitic Cloud]], poison clouds, and [[miasma]]/[[Sick]]ness. Note that most unbreathing monsters were already immune to these effects, due to their [[holiness]]. Also, grey [[Draconian]]s had unbreathing. (In 0.27, they gained amphibiousness, which allows them to resist drowning).\n*Prior to [[0.26]], unbreathing creatures were not immune to [[miasma]]."}

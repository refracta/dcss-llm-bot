They are conditioned to be insensitive to extreme amounts of pain, and can alert their brethren to an intruder's whereabouts with their howling cries.}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Anubis guards''' were humanoid defenders who tirelessly defend their [[list of mummies|mummy]] masters. Physically speaking, they hit rather hard, but were not particularly durable. However, they came with spells allowing them to seriously damage the undead and the unprotected living, and they could alert other monsters on the floor to your presence. Also, in spite of their living nature, they were immune to all sources of [[draining]] and [[torment]]. They could be found in [[the Tomb]].\n\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster3\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Hunting Cry]]\n|flags1={{Natural slot flag}}, {{No silent slot flag}}\n|slot2=[[Bolt of Draining]] (3d17)\n|flags2={{Natural slot flag}}, {{Breath slot flag}}\n|slot3=[[Dispel Undead]] (3d16)\n|flags3={{Priest slot flag}}\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Undead characters in the Tomb may have an easy time in many regards, but not against Anubis guards. Their Dispel Undead ignores all resistance and defensive traits, dealing anywhere from 3 to 48 damage per shot. You can disable this spell by either [[silence|silencing]] them or sending a summoned creature out to block its line of effect, but as a priest spell, [[antimagic]] weapons do not affect it.\n*If you're playing a living character, and you're in the Tomb, there's a good chance that you already have rN+++. If so, these foes are weaker than [[orc knight]]s with bad armour. If not, strongly consider leaving now; the Tomb is no place to wander in unprepared.\n\n==History==\n*Anubis guards were removed in [[0.19]].\n*Anubis guards were added in [[0.16]]."}

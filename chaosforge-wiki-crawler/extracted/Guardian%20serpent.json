{"title":"Guardian serpent","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Guardian_serpent","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | snakes}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Guardian serpents''' are dangerous support units. They can deal moderate damage on their own, but the real danger lies in [[Blink Allies Encircling]], sending its allies to the tiles adjacent to you. You can end up surrounded very quickly. They are common in [[Snake Pit]], and occasionally show up in the [[Desolation of Salt]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Being surrounded is extremely dangerous. When surrounded, your normal escape paths are cut off. Since nagas [[constrict]], even a [[scroll of blinking]] can fail to get you out. And, even for the toughest [[Axes]] users, taking 8 attacks per turn isn't fun.\n**Try to limit the number of free spaces around you. If you're standing in a hallway or corner, you might take only 2-3 attacks per turn rather than 8. Also, being surrounded by [[allies]] ([[summon]]s, [[Kiku]]'s Unearth Wretches...) means you can't be surrounded by enemies.\n**In Desolation, being encircled by creatures means high damage from [[Resonance Strike]].\n*Blink Allies Encircling can bring any monster in the ''caster'''s [[line of sight]] adjacent to you (not the player's LOS). This means that a guardian serpent can bring in monsters you didn't know about.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], they knew [[Teleport Other]] and [[Minor Healing]] in place of [[Blink Allies Encircling]]."}

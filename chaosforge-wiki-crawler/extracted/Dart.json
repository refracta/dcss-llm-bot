In addition to throwing skill, stealth skill improves the chance for a dart to affect its target.}}\n\n'''Darts''' are [[Throwing]] weapons designed to incapacitate foes, inflicting various [[status effect]]s. They may be found on the Dungeon floor or in the possession of some monsters ([[kobold (monster)|kobolds]] and [[spriggan rider]]s).\n\nDarts come with the following [[brand]]s:\n*'''[[Poisoned]]'''\n*'''[[Curare]]''' - inflicts heavy poison, [[slow]]s, and deals direct damage on impact\n*'''[[Datura]]''' - sends target berserk and [[neutral]], causing them to attack whatever's closest\n*'''[[Atropa]]''' - [[blind]]s and may briefly [[confusion|confuse]] target\n\n[[Undead]] and [[nonliving]] creatures are immune to all darts. Different brands of darts work differently:\n\n*Poisoned and curare darts always inflict their statuses against any target without [[poison resistance]].\n*Atropa and datura have a chance to inflict their statuses, increased by your [[Throwing]] and [[Stealth]] skills, and decreased by the target's [[HD]].\n:The chance is <code>100 - 100 * (HD - 2) / (4 + pow)</code>%, where <code>pow = (Throwing + Stealth) * 2 / 3</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|throw.cc|243}}</ref> For monsters with [[HD]] < 15, there's a minimum chance of 3% for success.\n\nWhen thrown, poisoned darts have a 8.33% chance to [[mulch]], destroying the dart. The other three brands instead have a doubled chance (to 16.66%).\n\n==Strategy==\nIn the early game, darts can be useful for all character types. Poisoned darts can be used to soften enemies up, curare [[slow]]s enemies, and atropa/datura darts are likely to inflict their statuses (even at little skill).\n\nAs the game progresses, most darts become less useful. By the late game, poison darts don't do a lot of damage. And if you don't have high Throwing and/or Stealth, atropa and datura are unlikely to succeed. But curare remains useful for just about anyone - it can slow dangerous enemies, like [[ettin]]s, [[juggernaut]]s, and even [[Antaeus]], making them weaker and easier to escape from. \n\nSneaky [[stab]]bers can benefit a lot from the two stealth darts, even late game. Their quantity is limited, however.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

{"title":"Toadstool","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Toadstool","type":"raw","data":"{{version021}}\n\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Toadstools''' are harmless, fragile [[:Category:Plant holiness|plants]] which only appear when the player worships [[Fedhas Madash]]. If a follower uses their Fungal Bloom ability in line of sight of a corpse, toadstools will grow on it and nearby (depending on the size of the corpse), instantly turning the corpse into a skeleton. The toadstools then die after some time has passed.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*This is the best way to gain piety for Fedhas worshippers. If you follow Fedhas, pray for every corpse you don't plan on eating. The more exotic [[Necromancy|necromantic]] uses of corpses are forbidden by Fedhas anyway.\n*You can use Fedhas' Evolution ability to turn toadstools into [[wandering mushroom]]s. This can be especially effective if you evolve a toadstool adjacent to a monster. \n*Alternatively, the fact that monsters can't move through them allows them to serve as roadblocks, slowing a monster's pursuit. But remember that walking through a toadstool will take 50% longer for you than walking over open spaces; this means you might get hit while retreating through the toadstools.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.12]], toadstools would appear regardless of your character's religion. As corpses rotted, they would occasionally generate toadstools independent of your actions."}

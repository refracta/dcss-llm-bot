{"title":"Iguana","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Iguana","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Iguanas''' are fairly straightforward melee attackers that are easily underestimated; their bite deals surprisingly high damage, and they are a common killer of low-level characters. Apart from that, they have no distinguishing features. They can be found in the early portions of [[the Dungeon]] and in [[the Lair]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you encounter one early on and are built for anything but heavily armoured melee combat, try to soften them up at range before they can reach you. A couple bites can take out a careless caster.\n*Characters with [[Freeze]] or a weapon of [[freezing]] can [[slow]] iguanas down, making it easier to kite them.\n*By the time you see the Lair, iguanas should be old news. You can stop worrying about them and start worrying about [[yak]]s, [[cane toad]]s, and [[hydra]]s."}

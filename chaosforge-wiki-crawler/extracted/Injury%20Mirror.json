{"title":"Injury Mirror","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Injury_Mirror","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Reflects damage taken for a short duration, hurting attackers whenever any damage is taken.}}\n\n'''Injury Mirror''' is a monster-only spell which causes any damage inflicted on the caster to also be inflicted on the attacker. This damage is not affected by any resistances you have: whatever damage the caster takes, you take too. In console, the caster's glyph will change colors while this is in effect, and it lasts for 7-9 turns.\n\nNote that you can be killed by reflected damage, for example, when [[stab]]bing a death knight.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==Strategy==\nWhen fighting death knights, pay close attention to them in case they activate Injury Mirror. Do your best to take them out before they can start reflecting damage; if they can put their shield up, focus your fire elsewhere or retreat in the meantime. Alternatively, summoned allies can fight them for you, but this will chew through your army quickly.\n\nBe aware that Mirror Damage can affect you even if the caster is out of your [[line of sight]]. Be ''extremely'' cautious using high-level spells while fighting enemies with Mirror Damage, especially ones that leave lingering damage effects like [[Freezing Cloud]] or [[Polar Vortex]]. Even if you hit them while their shields are down, they could raise them at any point during your spell's duration. Area-of-effect spells might also strike them while they're off-screen, particularly in the case of spells like [[Fire Storm]]. Damage from [[Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling]] '''won't''' be reflected back, though.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], worshippers of [[Yredelemnul]] had access to a similar ability, Pain Mirror.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], this spell was known as Mirror Damage.\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

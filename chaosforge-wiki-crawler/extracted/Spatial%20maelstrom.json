{"title":"Spatial maelstrom","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spatial_maelstrom","type":"raw","data":"{{version017}}\n{{list of | vortices}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Spatial maelstroms''' are a more advanced form of [[spatial vortex]], no longer [[confused]] and capable of creating new spatial vortices by consuming [[wall]]s and converting their matter into chaos (this randomly affects adjacent walls, and always affects walls they move into). Their better-than-[[spriggan]] speed, wall destruction, and rapid [[distortion]] hits make them high-profile threats within the branch, and almost impossible to escape on foot. They only appear in [[the Abyss]] and Abyss-themed [[Ziggurat]] floors - any other [[branch]] will quickly expel maelstroms back to the Abyss, even when generated via [[Lugonu]]'s Corruption ability.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Spatial vortices are surprisingly rare in the Abyss outside of one exit vault and one rune vault. As such, seeing multiple spatial vortices wandering around might indicate the presence of a maelstrom beyond your field of vision, and is therefore your cue to consider going a different direction.\n*Their distortion attacks can chew through your [[HP]] rapidly, send you into the more dangerous levels of the Abyss, or suddenly [[teleport]] you into unknown and potentially occupied terrain at low health. This, paired with their breeding habits and their speed, makes them top-priority threats; feel free to use consumables or heavy magic.\n*If possible, try to lure them into wide open areas to reduce the number of spatial vortices they can produce. More often than not, however, you won't find them until they've already devoured a section of the Abyss.\n\n==History==\nSpatial maelstroms were added in [[0.12]]."}

It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''falchion''' is the lightest of the long blades, dealing less damage than the others in exchange for a slight boost to accuracy. It can be selected as a starting weapon for many [[background]]s.\n\n==Strategy==\nFalchions have the best weapon stats of any \"simple\" starting weapon, just above the [[mace]]. Note that [[spear]]s will end up being better against single targets, due to their [[reaching]]. One (dis)advantage of [[Long Blades]] is that they scale with [[dexterity]] rather than [[strength]]. As a result, they are relatively better for a [[Dodging]]-focused character.\n\nUnless you find an exceptionally useful [[artifact]] falchion, you should upgrade to something else quickly. \n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Falchion1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Falchion2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Falchion3.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], Long Blades lost [[riposte]]. Damage was increased back to pre-riposte levels.\n*In [[0.19]], Long Blades gained riposte. Falchions were reduced by 1 base damage to compensate.\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Long blades]]"}

It is a one-handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Slings''' are one-handed [[Ranged Weapons]]. They are the lightest ranged weapon, and much more common than the other ranged one-hander, [[hand crossbow]]s.\n\n==Strategy==\nGenerally, a D:1 character with a sling is stronger than the same character without one. Slings let you attack from range for 0 MP, which is nice for both melee and mage starts. You don't need to train Ranged Weapons to benefit from one. Even at 0 skill, firing a sling at a melee enemy will net some extra damage (enough to outright kill D:1 enemies). Past [[Lair]] or so, the damage from an untrained sling is too low to bother with.\n\nCompared to other ranged options, slings are the weakest [[ranged weapon]]. They are stronger than [[stone]]s and slightly stronger than [[boomerang]]s at 0 skill (though boomerangs scale better with skill). [[Shortbow]]s offer +1 base damage and more accuracy, but you can't wield a shield with one.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Sling 1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Sling 2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Sling 3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]\n|-\n| '''[[Punk]]''' || [[File:Urand punk.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], hunting slings were renamed back into slings, with the removal of the [[Slings (skill)|Slings skill]] and [[fustibali]]. They now use Ranged Weapons skill. Also, prior to this version:\n**Hunting slings required use of [[stone]]s or [[sling bullet]]s, which added 2 or 4 damage to your shots.\n**They had an accuracy of +2 and a base delay of 12 (mindelay of 6).\n**Their damage did not scale with [[DEX]] and their attack speed wasn't slowed down by [[encumbrance rating|armour encumbrance]], like all ranged weapons.\n*In [[0.15]], slings were renamed into [[hunting sling]]s, with the addition of [[greatsling]]s (fustibali). Ranged combat also worked differently; they had 0 base damage, which was improved by their ammo.\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Slings]]"}

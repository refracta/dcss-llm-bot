They inflict less damage than other similar bolts, but their damage partially bypasses armour and they can be bounced off walls to hit targets twice.}}\n\nA '''wand of lightning''' is one of the more powerful attack [[wand]]s in the game, capable of launching deadly [[lightning bolt]]s at your opponents. These can strike multiple enemies without losing range, and will bounce off rock or stone [[wall]]s, potentially hitting enemies multiple times. Just be aware that its possible to hit yourself this way! Also, these wands generate a lot of [[noise]] (more than twice as much as [[shout]]ing), so don't be surprised if using it wakes up nearby monsters. It can hold at most 15 charges.\n\n==Strategy==\nIf you can't fire this wand at an enemy without zapping yourself, use the \"'''.'''\" key to fire at its tile. This will cause the bolt to end once it hits the desired point, rather than travelling for its entire possible range. You won't be able to benefit from the bounce, but at least you won't be electrocuted.\n\n==History==\nWands of lightning were removed in [[0.21]].\n\nPrior to [[0.20]], it was possible to break [[mesmerisation]] by zapping a wand of lightning.\n\n{{wands}}"}

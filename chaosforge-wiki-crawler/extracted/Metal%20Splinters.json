{"title":"Metal Splinters","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Metal_Splinters","type":"raw","data":"{{version023}}\n{{flavour|Fires a directed stream of sharp metal splinters. Its damage is strongly reduced by armour.}}\n\n'''Metal Splinters''' is a monster-only spell which blasts you with a cloud of shrapnel, dealing heavy ranged physical damage (reduced by AC thrice). Unlike many other types of breaths, it is not a [[bolt spell]] - it can only hit 1 target.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*In very early, pre-''DCSS'' versions of ''Crawl'', this was a player-castable level 8 pure [[Conjurations]] spell (though the name was then '''Throw Splinters'''). Notably, it was a penetrating bolt, dealt pure physical damage, and bypassed enemy evasion. It was replaced in ''Crawl'' 2.7 with [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

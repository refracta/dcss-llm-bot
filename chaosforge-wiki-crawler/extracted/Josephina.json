{"title":"Josephina","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Josephina","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''For the unique found earlier in the game, see [[Josephine]]. Also see [[Joseph]].''\n{{list of|liches}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Josephina the Ice-Lich''' is a [[unique]] [[lich]], who comes with powerful [[simulacra]] that she can then [[Seracfall|blow up]]. She always spawns with a [[randart]] [[ring of ice]].\n\nJosephina is an alternate version of [[Josephine]]. If Josephine has spawned, then Josephina won't, and vice-versa.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Crypt]]\n*[[The Depths]]: 2-4\n*[[Realm of Zot]]: 1-4\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Cold resistance]] is obviously very helpful -- get as much as you can. Simulacra hit hard, and that's before they start violently exploding in your face. Even her melee can deal high amounts of cold damage.\n**[[Negative energy resistance]] is also helpful against Ghostly Fireball, though that's of a lower priority.\n*In order to cast her devasting [[Seracfall]] spell, Josephina needs [[line of sight]] with a simulacrum:\n**If you can lure or otherwise separate the simulacra away from her, all the better.\n**You can also block ''her'' [[line of sight]] (e.g. with a [[scroll of fog]]) to prevent the spell from being cast.\n**She can't use Seracfall with a player-allied simulacra, so don't be afraid to cast the [[Simulacrum]] spell around her.\n**[[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] can be used to blow up her own simulacra in her face.\n*Like any other lich, all of Josephina's spells are completely shut down by [[Silence]]. Unlike regular liches, however, she can deal significant melee damage (42 physical + 63 cold damage) if you don't have good cold resistance.\n\n==History==\n*Josephina was introduced in [[0.29]]."}

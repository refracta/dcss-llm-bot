{"title":"Draconian stormcaller","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Draconian_stormcaller","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | draconians}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Draconian stormcallers''' are priests of [[Qazlal]] that employ the aid of smaller dragons, such as [[death drake]]s, [[swamp drake]]s, [[komodo dragon]]s, and [[fire drake]]s, as well as Qazlal's upheaval ability and [[smiting]]. Randomly generated stormcallers are [[white draconian]]s, complete with a [[Cold Breath]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Death drake]]s should always be your biggest concern among the summons. However, you'll probably want to focus most of your attention on the stormcaller, as killing it will stop the influx of reinforcements.\n**[[Qazlal]]'s own cloud immunity, [[Zin]]'s Vitalisation, and being [[undead]] can protect you from their [[miasma]].\n*Smite-targeted attacks such as [[Airstrike]] or [[Freezing Cloud]] are ideal for nailing stormcallers that are hanging out in the middle of a pack of other draconians. [[Bolt spells]] can also punch through anything standing between you and the caller.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|stormcallers will be immune to their own Upheaval.}}\n*Prior to [[0.28]], classed draconians could have varying elemental flavours.\n*In [[0.20]], [[draconian zealot]]s and [[draconian caller]]s were merged into draconian stormcallers, who retain the smiting of draconian zealots, summon drakes ability of draconian callers, and have a new divine ability identical to Qazlal's 2* Upheaval ability. Draconian callers had [[summon dragon]] instead of upheaval and smiting."}

He made a human figure of clay, and left a small aperture in the lesser brain in which he laid a parchment with the unutterable name of God written on it. The clod immediately arose and was a man; he performed all the duties of a servant for his creator, he fetched water, and hewed wood. All through the Jews quarter he was known as the Golem of the great Rabbi Löw. Every Friday evening the Rabbi took the parchment out of his head, and he was clay until Sunday morning. Once the Rabbi forgot this duty, all were in the Synagogue, the Sabbath hymn was begun, when all the women and children in the assembly started and screamed out, ‘the Golem! the Golem is destroying everything!’ The Rabbi ordered the precentor to pause at the end of the prayer: it was yet possible to save all, but later nought would avail, the whole world would be destroyed. He hastened home, and saw the Golem already seizing the joists of his house to tear down the building: he sprang forward, took the parchment out, and dead clay again lay at his feet.”<br>\n-Berthold Auerbach, _Spinoza_. 1882}}\n<!--monster-bot-end-->\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Clay golems''' are slow-moving, non-living monsters that are absolutely immune to all enchantment magic and most elemental magic. Fortunately, they don't hit too hard in melee, and non-elemental [[Conjurations]] still affect them just fine. They are uncommonly encountered in the [[Dungeon]] and may appear in [[Volcano]]es.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nExtremely fragile characters should take advantage of their slow speed and [[kite]] them. Otherwise, they're not too threatening.\n\n==History==\nClay golems were removed in [[0.14]]. The flesh golem in Cigotuvi's wizlab which used to be a variant of a clay golem, was replaced with an [[iron golem]].\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

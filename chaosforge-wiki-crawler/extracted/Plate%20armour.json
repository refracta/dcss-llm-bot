It provides excellent protection.}}\n\n'''Plate armour''' is the heaviest common body armour, providing excellent defense in exchange for [[encumbrance]] (reducing ability to [[spell failure|cast spells]], [[ev]]ade attacks, and fire [[Ranged Weapons]]). Commonly found on monsters, you are virtually guaranteed to find at least one set by the time you've cleared the [[Orcish Mines]].\n\nPlate armour is one of two armour types capable of generating with the [[ponderousness]] [[ego]].\n\n==Desirability==\nPlate is often the heaviest armour available, so it's good for strong melee characters. A well-enchanted plate armour with a useful [[ego]] (such as [[fire resistance]]) can serve for the entire 3-rune game. At the very least, heavy fighters won't have better alternatives for a long time.\n\nAlternatives do exist:\n*If you want to branch out into a hybrid fighter/caster, you'll want to switch to a lighter suit of [[dragon scales]].\n*Pure-strength characters may eventually end up in [[gold dragon scales]] or [[crystal plate armour]], which are heavier, but provide even more AC.\n*In any case, both [[storm dragon scales]] and [[shadow dragon scales]] are direct upgrades to a plain, +0 plate armour.\nCompared to the above, plate armour has the time advantage - you can find it earlier. Waiting for a better set of armour means waiting to use your [[scrolls of enchant armour]], which means making your character weaker ''right now''. As mentioned, if you find a plate armour with a good [[ego]], it may be wise to stick with it for the entire game.\n\nIn [[shop]]s, plate armour is 4x as expensive as [[chain mail]]. Buying a [[randart]] chain mail can be more cost-effective than plate.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the encumbrance rating was 19.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], plate armour was known as plate mail.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Plate1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Plate2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Plate armour3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrand]]art<br>Plate armour\n|-\n| '''[[Maxwell's Patent Armour]]''' || [[File:Maxwell's patent armour.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

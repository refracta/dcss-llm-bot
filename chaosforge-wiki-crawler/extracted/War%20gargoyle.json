{"title":"War gargoyle","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/War_gargoyle","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of|constructs}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''War gargoyles''' are significantly deadlier than any of their [[List of constructs#Gargoyles|gargoyle]] brethren, capable of blasting you with deadly shrapnel. They can be occasionally found in [[the Vaults]] (often with [[peacekeeper]]s), and sometimes found in [[the Iron City of Dis]] and near its [[Vestibule of Hell|entrance]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Metal Sprinters deals high damage, enough to two-shot many characters entering the Vaults, though it is thrice reduced by [[AC]], and it is subject to a [[Breath]] cooldown.\n*War gargoyles can be dangerous alone, but they usually spawn with [[peacekeeper]]s (inflicts [[might]]) and [[crystal golem]]s (another high damage, high AC enemy).\n*They are weak to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]].\n\n==History==\n*War gargoyles were added in [[0.14]]."}

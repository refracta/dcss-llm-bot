{"title":"Unseen horror","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Unseen_horror","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Unseen horrors''' are fast monsters that are naturally and permanently [[invisible]]. Like [[bat]]s, they constantly move around. They usually appear in mid-[[Dungeon]]; an [[out of depth]] unseen horror can appear as early as D:5.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Unseen horrors are batty - they'll hit you, move away to a random tile, and repeat. Because they are so fast, they'll complete this cycle multiple times. Because they are invisible, it's hard to track their location (unless you have see invisible).\n*Without see invisible, unseen horrors can be quite difficult. In addition to being harder to track, invisible monsters are harder to hit and more likely to hit you.\n**Conversely, if you have see invisible (via [[ring of see invisible|ring]], [[helmet]], [[Good mutations#Acute Vision|mutation]], or being a [[Naga]], [[Spriggan]], [[Felid]], or [[Vampire]]), unseen horrors shouldn't be an issue.\n*If you don't have SInv, the following can be effective:\n**[[Scroll of poison]]: Unseen horror are batty, so they'll skitter into the poison clouds, which will quickly finish the monster off.\n**Attacks that don't miss: Spells like [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] and [[Fireball]] don't miss, so the accuracy penalty does not matter.\n**If an unseen horror is in a [[cloud]], it's much easier to detect its location. Other than a scroll of poison, [[scroll of fog]] or [[Mephitic Cloud]] can be used to see its position. Mephitic Cloud can also confuse the unseen horror, turning it nearly harmless.\n*Swinging or casting wildly at a target you cannot see (and that will not stay still) is generally a waste of time. You can greatly increase your odds of hitting an unseen horror by luring it into a hallway, so you at least know which direction it'll be in. Better yet, try to lure it in with a [[rat]] or some other weak monster coming in behind it. If you can pin it in place, that gets rid of a lot of its advantage. Attack it with Ctrl+direction (or *+direction).\n*Fleeing is sometimes the wisest choice, and actually not too hard to do. [[Blink]]ing or [[teleport]]ing away is an excellent temporary method, and since unseen horrors cannot open [[door]]s and tend to move away after hitting you, it's easy to run and then leave them locked in a small chamber or on the other side of the level. Failing that, you can usually lure them up a floor and then escape back down without them pursuing (though it may take a few tries). Their low [[willpower]] means a [[scroll of fear]] can get them to temporarily flee you.\n**Unseen horrors cannot [[fly]], so if you have [[deep water]] or [[lava]] nearby, use them for an escape.\n*Worshipers of [[Cheibriados]] who can reliably invoke [[Cheibriados#Given Abilities|Slouch]] should do so if they are attacked by an invisible opponent; an unseen horror will generally die in one application.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.2]], unseen horrors were resistant to [[electricity]]."}

{"title":"Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Maxwell%27s_Capacitive_Coupling","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling''' ('''MCC''') is a Level 8 [[Air Magic]] spell that always kills the closest enemy, regardless of its current health, resistances, or defenses, after a few turns. \n\n==Useful Info==\nMCC charges for a few turns, during which you must [[wait]]. Afterwards, it kills the closest enemy. It may also create harmless, transparent [[cloud]]s around the target. No monster is immune to this spell. If two or more creatures are equally close, the target is chosen at random. \n\nThe charging period lasts <code>30 + (1d(200 - spellpower) - 1) / 50</code> [[aut]] (i.e., 3-7 normal speed turns).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-damage.cc|4338}}</ref> The spell will be interrupted if you do any action other than waiting, or if you become [[Silence|silenced]].\n\nWhile charging, the status light {{LightBlue|Charge-|}} cycles counterclockwise. However, the cycle starts and ends at random positions, so you can't tell when the spell will activate.\n\n==Strategy==\nMaxwell's Capacitive Coupling is an immensely powerful spell. It can instantly kill ''any'' enemy in 3-7 turns. For a matter of perspective, [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] may kill a tough enemy in 3 casts - that's 3 turns, but it costs 24 MP instead of 8, and crystal spears can miss. Great spell for Air Magic specialists, since it ignores enemy resistances. \n\nThe downside of this spell is that you can't aim it. [[Summon]]ers can surround you with misleading targets, causing you to waste the charge. You can fight important summoners in corridors or [[kill hole]]s to reduce the chance of a misfire.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*You can use autofight to automatically charge this spell. (If MCC is currently charging, autofight will input a wait command for you.)\n*The effect will fire straight through your own allies. You can hide behind summons, who will fight for you as you charge up this spell.\n*You can start charging this spell when enemies are out of [[LOS]]. Enemies only need to be in LOS on the turn it fires.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling didn't create harmless [[cloud]]s on activation.\n*Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling was added in [[0.27]], replacing [[Absolute Zero]].\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

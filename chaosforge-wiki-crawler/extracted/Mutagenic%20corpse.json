{"title":"Mutagenic corpse","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mutagenic_corpse","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\nEating flesh from a '''mutagenic corpse''' grants a living character a random [[mutation]]. Eating mutagenic flesh provides no [[nutrition]].\n\nIf you feel like gambling with mutations, you can try scarfing down every mutagenic corpse-leaving monster you cross paths with ([[sky beast]]s and [[ugly thing]]s are the more common examples). This is quite risky, as some mutations can easily doom a promising character. Alternatively, you can use mutagenic corpses as makeshift [[potion of cure mutation|potions of cure mutation]] if you've accumulated several [[bad mutation]]s; it's still risky, but you might end up better off than you were.\n\n==History==\n*Mutagenic chunks were removed in [[0.21]].\n*In [[0.12]], [[Fulsome Distillation]] was removed, meaning players could no longer use mutagenic corpses to create [[potions of mutation]].\n\n[[Category:Mutations]]\n[[Category:Mutagenic corpse]]\n[[Category:Hunger]]"}

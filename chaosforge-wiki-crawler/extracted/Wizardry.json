These are provided by [[ring of wizardry|rings]] and the [[demonspawn mutation]] [[Big Brain]].\n\nIf you have at least one source of wizardry, your [[Spell Success#Modifiers|raw spell failure]] is multiplied by <code>6 / (7 + sources)</code>. This is applied after calculating spell failure from skills and other modifiers, though failure is modified by a [[Spell_Success#Final Step|further modifier]]. There is no limit to the number of wizardry you can have.\n\nIf you worship [[Vehumet]], the raw spell failure of [[Vehumet#Destructive spells|destructive spells]] is further multiplied by 2/3. This is roughly equivalent to 2 sources of wizardry if don't have any. Note that this bonus is ''not'' considered as 2 sources of wizardry; it is a multiplier applied after wizardry is calculated.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" border=1\n|-\n!Wizardry!!Raw Fail Multi.!!Wizardry!!Raw Fail Multi.\n|-\n|Wizardry x1 || 75%\n|||\n|-\n|Wizardry x2 || 66.67%\n|Vehumet || 66.67%\n|-\n|Wizardry x3 || 60%\n|Vehumet + Wiz x1 || 50%\n|-\n|Wizardry x4 || 54.55%\n|Vehumet + Wiz x2 || 44.4%\n|-\n|Wizardry x5 || 50%\n|Vehumet + Wiz x3 || 40%\n|}\n\nGenerally, the actual decrease to failure rate will be ''larger'' than the raw decrease.<ref>This is true, at the very least, when your (post-wizardry failure rate) < 50%. The smaller the failure, the smaller the % multiplier (keep in mind that it ''is'' a multiplier).</ref> For example, wizardry x1 will bring actual failure rates from 80% -> 45% (×56%), 50% -> 22% (×44%), or 15% -> 6% (×37.5%).\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Spell success#Modifiers|Spell success]] for details on how wizardry affects failure rate.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], there was a raw failure multiplier cap of 50%. This meant you could only have 5 sources of wizardry apply at once, or Vehumet and 1 source of wizardry.\n*Big Brain was introduced in [[0.27]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], [[staff of wizardry|staves of wizardry]] existed, which gave a rank of wizardry.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], [[potion of brilliance]] provided a temporary wizardry bonus.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], a staff of wizardry granted a better wizardry bonus than a [[ring of wizardry]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Magic]]"}

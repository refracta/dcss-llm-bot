{"title":"Lom Lobon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lom_Lobon","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Lom Lobon''' is a [[unique]] [[Pandemonium lord]] and guardian of the magical [[rune]]. It packs some powerful [[cold]], [[Air magic|wind]], and [[electricity]] damage spells, the most powerful [[healing]] spell in the game, and keeps a number of [[wizard (monster)|wizard]]s and [[blizzard demon]]s on hand. You can find Lom Lobon on a dedicated [[Pandemonium]] floor, which has grey floors and white [[wall]]s.\n\nIn [[Dungeon Sprint]] \"Red Sonja\", Lom waits in the last room in front of the Orb of Zot chamber.  \n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Lom Lobon might not have the raw resilience of the other pan lords, but Major Healing can make it very difficult to kill Lom quickly. They'll attempt to blink away and cast either Glaciate, Polar Vortex, or Conjure Ball Lightning when you get too close. Have rC++ at least, preferably rC+++, and definitely rElec before facing them.\n*Lom Lobon is generally easier for melee fighters to deal with. Lom's antimagic attack can cripple casters, but is negligible to an aromoured fighter. A [[potion of attraction]] can counter Lom's Blink Away, though watch for the usual risks with this potion. The usual [[haste]] and [[might]] are also recommended, if you can spare the potions. \n**Weapons of [[holy wrath]] will do very heavy damage, though weapons of [[antimagic]] can cripple Lom Lobon's spellcasting, which is the most threatening aspect of the fight. Either one is a good choice.\n*If you can't swim, it's recommended to have some source of [[flight]], even if its just from the [[potion of flight|potion]]. Polar Vortex can send you into deep water.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Lom Lobon had [[Tornado]] instead of [[Polar Vortex]].\n*Lom Lobon was considered male before [[0.19]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Lom Lobon knew [[Ice Storm]] instead of Glaciate and Tornado. This led to extremely suicidal behaviour on his part."}

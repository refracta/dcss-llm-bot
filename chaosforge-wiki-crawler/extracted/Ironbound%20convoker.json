{"title":"Ironbound convoker","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ironbound_convoker","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ironbound convokers''' are dangerous enemy support units which enhance the melee prowess of any monsters nearby, and will use their [[Word of Recall]] spell to call in reinforcements from elsewhere on the floor. They can be found in [[the Vaults]] and in the [[Desolation of Salt]].\n\n{{monster spells||ironbrand convoker}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Word of Recall takes 3 turns to complete. If you can kill, [[confusion|confuse]], [[silence]], [[fear|scare]], [[petrify]], [[waterlog]], or otherwise disable the convoker before it completes its spell, the reinforcements won't arrive.\n*Monsters can move on the turn they're recalled (but not always). If you're unlucky, you can take lots of damage in a single turn. Even worse, you can take lots of damage while a [[vault warden]] locks the doors and stairs.\n*Word of Recall can bring monsters out of [[vault]]s, including [[runed door]] and [[transporter]] vaults. It can recall any monster from a [[ghost vault]] except the [[player ghost]] itself, or bring monsters from the \"door vault\" with lots of [[out of depth]] enemies.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], these enemies were known as '''ironbrand convokers'''.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], [[curare]] [[needle]]s could also interrupt Word of Recall.\n*Ironbrand convokers were added in [[0.12]].\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

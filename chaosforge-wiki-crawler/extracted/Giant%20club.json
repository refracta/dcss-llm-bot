It is a two handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''giant club''' is an inelegant but devastating weapon, dealing massive damage, but can only be wielded by [[Formicid]]s, [[Oni]], and [[Troll]]s. It uses two hands (or all four, for Formicids) and also requires a lot of skill to swing quickly. They are never found [[brand]]ed normally, but [[Okawaru]] and [[Trog]] may gift you branded or [[randart]] ones.\n\n==Strategy==\nAlthough rare to find on the floor, giant clubs are very common, as [[ogre (monster)|ogres]] often carry them. It isn't surprising to see multiple giant clubs by the early Dungeon. Whether you actually want to use one is another story. Until they get enough skill, characters will suffer with slow speed and low accuracy.\n\nUsually, if you can comfortably wield a giant club, you should upgrade to a [[giant spiked club]] soon. The main exception to this rule would be artefact giant clubs with the [[speed brand|speed]] [[brand]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

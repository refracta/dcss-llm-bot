{"title":"Spatial vortex","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spatial_vortex","type":"raw","data":"{{version021}}\n{{list of | vortices}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Spatial vortices''' come into being in one of three ways: as a [[Translocations]] [[miscast effect]], through the actions of a [[spatial maelstrom]], or as the result of [[Xom]] wanting to have fun with you. In either case, spatial vortices are permanently confused, swirling storms of chaos, dealing heavy physical damage as well as [[distortion]] effects each time they hit something.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nIf you have decent long-ranged attack capabilities, kill it from a distance, keeping 3+ tiles of space between you at all times. If you don't have such capabilities, just walk away."}

Try to stay on land where you're faster than them (in water, they'll outrun most characters).\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], snapping turtles' attacks will be slower, but more powerful (30 -> 35 damage).\n*Prior to [[0.19]], they could [[Withdrawn|retreat]] inside their shells at low HP.\n\n[[Category:Crystal Ball Articles]]"}

Berserk increases HP by +50%, gives you [[might]] and [[haste]], and makes you immune to [[sleep]]. However, your actions are limited to (mostly) move & attack, not attacking will quickly lower its duration, and you are [[slow]]ed after it ends.\n\n[[Ghouls]], [[Formicid|Formicids]], [[Mummy|mummies]], and bloodless [[vampire]]s cannot go berserk. There is a cooldown between berserks.\n\n{{crawlquote|''Normal:'' A red film seems to cover your vision as you go berserk! You feel yourself moving faster!<br>You feel mighty!<br>\n''If already berserk:'' You're already berserk!<br>\n''If -Berserk:'' You're too exhausted to go berserk.<br>\n''Mummy, ghoul, or bloodless vampire:'' You cannot raise a blood rage in your lifeless body.<br>\n''Formicid:'' Your stasis prevents you from going berserk.<br>\n''If [[mesmerise]]d (not by the [[obsidian axe]]):'' You are too mesmerised to rage.<br>\n''Affected by [[Cause Fear]]:'' You are too terrified to rage.<br>\n''Under the effect of [[Death's Door]]:'' You can't enter a blood rage from death's door.}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the berserk status gave the player a +5 [[Strength]] bonus.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], this potion could be used after drawing the [[Battlelust card]] to cancel the effect entirely.\n\n{{potions}}"}

This reduces their remaining time before being sent back where they came from.}}\n\n'''Aura of Abjuration''' is a level 5 [[Summonings|Summoning]] spell which gives you an abjuration [[aura]]. Any hostile summoned creatures within its range will have their duration reduced each turn, and will be dismissed entirely when their duration hits 0.\n\n==Strategy==\n*You can cast this spell before combat with a summoner. This is usually worthwhile against opponents that have other means of hurting you badly from behind their summons; think [[royal mummy|greater mummies]] and [[lich]]es. In the mid-game, the spell works well against [[deep elf demonologist]]s, [[boggart]]s, and [[vampire mage|vampire magi]].\n*Note that the spell has no effect on [[durable summon]]s or [[eldritch tentacle]]s. Also, [[The Shining One]] protects [[Seraph]]'s [[Summon Holies|divine summons]] against abjuration.\n\n==History==\n*The spell was removed in [[0.26]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Aura of Abjuration was a level 6 spell and appeared solely in [[Grand Grimoire]].\n*Aura of Abjuration was added in [[0.14]], replacing [[Mass Abjuration]]."}

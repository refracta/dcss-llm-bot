This makes it much easier to escape them, and significantly reduces their damage output in combat. This effect has to overcome the target's [[magic resistance]] to succeed, but having a high [[Evocations]] skill will increase your odds of success.\n\n==History==\nWands of slowing were removed in [[0.20]]."}

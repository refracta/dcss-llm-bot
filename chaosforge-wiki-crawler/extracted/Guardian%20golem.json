{"title":"Guardian golem","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Guardian_golem","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Guardian golems''' are constructs created by the spell [[Summon Guardian Golem]]. They are unable to attack, but they can [[Injury Bond|shelter]] your summons from injuries, and it gains the [[Inner Flame]] [[status effect]] when severely damaged.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n* Guardian golems can improve the durability of your other summons in extended combat, saving you from having to re-summon as often. Just watch out for the explosion.\n* Even if you don't have any other summons, a guardian golem can still serve to block oncoming monsters so you have a chance to get away.\n* You can weaponize guardian golems -- let enemies attack it until it explodes, then fight anything that survived in the ensuing flames.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], guardian golems were removed, as [[Summon Guardian Golem]] was replaced by two spells, [[Martyr's Knell]] and [[Summon Blazeheart Golem]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], guardian golems only had a 1/4 chance to get Inner Flame.\n*Guardian golems were added with the [[Summon Guardian Golem]] spell in [[0.14]]."}

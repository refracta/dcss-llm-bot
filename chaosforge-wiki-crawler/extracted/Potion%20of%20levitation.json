When coupled with the spell \"Swiftness\", it increases your movement speed. With an amulet of controlled flight (which eventually auto-identifies in the process), you can fly instead, which grants the advantages of levitations without drawbacks.\n\nYou are warned about a loss in buoyancy when the potion's effects are nearly over, giving you time to steer clear of lava.\n\n \"You feel very buoyant. You gently float upwards from the floor.\"\n \"You feel more buoyant.\"\n\n==History==\nPotions of levitation were replaced with [[potions of flight]] in [[0.12]]."}

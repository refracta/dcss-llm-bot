{"title":"Ice Elementalist","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ice_Elementalist","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|Ice Elementalists begin with the Freeze spell. The spells in their starting library are quite versatile.}}\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Merfolk]], [[Gargoyle]], [[Draconian]], [[Djinni]], [[Demigod]], and [[Barachi]] are the recommended species if you pick an Ice Elementalist Background.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[robe]]\n*[[Potion of magic]]\n\n===Available Spells===\n*[[Freeze]]\n*[[Frozen Ramparts]]\n*[[Ozocubu's Armour]]\n*[[Summon Ice Beast]]\n\nIce Elementalists start with the [[Freeze]] spell memorised.\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Stealth]]: 2\n*[[Spellcasting]]: 2\n*[[Ice Magic]]: 4\n\nChoosing Ice Elementalist adds 7 to your starting [[Intelligence]] and 5 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nIce Elementalists are a fairly consistent choice, with offensive spells that simply can't miss. Ice spells don't slouch for damage, and they will freeze [[cold-blooded]] monsters like [[list of reptiles and amphibians|reptiles]] in the process. However, several kinds of enemies resist cold - early examples include the [[undead]] and [[ice beast]]s. Their starting spells also have poor range, though Ice Magic's power easily makes up for it.\n\n===Spell Details===\n[[Freeze]] is a powerful level 1 attack spell. It deals average damage, but ignores both [[AC]] and [[EV]] to always hit. Fast and evasive monsters, such as [[jackal]]s and [[adder]]s, are some of the scariest monsters in the upper Dungeon -- monsters which Freeze works well against. You can use whatever [[Throwing|throwables]] or [[Slings]] you find in order to compensate for its 1-tile range.\n\n[[Frozen Ramparts]] is a very strong spell, especially in hallways. It deals strong and guaranteed AOE damage, as long as you can survive a few hits without moving. The spell requires walls to function, but those are in abundance throughout the Dungeon (and even Lair). [[Ozocubu's Armour]] may give you just the defense you need in such a situation. They both are level 3 and pure Ice Magic, meaning its trivial to cast them both at the same time. Generally, Frozen Ramparts is the better option of the two if you're out of spell levels - it simply and reliably kills things.\n\n[[Summon Ice Beast]] summons... an [[ice beast]]. Summons are useful since they are cost efficient and because they can take damage for you. You can have up to 1 summoned ice beast at a time. Ice beasts also deal a small amount of physical damage.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Ice Elementalists started with [[Hailstorm]] rather than [[Summon Ice Beast]].\n*In [[0.29]], most backgrounds were buffed; all Mage backgrounds gained a [[potion of magic]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Ice Elementalists started with the [[Book of Frost]], and had [[Summon Ice Beast]].\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Ice Elementalists started with [[Throw Frost]] and [[Throw Icicle]] instead of [[Frozen Ramparts]] and [[Hailstorm]]. They also had 1 skill in [[Conjurations]], but only 3 skill in Ice Magic.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Ice Elementalists only started with 1 level of Spellcasting.\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

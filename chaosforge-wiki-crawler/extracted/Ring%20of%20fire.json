For the obsolete spell, see [[Ring of Flames]].''\n{{item\n |itemtype=Jewellery\n |name=Ring of fire\n |cost= 434\n}}\n{{flavour|A ring that brings its wearer more in contact with the powers of fire. It grants resistance to heat and enhances fire magic, but causes vulnerability to cold.}}\n\nA [[ring of fire]] is a [[ring]] that enhances the [[spell power|power]] of [[fire magic]] spells. Additionally, it provides one level of [[fire resistance]] (rF+) and one negative level of [[cold resistance]] (rC-).\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*A ring of fire can serve as a poor man's [[ring of protection from fire]] in a pinch, particularly if you should encounter a [[Volcano]] mini branch.\n*You don't want to be vulnerable to any element for too long, since you (the player) can always forget about it. Even if you use [[Fire Magic]], you'll want a source of [[cold resistance]] to counteract the vulnerability. \n:If you don't have a way to negate rC-, Fire specialists can still find this ring useful - just remember to remove it against icy enemies.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], rings of fire provided a negative [[Ice Magic]] enhancer.\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

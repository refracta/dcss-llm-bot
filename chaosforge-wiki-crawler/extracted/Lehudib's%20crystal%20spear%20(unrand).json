{"title":"Lehudib's crystal spear (unrand)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lehudib%27s_crystal_spear_(unrand)","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|Presumably this relic led to the invention of the famous spell, or maybe the other way around.}}\n[[File:Lehudib's_crystal_spear_(weapon).png]] '''''the +6,+6 Lehudib's crystal spear'''''\n\n+6, +6 [[spear]]\n\n[[Returning]] brand<br>\n+3 INT\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Lehudib's crystal spear''' is a very useful item if you have decent [[Throwing]] skill, combining high damage, accuracy, and the fact that it will never [[mulch]]. Just be careful not to accidentally throw it at enemies in [[deep water]] or [[lava]], as its [[returning]] [[brand]] is not guaranteed to function every time. If discovered early on, some players might wield it for its high enchantment bonuses, but a well-enchanted and branded [[trident]] or [[demon trident]] will definitely be a superior melee weapon. Casters might also appreciate the [[intelligence]] bonus, although a [[magical staff]] is a more effective method for enhancing your spells.\n\nThe spell version of [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] does more damage, obviously.\n\n==History==\n*The crystal spear was removed in [[0.14]], as thrown spears no longer damage foes (though the spell still remains).\n*Despite the description, it is not ambiguous which came first, the spell or the spear: the spell predates this artefact by many versions.\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Polearms]]\n[[Category:Obsolete items]]"}

{"title":"Ring of the Octopus King","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ring_of_the_Octopus_King","type":"raw","data":"{{version|031}}\n{{flavour|One of the eight rings once worn by the Octopus King and now scattered across the land. Each has its own unique enchantment.<hr>\n\n\"A mermaid who fancied to sing,<br>\nRoused lust in the Octopus King.<br>\nHer squiggly suitor,<br>\nTried hard to woo her,<br>\nBut she couldn't wear all his rings.\"}}\n\n[[File:Urand octoring.png]] '''''a ring of the Octopus King'''''<br>\n+2 [[HP]]<br>\n+2 [[AC]]<br>\n+2 [[EV]]<br>\n+2 [[SH]]<br>\nOne of the following properties: [[ring of protection from fire|rF+]], [[ring of protection from cold|rC+]], [[ring of positive energy|rN+]], [[ring of resist corrosion|rCorr]], [[ring of magical power|MP +9]], [[ring of wizardry|Wizardry]], [[ring of see invisible|SInv]], or [[ring of flight|Fly]]<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|artefact.cc|1796}}</ref>.\n\nEach ring worn also adds a +2 enchantment to the [[trident of the Octopus King]].\n\n==Desirability==\nThere are technically eight different '''rings of the Octopus King'''.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|1264}}</ref> It is possible to find more than one in a single game, but finding all eight is extraordinarily unlikely (unless you complete an egregious number of [[Ziggurat]]s). \n\nOn their own, each ring is a step up from their mundane counterparts. Having +2 AC / +2 EV / +2 SH is better than a [[ring of protection]], and you get the original ring's property on top. Therefore, while it's not uncommon to find better [[randart]] rings, these rings can be useful for any character.\n\nOnly an [[Octopode]], with their ability to wear eight rings at once, can take full advantage of the rings' synergy with the Trident, but they'll still need to find them all first. And by the time that's done, they'll likely have found multiple high-powered randart rings.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], rings gave +1 to AC, EV, [[strength]], [[intelligence]], and [[dexterity]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], rings generated with [[ring of stealth|Stealth]] instead of Flight.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the rings' bonus to the trident of the Octopus King was +1 each. Also, rings generated with [[sustain attributes]] instead of [[corrosion resistance]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], rings generated with [[ring of regeneration|Regen]] instead of SInv.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], rings generated with [[ring of sustenance|Hunger-]] instead of Stealth+. Also, the rings did not increase the enchantment level of the trident of the Octopus King.\n*The rings of the Octopus King were added in [[0.10]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Ring]]"}

[[Transmuter]]s started with this spell in their library.\n\n==Effect==\nWhile the spell is active, each enemy killed grants a +1 [[slaying]] bonus (up to a cap of +9), as well as 1d3 healing if the enemy was adjacent to the player. Both effects only apply when killing monsters that give [[XP]], so destroying [[summon]]s will not help. Unfortunately, the bestial blood gives your character the irresistible urge to howl, generating significant [[noise]].\n\nThe effect lasts <code>19 + (1d[[spell power|power]] + 1d(power + 1)) / 2</code> turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|spl-selfench.cc|187}}</ref>  Casting the spell again while still active will renew the duration, but also resets the slaying bonus.\n\nYou are unable to cast this spell if you are [[undead]], though you don't need to have [[blood]] to cast this spell.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nDespite the low level of this spell, melee, ranged, and hybrid fighters at most stages of the game can benefit from the practically free Slaying bonus offered by this spell. As you should expect, unarmed Transmutations experts, without encumbering armour, can most easily use this spell.\n\n==History==\n*This spell was replaced by the level 3 [[Necromancy]] spell [[Fugue of the Fallen]] in [[0.31]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Wereblood had no healing effect from killing adjacent enemies.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], this spell was known as '''Song of Slaying''', was a level 2 [[Charms]] spell, and was slightly louder.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], you could stop singing through an [[ability]] at any time.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], toughness of monsters controlled how much they could increase the slaying bonus. The bonus wasn't capped.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the spell had lower duration and granted less slaying, but had a higher power cap.\n*Song of Slaying was added in 0.13.\n\nDuring the Christmas holiday of 2014 and 2015, online ''Crawl'' servers replaced this spell with the '''Song of Sleighing''':\n\n{{flavour|This spell conjures ancient Christmas carols within the caster's mind, which the caster then recites — quite loudly! Each non-summoned enemy the caster slays in combat during this recitation temporarily enhances their melee & ranged skills. The bonus only lasts for the duration of the song; casting this spell while already singing will start a new song, not extend an existing one.}}\n\nThis had no impact on actual gameplay.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

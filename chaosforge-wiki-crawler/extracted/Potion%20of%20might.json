{"title":"Potion of might","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Potion_of_might","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{item\n |itemtype=Potion\n |name=Potion of Might\n |cost=35\n |weight=4.0\n}}\n{{flavour|A potion which greatly increases the power of the drinker's melee attacks.}}\n\nQuaffing a '''potion of might''' grants your character the [[might]] [[status effect]], adding +1d10 damage to your melee attacks for <code>34 + 1d40</code> (more) turns, with a hard maximum of 80 turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|potion.cc|279}}</ref> It does not stack with [[berserk]], which already gives might.\n\nMight is roughly equivalent to +10 [[slaying]], but they are not identical; the +1d10 bonus is rolled separately from slaying. For example, if you had +20 slaying, you'd have (1d20 - 1) damage. With +10 slay and might, you'd have (1d10 + 1d10 - 1) damage instead. In addition, might does not increase [[to-hit]].\n\n{{crawlquote|''Quaff normally:'' You feel very mighty all of a sudden.<br>\n''Quaff while Mighty:'' You feel mightier all of a sudden.}}\n\n==Strategy==\nDoes nothing for [[Ranged Weapons]] or magic, but a reasonably strong buff in melee. Use this before things get too hairy; you are more likely to win if you use the potion at 100% health rather than 50% health. Casters will want to carry them around, for emergencies where they can't use spells.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], potions of might gave the player a +5 bonus to [[Strength]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], quaffing a potion of might while already mighty would give a point of [[magic contamination]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{potions}}"}

{"title":"Curse skull","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Curse_skull","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Curse skulls''' are fast and powerful [[undead]] monsters, which resist most elements, summon swarms of undead allies, and [[torment]] you repeatedly. They can be found in [[the Crypt]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Curse skulls can [[torment|halve your HP]] every turn. With high AC, elemental resistances, and swarms of summons, they are difficult to kill. The following things are effective at killing them:\n**[[Dispel Undead]] ignores AC, so it'll destroy curse skulls quickly. However, due to the mass of summons, getting into range can be a challenge.\n**[[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] is also great to use - when targeting the skull itself (and not the walls around the skull), it ignores AC. Unlike Dispel Undead, LRD can be used from a distance.\n**Level 9 spells pierce resistances, so they remain effective against curse skulls. Failing that, try to avoid elemental spells - use irresistible spells like [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]] or [[Airstrike]] instead.\n**Melee fighters can use weapons of [[holy wrath]]. [[Javelin]]s or bolt [[wand]]s can work well if you can't get in melee range.\n*Curse skulls are immune to [[Silence]] and have infinite willpower, so you can't simply disable their ability to cast spells.\n*Try to minimize time spent in [[line of sight]] with the skull; this minimizes the amount of torments. Use corners or a [[scroll of fog]] to break the [[line of sight]].\n*A [[potion of lignification]] gives immunity to torment. However, you'll be trapped with the curse skull, along with its army of summoned reinforcements. Use with caution; preferably use it around a corner/hallway, somewhere away from unexplored regions.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.16]] onward, curse skulls can move like any other monster, now at fast (15) speed.\n*In [[0.15]], curse skulls were [[stationary]] and had 15 speed.\n*In [[0.13]] and [[0.14]], curse skulls could move only when outside player [[LOS]], at only 10 speed. They also had the [[vigilant]] flag.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], curse skulls were stationary, had 10 speed, and had significantly higher HP and AC."}

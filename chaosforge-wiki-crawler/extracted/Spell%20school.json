{"title":"Spell school","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spell_school","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\nA '''spell school''' is the category to which a spell belongs.  A spell may belong to one, two or three schools. The more schools a spell belongs to, the more [[skill]] and [[XP]] will be needed to train to achieve facility with that spell: spell casting success is based on the average of the spell's schools' skills.\n\nThe spell schools currently extant are:\n*[[Hexes]]\n*[[Summonings]]\n*[[Necromancy]]\n*[[Translocations]]\n*[[Transmutations]]\n*[[Fire Magic]]\n*[[Ice Magic]]\n*[[Air Magic]]\n*[[Earth Magic]]\n*[[Poison Magic]]\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.26]], the [[Charms]] spell school was removed.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], there was an aptitude penalty for training opposed elemental magic schools (Fire/Ice and Air/Earth).\n*In [[0.8]], the [[Enchantments]] school of magic was split into [[Charms]] and [[Hexes]].\n*Prior to [[0.6]], the [[Divinations]] spell school existed.\n\n==See also==\n[[List of spells by school]]\n\n[[Category:Spells]]"}

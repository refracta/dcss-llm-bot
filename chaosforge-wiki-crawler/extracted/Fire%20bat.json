They can also be found in a few fire- or bat-themed [[vault]]s.\n\nIf you find a fire bat in the early [[Dungeon]], it is almost always part of a vault. This fire bat has a [[HD]] of only 1, so it is significantly weaker than the regular monster.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Although [[Magic Dart]] never misses, it deals such low damage that you'll need to hit them with multiple darts each to take them down. [[Airstrike]], [[Poisonous Vapours]], or [[Freezing Cloud]] are all excellent unavoidable ways to take them out quickly.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], fire bats were [[:Category:Water_vulnerability|vulnerable to water]]."}

Like all [[rod]]s, its effectiveness rises with your [[Evocations]] skill. \n\n==Strategy==\n[[Freezing Cloud]] is the main highlight from this rod. Instead of having to train a triple-school spell, frigid destruction lets you cast it with just Evocations. The other two spells can be useful, both being raw damage abilities.\n\n==History==\nRods of frigid destruction were added in [[0.13]] and removed in [[0.14]]."}

{"title":"Ring of flight","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ring_of_flight","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{item\n |itemtype=Jewellery\n |name=Ring of flight\n |cost=\n}}\n{{flavour|A ring that grants its wearer flight.}}\n\nBy wearing a [[ring of flight]], you gain the ability to [[fly]] for as long as you wear it. Note that flying characters still trigger [[trap]]s as normal.\n\n==Strategy==\nFlight is useful in areas where [[water]] is common, such as the [[Swamp]] or [[Shoals]]. Having flight on hand can help you avoid or fight monsters wherever water and lava are present. While many monsters in the aforementioned Lair branches swim faster than the average player, flight still prevents many of the penalties while fighting in water, including its effect on [[invisibility]].\n\nA ring of flight can largely replace [[potions of flight]], though using the ring slot temporarily should be a (minor) consideration.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], flight was a temporary ability. You could [[evoke]] the ring for 3 MP, with a failure rate that scaled down with [[Evocation]]s. You could not extend the duration of the effect by evoking the ring while already flying.\n*The ring of flight was introduced in [[0.12]], replacing the [[ring of levitation]].\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

This prized relic is now one of the last proofs that the vividly coloured faerie dragons ever existed.}}\n[[File:Faerie_dragon_armour.png]] '''''Faerie dragon scales'''''<br>\n\n+X [[acid dragon scales]] (ranges from 0 to +8)<br>\n[[Acid#Corrosion|rCorr]]<br>\n1d3 random properties, with a chance of a negative property as well.\n\nThese random properties are selected much like the properties on [[randart]] armour, though they are weighted toward being positive, and certain properties have adjusted likelihoods of occurring. The following properties are more likely to appear than average (5% chance of any given property being from this list):\n*[[HP]] bonus (-10 to +11)\n*[[MP]] bonus (+1 to +11)\n*[[Clarity]]\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Faerie dragon scales'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|375}}</ref> are a randomised artefact found only by killing [[the Enchantress]]. Its usefulness is entirely dependent on what the [[RNG]] decides to generate.\n\nDon't overlook this armour until you've actually seen its properties. A set of +8 acid dragon scales with rF++, rElec, and Dex+10 is nothing to sneeze at. At the same time, heavy melee brutes will probably find this armour too light to wear.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], faerie dragon scales were called faerie dragon armour and the item's base type was mottled dragon armour.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

{"title":"Agnes","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Agnes","type":"raw","data":"{{version|030}}\n{{list of|spriggans}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Agnes the Wanderer''' is a very fast [[spriggan (monster)|spriggan]] warrior who wields a [[lajatang]] (often [[brand]]ed). She attacks almost twice as fast as normal and is capable of dealing heavy damage very quickly, especially with a good brand.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:14-15\n*The [[Elven Halls]]: 1-2\n*[[The Snake Pit]]\n*[[Spider's Nest]]\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n* While heavily armored fights can usually plow right through her, other characters will want to watch out. Try to beat her at range, if at all possible.\n* Her [[ev]]asion makes hitting her in general tricky. If possible, try to hit her with unavoidable spells like [[Airstrike]], [[Fireball]], or [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]]. [[Cloud]]s, such as from a [[scroll of poison]], [[condenser vane]], or [[Freezing Cloud]], are very effective. You can also use evocables like the [[wand of roots]] (which lowers her EV), [[wand of iceblast]], or [[lightning rod]].\n* While [[Hexes]] can't miss, Agnes has high [[willpower]]. A [[scroll of vulnerability]] can bring it down to manageable levels.\n\n[[Category:Spriggan]]"}

{"title":"Meliai","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Meliai","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of|arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Meliai''' are fey bee-priestesses that always come in threes. They can appear in the late [[Dungeon]], [[Spider's Nest]], or as part of a [[killer bee]] [[vault]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Think of them like killer bee versions of [[orc priest]]s: Smiting, high speed, and a poisonous sting. Even though they might be frail, don't take meliai packs lightly!\n**A group of 3 meliai is equivalent to 6 orc priests, and closer to 8 orc priests in practice (as meliai cast Smiting ~40% more often than priests).\n*Meliai are fast, high EV, but frail threats. The following can be good ways to take them out:\n**Strong AOE options that never miss, including [[lightning rod]]s, [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]], and [[Freezing Cloud]] . A [[tin of tremorstones]], while it can miss, is very accurate and likely to kill (if you have decent [[Evocations]]). \n**Like many insects, they're weak to poison. [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] may prove extremely helpful if they appear in a vault full of other bees.\n**They have poor [[willpower]]. A [[wand of charming]] is very effective, though [[wand of paralysis|paralysis]] is nice to use too.\n*Meliai are valid targets for a [[queen bee]]'s [[Berserk Other]]. If that happens, watch out!\n\n==History==\n*Meliai were introduced in [[0.19]]."}

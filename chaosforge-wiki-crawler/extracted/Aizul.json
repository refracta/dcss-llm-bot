{"title":"Aizul","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Aizul","type":"raw","data":"{{version|026}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Aizul the Neglectful Guardian''' is a very fast [[unique]] [[guardian serpent]] capable of deadly [[Poison Magic]] and a [[Hexes|Hex]] which can put you to sleep for several turns. Although not very dangerous in melee, she can deal huge amounts of [[poison]] damage to those without resistance and has much more durability than most monsters at her depth.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Depths]]:1-3\n*The [[Elven Halls]]\n*[[The Swamp]]\n*[[The Snake Pit]]\n*[[The Shoals]]\n*The [[Spider's Nest]]\n*[[The Vaults]]:1-4\n*[[The Crypt]]:1\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Melee attacks against you will deal extra damage while asleep. Taking any damage (including poison damage) will wake you up, however.\n*[[Poison resistance]] and high [[willpower]] are highly recommended, and even with poison resistance, expect to take decent damage from her Poison Arrows. If you lack either, definitely consider fleeing this fight until you're better prepared.\n*Aizul has no arms, and thus cannot open [[door]]s. Use this to make escaping much easier."}

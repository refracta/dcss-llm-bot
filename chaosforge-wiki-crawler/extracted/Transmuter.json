They deal damage primarily in unarmed combat, often using transformations to enhance their defensive and offensive capabilities. They also enter the dungeon with a potion of lignification.}}\n'''Transmuters''' are magicians who specialise in [[Transmutations]] magic. They are best described as kung-fu mad scientists, but initial survival is quite a challenge for them. \n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Troll]], [[Naga]], [[Merfolk]], [[Draconian]], [[Demigod]], and [[Demonspawn]] are the recommended species if you pick a Transmuter Background.\n\n==Racial restrictions==\nAs [[Ghoul]]s and [[Mu]]mmies cannot transform themselves, they are forbidden for becoming transmuters.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[robe]]\n*[[Potion of lignification]]\n\n===Available Spells:===\n*[[Beastly Appendage]]\n*[[Wereblood]]\n*[[Spider Form]]\n*[[Ice Form]]\n\nTransmuters start with the [[Beastly Appendage]] spell memorised.\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Fighting]]: 1\n*[[Unarmed Combat]]: 3\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Spellcasting]]: 2\n*[[Transmutations]]: 2\n\nChoosing Transmuter adds 2 to your starting [[Strength]], 5 to your starting [[Intelligence]] and 5 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nTransmuters have a rougher start in the Dungeon. [[Unarmed Combat]], even though strong later in the game, struggles to keep up with weapons in the early game, with a base damage of only 3 for most species. This is exacerbated by a Transmuter's need to dedicate XP to Transmutations to unlock better combat forms.\n\nMany transmuters may want to forgo their form spells and focus on melee and defenses, at least until they become competent at their main combat skills.\n\n===Spell Details===\nCasting [[Beastly Appendage]] before every fight is a must for survival, and is recommended even if you play an already strong species like [[Minotaur]] or [[Troll]]. It creates [[Horns]] and [[Talons]] to attack more in combat. While eventually a liability once you get [[helmet]]s and [[boots]], Transmuters don't start with either. Beastly Appendage works with weapons, so using a [[dagger]] or [[short sword]] can be optimal for the first few levels.\n\n[[Wereblood]] is useful when fighting groups; it's not amazing when you first hit level 2, but always remains helpful in various crowded situations throughout the game. Its noise may also attract even more monsters; you'll want to be in a hallway when fighting like this. \n\n[[Spider Form]] gives your attacks the [[venom]] brand, and boosts both unarmed damage and evasion. Unfortunately, it also melds all of your armour and leaves you vulnerable to poison yourself. But venom is quite powerful for the early game. Non-resistant melee threats can be [[kite]]d, taking high poison damage. Once enemies reach max poison, you can just walk away (watch for [[attacks of opportunity]] though).\n\nMeanwhile, [[Ice Form]] is a more robust form, with useful resistances and good damage. It might not be as durable as any old melee fighter, but the cold damage slows down [[cold-blooded]] creatures, many of which are scary to face early on. While you become vulnerable to fire, you start hitting like a beast -- damage is equivalent to a strong, [[brand]]ed one-handed weapon, even at 0 UC skill.\n\n==History==\n*The Transmuter background was removed in [[0.31]], along with the Transmutations skill. It was replaced by [[Alchemist]] and [[Shapeshifter]].\n*In [[0.29]], Transmutaters gained a [[potion of lignification]]; most other backgrounds also gained a buff.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Transmuters started with the [[Book of Changes]] and had access to [[Blade Hands]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Transmuters started with [[Sticks to Snakes]] instead of [[Wereblood]]. As such, they started with 12 [[arrow]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Transmuters started with 20 [[gold]].\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

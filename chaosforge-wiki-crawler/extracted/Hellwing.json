{"title":"Hellwing","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hellwing","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n[[Hellwing]]s are pesky [[tier-4 demon]]s with average melee combat skills and decent regeneration. They can make swooping attacks in range-4: when swooping, they land on the opposite side of a target, and instantly make a melee attack. They are found in [[the Abyss]] and [[Pandemonium]], and are often summoned by other monsters through the [[Summon Demon]] spell.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Unless you find a hellwing particularly early (mid-Dungeon, Lair), they usually don't pose much of a melee threat. The bigger threat is the hellwing appearing from behind, blocking your escape path.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], hellwings had fast regeneration.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], hellwings could spawn in the [[Hell]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], hellwings had the [[Cigotuvi's Embrace (spell)|Cigotuvi's Embrace]] spell and were vulnerable to [[silver]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], they didn't have the swoop attack formerly possessed by [[blue devil]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], hellwings had [[Teleport Self]] and [[Teleport Other]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], they couldn't cast Cigotuvi's Embrace.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], player-summoned hellwings could be used to gain permanent undead allies.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], hellwings were [[tier-3 demon]]s.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

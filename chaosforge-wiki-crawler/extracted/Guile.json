{"title":"Guile","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Guile","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|It weakens the willpower of the wielder and anyone they hex.}}\n\nThe '''Guile''' [[ego]], exclusive to [[orb]]s, gives you -80 (**) [[willpower]]. In exchange, monsters you target with [[Hexes]] or other willpower checks effectively have -80 willpower.\n\n==Strategy==\nLosing willpower is ''incredibly'' risky. [[Paralysis]] and [[Petrify]] can instantly kill you if you're unlucky. Other hexes - such as [[sleep]], [[banishment]], and [[confusion]] - range from annoying to directly lethal. Also, as an orb, it prevents you from wearing a [[shield]].\n\nAt the same time, a flat -80 willpower is an incredibly strong effect. [[Death yak]]s, for instance, go from 100 to 20 will, turning a mid-power [[Ensorcelled Hibernation]] from a 2% to 68% chance of success. Most non-[[unique]] enemies before [[Zot]] don't even have 100 will, allowing you to get very consistent (60% - 90%) success rates for [[Hexes]], status [[wand]]s, etc. Don't think you need to be a Hexes or Evocations specialist to benefit. If you just have 5 Evocations skill, a [[wand of paralysis]] has a 77% chance to succeed against 0 willpower monsters.\n\nThe risk can be mitigated in a few ways:\n*Using guile in places with few willpower threats. The early [[Dungeon]], the [[Lair]], and some of its branches ([[Spider]], [[Snake]], arguably [[Shoals]]) don't have many willpower checks; you aren't expected to have good will yet. \n**But even in these places, it comes with a cost. Spells like Petrify ([[basilisk]]s), [[Mesmerise]] ([[merfolk siren]]s), and [[Dimension Anchor]] ([[nagaraja]]) can still harm you. [[Unique]]s like [[Rupert]] and [[Louise]] can appear around these areas, armed with deadly hexes. And if the wand of paralysis spawns in your game, ''any'' humanoid monster has the potential to paralyse you. \n*Using guile in places with no willpower threats. If you're taking out a [[ghost vault]] on an otherwise clear level, using guile can be safe (so long as the ghost doesn't have hexes of its own).\n*Using hexes/statuses of your own. Paralysis will prevent monsters from using their Paralyse, for instance. [[Cause Fear]] is brutally effective with guile, giving you a renewable supply of [[scroll of fear|fear scrolls]] at ~80% success. (This isn't 100% guaranteed; not only does it have a chance to fail, but a monster can paralyse you the turn you step into its [[LOS]].)\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Note that monsters won't go below 0 willpower. If you've got a 68% chance to succeed a hex against [[hydra]]s, you'll also get a 68% chance to succeed against [[rat]]s and [[hobgoblin]]s. Therefore, guile has the most noticeable effect against monsters around the 80 - 120 will range. \n*Sadly, it does not affect hexes from your allies (such as [[Hepliaklqana]]'s ancestor).\n\n==History==\n*The guile ego was introduced, along with orbs, in [[0.28]].\n\n{{orb}}"}

It has a tendency to damage the caster, but they receive a great reduction in damage.\n\n==Useful Info==\nThere is no way to aim Chain Lightning. When cast, it creates an \"arc\" of lightning, which strikes the nearest valid target (randomly chosen if multiple targets are equally close). It then creates another arc; each consecutive arc will hit everyone within 3 squares of any previous target, that 1. hasn't been hit before, and 2. is in [[LOS]]. This continues until there are no valid targets.\n\nEach arc deals two-thirds the damage of the previous arc. The initial strike deals full damage only at point-blank range, with the damage reduced to x2/3 from range 2 to 4, and x4/9 from range 5 to 7. Half of the spell's damage is irresistible, and only half of the target's AC applies.\n\nThe caster can be hit by their own spell, but takes only 1/6 damage. With rElec, this damage is almost negligible, and even without rElec it doesn't do much (expect 10-20). The caster's [[allies]] are not protected from this spell (unless they are protected from ''all'' damage, such as [[Hepliaklqana]] ancestor or [[Fedhas]] plants).\n\n==Strategy==\nChain Lightning deals incredible damage against single targets, without the delays of [[Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling]]. It also works nicely as an area-of-effect spell: arcs will hit targets, close or far, for decent damage, and it doesn't get weaker when hitting more targets. The optimal cast is when you are against 1 (or more) adjacent opponents, with a dense pack of monsters nearby.\n\nAt moderate spell power, Chain Lightning can take out powerful uniques in 2-3 castings. At max spell power, it becomes one of the most potent damage sources in the game, bolstered by it partially ignoring electricity resistance.\n\nHowever, as a level 9 spell, it's tough to cast for a typical 3 rune character. Worshippers of [[Ashenzari]], [[Vehumet]] and/or those with high [[aptitude]] in magic ([[Tengu]] especially) are best suited to use this spell, while other characters may want to settle for spells like [[Plasma Beam]], [[Bombard]], and Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Wielding a [[staff of air]] provides a significant boost to damage, ''and'' grants you resistance to the self-damage; definitely consider wielding one if you can find it.\n*[[Plant]]s, [[fungi]], and [[bush]]es are not valid targets for Chain Lightning, so they cannot extend the range of the spell. \n*Followers of [[Beogh]], [[Yredelemnul]], or any other character that makes heavy use of allies should use extreme caution before casting Chain Lightning. You are almost guaranteed to injure or kill your allies in the process.\n\n==Monster Version==\nThe monster version of Chain Lightning is functionally identical to the player version.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"400px\" heights=\"400px\" class=\"left\" mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Chain lightning ex.png|thumb|left|Example of Chain Lightning targeting.<br>Arcs go from green (66%) -> yellow (44%) -> orange (29%).<br>(Note that the initial arc may also hit the fire giants first.)\n</gallery>\n\n==History==\n*The spell was reworked in [[0.27]]. Prior to this version, Chain Lightning was a Level 8 Conjurations/Air spell. It went from single target to single target, reducing in damage each time before eventually grounding out. Also, the spell's damage couldn't partially bypass resistance to electricity.\n*Chain Lightning was added in [[0.1]], replacing [[Orb of Electrocution]]."}

He comes with decent equipment, and once buffed, can deal gruesome damage in melee.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Depths]]:1-3\n*The [[Elven Halls]]:2-3\n*The [[Snake Pit]]:2-4\n*The [[Spider's Nest]]:2-4\n*[[The Vaults]]\n*[[The Crypt]]\n\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster2\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Might]]\n|flags1={{Priest slot flag}}\n|slot2=[[Haste]]\n|flags2={{Priest slot flag}}\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nWiglaf may be strong, but he has numerous vulnerabilities. Firstly, one can soften him up from a distance. He has no ranged abilities unless he happens to find a weapon and ammunition lying around, but his ability to haste himself means he may be able to get close to you before you can take him out. Haste yourself to maintain the gap, and hit him with your most powerful conjurations. If you're a melee fighter, you might simply try hasting yourself and drinking a [[potion of might]] before engaging him in melee; generally, you will have superior damage output. If you yourself worship Okawaru, you can use his Finesse ability, which is superior to Wiglaf's Haste. Lastly, one can attempt to close to melee range before he can cast Haste or Might - once in melee, he'll rarely cast them.\n\n==Trivia==\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiglaf Wiglaf] is a character in the Anglo-Saxon epic poem ''Beowulf''.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Wiglaf will return with an artefact [[hat]] and [[Hellfire Mortar]].

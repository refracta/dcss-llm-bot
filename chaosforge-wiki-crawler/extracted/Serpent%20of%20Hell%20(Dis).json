{"title":"Serpent of Hell (Dis)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Serpent_of_Hell_(Dis)","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | dragons}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe '''Serpent of Hell''' is a [[unique]] dragon whose elemental affinity varies based on which branch of [[Hell]] you encounter it in. When faced in [[the Iron City of Dis]], the Serpent is capable of breathing deadly shrapnel and magic-stripping energies at you.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The Dis iteration of the Serpent of Hell is an extremely durable monster capable of pouring out tremendous damage that ignores all resistances. Its multiple attacks per turn each hit fairly hard, but its spells are far more frightening. Metal Splinters can be gruesome for characters with low AC, Quicksilver Bolt injures you while negating any buffs you have in place, and Lehudib's Crystal Spear simply maims any character that it hits. Summon Dragon complicates the fight with additional enemies, and Abjuration prevents you from bringing in reinforcements, but these effects are generally less of a concern than the Serpent's direct damage spells. To top it all off, all three of its attack spells are considered natural abilities, completely ignoring the effects of [[antimagic]] weapons.\n*[[Earth Magic]] specialists can beat the Serpent at its own game, hammering it with their own Crystal Spears until the beast falls. [[Air Magic]] can also be very effective here, as it does not possess [[electricity]] resistance.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|this Serpent of Hell will get [[Corrosive Bolt]] and [[Iron Shot]] instead of Metal Splinters and LCS. Also, its defenses will be nerfed: 30 AC / 8 EV -> 28 AC / 4 EV.}}\n*In [[0.16]], it got the third breath attack, [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]]."}

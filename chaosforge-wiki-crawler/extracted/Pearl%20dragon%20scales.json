It grants its wearer resistance from negative energies.}}\n\n'''Pearl dragon scales''' are a strong armour choice, with the same AC as [[plate armour]], but with a bearable encumbrance. They also provide one rank of [[life protection]] (rN+).\n\nThis item has a 33% chance to generate when you slay a [[pearl dragon]], which can only be found on the [[holy]] [[Pandemonium]] floor, [[Ziggurat]]s, and a few special [[Depths]] [[vault]]s. Otherwise, these scales can rarely be found on the floor or in a [[shop]].\n\n==Desirability==\nA very strong option for [[EV]]-based characters, often considered to be the \"ultimate\" base armour for these characters. It has the same protection as a plate armour, but much less encumbrance, meaning it won't hinder [[Dodging]], [[Spellcasting]], and [[Ranged Weapons]] as much. Unfortunately, they are far too rare to rely on finding one before [[extended]]. Melee brutes should also consider it, since it's better than plate armour.\n\nCompared to [[fire dragon scales|fire]] and [[ice dragon scales]], pearl scales have the same encumbrance, but higher AC and max enchantment. Pearl scales give rN+ with no vulnerability, while the former two scales make you vulnerable to the opposite element.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], this item was known as pearl dragon armour in-game and was obtained by using a [[scroll of enchant armour]] on a [[pearl dragon hide]].\n*Prior to [[0.10]], this armour was impossible to [[curse]] by any means. This was changed, the rationale being that pearl dragon armour is created by mutilating a holy creature's corpse, as opposed to being an item blessed by [[the Shining One]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

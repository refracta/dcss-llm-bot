It is enchanted to provide mages with immeasurable power, and more than a little overconfidence...}}\n[[File:Robe_of_folly.png]] '''''the +4 robe of Folly'''''\n\n+4 [[robe]]\n\nBrilliance ([[archmagi|Boosts spellpower]] and [[potion of brilliance|halves mana costs]])<br>\n-âˆž [[Will]]<br>\n+8 [[intelligence]]<br>\n\n==Desirability==\nWith a massive boost to every aspect of spellcasting, the '''robe of Folly'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|955}}</ref> is a tempting piece of armour for any spellcaster. However, its drawback of setting your [[willpower]] to 0 should not be taken lightly -- an encounter with an opponent capable of [[banish]]ing or [[paralyse|paralysing]] you can very easily get you killed. Even [[confusion]] can be devastating.\n\nMany will find this robe not worth the risk when seeking to successfully retrieve the [[Orb of Zot|Orb]] and escape. Still, it allows casters to inflict fantastic amounts of carnage by spamming powerful, wide-range spells like [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]] or [[Starburst]]; if you ''do'' choose to make use of it, just don't be surprised when this robe becomes your folly.\n\nNote that some [[Lair]] rune branches (the [[Spider's Nest]], [[Snake Pit]], and [[Shoals]]) do not have ''immediately'' threatening enchantments. [[Mesmerisation]], for example, is still hard to deal with, but not immediately life-threatening. But even in these branches, you can find certain [[unique]]s like [[Louise]] and [[Rupert]] with deadly hexes, and any humanoid monster can pick up a [[wand of paralysis]] (if this wand [[alternate items|has generated]]).\n\nUnlike regular robes of [[Archmagi]], [[potions of brilliance]] do nothing while you're wearing this robe.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the robe of Folly had [[Archmagi]] instead of Brilliance, reduced will by -80, had +5 intelligence, and had a 50% chance to [[curse]] on equip.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the robe of Folly's [[magic resistance]] penalty was -100 instead of -80.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], the robe of Folly was a strictly bad artifact. It was a -1 robe that completely prevented spellcasting instead of having an MR malus.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

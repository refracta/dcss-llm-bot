It works only on animals amenable to domestication. Sometimes it will tame the animals permanently. Most amenable animals are various dogs, frogs, rats and bats that do not live too long in the dangerous dungeons. Only a few, like trained wyverns, death yaks, war dogs, spiny frogs, wargs or polar bears may be of some aid for a while.}}\n\n'''Tame Beasts''' was a level 5 [[Enchantments]] spell which attempted to charm every \"domesticated\" animal in your [[LOS]]. The [[undead]] could not use this spell.\n\n;Tameable Monsters\n:[[Giant bat]]\n:[[Rat]]\n:[[Grey rat]]\n:[[Green rat]]\n:[[Orange rat]]\n:[[Jackal]]\n:[[Hound]]\n:[[War dog]]\n:[[Wolf]]\n:[[Warg]]\n:[[Giant frog]]\n:[[Giant toad]]\n:[[Spiny frog]]\n:[[Blink frog]]\n:[[Hog]]\n:[[Sheep]]\n:[[Yak]]\n:[[Death yak]]\n:[[Bear]]\n:[[Black bear]]\n:[[Grizzly bear]]\n:[[Polar bear]]\n:[[Hippogriff]]\n:[[Griffon]]\n:[[Wyvern]]\n\nIt was cast with a 50% power boost on hounds, war dogs, and ([[hill orc]]s only) on wargs. It checked [[MR]] for each, and charmed it if successful, creating a temporary thrall unless your spell power passed a roll of d100 < d(Power/10), in which case it became permanently friendly.\n\n==History==\nThis spell was removed in [[0.8]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

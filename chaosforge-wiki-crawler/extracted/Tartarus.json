[[Tzitzimitl|Tzitzimimeh]] and [[Tormentor]]s are quite dangerous denizens: living characters will get pelted with [[Bolt of Draining]] and [[Symbol of Torment]], undead and [[lichform]] characters will be torn apart with [[Dispel Undead]]. [[Tainted leviathan]]'s take advantage of the reduced willpower by [[mesmerise|mesmerising]] you into a large miasma ring, while [[putrid mouth]]s shoot said miasma at you. You'll also bump into [[bone dragon]]s, [[shadow dragon]]s, [[reaper]]s, [[soul eater]]s, [[lich]]es, [[silent spectre]]s and the odd [[Executioner]]. [[Doom hound]]s can inflict the [[Doom_Howl|Howl]] status condition on you, quickly bringing in packs of monsters to your location.\n\nLike every other hell, the first six levels contain one exit, one staircase down, and are drastically shorter.\n\nThe last level contains the bone [[rune of Zot]], guarded by the fearsome arch-fiend [[Ereshkigal]].\n\n===Hell Effects===\nIn addition to the universal [[Hell#Hell's Mystical Force|forces of hell]], Tartarus' oppressive rot cuts your [[willpower]] in half.\n\n==Recommendations==\nDifficulty-wise, Tartarus is a mixed bag. On the one hand, rN+++ confers complete immunity to negative energy, unlike other resistances. On the other hand, the demons you meet here are varied and dangerous. [[Paralysis]] is an extreme threat; Tartarus cuts your will, so it's impossible to 100% resist paralysis from [[dread lich]]es and [[Ereshkigal]].\n\nThe last level of Tartarus is often deceptive. In some layouts you'll have to excavate rock walls or search for doors to reach treasure vaults, including the one in which the rune is hidden, near where you encounter Ereshkigal.\n\nIf you are a magic user, make sure you have a strategy for the inevitable [[Silence]] auras you will encounter, both from silent spectres and Ereshkigal herself. Ereshkigal's silence range is 5 tiles, much more manageable than the silent spectres' permanent 12-tile aura. If you are relying on [[Necromutation]], watch out - it may wear off when you're in a silence field.\n\n==Trivia==\nIn ancient Greek mythology, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus Tartarus] is a deep, gloomy place, a pit, or an abyss used as a dungeon of torment and suffering that resides beneath the underworld. Where Hades was the afterlife for common humans (and failed heroes), Tartarus was the prison for the Titans, the overthrown parents to the Olympian gods.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], willpower was not capped at 200 (Will+++++), meaning that it was possible (and often advisable) to stack willpower high enough to essentially ignore the will-halving effects.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Tartarus did not halve vistors' willpower, had regular sized floors, an overall weaker set of monsters, and a miscast-based set of unique hell effects.\n\n{{branches}}\n\n [[Category:Hells]]"}

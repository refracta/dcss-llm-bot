The effect is surprisingly subtle, and unwary victims may sleep through it entirely.}}\n\nQuaffing a '''potion of attraction''' will pull all monsters towards you for several turns. Every turn, monsters in [[LOS]] will be pulled 3-ish tiles closer. As monsters are translocated towards you, it won't [[sleep|wake]] them up, and they can pass through obstacles like [[deep water]]. (You can't use this potion to make monsters fall into deep water/lava, though.)\n\n==Strategy==\nBeing able to forcibly pull monsters towards you can serve a variety of different purposes:\n\n*Pull monsters into [[cloud]]s or other areas of effect to maximize their impact. A [[scroll of poison]] works well, as do spells like [[Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot]] or [[Eringya's Noxious Bog]]. You can also pull pesky spellcasters into a zone of [[Silence]] surrounding you.\n*Pull sleeping monsters towards your stealthy [[stab]]ber; attraction doesn't disturb sleeping monsters.\n*Pull ranged enemies, e.g. [[centaur (monster)|centaurs]], [[faun]]s, [[satyr]]s, and [[merfolk javelineer]]s, next to you. This works especially well against the likes of [[deep elf archer]]s, who like to blink around.\n**Allows you to [[stair dance]] enemies more reliably.\n**If you are stuck in [[Tree Form]], the potion can help you fight monsters with [[polearm]]s.\n*Attraction affects allies too, which can be useful if your character is faster than your summons. [[Necromancer]]s can use the potion to drag a crowd of slow zombies into fights.\n\nBut attraction is not without serious risks. It can pull things that you weren't aware of; dangerous monsters can wander into LOS ''after'' you quaff the potion. And attraction makes it very difficult to escape. If a fight turns sour, you have a few options. You'll be quickly surrounded, and even a [[scroll of blinking]] only gives you a turn or two to breathe. A [[scroll of teleport]] can bring you out of the situation, but it doesn't stop the effect. A [[potion of cancellation]] will end the effect, but you'll still be surrounded.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], potions of attraction physically dragged monsters closer instead of translocating them.\n*Potions of attraction replaced the [[potion of stabbing]] in [[0.26]]."}

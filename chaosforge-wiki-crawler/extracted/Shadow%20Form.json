While in this form, you are permanently invisible and are immune to poison, draining, torment, and hostile enchantments. All incoming damage will be halved, and you will bleed smoke on any incoming attack. However, your ability to deal damage in melee and with ranged attacks will be halved, your spellcasting power will be greatly hampered, and your skills will be further drained when taking damage.\nInvocations skill increases the duration of the transformation.}}\n\n'''Shadow Form''' is a transformation which turns you into an immaterial shadow being. This is an entirely defensive form, greatly increasing your ability to survive dangerous situations, though at significant cost to your offensive capabilities. \n\nShadow Form is only available through worshiping [[Dithmenos]], costs 9 [[MP]], 10-15 [[piety]], and lightly [[draining|drains]] you when activated.\n\n==Useful Info==\nShadow Form does the following:\n\n'''Combat'''\n*[[Invisibility]]\n*×50% damage to [[weapon]]s (including [[Unarmed Combat]])\n*Two negative [[spell power]] enhancements\n*50% reduction to all damage taken\n\n'''Resistances'''\n*[[Poison resistance|Poison immunity]]\n*Immunity to external sources of [[draining]]\n*[[Torment]] immunity\n*Will∞ (immune to hostile enchantments)\n*Immunity to [[petrification]]\n*Immunity to [[Corona|backlighting]] (e.g. [[Corona]] or glow from high [[magic contamination]])\n\n'''Other'''\n*You [[scroll of fog|bleed smoke]] when taking damage\n*Taking damage inflicts further, unavoidable [[drain]]\n*[[Stealth]] score multiplied by 2\n\nShadow Form does not [[meld]] any equipment and does not [[fly]]. Despite its similarity to the [[undead]], Shadow Form is not vulnerable to [[holy]] or [[holy wrath]]. It uses the same size and movement speed as your base species.\n\nEven the [[undead]] can use Shadow Form.\n\n==Strategy==\nShadow Form is clearly meant as an escape tool. The combination of [[invisibility]] and bleeding [[scroll of fog|smoke clouds]] allows you to shake off ranged attackers and unintelligent melee enemies. Should you be chased by something that can [[see invisible]] and keep up with you, increasing your speed with [[Swiftness]] or a [[potion of haste]], or simply [[teleport]]ing away, is recommended.\n\nIt's also perfect for ninja'ing runes. You can break into a rune vault, grab the rune via [[Apportation]], and teleport or [[Translocations|translocate]] away. The 50% damage reduction is very significant, even before considering the resistances. However, you'll almost certainly wind up with heavy draining once you're in the clear. And, if you haven't cleared the rest of the floor, your getaway might not be as safe as you'd hoped.\n\nAs a general combat buff, Shadow Form is very costly, and usually counter productive. It inflicts heavy [[drain]], costs a lot of piety, and reduces your offensive capabilities. But it ''does'' have a niche. Dedicated [[stab]]bers can take advantage of the invis-stabs. The infinite [[willpower]] can be used to block hex effects, whether from [[unique]]s or standard monsters. Could also be used for poison resistance in a pinch, though there are usually better sources.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*If you aren't flying, watch out for [[water]], which will reveal your position to monsters.\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

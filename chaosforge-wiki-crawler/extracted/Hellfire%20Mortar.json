{"title":"Hellfire Mortar","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hellfire_Mortar","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{stub}}\n{{spell info}} \n\n'''Hellfire Mortar''' is a level 7 [[Fire Magic|Fire]]/[[Earth]] spell that creates a line of temporary [[lava]] in a chosen direction (even through walls) and spawns a [[hellfire mortar (monster)|hellfire mortar]] that moves along that line of lava, firing autonomously at nearby targets while it does so. The mortar's [[HD]] is <code>3 + pow / 28</code>.\n\nThe mortar fires [[Bolt of Magma|Bolts of Magma]] at up to 2 different random enemy targets each turn, then moves 1 tile further along the path that was carved out for it. When it reaches the end of this path (or a monster blocks its attempt to move), it will disappear.\n\n==Useful Info==\n\n==Strategy==\n\n==History==\n*Added in [[0.32]]"}

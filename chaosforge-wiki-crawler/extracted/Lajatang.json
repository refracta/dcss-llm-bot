It is a two handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Lajatangs''' are the most powerful staves, as far as melee combat is concerned. For their damage output, lajatangs have a remarkably low base delay, meaning they require less skill to use effectively.\n\nAs chopping weapons, lajatangs will cut off [[hydra]] heads. As Staves, lajatangs may generate with the [[speed brand]].\n\n==Strategy==\nAt [[minimum delay]], lajatangs are worse than comparable options like [[great mace]]s or [[great sword]]s. However, lajatangs require much less skill than competitors - 14 rather than 20 skill. And if you were already using a [[quarterstaff]], you might as well use a lajatang (if you find one).\n\nTrue to its description, lajatangs are rare. [[Agnes]] always carries a lajatang. You can occasionally find lajatangs on [[spriggan defender]]s.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Lajatang1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Lajatang2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Lajatang3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]\n|-\n| '''[[Lajatang of Order]]''' || [[File:Lajatang of Order.png]]\n|}\n\n{{weapons}}\n\n[[Category:Staves]]"}

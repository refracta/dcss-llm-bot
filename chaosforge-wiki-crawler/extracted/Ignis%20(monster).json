While high [[magic resistance]] will render them almost harmless, it's best not to let them live, and sneaky characters should be extremely careful traveling while illuminated.\n\n==History==\nIgnes were considered for inclusion in [[0.14]], but were disabled shortly after being introduced and later removed before making it into any stable release."}

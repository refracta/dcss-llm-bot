Additionally, this [[amulet]] grants a rank of [[negative energy]] resistance (rN+).\n\n==Desirability==\nNot terribly high. Although the rN+ is helpful for general use, it is far from critical, and warding is useless in most situations. Even when summoning opponents appear, it's usually best to kill them as quickly as possible or flee if too many summoned enemies appear, especially because warding has no impact on the ranged or magical attacks of summoned creatures. It can make an encounter with [[Eustachio]] or [[Wucad Mu's Monastery]] significantly easier, but in general this is not a terribly helpful amulet.\n\n==History==\nThe amulet of warding was removed in [[0.18]].\n\n{{amulets}}"}

{"title":"Summon Guardian Golem","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summon_Guardian_Golem","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n[[Summon Guardian Golem]] is a level 3 [[Hexes]]/[[Summonings|Summoning]] spell which summons a [[guardian golem]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nSummons a single [[guardian golem]]; it cannot attack, but it will immediately [[Injury Bond|share damage]] done to other allies (but not the caster). When the golem is below 1/2 health, still alive, and can see an enemy, it will always gain the explosive [[Inner Flame]] status.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-abil.cc|1098}}</ref> Higher [[spell power]] increases the golem's durability.\n\nThe golem's [[hit dice]] is <code>4 + <power> / 16</code> (randomly rounded).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|spl-summoning.cc|878}}</ref>\n\nDuration of the summon is around 27 turns. It is not affected by spell power. \n\nThere is a summon limit of 1; casting the spell again will cause the old summon to very quickly time out.\n\n==Strategy==\nGuardian Golem serves two purposes. The first is defensive; the injury bond will increase the effective health of your summons. The golem can also take hits on its own. Even if you have no other allies, the golem still has enough durability to stand in a corridor and take a few hits while you retreat. It is also completely immune to [[Hexes]] and has resistances to several elements. Just be sure to keep a safe distance in case it explodes.\n\nThe second is offensive. When the golem is damaged enough, it will cause an [[Inner Flame]] explosion - a 3x3 explosion dealing 3d20 damage and creating [[Clouds#flame|flame clouds]]. Much stronger than any level 3 [[Conjurations]] spell, but it requires some set-up. You can summon a golem in a corridor or other convenient chokepoint, take a step or two back, and let the fireworks ensure. (Since your golem won't attack enemies, enemies will ignore the golem unless it is in their way.)\n\nNote that, in order for the golem to explode, you'll need to fight monster strong enough to kill it in time. [[Gnoll (monster)|Gnoll]] packs or [[ogre (monster)|ogres]] can kill a golem in time. Weaker monsters like basic [[orc]]s won't. \n\n===Tips and Tricks===\n*If you're next to a golem about to explode, you can summon another golem, causing the previous one to quickly dissipate. \n*Gods that forbid harming your allies will not mind a Guardian Golem incidentally blowing up.\n*Golems won't receive Inner Flame if there are only [[invisible]] enemies in its [[LOS]].\n\n==History==\n*This spell was removed in [[0.31]]. [[Martyr's Knell]] and [[Summon Blazeheart Golem]] were introduced in its place.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], guardian golems only had a 1/4 chance to be lit with Inner Flame.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Summon Guardian Golem was a level 4 Summonings/Hexes spell.\n*Summon Guardian Golem was added in [[0.14]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

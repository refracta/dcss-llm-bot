{"title":"Profane servitor","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Profane_servitor","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nProfane servitors are angels of [[the Shining One]] who have been corrupted by [[Yredelemnul]]. Profane servitors are resistant to most damage types, including pure [[holy]] damage, and have vampiric/draining attacks. Their [[umbra]] lowers your [[to-hit]] slightly. Profane servitors are rare, occasionally encountered while wandering [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], and certain [[Crypt]]:3 layouts.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Demon]]s, [[undead]], and worshippers of [[Dithmenos]] or [[Yredelemnul]] are immune to the umbra's penalties. This includes monsters that worship Yredelemnul. Any [[halo]] effects will cancel out the umbra.\n*Although profane servitors are resistant to holy attacks (e.g. Cleansing Flame), they are still vulnerable to weapons of [[holy wrath]].\n*Keep in mind that they aren't resistant to fire and acid damage.\n\n==History==\nProfane servitors were added in [[0.10]]."}

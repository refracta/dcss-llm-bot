{"title":"Vhi's Electric Charge","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Vhi%27s_Electric_Charge","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}{{spell info}}\n'''Vhi's Electric Charge''' is a level 4 [[Translocations]]/[[Air Magic]] spell which causes the user to charge at an enemy, bypassing most obstacles in the way.\n\n[[Warper]]s start with this spell in their libraries.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen cast, the spell will move the user up to the target and make a boosted melee attack. You must be at least 2 tiles away from the target (i.e. this spell must move you at least 1 tile). It bypasses [[monster]]s, impassable liquids ([[deep water]]/[[lava]]), [[trap]]s, and other hazards in your path. It can ''not'' pass through translucent [[wall]]s/[[door]]s, [[iron grate]]s, or statues. If there is a monster at your destination spot, it will be displaced. However, you must be able to stand on your destination tile otherwise.\n\nThis spell uses your melee attack for damage. Time to cast will be as long as either one move or one swing, whichever is higher. [[Auxiliary attack]]s and [[cleaving]] still apply when charging, but you can't [[stab]].\n\nFor each tile moved, you will gain a bonus of +33% electric damage, for a maximum of +100% damage at 3 tiles. Regardless of distance, you will deal an additional <code>power/1.5</code>% electric damage - another +33% at max power. Damage bonuses are additive, so if you move 3 or more tiles, you will deal +133% damage against non-resistant targets. In addition, this attack gains +5 [[to-hit]].\n\nThis spell does not work if you cannot translocate ([[Dimension Anchor|-Tele]] or [[Formicid]]'s [[stasis]]) or move.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe opposite of [[Lesser Beckoning]], Vhi's Electric Charge allows you to approach enemies with some extra damage. It can also be used to reposition yourself mid-battle. Assuming you have a suitable target to charge at, you can use this spell to move and attack in the same turn. You'll avoid [[attacks of opportunity]], too.\n \nBe careful when using this spell; you could charge straight into a pack of monsters without realizing it. Thankfully, it is not a particularly loud spell.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|[[player ghost]]s will replace this spell with '''Vhi's Electrolunge''', which deals damage based on HD instead of distance and weapon damage.}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Vhi's Electric Charge was level 3.\n*Vhi's Electric Charge was added in [[0.30]], using the roll mechanic from [[Palentonga]]."}

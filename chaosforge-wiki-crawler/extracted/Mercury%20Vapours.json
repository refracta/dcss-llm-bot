{"title":"Mercury Vapours","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mercury_Vapours","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Mercury Vapours''' is a level 2 Alchemy/Air spell which causes [[smite-targeted]] poison on any non-resistant enemy within [[line of sight]], and attempts to [[weak]]en monsters in a 3×3 area.\n\n[[Alchemist]]s start with this spell in their libraries.\n\n==Useful Info==\nInflicts [[poison]] on a central 'main' target, if they don't have poison resistance. It has an independent chance to inflict weakness on the central target and all creatures adjacent.\n\nThe main target gains <code>pow/25</code> (min. 1) poison \"[[Poison#Monster Formula|stacks]]\".<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|spl-damage.cc|3566}}</ref> If the target does not currently have poison, 1 extra poison stack is inflicted. If the player is the central target, this spell inflicts 2d6 poison damage instead of any stacks. Creatures with [[poison resistance]] cannot be poisoned at all by this spell.\n\nIn addition, each monster in a 3×3 area has a chance to gain the [[weak]] status, which reduces their melee damage by ×66%. The main target has a <code>(83% - <12 * [[HD]]> + <1.5 * power>) * 1.15</code> chance to be weakened.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|spl-damage.cc|3529}}</ref> Creatures that aren't the main target are ×66% as likely to be weakened.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|spl-damage.cc|3589}}</ref> Poison resistance or immunity does ''not'' prevent the weakness. Keep in mind that you are not immune to the effect.\n\nHigher poison stacks mean more damage per turn, according to the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Average poison damage per 1.0 turn\n|-\n!rowspan=2 | # Stacks !! colspan=2 | Damage !! rowspan=2 | Description\n|-\n!width=\"50pt\" | Normal !! width=\"50pt\" | rPois-\n|-\n|1 || 0.75 || 1.75 || Poisoned\n|-\n|2 || 1 || 3 || Very poisoned\n|-\n|3 || 1.25 || 4.25 || Very poisoned\n|-\n|4 || 2.5 || 6.5 || Extremely poisoned\n|}\n\n==Strategy==\nMercury Vapours never misses, ignores AC, and is one of the few ways to inflict the [[weak]] status. It can be useful even if you aren't into [[Alchemy]]. The downside is that it relies on poison - damage is done over time, and cannot damage foes with poison resistance. These shouldn't be dealbreakers, however. You can [[kite]] susceptible enemies: apply a few stacks of poison, then retreat a few tiles, allowing the poison to do its job.\n\nAt low skill levels, [[Sting]] deals more damage/MP, but this spell is perfectly accurate and inflicts weak. In the early game, you may want to cast Mercury Vapours once per monster (to inflict weak and the extra poison), then use Sting. Once you gain more [[spell power]], though, Mercury Vapours is more efficient, so feel free to forget Sting.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*[[Ignite Poison]] is quite strong with any source of poison, including this spell. It converts poison stacks into instant damage, with a great increase in damage. The Ignite Poison + Mercury Vapours combo offers decent damage, high reliability, and good MP efficiency for its level.\n*In Tiles, you can count poison stacks by the number of green poison drops on the monster. 1 drop is 1 stack (poisoned), 2 drops is 2-3 stacks (very poisoned), and 3 drops is 4 stacks (extremely poisoned).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], this spell was known as '''Poisonous Vapours'''. It was a level 2 [[Poison Magic]]/[[Air]] spell, had full [[LOS]] range, but did not have a chance to weaken foes. Also, it inflicted <code>power/15</code> stacks of poison, but with no bonus against non-poisoned foes.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Poisonous Vapours would create a short lived [[cloud]] instead of inflicting poison directly. Thus it wouldn't work if there was a cloud already there (including from the spell itself). Also, [[Vehumet]] did not consider this spell \"destructive\".\n*Poisonous Vapours was added in [[0.20]].\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

{"title":"Orc priest","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Orc_priest","type":"raw","data":"{{version|018}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{list of | orcs}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Orc priests''' introduce [[smiting]] into the game at levels where smiting is scary. So long as an orc priest is visible, it is capable of instantly dealing 7-17 damage to you in a single turn. Even worse, they usually appear along with a pack of [[orc]]s, [[orc wizard]]s, and [[orc warrior]]s, and can appear as early as [[Dungeon]]:2.\n\n[[Hill orc]] characters will be given the opportunity to convert to [[Beogh]] whenever they encounter an orc priest. Once you see the \"Beogh\" status effect appear, press 'a' and then 'Y' to become a believer.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Orc priests can be neutralized by hiding from their [[line of sight]] (they will try to rush you if they can't smite you), making them confused/paralyzed, or trapping them in a [[throwing net]].\n*Avoid fights where they get to cast against you for several turns while you have to chop a path through their allies.\n*Very early characters may wish to avoid them entirely, if they don't have an easy way of killing them quickly. If you see more than one priest at a time, start running.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.13]], [[hill orc]] characters had to either begin the game as a [[priest]] or find an appropriate altar in the [[Orcish Mines]] to worship Beogh.\n\n[[Category:Orc]]"}

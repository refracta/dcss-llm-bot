{"title":"Virulence","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Virulence","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{flavour|Makes a targeted creature more vulnerable to poison.}}\n\n'''Virulence''' is a monsters-only spell which strips its target of their [[poison]] resistance by inflicting the rPois- [[status effect]]. It also increases the current poison level of its victim to 150% of its current level. This has little effect when cast on a lightly poisoned character, but can lead to a massive increase in damage taken for characters already at red or dark red poison levels. The spell must overcome your [[willpower]] to affect you.\n\nRemember that no matter how much poison you have coursing through your veins, one [[potion of curing]] will remove all of it.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\nVirulence was added in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

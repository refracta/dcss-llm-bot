{"title":"Death Knight (background)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Death_Knight_(background)","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n''This article covers the obsolete player [[background]]. For the monster, see [[death knight]].''\n{{flavour|The Death Knight is a fighter who aligns him or herself with the powers of death and worships Yredelemnul the Dark, who will soon grant the ability to re-animate the dead.}}\n'''Death knights''' are unholy warriors who worship [[Yredelemnul]], the god of Death. They are charged with opposing all things [[holy]], but in return they gain power over death and the [[undead]].\n\nDeath knights start with 35 [[piety]].\n\n==Preferred Races==\n\n[[Human]], [[Hill Orc]], [[Troll]], [[Merfolk]], [[Minotaur]], and [[Demonspawn]] are the recommended races if you pick a Death Knight Background.\n\n==Racial Restrictions==\nNeither [[demigod]]s nor [[gargoyle]]s can be death knights, as neither can worship Yredelemnul.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+1 [[weapon of choice]] ([[hand axe]], [[spear]], [[short sword]], [[mace]], or [[falchion]])\n*+0 [[leather armour]]\n*[[Bread ration]]\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Fighting]]: 2\n*Chosen Weapon's Skill: 2\n*[[Armour]]: 1\n*[[Dodging]]: 1\n*[[Invocations]]: 3\n\nChoosing Death Knight adds 5 to your starting [[Strength]], 3 to your starting [[Intelligence]] and 4 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\n[[Yredelemnul]]'s powers are primarily for the creation and enslavement of [[undead]], so this background plays a little like a [[summoner]] with decent melee ability. Like many religious backgrounds, the role of death knight suits less magical species who need an alternate source of power. Although costly, [[Yredelemnul]]'s Mirror Damage ability allows you to make specific dangerous encounters dramatically easier, while Life Drain is an excellent panic button when dealing with the living. Later in the game, his ability to enslave souls can make worthy slaves even of [[unique]]s.\n\n==History==\nDeath Knights were removed in [[0.16]].\n\nPrior to [[0.14]], death knights started with 20 [[gold]].\n\nOriginally, death knights had a choice between starting with a [[book of Necromancy]] or worshiping Yredelemnul. In [[0.7]], the background was removed entirely, and [[priest]]s were given the option to start with Yred. The ability to start with a book of Necromancy was deemed redundant to and also weaker than a plain [[necromancer]], and thus removed; [[reaver]]s were removed for a similar reason a version later. In [[0.8]], death knights were restored, this time only worshiping Yred (with priests correspondingly losing that option).\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]\n[[Category:Obsolete backgrounds]]"}

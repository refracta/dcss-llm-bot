The mouth may devour slain creatures, healing the user to an extent increased by the user's Shapeshifting skill and the power of the creature eaten. Skill also increases the damage done by the maw.}}\n\n[[File:maw talisman.png]] A '''maw talisman''' is a [[talisman]] that changes you into '''Maw Form''', which adds a giant, gnashing mouth in place of the stomach.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen e'''V'''oked, a maw talisman turns you into Maw Form, which lasts until you end the form. Entering or exiting a form takes 5 turns.\n\nMaw Form has the following effects:\n\n'''Combat Bonuses'''\n*'''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' 5 base damage.\n*'''Maw aux attack:''' Adds a biting [[auxiliary attack]]. Whenever you make a melee attack, weapon or not, you have a flat 75% chance to make a maw attack. Unlike other aux attacks, this chance is not impacted by XL. Damage scales linearly with Shapeshifting skill:\n**Below minimum: 3 damage (0 skill) - 12 damage (10 skill)\n**Above minimum: 12 damage (10 skill) - 20 damage (19 skill) ; +0.8 damage per level\n*'''Devour on kill:''' Whenever you kill a enemy that can drop a [[corpse]] in melee, you have an independent 66% chance to devour it, healing you. You'll heal the ''lesser of'' <code>[[HD]] + 1d(HD)</code> or <code>[[Shapeshifting]] + 1d20</code>. You don't need to make a maw attack to devour.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|melee-attack.cc|781}}</ref>\n**[[Beogh]] followers will not devour [[list of orcs|orcs]]. [[Gozag]] turns corpses into gold, stopping this effect. [[Death drop]]s still generate, so you won't miss out on [[dragon scales]] and the like. However, [[Animate Dead]] and [[Infestation]] don't function if you devour.\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n*'''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' [[Body armour]].\n\nMaw Form does not block any [[mutation]]s, does not change your [[size]], and gives no innate bonus to HP / [[AC]].\n\nMaw Form has a minimum [[Shapeshifting]] skill of 10, below which you get an [[Talisman#Skill|HP penalty]], and the maw's damage scales down. It has a maximum skill of 19, where skill has no further impact.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe maw [[auxiliary attack]] doesn't care about how hard you hit, but the faster you swing, the more maw attacks you'll proc. Therefore, it works best on fast weapons. Skilled Unarmed Combat is obvious, but it also works well with [[Short Blades]] and [[demon whip]]s.\n\n==History==\n*Maw talismans were introduced in [[0.31]], along with talismans themselves. Maw Form had no previous counterpart. \n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Forms}}"}

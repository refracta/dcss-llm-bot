{"title":"Kobold demonologist","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Kobold_demonologist","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of|kobolds}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Kobold demonologists''' are [[kobold (monster)|kobolds]] that have learned how to summon [[lesser demon|lesser]] and [[common demon|common]] [[demon]]s. Fortunately, they aren't much more durable than their non-magical brethren. They are uncommon, most commonly encountered late in [[the Dungeon]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They are fairly fragile, so it's usually a better idea to kill the summoner rather than the summoned demons. Once the demonologist dies, its summons vanish with it.\n*Summon Demon can create all kinds of dangerous enemies, such as [[sixfirhies]] and [[neqoxec]]s, so take them out quickly. Having a piercing, [[smite-targeted]], or AOE attack can be useful to attack through summons and other kobolds.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], you could meet '''an apprentice kobold demonologist''' in [[the Sewers]]. This monster was only capable of summoning [[lesser demon]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], kobold demonologists were considerably more fragile.\n\n[[Category:Kobold]]"}

This is a powerful, somewhat inaccurate bolt, which ends all [[dispellable effects]] when it hits.\n\nPlayers will deal <code>6d(4.16 + 3.5 * [[Evocations]]/9)</code> damage with this wand.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|zap-data.h|1375}}<br>Specifically, you'll deal <code>6d(15/6 * pow/9)</code> damage, for pow = <code>15 + 3.5 * Evocations</code> ({{source ref|0.30.0|evoke.cc|177}}). If you have the [[MP-Powered Wands]] mutation, then your \"pow\" gains a +33% boost.</ref> Players have a [[to-hit]] of <code>10.6 + (3.5 * Evocations)/25</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|zap-data.h|1376}}</ref>\n\nMonsters will deal <code>3d(7 + (30 + [[HD]])/14)</code> damage with this wand.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|zap-data.h|1377}}</ref>\n\nIt is [[alternate items|mutually exclusive]] with the [[wand of acid]] and [[wand of light]]. When compared to acid and light, the wand of quicksilver has more range (7 tiles), and deals slightly more damage\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*There are many effects that you can dispel. In addition to every effect from a [[potion of cancellation]], quicksilver can also stop effects like [[Word of Recall]] and [[Bind Souls]].\n*Very useful versus powerful magic-users who immediately cast [[Haste]] to close distance.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], it was possible to target yourself with this wand.\n*The wand of quicksilver was added in [[0.29]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{wands}}"}

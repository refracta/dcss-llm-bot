It was first wielded by the archangel Lucriel, who, on seeing the suffering of the first mortals, led them as an army against the cruelty of the gods. The ragged survivors of Lucriel's army took this weapon with them into the wilderness, the sole remnant of an archangel's virtue.}}\n\n[[File:condemnation.png]] '''''The +8 trishula \"Condemnation\"'''''\n\n+8 [[trishula]]<br>\n[[Holy wrath]] brand<br>\n[[Negative energy|rN+]]<br>\n[[Flight]]<br>\nMay make [[noise]] when striking foes<br>\nInflicts [[Anguish]] for 4-8 turns on hit\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Condemnation''' is quite useful for any [[Polearms]] user by being a +8 [[trishula]]. In addition, enemies hit by the trident will take damage equal to the damage they deal, bypassing [[AC]] and [[EV]]. This effect works especially well with [[summon]]s; damage to them also triggers Anguish, and Condemnation can reach past your allies to strike enemies from a position of relative safety. \n\nFor non-summoners, Condemnation's intrinsics are nice, but its [[holy wrath]] brand is most viable for the demon-infested [[extended game]]. Outside of extended, a [[demon trident]] of a damaging brand will be more consistent as a main weapon.\n\nLike all [[trishula]]s, Condemnation cannot be wielded by [[undead]] or [[demonspawn]] players.\n\n==History==\n*Condemnation was introduced in [[0.29]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Polearms]]"}

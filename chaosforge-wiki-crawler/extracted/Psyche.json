{"title":"Psyche","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Psyche","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Psyche the Insane Magess''' is a fast-moving [[unique]] mage. Her [[Chain of Chaos]] spell can cause [[paralysis]] or banish you to [[the Abyss]], making her deadly. She also spawns with either a [[chaos]] (75% odds) or [[distortion]] (25%) [[dagger]], which can do the same things in melee.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:8-12\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Avoid her if at all possible. She's fast, so you can't just run away. Every time you are hit by Chain of Chaos, you'll have a 1% chance to be paralysed and 1% chance to be banished; both effects can lead to ''unavoidable death''. Skipping a floor that has Psyche is often worth it.\n**Unfortunately, she can spawn on the floors that [[Lair]] or [[Orcish Mines|Orc]] are on. If you decide to skip the floor, a [[scroll of magic mapping]] can scout out any branch entrances you'd be missing.\n**Assuming you don't have amazing [[willpower]], chaos is less likely to banish you than [[Erolcha]] or [[wizard (monster)|wizards]], and less likely to paralyse you than [[ogre mage]]s. If you find these kinds of threats (and are forced to fight one of them), Psyche is probably the lesser of two evils.\n*She has low [[HD]], so [[Mephitic Cloud]] is particularly effective.\n\n==Trivia==\nPsyche is a character from the Greek myth of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid_and_Psyche Eros and Psyche]. In this myth, Psyche was a girl who fell in love with the god of desire, Eros, but needed to complete several impossible tasks before his mother Aphrodite would allow them to be wed.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Psyche had the following spell set: [[Cantrip]], [[Magic Dart]], [[Throw Frost]], [[Throw Flame]], [[Haste]], and [[Invisibility]]. Also, she only had 20 [[willpower]].\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

{"title":"Eldritch tentacle","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Eldritch_tentacle","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | tentacles}}\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Eldritch tentacles''' are the limbs of some gargantuan horror reaching through a [[Malign Gateway]]. They are fast, powerful, immune to nearly all elemental magic, and have [[chaotic]] attacks. Malign Gateway's tentacles are loyal to their summoner when they first arrive, though they can turn hostile. They can also appear as a result of activating a [[Zot trap]], in the [[Roulette of Golubria]], and certain [[Abyss]] themed vaults.\n\nWhen connected to the gateway, tentacles can reach out four spaces from their origin points. If/when the gateway ends, the tentacle will be severed; it will turn [[neutral]] and flail about for a bit before dying.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Hostile eldritch tentacles are very deadly due to their chaotic attacks. These attacks can [[paralyse]] you, or turn you into a [[bad form]].\n*In spite of the fact that dripping tentacle horrors are generally seen as [[evil]], eldritch tentacle biology is so alien that they are treated as [[nonliving]], and thus suffer no extra harm from holy attacks. [[Silver]] missiles deal additional damage, and non-elemental [[Conjurations]], [[Earth Magic]], and [[Airstrike]] will also harm it effectively.\n*Casters and ranged specialists can stand just beyond their reach and fling stuff at them until they die. Melee fighters will have a harder time, as the tentacle will retract if attacked from beyond its reach (poking it to death with a [[Polearm]] won't work).\n*Because only one Malign Gateway can be open at a time, only one (summoned) eldritch tentacle can exist at a time. Casting a Malign Gateway prevents enemies from doing so, and vice versa.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], the effects of [[chaos]] attacks were modified. This is generally a buff to the eldritch tentacle. See the [[Chaos#History|chaos]] article for more details.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], you could enter through a portal of the Malign Gateway if the tentacle was killed. This would [[blink]] you and cause some damage."}

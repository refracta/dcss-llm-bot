{"title":"Vampire Summon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Vampire_Summon","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n'''Vampire Summon''' is a monsters-only spell which summons creatures much like the spell [[Summon Small Mammals]]. However, it summons a greater number of mammals (3-5) and replaces the harmless [[quokka]]s with dangerous [[orange rat]]s.\n\nThe following enemies cast Vampire Summon:\n*[[Vampire (monster)|Vampire]]\n*[[Vampire knight]]\n*[[Deep elf summoner]]\n\n==Strategy==\nThis spell is mostly just annoying. By the time you encounter vampires, you're usually quite well prepared to handle even orange rats. rN+ can help if you really don't want to get drained, though usually if you're careful and prioritize the orange rats, you won't lose much XP anyway.\n\n==History==\nThis spell was removed in [[0.12]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

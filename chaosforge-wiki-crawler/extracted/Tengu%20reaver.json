{"title":"Tengu reaver","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tengu_reaver","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | tengu}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Tengu reavers''' are the most dangerous [[list of tengu|tengu]] opponents you can encounter. They are competent swordsmen and capable [[Conjurations]]-users which usually pelt you with powerful [[bolt spells]], while you will find your own ranged attacks failing to hit due to their [[Repel Missiles|repulsion]]. They can be found in [[the Vaults]] and [[Depths]], and are often found in the company of [[Sojobo]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They can cast high damage spells of the 6 \"main\" elements. Unless you're resistant to everything, don't expect to get out of the fight unscathed. A 3d26 damage spell might not seem like a lot, but 1-2 good rolls can quickly turn things sour.\n*They have low [[willpower]] for where they are found, so all sorts of [[Hexes]] and hex [[wand]]s can work well.\n*Repel Missiles can be [[dispel|dispelled]]. This isn't very useful for the [[wand of quicksilver]], but [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]] never misses and can damage the target and any adjacent foes.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], tengu reavers had fast movement but did not have Repel Missiles.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], tengu reavers could have one of three possible spell sets:\n**[[Bolt of Magma]] (3d26), [[Fireball]] (3d27), and [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere]]\n**[[Venom Bolt]] (3d21), [[Poisonous Cloud]] (3d11), [[Corrosive Bolt]] (3d21), and [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere]]\n**[[Freezing Cloud]] (2d27), [[Lightning Bolt]] (3d22), and [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere]]\n*Tengu reavers were added in [[0.13]]."}

Hill giants are uncivilized in every sense of the word, and have few recreational interests beyond smashing things such as you.}}\n<!--monster-bot-end-->\n==Useful Info==\n'''Hill giants''' are the weakest giants in the game, but that doesn't stop them from being massively more powerful than [[ogre_(monster)|ogres]]. They wield [[giant club]]s and [[giant spiked club]]s, and can deal tremendous damage when in melee. They also occasionally generate with [[throwing net]]s, greatly increasing their potential danger. You can find them on the middle floors of [[the Dungeon]] and the lower floors of the [[Orcish Mines]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Their [[magic resistance]] isn't ''too'' high, so [[confusion]], [[slow]], and other [[hexes]] work well against them. [[Curare]] needles are also very effective, especially with some other method for dealing damage while [[kiting]].\n*If you intend to simply nuke them at range before they can reach you, be careful; they often have enough durability to survive several shots of low-level [[conjurations]], and it doesn't take many swings for them to squish casters in melee.\n*Pay special attention to their [[throwing net]]s - they prevent you from moving or attacking with melee/ranged weapons, which can be lethal.\n\n==History==\n*Hill giants were removed in [[0.20]], largely replaced by [[two-headed ogre]]s."}

{"title":"Merfolk impaler","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Merfolk_impaler","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of| merfolk}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Merfolk impalers''' are powerful [[list of merfolk|merfolk]] warriors who inhabit [[the Shoals]]. They carry [[brand]]ed tridents and sometimes shields. Although not too durable, their attacks are nearly twice as fast as those of most monsters, making them a significant threat in melee.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They're much more dangerous than regular merfolk, but still less of a threat than a [[merfolk javelineer]]. [[Mephitic Cloud]]ing them while they're in a crowd of their allies works very well.\n*They occasionally wield [[demon trident]]s, a very nice reward for [[Polearms]]-users.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], their melee attacks dealt 25 base damage.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], monsters had hidden weapon penalties (they attacked slower), which made merfolk impalers less dangerous.\n\n[[Category:Merfolk]]"}

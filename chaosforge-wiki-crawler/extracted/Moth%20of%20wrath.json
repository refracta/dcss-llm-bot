{"title":"Moth of wrath","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Moth_of_wrath","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Moths of wrath''' are flying pests which are fairly harmless on their own. However, they can [[berserk]] its allies and anything it hits in melee, which makes things much more deadly. Their bites can also induce berserk in you, which may or may not be a good thing. They can be found in the [[Spider's Nest]], [[the Realm of Zot]], and in certain [[vault]]s, often sealed away behind [[iron grate]]s near an [[altar]] to [[Trog]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*For monsters, berserk increases damage by 50% and makes all actions 50% faster. It can make [[redback]]s into serious threats, or multiple spiders into very serious threats. In Zot, being surrounded by berserked [[list of draconians|draconians]] or [[Orb Guardian]]s is just as deadly.\n*Remember that moths of wrath can berserk you in melee. While berserk makes you stronger, it prevents use of consumables, god abilities, and spells. That can be fatal in the wrong circumstances. The berserk also [[slow]]s you once it ends. If you really need to end berserk, do anything but attack.\n*[[Wand of polymorph|Polymorphing]] them is a good idea, as they have surprisingly low [[hit dice]] for something so dangerous. It might change into e.g. a manticore.\n*\"Friendly\" moths of wrath may still berserk your enemies with their melee attack, and are sometimes created from a [[scroll of summoning]] in Zot. Thankfully, they won't berserk you (while retaining the ability to enrage allies)."}

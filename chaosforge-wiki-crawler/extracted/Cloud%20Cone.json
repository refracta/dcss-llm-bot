At low power, the most lethal clouds that can be created are noxious fumes. As power increases, this gives way to roaring flames, freezing vapours, and poisonous gas. At the highest tiers of power storm clouds, acidic fog and clouds of negative energy become available.}}\n\n'''Cloud Cone''' is a spell that fills a cone-shaped area in front of you with [[cloud]]s, with higher [[spell power]] determining the nature and duration of the clouds produced. Cloud Cone is only castable via a [[wand of clouds]], so its power is derived from the player's [[Evocation]] skill.\n\nThis table shows possible clouds produced by this spell, and skill levels at which they can be produced:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Cloud||Min.

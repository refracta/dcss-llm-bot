{"title":"Spear trap","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spear_trap","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|A mechanical contraption that shoots long sharp poles to skewer tresspassers.}}\n\n[[File:Spear trap.png]] \n\nA [[spear trap]] is a [[trap]] that fires spears when stepped upon by the player or [[monster]]. They hold 2-7 spears and deal 1d26 damage to you or 1d10 damage to monsters. The game will prompt you if you try to walk over one on less than 40 HP.\n\nEffects that grant the [[Repel Missiles#Player sources|RMsl]] status will reduce the chance of this trap being able to hit the player.\n\nMuch like other traps, spear traps cannot be disarmed, but they do have a limited supply of ammunition. They are fairly uncommon, appearing only in the [[Ossuary]] branch and in the [[Tomb]].\n\n==History==\n*Spear traps were removed in [[0.27]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], [[fly]]ing characters would never trigger traps.\n*In previous versions, traps could be disarmed by \"attacking\" the trap in place by pressing '''Ctrl-<Direction>'''. This ability was enhanced by the [[Traps & Doors]] skill. These traps could also be generated randomly throughout the dungeon.\n\n[[Category:Traps]]"}

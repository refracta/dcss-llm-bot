Entering or leaving a form with a talisman requires a brief period of concentration, but otherwise, forms last until the user chooses to leave them.\n\nMore powerful talismans require some amount of Shapeshifting skill, without which a user will find their maximum health reduced until they leave the form. Shapeshifting skill also increases other benefits provided by talismans' forms, though weaker talismans have a limit to how helpful skill can be.}}\n'''Talismans''' are items used to change your [[Transformation|form]], using the [[Shapeshifting]] skill.\n\n==Useful Info==\nA talisman, when e'''V'''oked, turns you into its respective [[transformation]] (e.g. a [[beast talisman]] turns you into [[Beast Form]]). This transformation lasts indefinitely. It can't be [[potion of cancellation|cancelled]] or [[Quicksilver Bolt|dispelled]], though you can voluntarily exit (either with '''V''' or as an '''A'''bility) at any time. Entering or exiting a form takes 5 turns. The talisman doesn't need to be in your inventory to stay in or exit a form. If you are turned into a [[bad form]], when you revert, you'll go back to your talisman form. \n\nTalismans may spawn as [[randart]]s; any randart properties apply so long as you remain in the form. For example, a beast talisman \"Centaurbane\" {rC+} gives permanent [[cold resistance]] in addition to all the benefits of Beast Form.\n\nThe [[undead]] ([[Ghoul]]s, [[Mummies]], bloodless [[Vampire]]s) are unable to transform. [[Zin]] despises form-shifting, and will instantly excommunicate any follower who uses one.\n\n===Transformations===\nEach form has its own benefits and downsides. However, talisman forms share a few things in common:\n\n* All talisman forms will boost [[Unarmed Combat]] in some way.\n* Most forms will [[meld]] certain types of equipment, which cannot be used. For example, a [[blade talisman]] turns your hands into blades, melding your [[weapon]], [[shield]], and [[gloves]].\n* Forms often negate certain [[mutation]]s, or add new ones. They can also change your [[size]].\n\nBeing in any form will make you take +75% damage from [[silver]] weaponry.\n\n===Skill===\nEach form has a minimum [[Shapeshifting]] skill. Below this skill, you will receive a penalty to max HP. Every level of skill below the minimum gives a penalty of -10% max HP (max. -90% HP), which is then multiplied by the form bonus. <!-- https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/a941d207056b69c563e2790628016430eb5d529d/crawl-ref/source/transform.cc#L306 transform.cc -->\n\nRaising Shapeshifting past this point will give you form-specific benefits. Beast Form will increase your [[slaying]] (attack) bonus, Statue Form will increase your defenses, etc. Each form also has a maximum Shapeshifting skill, where further training has no benefit.\n\nTalismans are not related to [[spell]]s in any way, so [[intelligence]], [[wizardry]], etc. has no effect, and [[Trog]] won't hate them. They are also unaffected by [[Ru#Sacrifices|Sacrifice Artifice]], since they are not evocables.\n\n==Sources==\nTalismans are found around the dungeon and in jewellery [[shop]]s. There's a 50% chance to find a [[blade talisman]], possibly an artefact one, in the Hall of Blades part of [[Elven Halls]]:2. The loot chamber in [[Crypt]]:3 has a 33% chance to contain a [[talisman of death]].\n\nSome [[unique]]s can drop talismans after you kill them:\n*{{monsterlink|Rupert}}, [[maw talisman]], 50% chance\n*{{monsterlink|Aizul}}, [[serpent talisman]], 100% chance (guaranteed to be an [[artefact]])\n*{{monsterlink|Roxanne}}, [[granite talisman]], 100% chance\n*{{monsterlink|Sojobo}}, [[storm talisman]], 50% chance\n*{{monsterlink|Bai Suzhen}}, [[dragon talisman]], 50% chance\n*{{monsterlink|Josephina}}, [[death talisman]], 50% chance\n\n==List of talismans==\nTalismans are sorted by \"tiers\"; each tier has the same [[Shapeshifting]] skill thresholds.\n\n'''Tier 1:''' (min. 0 skill, max. 7 skill)\n*[[File:beast talisman.png]] [[Beast talisman]] (Beast Form)\n\n'''Tier 1.5:''' (min. 7 skill, max. 14 skill)\n*[[File:flux talisman.png]] [[Flux talisman]] (Flux Form)\n\n'''Tier 2:''' (min. 10 skill, max. 19 skill)\n*[[File:blade talisman.png]] [[Blade talisman]] (Blade Form)\n*[[File:maw talisman.png]] [[Maw talisman]] (Maw Form)\n*[[File:serpent talisman.png]] [[Serpent talisman]] (Serpent Form)\n\n'''Tier 3:''' (min. 16 skill, max. 25 skill)\n*[[File:dragon-blood talisman.png]] [[Dragon-blood talisman]] (Dragon Form)\n*[[File:granite talisman.png]] [[Granite talisman]] (Statue Form)\n\n'''Tier 4:''' (min. 23 skill, max. 27 skill)\n*[[File:talisman of death.png]] [[Talisman of death]] (Death Form)\n*[[File:storm talisman.png]] [[Storm talisman]] (Storm Form)\n\n===Melded Slots===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

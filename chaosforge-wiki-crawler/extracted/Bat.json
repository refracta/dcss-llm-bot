{"title":"Bat","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bat","type":"raw","data":"{{version021}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nAlthough weak, '''bats''' are one of most annoying creatures in the game. They move three times faster than the average player and aren't easy to hit, but do very little damage. Bats are only a threat to players on the brink of death. \n\nBats can be summoned with the [[Summon Small Mammals]] spell.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Bats move very quickly and can perform multiple actions before the player can react, which means they can hit and move out of melee range between the player's actions. One way to minimize hits is to move away from them rather than toward them. They'll waste most of their turn approaching you and may end up next to you. This technique is very useful later on when dealing with monsters that are both fast and dangerous, such as [[unseen horror]]s.\n*Another way to deal with bats is to fight them in a corridor to restrict their movement. You can even trap the bat between yourself and another monster or a dead end to prevent the bat from moving.\n*Ranged [[weapon]]s such as [[stone]]s, and [[bow]]s allow you to attack even when they fly a few spaces away, but characters without the appropriate skills will often miss.\n\n==Variant Bats==\nOne particularly harmless-yet-annoying [[vault]] you can encounter (the aptly-named \"goddamned_bats\" vault) contains a wide variety of unique bats. They all have their own names, but for the most part their stats are only slightly different from those of standard bats.\n\n[[Image:Megabat.png]] '''Megabat'''\n{{flavour|A huge black bat.}}\n\n[[Image:Microbat.png]] '''Microbat'''\n{{flavour|A bat that, despite its name, is not any smaller than a megabat.}}\n\n[[Image:Gigabat.png]] '''Giga bat''' (has 4 [[HD]] and slightly improved stats)\n{{flavour|A huge, bloated bat.}}\n\n[[Image:Vampire bat.png|32px]] '''[[Vampire bat]]'''\n{{Flavour|A large black bat with vicious fangs that feeds on blood.

This was changed to megabats in [[0.8]], and in [[0.9]] they simply became bats."}

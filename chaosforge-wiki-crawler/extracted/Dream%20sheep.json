{"title":"Dream sheep","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dream_sheep","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n<!-- {{list of | quadrupeds}} -->\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Dream sheep''' are physically weaker than the common [[yak]], but their dust can inflict [[sleep]] from anywhere in [[LOS|sight]]. The more sheep in LOS, the more likely you are to fall asleep. Since falling asleep in combat isn't a good idea, dream sheep are major threats when combined with other monsters. They are commonly found running wild in herds throughout the [[Lair]], but can also be found in the care of [[cyclops]] shepherds in the [[Shoals]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Sleep]] is very dangerous: it prevents you from doing anything until attacked, lowers your [[EV]] and [[SH]] to near 0, and increases damage taken in melee. EV-based fighters have the most to worry, but sleeping next to a [[hydra]] is deadly to anyone. \n*Be aware of what does and does not protect you from sleep:\n**[[Willpower]] does ''not'' protect you from their sleep effect. \n**It is a [[line of sight]] effect. Hiding behind creatures won't work, but limiting dream sheep in sight with a corner or [[scroll of fog]] is helpful.\n**[[Clarity]] grants immunity to sleep, though this property is incredibly rare outside of [[Ashenzari]], and you might not even have 3* of piety when you enter Lair.\n**[[Berserk]] is a more common status that grants immunity, but comes with all the risks that Berserk and post-berserk provide. Be careful not to take on more than you can handle -- one rage can usually get you through a herd of dream sheep, but you might have trouble if more monsters decide to investigate the sounds of fighting.\n**[[Undead]] characters, [[Gargoyle]]s, [[Djinn]], and players in [[Statue Form|Statue]], [[Storm Form|Storm]], or [[Wisp Form]] cannot be put to sleep and have very little to fear from dream sheep. Vampires must be Bloodless to be immune.\n*Try to kite a herd of dream sheep or hit them with area-of-effect attacks like [[cleave|cleaving]] or [[Fireball]]; aim to kill them quickly before they put you to [[sleep]]. Failing that, try to fight them somewhere only a few creatures can get to you at a time, and ''especially'' don't fight them where dangerous monsters like [[hydra]]s or [[komodo dragon]]s can get at you.\n**This might be a good time to build yourself a choke point or [[kill hole]] with a [[wand of digging]].\n*If you run into a pack of dream sheep you weren't ready for and need to flee, consider reading a [[scroll of teleportation]] -- even if you get put to sleep, the teleportation effect will still kick in after a few turns.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], dream sheep could use Dream Dust when inflicted by [[fear]].\n*Prior to [[0.22]], [[Sticky Flame]] would spread between dream sheep, causing them to [[fear|panic]].\n*Dream sheep were introduced in [[0.19]], replacing ordinary [[sheep]]."}

It grows more powerful every time it inflicts a killing blow on a strong dragon. The more powerful it grows, the harder it will be to find a worthy opponent.}}\n[[File:Wyrmbane.png]] '''''the +8 lance \"Wyrmbane\"'''''\n\n+8 lance (modified [[spear]]: 8 base damage)\n\n[[Dragon slaying]] brand<br>\n+3 AC<br>\nrF+<br>\nrC+<br>\nrPois<br>\nEnchantment increases when used to kill dragons\n\n===Enchantment Mechanics===\nIf a dragon slaying-vulnerable target is killed by Wyrmbane or an [[auxiliary attack]] afterwards, it will gain +1 enchantment up to the HD of the dragon killed.\n\nExamples:\n*If you kill a [[fire dragon]] (HD 12) with the basic +8 Wyrmbane, it will become +9.\n*If you then use Wyrmbane to kill a [[swamp dragon]] (HD 9), it's enchantment will not change (the dragon was too weak to boost the enchantment).\n\nThe maximum enchantment Wyrmbane can gain this way is +18, even though there are draconic monsters with higher HD.\n\nThe following creatures can raise the enchantment of Wyrmbane when slain, assuming its enchantment is less than their HD. Any dragon slaying-vulnerable creature not listed here ([[steam dragon]], [[rime drake]], etc.) is too weak to affect even the base enchantment of Wyrmbane.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

A fully empowered '''Wyrmbane'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|675}}</ref> is a top-tier weapon, arguably ''the'' best in the game. First off, Wyrmbane has a high, irresistible damage output. It also takes little skill to reach [[mindelay]], can be wielded with a [[shield]] (for all species), and provides some very helpful resistances.\n\nBe aware that the [[dragon slaying]] brand has little to do with its excellent performance. Swinging a +18 or so lance at 0.5 delay works fine against any opponent. It stacks well with other slaying bonuses and [[might]]/[[berserk]].\n\nA +9 [[demon trident]] of [[flaming]]/[[freezing]] can be stronger at high strength and skill (~18+ skill). However, it requires more skill, can be resisted, and provides no extra resistances of its own. Wyrmbane is slightly easier to train; just 12 skill reaches mindelay, which is attainable even with an abysmal Polearms aptitude. Further training is not 100% necessary, though it obviously is helpful.\n\n===Finding Dragons===\nIn order to make the best use of Wyrmbane, one must first kill many dragons with it. Fortunately, this is an easier task than it might seem. Getting Wyrmbane up to +12 can be accomplished by hunting [[fire dragon|fire]] and [[ice dragon]]s, which can be found throughout [[the Depths]] easily enough. [[Storm dragon|Storm]], [[shadow dragon|shadow]], and [[quicksilver dragon]]s (HD 14-17) are often found in [[Vaults]]:5. [[List of draconians|Professional draconians]] (HD 16) can be found in [[Zot]] and around its entrance.\n\n[[Golden dragon|Golden]] and [[bone dragon]]s are probably the easiest dragons to find that will get you all the way up to +18. You can either dip into the Realm of Zot to hunt golden dragons, or into [[The Crypt]], where bone dragons and [[skeleton (monster)|skeletal]] or [[zombie|zombified]] dragons of very high HD tend to roam. The [[Abyss]], [[Hell]]s, and [[Pandemonium]] all contain even more dragons for the particularly daring explorer to slay.\n\nThe uniques [[Maggie]] and [[Margery]] both have a tiny chance (1%) of spawning with a slightly pre-enchanted Wyrmbane; Maggie's version is +9 while Margery has raised it to +10.\n\n==History==\n*Maggie and Margery were given the ability to appear wielding a pre-enchanted Wyrmbane in [[0.25]]\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Wyrmbane provided [[berserk|+Rage]] instead of [[cold resistance|rC+]] and had a +5 [[AC]] bonus.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Wyrmbane had a +9,+6 enchantment bonus, either of which could increase when slaying dragons.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Polearms]]"}

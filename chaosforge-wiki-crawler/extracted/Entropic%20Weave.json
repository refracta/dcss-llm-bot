{"title":"Entropic Weave","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Entropic_Weave","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{Flavour|Corrodes the target, with no direct line of fire required.}}\n\n'''Entropic Weave''' is a [[smite]]-targeted monster-only spell that inflicts [[corrosion]] on its target and is the signature spell of [[entropy weaver]]s. As is usual with smiting attacks, it is advisable to avoid being in sight of an entropy weaver for longer than you absolutely need to. If you have to fight one, do it with a form of [[corrosion resistance]] if at all possible, as that will greatly mitigate the amount of corrosion you'll have to deal with.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

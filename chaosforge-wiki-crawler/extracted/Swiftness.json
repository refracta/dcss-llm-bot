{"title":"Swiftness","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Swiftness","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Swiftness''' is a level 3 [[Air Magic|Air]] spell which temporarily reduces your [[movement]] delay, then slows you after.\n__NOTOC__\n==Useful Info==\nGrants the '''Swift''' status, reducing movement delay by 25%, thus increasing your move speed. However, after the speed boost ends, you will gain '''-Swift''' for the same duration, which prevents recasting and makes your movement speed 50% slower. For a regular move speed character, you'll take 0.7 to 0.8 [[decaAut]] (avg. 0.75) to move under Swift, and 1.5 decaAut to move under -Swift.\n\nSwiftness can not reduce your [[movement delay]] below 0.6 without [[haste]]. Therefore, [[Spriggan]]s receive no benefit (unless under a [[transformation]] with slower movement speed). If you happen to have a movement delay of 0.7, the speed fluctuation is smaller: the increase only brings them to 0.6, a 16.7% bonus, while the penalty slows you by 20%.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|player.cc|1853}}</ref>\n\nThe Swift status lasts for <code>11 + 1d(power) / 2</code> decaAut (max. 30).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-selfench.cc|126}}</ref> You cannot recast the spell to increase the duration.\n\n===Limitations===\n*This spell does stack with other sources of speed, such as [[Haste]] and the [[lightning scales]].\n*Due to their [[stasis]], [[Formicid]]s cannot cast Swiftness.\n*[[Cheibriados]] dislikes the use of Swiftness -- using it will incur penance.\n\n==Monster Version==\nWhile monsters can't cast Swiftness, they instead get the functionally similar [[Sprint]]. Sprint boosts the movement speed of the caster, but has  no penalty or cooldown afterwards. [[Player ghost]]s with Swiftness will have their spells replaced.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], standing in water would negate this spell's effects (positive and negative).\n*Prior to [[0.27]], this spell was a level 2 Air spell.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Swiftness was a dual-school, level 2 [[Air Magic|Air]]/[[Charms]] spell.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Formicids could use Swiftness.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], there was no slowdown after the spell ended, but it penalized [[stealth]] and [[trap]] detection while active. It also reduced move delay by a flat 0.2 instead of by a percentage.\n*Prior to [[0.13]] this spell couldn't be cast while standing in shallow water.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Movement]]\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

{"title":"Channeling","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Channeling","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For spells like [[Searing Ray]] with an effect that requires several turns of focus, see [[Channeling spell]].''\n{{flavour|Dramatically increases the user's regeneration of magical power for a duration that increases with Invocations skill.}}\n\n'''Channeling''' is the act of passively restoring MP to a character, as opposed to using a single-turn action like the [[Sublimation of Blood]] spell to restore MP. There are two types: Active Channeling (which require the use of an activated ability), and Passive Channeling (which comes from equipment and happens without the player's input).\n\n[[Djinn]] do not use MP and cannot make use of any form of channeling.\n\n==Active Channeling==\n'''Channel Magic''' is an [[ability]] that allows worshipers of [[Sif Muna]] to restore [[MP]] much more quickly. Followers gain this ability at 1* [[piety]]. \n\n{{crawlquote|\n'''Success rate:''' (60 + 4*[[Invocations]])/100 + [[Piety]]/25<br>\n'''MP Recovered:''' 3-5 per turn for (3 + 2d(2/3 * Invocations)/2) turns, average (3 + Invocations/3) turns\n}}\n\n==Passive Channeling==\n[[Orb]]s of [[energy]] and the [[crystal ball of Wucad Mu]] allow you to passively channel energy, refunding the MP costs of spells you cast.\n\nWith the energy ego, when you successfully cast a spell, there's a 20% chance to have the full MP cost refunded. When you [[miscast]] a spell, you will always have MP refunded. However, it increases your ''raw'' [[spell failure]] chance by +10%. The crystal ball of Wucad Mu has double the refund rate, with the same failure penalty. (For reference, the first stack of [[wizardry]] reduces raw spell failure by 25%.)\n\nNote that this does not mean that your spell failure actually increases by +10%, as its modified by a function. See the [[Spell Success#Final Step|Spell Success]] page for details. For example:\n*If you have a spell with 6% failure, an orb of energy increases it to 17% actual failure.\n*If you have a spell with 2% failure, an orb of energy increases it to 8% actual failure.\n*For spells with 1% failure, it varies. A 1% failure might increase to 2% or 9% actual failure, depending on how much skill you have.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.30]], passive channeling was reworked. Prior to this version, you had a <code>Sources * Evocations / 108</code> (orb of energy: 2 sources ; [[staff of Wucad Mu]]: 3) to succeed. If you succeeded, you had a <code>1 / (Evocations - MP cost)</code> to backfire, either draining 1-5 points of intelligence or inflicting [[confusion]]. As Wucad Mu is now an orb, you are physically unable to stack channeling.\n*In [[0.28]], the ability to stack multiple sources of passive channeling was added, along with the [[orb]] of [[energy]]. Success rate per source decreased, but all items count towards multiple sources.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the staff of Wucad Mu's success rate was <code> Evocations / 81</code> (buffed to <code> Evocations / 54</code>), and backfiring did not refund MP.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], you could actively channel magic by e'''v'''oking a [[staff of energy]]; compared to other active channeling items, this provided fewer MP but could not backfire. The staff of Wucad Mu could also channel magic in this way.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], a [[crystal ball of energy]] could be used as a high-risk way to restore MP, much like the staff of Wucad Mu.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], Channel Magic was Sif Muna's *** ability.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Sif Muna instead granted '''Channel Energy''', which was a repeatably usable ability, not a duration. With each use, it restored a small amount of MP (depending on Invocations skill) and cost [[hunger]] but no piety.\n\n[[Category:Abilities]]\n[[Category:Religion]]"}

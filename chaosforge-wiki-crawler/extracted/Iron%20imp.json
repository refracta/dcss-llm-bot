{"title":"Iron imp","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Iron_imp","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Iron imps''' are relatively burly [[tier-5 demon]]s. They have the most [[HP]] of all the imps and decent attacks, but they're slow, and almost never appear where they'd actually be a threat. They can only be found as part of certain [[vault]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you're concerned about them being a threat in melee, they're easy to [[kite]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], they could be created by [[Call Imp]]. Of the imps summoned by that spell, they were the physically toughest.\n*Prior to [[0.7]], iron imps were called '''manes''', a name that was both singular and plural.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

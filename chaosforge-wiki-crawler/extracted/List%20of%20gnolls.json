{"title":"List of gnolls","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_gnolls","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n'''Gnolls''' are brutish dog-like monsters found early in the game. They are almost always found in groups and usually wield [[flail]]s or [[halberd]]s. New adventurers should be wary of them, since they can hit much harder than most enemies in the early [[Dungeon]]. Sometimes they carry [[throwing net]]s to pin you in place.\n\n==Gnoll Types==\n{{yellow|g}} [[File:Gnoll (monster).png]] '''[[Gnoll (monster)|Gnoll]]''' - An angry dog-headed humanoid, only as dangerous as the weapon it wields.\n\n{{monsterlink|Gnoll sergeant}}- Significantly stronger than a standard gnoll, they tend to have better equipment and often carry healing [[potion]]s or [[shields]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Gnoll shaman}}- Gnollish support casters who can heal and [[Haste]] their allies while [[Corona|highlighting]] you.\n\n===[[Unique]] Gnolls===\n{{monsterlink|Crazy Yiuf}}- Clam drain pasta spittle! Rot pontify action! Marry what a flowbot? (This deranged gnoll's [[quarterstaff]] of [[chaos]] is just as crazy as he is.)\n\n{{monsterlink|Grum}}- A modestly powerful gnoll who hunts adventurers with the help of a pack of ferocious [[wolves]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Grunn}} - An alternate, undead version of Grum who serves [[Ereshkigal]] with a pack of [[doom hound]]s.\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

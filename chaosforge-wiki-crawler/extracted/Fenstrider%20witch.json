{"title":"Fenstrider witch","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fenstrider_witch","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Fenstrider witches''' are hexing, supportive casters of [[the Swamp]]. [[Paralysis]] can be deadly in every branch; the Swamp is no exception. If you get into melee range, they can inflict [[Agony]] on you. High [[willpower]] is recommended to deal with them. When killed, their corpses may form into usable [[wand]]s (100% per [[corpse]], or a net 50% chance).\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Paralyse is a very scary spell, unless you have the willpower to resist it. Getting paralysed next to a group of monsters can instantly kill you. \n*Unlike other monsters, witches have the melee version of the [[Agony]] spell.\n*Hurl Sludge creates a sludge tile where it lands, which lasts for 2-3 turns. Like [[Eringya's Noxious Bog]], any non-flying creature standing in sludge will take high amounts of poison damage. It otherwise acts as [[shallow water]], giving a penalty to melee attacks and movement speed to a non-amphibious adventurer.\n**Don't try to fight a witch while standing in toxic sludge, unless you have both [[poison resistance]] and a lot of HP, or the ability to fly.\n**Hurl Sludge can replace staircases with sludge tiles. Watch out!\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Fenstrider witches did not drop wands on death.\n*Fenstrider witches were added in [[0.26]]."}

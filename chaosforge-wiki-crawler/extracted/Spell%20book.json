{"title":"Spell book","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spell_book","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{flavour|An arcane textbook containing magical spells of unknown origin.}}\n'''Spell books''' are [[item]]s that allow player to [[Spell memorisation|memorise]] [[spell]]s.\n\nThere are two types of spell books: standard ones with a set name and list of spells, and randomly generated ([[randart]]) books that contain multiple random, but often thematically linked, spells.\n\n==General==\nSpell books are identified automatically on sight. Reading a spell book destroys the book and adds new spells to your spell library. [[Djinn]] are unable to learn spells from spellbooks but destroy the book anyway.\n\nBesides just finding them on the dungeon floor or in [[shop]]s, spell books can be obtained by using [[acquirement]] or as [[gift]]s from [[Sif Muna]]. \n\n==Strategy==\nSpell books are not exactly rare, but there are so many different ones out there that finding a specific spell book may be difficult or even impossible in a given game. While book [[shop]]s provide a large, random assortment to choose from, spell books are also generally on the expensive side. Thus, obtaining a specific spell book that you want can be a hassle, but you can alleviate this by worshiping the right [[god]].\n\n[[Sif Muna]] grants spell books as [[gift]]s, which are more likely to be in for a school you've trained in. Regardless, each book will have at least one new spell, so followers will eventually have access to every spell in the game.  [[Gozag]]'s Call Merchant may create a bookstore, which have a large number of books (~8 each). So by sheer numbers, you are likely to receive a useful book. Bookstores can, of course, spawn in the regular dungeon, where Gozag's funds at least help buy them.\n\n[[Kikubaaqudgha]] and [[Vehumet]] both provide spells directly instead of via book; specializing in [[Necromancy]] or [[Conjurations|offensive spells]], respectively.\n\n==Standard books==\n:''See also: [[List of spells by book]]''\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Air}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Alchemy}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Annihilations}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Armaments}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Beasts}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Blasting}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Blood}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Burglary}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Callings}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Cantrips}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Changes}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Chaos}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Conjurations}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Dangerous Friends}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Death}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Debilitation}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Decay}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Displacement}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of the Dragon}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Dreams}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of the Earth}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Fire}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Flames}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Frost}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Geomancy}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Hexes}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of the Hunter}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Ice}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Iron}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Lightning}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Maledictions}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Minor Magic}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Misfortune}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of the Moon}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Necromancy}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Party Tricks}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Power}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Rime}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Scorching}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of the Senses}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of the Sky}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Sloth}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Spatial Translocations}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Spectacle}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of the Spheres}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Storms}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Touch}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Transfigurations}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Unlife}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Vapours}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of the Warp}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Weapons}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of the Wilderness}}\n*{{spellbook2|Book of Winter}}\n*{{spellbook2|Everburning Encyclopedia}}\n*{{spellbook2|Fen Folio}}\n*{{spellbook2|Grand Grimoire}}\n*{{spellbook2|Great Wizards, Vol. II}}\n*{{spellbook2|Great Wizards, Vol. VII}}\n*{{spellbook2|Inescapable Atlas}}\n*{{spellbook2|Necronomicon}}\n*{{spellbook2|Ozocubu's Autobiography}}\n*{{spellbook2|There-And-Back Book}}\n*{{spellbook2|Trismegistus Codex}}\n*{{spellbook2|the Unrestrained Analects}}\n*{{spellbook2|Young Poisoner's Handbook}}\n\n==History==\n*[[0.29]]\n**Removed [[Book of Pain]].\n*[[0.28]]\n**Removed [[Book of Stone]].\n*[[0.27]]\n**Fixed books now only have 2-4 spells each (down from 4-6 each).

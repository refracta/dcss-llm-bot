{"title":"List of eyeballs","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_eyeballs","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n''For the [[Jiyva mutation]], see [[eyeballs]].''\n\n'''Eyeballs''' are deceptively dangerous creatures, as most of them lack any means of dealing damage to you. However, their gazes carry terrible effects all the same, permanently disfiguring you or leaving you easy prey for other, less subtle enemies. They can be found in great numbers in [[the Slime Pits]], though they occasionally appear in [[the Dungeon]] and some other branches as well. Much like [[List of jellies|jellies]], all eyeball monsters will be neutral towards worshipers of [[Jiyva]].\n\n==Eyeball Types==\n{{monsterlink|Floating eye}}- Due to their [[paralysis]]-inducing gaze, staring contests are not recommended.\n\n{{monsterlink|Golden eye}}- These pests fly around erratically, leaving you too [[confused]] to fight effectively.\n\n{{monsterlink|Eye of devastation}}- Angry eyes overflowing with explosive arcane power. Their deadly gaze drills through foes with ease.\n\n{{monsterlink|Shining eye}}- Every turn you spend within a shining eye's sight is a turn in which it might decide to [[mutate]] some adjustments into you. Kill them quickly.\n\n{{monsterlink|Great orb of eyes}}- A conglomeration of many eyeballs capable of causing multiple dangerous effects. They are unique among eyes in that they also bite in melee.\n\n==Retired Eyeballs==\n{{monsterlink|Eye of draining}}- Ravenous eyeballs that healed themselves by consuming your [[MP]] from afar. Little threat to weapon specialists, but mages feared and loathed them. Removed in [[0.27]].\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

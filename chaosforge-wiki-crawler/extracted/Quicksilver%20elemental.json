{"title":"Quicksilver elemental","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Quicksilver_elemental","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Quicksilver elementals''' are antimagic menaces found in the [[Iron City of Dis]]. Their combination of status effect-dispelling bolts, immunity to most elements, and MP-draining attacks make them particularly lethal to casters. They tend to move in erratic patterns.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Players should be particularly cautious around this creature. Getting hit with their bolts will unravel most enchantments, including useful buffs such as [[haste]] or [[might]]. Also, they can dispel your {{Blue|Tele}} status, preventing you from [[teleport]]ing away.\n*Casters should avoid being hit in melee, as a single attack can easily take out a large portion of their MP bar.\n\n==History==\n*Quicksilver elementals were added in [[0.28]]."}

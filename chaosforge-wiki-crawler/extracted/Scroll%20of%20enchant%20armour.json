Body armour and bardings can be enchanted up to the same value as their base armour rating. Bucklers, kite shields and tower shields can be enchanted up to +3, +5 or +8 respectively, and other armour can be enchanted up to +2. Magical artefacts cannot be enchanted at all.}}\n\nReading a '''scroll of enchant armour''' will immediately add +1 to the enchantment level of selected piece of [[armour]] in your [[inventory]], increasing its [[AC]] or [[SH]] by 1.\n\n==Useful Info==\nThese [[scroll]]s can affect any kind of armour, be it [[hat]]s or [[helmet]]s, [[gloves]], [[cloak]]s, [[boots]], [[shields]], or [[body armour]]. However, [[scarves]] and [[orb]]s cannot be enchanted.\n\n[[Artefact]]s cannot be enchanted by this scroll.\n\nThe enchantment cannot be increased once maximum enchant level (see below) is reached.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! colspan=2 | Maximum Enchantment Levels\n|-\n| [[Body armour]] || +([[Body armour|Armour's base AC]])\n|-\n| [[Barding]] || +4\n|-\n| [[Shields]] || +3 for [[Buckler]]s, +5 for [[Kite shield]]s, +8 for [[Tower shield]]s\n|-\n| All other armour || +2\n|}\n\n==Strategy==\nWhen thinking about enchanting a piece of armour, bear these two things in mind:\n\n'''1. How likely am I to replace this armour?'''\n\nIf you're wearing [[scale mail]], and switch to a [[chain mail]] just 1 floor later, then the enchantment didn't really do much.\n\n*In general, auxiliary slots and [[shield]]s are less likely to be replaced than body armour. Items with an [[ego]] are even less likely to be replaced. For instance, a cloak of [[willpower]] is very difficult to beat. Body armours with a good ego (e.g. plate armour of fire resistance) can be good options to enchant as well.\n*When comparing auxiliary slots, it's useful to consider the rarity of egos. Cloaks are the most likely to generate with an ego, such as poison resistance or willpower. In the order from ''least'' to most likely to have an ego: hats / helmets < boots < gloves < cloaks.\n*It can be a strategy to spread enchantments out. Say you could have a +2 helmet and +0 cloak, or +1 helmet and +1 cloak. If you find a +2 helmet, or a +2 helmet of intelligence, then the latter arrangement would end up with a better result. (Note that you can also find a +1 cloak, though, in which case having a +2 helmet would be better)\n*[[God]] choice can matter in this decision:\n**Followers of [[Okawaru]] will get an armour gift at 6*, which can change your equipment layout.\n**Followers of [[Gozag]] or [[Yredelemnul]] are unable to get dragon scales from dragons. For them, body armour (of a good ego) is harder to replace.\n\n'''2. How much do I need help ''right now''?'''\n\nWhile it might be tempting to save these scrolls for an ideal set of [[dragon scales]], you won't benefit from doing that for a long time. If your defenses are miserably low right now, then you're likely to die before getting any dragon scales at all. In contrast, having, say, a +8 plate armour {rPois} or +5 [[kite shield]] can really make a difference immediately.\n\n*If you care about the early game at all, you should use these scrolls as soon as you find them (preferably when considering point #1).\n*Scrolls of enchant armour can can help satisfy requirements for a [[trove]]. It's usually unwise to save your scrolls ''in anticipation'' for a trove, but keep it in mind.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], scrolls of enchant armour would convert [[dragon hide]]s into their respective [[dragon armour]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], scrolls of enchant armour could remove [[curse]]s on armour.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], increasing the enchantment level could fail if it was already high.\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

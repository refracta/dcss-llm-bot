{"title":"Archery","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Archery","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}{{flavour|It improves your effectiveness with ranged weaponry, such as bows and javelins (Slay+4).}}\n'''Archery''' is an [[ego]] found only on [[gloves]], which enhances your ability to fight with [[ranged weapon]]s: you receive a +4 [[slaying]] bonus when using [[Throwing#Weapons|throwing weapons]], [[bows]], [[crossbows]], or [[slings]].\n\n==Desirability==\nSlaying bonuses are always desirable, but not all characters wind up using ranged weapons. If ranged weapons are your primary form of attack, these are an extremely welcome find. Spellcasters will likely prefer gloves of [[strength]] or [[dexterity]] (or a nice [[artefact]]), while melee fighters (who aren't using Throwing) might find them unnecessary.\n\n==History==\n*This ego was replaced with [[Hurling]] in [[0.28]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], archery gave +5 to accuracy and +3 to damage, at the cost of -1 slaying in melee.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], archery was only found on the [[bracers of archery]], a now-obsolete form of hand-slot armour.\n\n[[Category:Egos]]"}

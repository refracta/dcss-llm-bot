{"title":"Metabolic Englaciation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Metabolic_Englaciation","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Metabolic Englaciation''' is a level 5 [[Hexes]]/[[Ice Magic|Ice]] spell that [[slow]]s down monsters in the caster's [[line of sight]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nApplies the [[slow]]ed status effect for creatures in the caster's line of sight. The duration of this effect is dependent on [[spell power]] and inversely proportional to monster [[HD]]; it does not check [[willpower]]. Duration is doubled for [[cold-blooded]] targets. [[Cold resistance|Cold resistant]] and [[stationary]] monsters are unaffected by this spell. Using this spell on an already slowed creature will increase its duration.\n\nThe slow effect will last for <code>3d(pow+1)/6 - HD/2 - 0.5</code> turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-monench.cc|40}}</ref> If this results in â‰¤ 0 turns, then the spell is resisted, otherwise it has a minimum of (1 + 1d4) turns. Cold-blooded creatures have their duration doubled ''after'' the turns > 0 check, meaning they aren't more likely to be slowed.\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile this spell may not be as impressive as other Hexes, Metabolic Englaciation can still be valuable as a crowd-control spell. Even if you can't slow down the most dangerous monsters, you can disable whole packs of \"mook\" enemies, such as [[vault guard]]s and [[list of draconians|draconians]]. Unlike [[Cause Fear]], Metabolic Englaciation checks HD instead of willpower.\n\nHigh spellpower is vital for this spell's function; power increases the chance to slow, as well as the duration of the slow.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Metabolic Englaciation didn't have a minimum duration.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Metabolic Englaciation lasted for <code>3d(pow + 1) / 6 - 1d(HD) - 1</code> turns.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Metabolic Englaciation was a level 6 Hexes/Ice spell, and had no effect on already slowed creatures.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], Metabolic Englaciation functioned as a mass [[Ensorcelled Hibernation]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

Originally used by hunters to entangle and entrap prey, it soon found obvious application in battle and gladiatorial arenas. Struggling victims can eventually destroy the net and break free, if they live long enough.\n\n----\n\n\"The look of a scared thing<br>Sitting in a net!\"\n\n-Edna St. Vincent Millay, \"When the Year Grows Old\". 1917.}}\n\n'''Throwing nets''' are [[Throwing]] implements which deal no damage directly, but [[constriction|ensnare]] their foe, lowering their [[ev]]asion and allowing [[stab]]bing attacks.\n\n==Useful Info==\nNets can be used to ensnare opponents. If the net hits, it has the following effects:\n*[[EV]] of the target is reduced\n**Player EV is divided by 2\n**Monster EV is divided by <code>2 + [[size|body size]]</code> (tiny is 1, little is 2, etc.)\n*Prevents physical movement (including abilities like [[Barachi|hopping]]), melee attacks, and use of [[ranged weapon]]s\n*Monsters are vulnerable to low-tier [[stab]]s\n\n[[Insubstantial]] and [[list of jellies|jelly]] creatures are immune to nets. Player with the [[slick slippers]] unrand are also immune.\n\nCreatures can struggle through a net, which will eventually break it. Nets can also be escaped via [[blink]], [[teleport]], and certain abilities (like [[Ru]]'s Draw Out Power and [[Zin]]'s Sanctuary).\n\nUnlike other [[Throwing]] implements, monsters do not have infinite ammo with throwing nets.\n\n===Mulching===\nVictims will struggle if they try to move or melee attack. Eventually, the net will break, letting them free.\n\nEvery time a victim struggles, they deal <code>1d4</code> \"damage\" to the net. After taking 8 or more damage, the net breaks.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|traps.cc|884}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|traps.h|17}}</ref> If they die or escape via other means (such as teleportation), the net has a <code>damage in 9</code> chance of being destroyed. <ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|traps.cc|949}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Apportation]] spell can be used to recover a net, even if it's still on a monster. This can mulch the net, as if the monster had otherwise died/escaped. You cannot apport nets that are on you.\n\n==Sources==\n[[Gladiator]]s begin play with a stack of throwing nets, and they can be found as random loot throughout the Dungeon. They are also held by [[Gnoll (monster)|gnolls]] and [[list of merfolk|merfolk]], though they'll usually throw the net at you, first. \n\n[[Net trap]]s, mostly found in [[Zot]]:5 and [[the Tomb]], can drop a net on you, but these nets cannot be retrieved.\n\n==Strategy==\nNets can be used to escape from a monster, to stab enemies, or to get the edge during a dangerous fight. They are quite rare, so use them wisely. Keep in mind that nets are able to miss.\n\nFew monsters in the game are immune to nets. Even \"bosses\" like [[the Royal Jelly]], all [[pandemonium lord]]s, and 3 of the 4 [[Hell]] lords ([[Antaeus]] is giant) can be netted. \n\nWatch out for enemy nets. As soon as you enter D:2, [[Gnoll (monster)|gnolls]] can generate with them. Nets are just as dangerous in enemy hands as yours; they can make a sticky situation that much more dangerous.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! Throwing net\n|-\n| [[File:Throwing net.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], [[Size#Giant|giant]] creatures were immune to nets, but jellies weren't.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], you could retrieve nets dropped from [[net trap]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the mechanics of escaping nets were more complicated. A creature caught in a net could escape it by either ripping the net or slipping out of it. Being [[Size#Small|small]], [[EV|evasive]] and [[dexterity|dexterous]] (player only) made slipping out of nets more likely. On the other hand, [[Size#Big|big]], [[Strength|strong]], and [[berserk]]ing creatures were more likely to rip the net. Nearby creatures were adding tension, which sped up both escaping and destroying nets for the player. Cutting weapons, especially [[flaming]] and [[vorpal]] ones, as well as [[claws]], were good for shredding nets. Also, confused creatures, including the player, had a chance to struggle in a net without any result.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], any flying creature had an additional 66.6% chance to avoid any nets thrown at it, separate from the normal miss chance.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], flying opponents were completely immune to throwing nets, and instead of simply mulching, throwing nets would go through an elaborate deterioration process before finally falling apart entirely. Also, only medium or larger characters were able to use them.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{weapons}}\n\n[[Category:Throwing]]"}

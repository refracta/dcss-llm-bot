{"title":"Mara","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mara","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Mara, Lord of Illusions''', is the [[unique]] lord of all [[rakshasa]]s. Armed with a deadly array of illusory magic, he is an extremely dangerous opponent capable of turning all your strengths against you. He always generates with a [[brand]]ed demon weapon, and his unique spellset makes him challenging regardless of your preparations.\n\n==Location==\n*[[Depths]]: 1-4\n*[[Elven Halls]]: 3\n*[[Swamp]]: 3-4\n*[[Snake Pit]]: 3-4\n*[[Shoals]]: 3-4\n*[[Spider's Nest]]: 3-4\n*[[Vaults]]: 2-5\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Strategy==\nMara is a notoriously dangerous unique.\n# Alone, Mara has moderately high durability (especially for the [[Lair]] branches), and [[Bolt of Fire]] can hurt quite a bit.\n# He can create 2 copies of himself, and each copy can cast spells at the same strength. Having 3 Maras, all shooting Bolts of Fire, means you'll take high damage quickly. Up to 273 damage/turn, if you lack fire resistance.\n# He can also create copies of you, which are just as deadly as you are. You might win 50/50 against yourself... but that's a 50% chance to lose on the spot. That's before considering Mara himself - when combined with 2 Mara clones, the chances of you winning are extremely low.\n\nRemember that '''you do not need to kill every monster you come across in ''Crawl'' in order to win the game'''. He often spawns in rune branches, and you'll ''eventually'' need 3 runes to win. But you can always come back for the rune later, when you have the power to kill Mara quickly. If he spawns on <Lair Branch>:3, you can skip the floor he's on.\n\nIf you do decide to deal with him, [[fire resistance]] is highly recommended, and you should be able to deal decent damage without using fire, poison, or negative energy. In general, it's best to treat him like you would any other extremely dangerous summoner: kill him as quickly as possible, and if he summons something you can't handle, teleport away. \n\n===Dealing with Clones===\nMara will create clones, either of himself or you. These clones will harass you until they time out, until the real Mara is defeated, or until you change the level. Upon use of Mara Summon, the real Mara may switch places with the clone, making it impossible to tell them apart.\n\n'''Player'''\n*Fighting a player clone is extremely risky on its own, and with Mara in play, it clearly becomes a losing fight. Generally, the best approach with a player ghost is to not deal with it at all: you can go back up the stairs or teleport away if it's summoned.\n*It is technically possible to 'cripple' your clone before it is summoned; e.g. casters with -Cast gear, melee fighters wielding a [[scroll]]. However, this is a bad idea - until he summons your clone, he has free reign to attack you.\n\n'''Monster'''\n*Retreating up[[stairs]] can isolate Mara from the clones, since only the real Mara can follow you.\n*Like other rakhsasas, he can clone other monsters. While monsters (most likely) won't be as dangerous as you, it can still make a dangerous encounter even worse. This is another good reason to fight Mara by himself.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*[[Silence]] does nothing against demons, but [[antimagic]] will cripple his spellcasting.\n*With a [[demon trident]], Mara becomes better at melee. As he constantly [[blink]]s, the trident's [[reaching]] makes it easier for him and the clones to hit you in melee.\n*Any statuses you have ([[haste]], [[might]]...) will also be transferred to the clone. However, this doesn't mean you shouldn't buff yourself; any buffs you have make it easier to kill Mara before the clone is summoned. Just don't go [[berserk]], since berserk works poorly against any enemy with [[Blink]].\n*While Mara has great [[willpower]], a [[scroll of vulnerability]] can make it reasonable for a [[wand of paralysis]] (if you have one) to work. But if you have any sort of [[Hexes]] spell (or [[Petrify]]), don't use vulnerability - it'll make you vulnerable to the clone's spells.\n*He's a very good choice for a [[Yredelemnul]] bound soul. Few monsters are able to handle a clone of themselves ''and'' 3 Maras ''and'' the player at the same time.\n\n==Trivia==\nIn Buddhism, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mara_%28demon%29 Mara] is the demon that tempted Buddha to give up his enlightenment.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Mara could cast [[Pain]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Mara knew [[Mislead]].\n*Mara was added in [[0.6]]."}

A large quantity of the desired element must be available; this is rarely a problem for earth and air, but may be for fire and water. The elemental will usually be friendly to casters - especially those skilled in the appropriate form of elemental magic.<br>You can sustain at most three creatures summoned by this spell.}}\n\n'''Summon Elemental''' is a level 4 [[Summonings]] spell which summons an elemental of either fire, water, air, or earth into existence. The type of elemental summoned varies based upon the contents of the tile you attempt to summon it from. While only the Summonings and [[Spellcasting]] skills are necessary to cast the spell, the friendliness of the summoned elemental is based entirely upon your skill in the associated elemental magic school:\n\n{{crawlquote|'''[[Fire elemental]]''': Summoned from [[lava]] or flame [[cloud]]s<br>[[Fire Magic]] × 10% friendliness rate<br>Fast fire damage strikers that leave a trail of flames<br><br>'''[[Water elemental]]''': Summoned from [[shallow water]] or [[deep water]]<br>[[Ice Magic]] × 10% friendliness rate<br>Decent minions that can silence casters<br><br>'''[[Air elemental]]''': Summoned from an empty tile<br>[[Air Magic]] × 6.66% friendliness rate<br>Fast, nimble physical damage attackers<br><br>'''[[Earth elemental]]''': Summoned from rock [[wall]]s<br>[[Earth Magic]] × 10% friendliness rate<br>Slow brutes that deal massive physical damage<br><br>'''Maximum Friendliness Rate''': 98%}}\n\n[[Iron elemental]]s cannot be summoned, except by [[the Iron Giant]].\n\n==Strategy==\n*One convenient aspect of some elementals is that they are immune to the kind of damage you are most likely going to be slinging around the battlefield. Air elementals have complete immunity to all Air Magic. Fire elementals are mostly immune (though [[Bolt of Magma]] or [[Fire Storm]] will make short work of them). Earth and water elementals have no immunity to their school's magic, so try not to hit them with friendly fire. However, all elementals are immune to poison, so if you're willing to use [[Poison Magic]], [[Poisonous Cloud]] pairs up well with elemental summoning.\n*Certain evocable items can be used to imitate this spell for a single element: the [[lamp of fire]], the [[phial of floods]], the [[stone of tremors]], and the [[fan of gales]].\n*Summoning an Earth elemental removes the square of rock wall that was used to create it.  It can thus be used as a 1-square-at-a-time [[Dig]].\n\n==History==\nSummon Elemental was removed in [[0.15]]\n\nPrior to [[0.11]], [[Merfolk]]s had lower chances of summoning unfriendly [[Water elemental]]s.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

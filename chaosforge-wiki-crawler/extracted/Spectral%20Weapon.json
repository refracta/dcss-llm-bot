{"title":"Spectral Weapon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spectral_Weapon","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n''For the currently existing [[brand]] that creates spectral weapons, see [[spectral]].''\n{{flavour|Draws out the spirit within a wielded weapon to fight for the caster, with its strength increasing with power. It only attacks when the caster does, and its kills count as the caster's own. If the weapon is damaged, part of the injury will be echoed on the caster's body. Only one spectral weapon can be maintained at a time, and only while the original weapon remains wielded.\n\nCertain powerful named artefacts cannot be affected, and any abilities that require evocation skill to trigger will not be active.}}\n{{Spell\n|name=Spectral Weapon\n|level=3\n|school1={{Charms}}\n|school2={{Hexes}}\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Battle]] \n</div>\n|castingnoise=3\n|spellnoise=0\n}}\n\n'''Spectral Weapon''' is a level 3 [[Charms]]/[[Hexes]] spell which summons a spectral clone of your melee weapon.\n\n==Useful Info==\nA spectral weapon entity, matching your wielded weapon, is created. It will follow you and attack each time you do. Damage done is proportional to both spell power and weapon skill, as well as the weapon base type.\n\nHalf of any damage dealt to the spectral weapon will additionally be dealt to you, regardless of your defenses and resistances. Spectral weapons have one level of [[resistance]] to fire, cold, electricity and poison. Their [[AC]], [[EV]] and max [[HP]] are proportional to [[spell power]]. \n\nSpectral Weapon works on all melee weapons, including [[magical staves]], except few [[unrand]]s: [[Singing Sword]], [[Mace of Variability]], [[Sword of Power]], [[Sceptre of Torment]] and [[Devastator]]. Unwielding your current weapon dismisses your spectral weapon.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

The main cost is strategic - the XP you need to cast the spell. Light armour makes it easier to cast, but lowers your defenses. Heavy armour provides good AC, but makes any spell difficult to cast.\n\nDue to the damage splitting effect of this spell, avoid using it around enemies with area of effect abilities. [[Fireball]], [[Freezing Cloud]], and [[Hellfire]] are all things you don't want dealing 1.5Ã— normal damage.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*[[Polearms]] are often preferred with Spectral Weapon, since you can [[reach]] over the weapon (and vice versa).\n*Spectral weapons can't see [[invisible]] creatures, so don't rely on one when facing an [[unseen horror]] or invisible [[sky beast]] or the like.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Dancing weapon]]\n\n==History==\n*Spectral Weapon was removed [[0.26]], along with the [[Charms]] school. The [[spectral]] brand was introduced in its place.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Spectral Weapon's strength was based on weapon skill instead of spell power.\n*Spectral Weapon was added in [[0.13]]."}

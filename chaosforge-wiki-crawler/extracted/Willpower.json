{"title":"Willpower","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Willpower","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Willpower''' ('''Will''') is the ability to resist hostile enchantments such as [[slow]], [[confusion]], [[banishment]] to [[the Abyss]], and [[paralysis]].\n\nThe higher a being's Will, the less likely that it will be affected by an enchantment cast on it. Beings that are magical in some way (such as [[list of deep elves|elves]] or [[siren]]s), magic-users, and those that are not [[natural]] tend to have higher Will than other creatures.\n\nMonster willpower is partly based on [[hit dice]], so monsters with high hit dice tend to be strong-willed. Most monsters with one hit die have a 50% chance to fail to resist enchantments outright, in addition to the normal saving throw. Finally, some monsters have unshakeable will and are outright immune to magical enchantments, such as most [[nonliving]] creatures.\n\n==Resistible Enchantments==\nSome of these effects can come from potions, weapon brands, clouds, or spells that are not considered enchantments.\n\n<div style=\"column-count:3\">\n*[[Agony]]\n*[[Banishment#Monster banishment|Banishment]]\n*[[Brain Feed]]\n*[[Cause Fear]]\n*[[Confuse]]\n*[[Confusing Touch]]\n*[[Corona]]\n*[[Dimension Anchor]]\n*[[Discord]]\n*[[Dispersal]] (confuse + teleport only)\n*[[Enfeeble]] (daze + blindness only)\n*[[Ensorcelled Hibernation]]\n*[[Inner Flame]]\n*[[Necrotise]]\n*[[Mass Confusion]]\n*[[Pain]]\n*[[Paralyse]]\n*[[Petrify]]\n*[[Porkalator]]\n*[[Scroll of fear]]\n*[[Sentinel's Mark]]\n*[[Sleep]] (but not the effects of [[Dream Dust]] from [[dream sheep]])\n*[[Slow]]\n*[[Strip Willpower]] (ignores Will 33% of the time)\n*[[Teleport Other]]\n*[[Virulence]]\n*[[Wand of mindburst]]\n*[[Wand of charming]]\n*[[Wand of paralysis]]\n*[[Wand of polymorph]]\n</div>\n\n===Notes===\n*Many of these enchantments can be resisted via other means. For example, undead, nonliving, and plant monsters cannot be put to [[sleep]].\n*[[Polymorph]] will not be resisted by ([[very ugly thing|very]]) [[ugly thing]]s, which will always change color. [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]]s can only resist it if they are currently in the form of something with unshakeable will.\n*Effects produced by the [[chaos]] brand don't check Will.\n\n==Resisting enchantments==\nResisting an enchantment is dependent on the resisting creature's Will and the [[#Enchantment power|enchantment power]] (which is a function of the [[spell power]]) of the enchantment it is resisting. The formula is:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|actor.cc|121}}</ref>\n\n{{crawlquote|If (1d100 + 1d101) is less than (102 + Will - enchantment_power), the enchantment is resisted.}}\n\nThis is sometimes referred to as a \"[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/saving_throw saving throw]\", after the die-based resistance system employed in ''Dungeons & Dragons''.\n\n[[File:magic_resistance_saving_throw.png]]\n\nIf <code>(willpower) ≥ (enchantment power + 99)</code>, then the enchantment is always resisted. If <code>(enchantment power) ≥ (willpower + 100)</code>, then the enchantment always succeeds. \n\n===Enchantment power===\nWhen a player casts a spell or evokes a wand, the game uses enchantment power, which is based off [[spell power]] and the type of spell cast.\n\nFirst, spellpower is modified by <code>spellpower * factor</code>, which is specific to a given spell. For example, [[Cause Fear]] and other \"mass enchantments\" have a factor of 3/2. The usual spell has a multiplier of 1. If your adjusted power > 35, it is then passed through a stepdown function, <code>35 * log2(1 + adj_pow/35)</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|beam.cc|6806}}<br>Stepdown function can be found at {{source ref|0.30.0|stepdown.cc|14}}</ref> \n\nThe stepdown function means that, for every 35 enchantment power, the next 35 power requires twice as much spellpower to obtain. Since spellpower (for spells) goes through a [[Spell power#Step down|stepdown]] of its own, it becomes very hard to raise power at high levels. To compensate, many high-level spells, such as [[Agony]] and [[Enfeeble]], have large multipliers.\n\nFor monsters, enchantment power is either 1. a flat number, or 2. a number based on monster [[hit dice]].\n\nAfter enchantment power is calculated, it is compared to the target's willpower (see above for more details).\n\n==Resistance Descriptions==\nNeither the player's nor monster's Will are ever given explicitly. A rough suggestion of how resistant they are can be seen by pressing the [[%]] key for the player, and e'''x'''amining a monster's description. \n\nPluses on these screens correspond to the Will level of the player or monster, as follows:\n{|- class=\"prettytable\"\n!Pluses shown\n!Player Will\n!Monster Will\n|-\n| ..... || 0-39 || 0\n|-\n| +.... || 40-79 || 1-40\n|-\n| ++... || 80-119 || 41-80\n|-\n| +++.. || 120-159 || 81-120\n|-\n| ++++. || 160-199 || 121-160\n|-\n| +++++ || 200 || 161 or more\n|}\n\nMonsters always have a set amount of willpower, which is listed on the wiki's respective monster page. Players' willpower can be calculated with the formulas below.\n\nAs a practical matter, a player who has Will++++ should generally be able to resist the most dangerous enchanters in the game (such as [[deep elf demonologist]]s, [[lich]]es, and [[ancient lich]]es). More Will reduces the likelihood of these spells landing even further, but the gains become significantly less important beyond this point.\n\n===Player Resistance===\nA player's innate willpower is determined by the following equation:\n\n Experience level × racial multiplier\n\nRacial multipliers are as follows:\n{|- class=\"prettytable\"\n!Will per XL\n!Species\n|-\n| 7 || [[Spriggan]]\n|-\n| 6 || [[Felid]], Purple [[draconian]]\n|-\n| 5 || [[Meteoran]], [[Mummy]], [[Naga]], [[Vine stalker]]\n|-\n| 4 || [[Deep elf]], [[Demigod]], [[Formicid]], [[Ogre]], [[Vampire]]\n|-\n| 3 || All other species\n|}\n\nThe following sources can add (or subtract) to your willpower:\n\n* +40 for each source of Will+\n** [[Ego|Armour of willpower]] (Will+)\n** [[Ring of willpower]] (Will+)\n** [[Good mutations#Magic Resistance|Strong-willed mutation]] (a level of Will+ per rank)\n** [[Lichform]] (Will+)\n** [[Artefact]]s (up to Will+++)\n* +80 when using [[Trog]]'s Hand\n* -80 with an [[guile|orb of guile]]\n\nWillpower is capped at 200 at this stage. Then, willpower is modified by the following factors (in order):\n\n*The total is then divided by two if you are under the '''Will/2''' status (from a [[scroll of vulnerability]], the [[:Category:Vuln flavour|attack]] of a [[phantasmal warrior]] or [[imperial myrmidon]], the [[Strip Willpower]] spell, or while in [[Tartarus]]).\n*The [[robe of Folly]] sets your willpower to 0.\n*[[Shadow Form]] gives infinite willpower.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], willpower was not capped at 200 (Will+++++).\n*Prior to [[0.26]], willpower was called '''magic resistance''' ('''MR''').\n*Prior to [[0.13]], [[Blink Other]] was subject to magic resistance.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Game_mechanics]]"}

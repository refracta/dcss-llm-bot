{"title":"Bolt of Cold","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bolt_of_Cold","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Fires a penetrating bolt of frost.}}\n\n'''Bolt of Cold''' is a monster-only spell capable of striking multiple targets along its path, doing a considerable amount of cold damage. [[Cold#Cold_Resistance| Cold resistance]] reduces the damage dealt by this spell by 50% (rC+), 66% (rC++), or 80% (rC+++). The [[Cold Breath]] monster ability is very similar to this spell. \n\nBolts of cold that travel through [[water]] will create [[freezing vapour]]s.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n{{Spell\n|name=Bolt of Cold\n|level=6\n|school1={{Conjurations}}\n|school2={{Ice Magic}}\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Ice]]\n*[[Wand of cold]]\n</div>\n|castingnoise=6\n|spellnoise=6\n}}\n\n{{AttackSpell\n|name=Bolt of Cold\n|formula = 6d(3+Power/9) [[cold]]\n|maxdmg = 6d(25)\n|maxsp = 200\n|range = 5\n|target = Bolt\n|tohit = 10+Power/25\n|special = N/A\n|hit_type = normal\n|hit_adder = 10\n|hit_num = 1\n|hit_denom = 25\n|dam_calculator = calcdice\n|dam_numdice = 6\n|dam_adder = 18\n|dam_num = 2\n|dam_denom = 3}}\n* Prior to [[0.26]], [[bolt spell]]s would decrease by 1 range for every target they hit.\n* Prior to [[0.25]], Bolt of Cold was a level 6 [[Conjurations]]/[[Ice Magic]] spell available to players. \n: It was often considered worse than [[Bolt of Fire]], due to its inferior range, and the fact that cold resistant monsters were generally more common ([[undead]] have rC+, for instance).\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

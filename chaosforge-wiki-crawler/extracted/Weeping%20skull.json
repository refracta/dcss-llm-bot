{"title":"Weeping skull","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Weeping_skull","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Weeping skulls''' can be found in [[ossuary|ossuaries]], [[Crypt]], and [[the Abyss]]. They spew [[clouds#Excruciating misery|clouds of excruciating misery]], harming the player for 10% of their health each turn without [[negative energy resistance]]. They also produce an aura of short-lived misery clouds a few tiles around them.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you lack negative energy resistance, do not fight these in corridors. You will quickly lose all of your health over the course of a few turns.\n*[[Torment resistance]] has no effect against clouds of excruciating misery.\n*If you stay still, the misery clouds created from [[Mourning Wail]] can never hit you, as it will not spawn clouds on tiles with vulnerable targets. The clouds that randomly spawn around the weeping skull can, however.\n*[[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] will likely destroy these in 1-2 casts.\n\n==History==\n*This monster was added in [[0.31]], replacing [[flying skull]]s."}

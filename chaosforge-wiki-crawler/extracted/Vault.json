{"title":"Vault","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Vault","type":"raw","data":"''Not to be confused with the dungeon branch [[The Vaults]].''\n\nThe term '''vault''' refers to any [[Dungeon features|dungeon feature]] that is not part of the dungeon's normal layout.  Vaults generally have a fixed layout, though many include random items or monsters, and some (notably [[Xom]]'s altar vault) randomize the terrain as well.\n\n==How do I recognize a vault?==\nVaults are created by humans, so often clash with the randomly generated dungeon. They will often be symmetric or have other form of \"structure\", though note that the dungeon may generate rooms, hallways, etc. randomly. Vaults may spawn with stone or green crystal walls in a level made of rock, while [[door|runed doors]] and [[transporter]]s are only created by vaults. \n\nParticularly devious vaults may not be obvious at first glance... until you open a door and find yourself face-to-face with a room full of [[kobold brigand]]s or worse. Out-of-branch or very out-of-depth monsters can also be a sign of a vault: if you find a [[red devil]] in the main [[Dungeon]], or a [[fire crab]] on D:9, it's probably as a result of a vault.\n\nMost [[branch]]es will always have one of a couple possible vaults on its final floor, protecting treasure and/or a [[rune of Zot]]. For example, 24 [[vault guard]]s will surround the entrance to [[Vaults]]:5, and the rest of the floor has vaults. The infamous orb chamber will always guard the [[Orb of Zot]] on [[Zot:5]]. Meanwhile, almost all temporary [[portal]] areas are defined entirely by vault structure.\n\n==How big are vaults?==\nA vault can be very small, like the 3x4 \"elevator\" vault.  This vault is nothing more than two staircases, one up and one down, enclosed in a ring of walls.  Very small vaults may be referred to as '''minivaults'''.\n\nOn the other end, a vault can encompass an entire level, such as with [[Vaults]]:5, or [[Crypt]]:3. Other such vaults may appear as a floor of [[Depths]] or the deeper parts of the main [[Dungeon]].\n\n==Where do I find vaults?==\nVaults can appear anywhere in the dungeon, though most (if not all) of them are restricted to specific parts.  Some vaults are tied to specific branches, while others will only appear if you're deep (or shallow) enough in the main dungeon.\n\n==What kinds of vaults are there?==\nThe easiest kind of vault to find is an entrance vault.  Entrance vaults are generated on D:1 as something interesting for the player to look at or interact with when they first enter the game.  A few can be dangerous if handled badly--some have a large number of monsters behind a warning-scrawled door in a clear wall--but they're generally just eye candy.\n\nVaults are used to place [[altar]]s in the main dungeon, sometimes thematically appropriate (like a \"yin-yang\" symbol for a good and evil god). [[Ghost vault]]s are used to trap [[player ghost|ghosts of past players]] in a neat container, as of [[0.22]].\n\nDeeper in the dungeon, however, you can find vaults with good treasure or dangerous monsters, and often both.  One vault is nothing more than a pair of angled corridors with hostile [[statue]]s at the end and a bit of treasure behind them.\n\nThe entrances to new [[branch]]es are often contained in a vault that reflects their nature.  [[Orcish Mines]] is often surrounded by many [[orc]]s, [[natural]] monsters surround [[The Lair]], and [[The Vaults]] may have some treasure just outside.\n\n==How many vaults are there?==\n\nThough it's difficult to read, the full list of vaults can be viewed [https://github.com/crawl/crawl/tree/master/crawl-ref/source/dat/des here] as part of the game's source.  A quick search of that directory reveals that there are over 1,000 vaults in the game as of 0.10 and more than twice as many in master (the development version).  Do note, however, that these counts include the tutorials, and presumably other vaults that aren't seen in the game proper.\n\n==Oooh, shiny!==\n\nBe careful!  While vaults can contain very good items, they may also spawn with [[out-of-depth]] monsters, like a [[golden dragon]] on D:14.  When approaching a vault, remember that it may have loose monsters, devious traps, or intelligent denizens who will come out to investigate if you make too much noise.  If you actually open a door, be prepared to run if you don't like what's on the other side.\n\n== See Also ==\n\n* [[Example Vaults]]\n* [[:Category:Vault monsters|List of vault-defined monsters]]\n\n[[Category:Dungeon_Features]]"}

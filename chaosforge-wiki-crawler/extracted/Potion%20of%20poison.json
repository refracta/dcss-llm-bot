Your poison status will be set to yellow, or higher if you were already poisoned. Each level (up to poison level 5) will deal on average 8 damage, with a frequency depending on your number of poisoned levels (20% chance per turn per level to lose 1 HP).\n\nThey are not entirely useless, however. Characters with rPois may drink them for a small amount of [[nutrition]].\n\n \"That liquid tasted very nasty...\"\n \"You feel slightly nauseous.\" (with poison resistance)\n\n==History==\nPotions of poison were removed in [[0.18]].\n\nPrior to [[0.12]], potions of poison were useful when coupled with [[Evaporate]], producing [[cloud]]s of poison gas wherever they were thrown."}

{"title":"Anaconda","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Anaconda","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{list of | snakes}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Anacondas''' are extremely fast, non-venomous [[constriction|constricting]] snakes which deal significant damage in melee. They annihilate lightly-armoured casters foolish enough to let them get close, and are a risk to anyone else who can't kill them quickly. They can be found in some vaults (e.g. one of the possible endings of [[the Lair]]) and more commonly in [[the Snake Pits]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nWhile anacondas do a lot of damage, they lack poison resistance. [[Curare]] [[dart]]s are quite effective. If it managed to get close and constrict you, you can always try [[Mephitic Cloud]]. Like other snakes, they have poor [[willpower]], so a [[wand of paralysis]] or the like will also work.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.10]], anacondas got a bite attack. Previously, they could only constrict their enemies.\n*Prior to [[0.7]], anacondas weren't amphibious."}

{"title":"Eringya's Surprising Bouquet","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Eringya%27s_Surprising_Bouquet","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n'''Eringya's Surprising Bouquet''' was a spell only available in very early pre-''Stone Soup'' versions of ''Dungeon Crawl''. Casting it would convert any wooden item you are currently wielding into an edible bouquet of flowers.\n\nAlthough few if any modern ''Crawl'' players are familiar with the spell, it remained historically important as an explanation of [[Eringya's Formal Garden]], one of the original batch of [[Wizard Laboratory|wizard laboratories]], before the introduction of [[Eringya's Noxious Bog]]."}

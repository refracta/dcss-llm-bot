{"title":"Summon Caniforms","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summon_Caniforms","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n'''Summon Caniforms''' is a monster-only spell which summons 1-5 of the following forest-related animals:\n\n{{monsterlink|Wolf}}(52.6%)\n\n{{monsterlink|Black bear}}(31.6%)\n\n{{monsterlink|Grizzly bear}}(15.8%)\n\nAlthough none of these monsters are terribly dangerous on their own, they can prove a costly distraction while the caster hits you with its more dangerous spells, especially if they manage to pin you down adjacent to several animated [[tree]]s.\n\n==History==\nSummon Caniforms was removed in 0.13, when the only monster that could cast it ([[spriggan druid]]s) had their spell list updated.\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

{"title":"Troll (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Troll_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n''This page is about the troll [[monster]]. For the player race, see [[troll]].''\n{{list of|trolls}}\n{{monster info|troll}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Trolls''' are hulking brutes that lumber into melee, tearing apart their opponents with powerful attacks. Although they lack resistances, they regenerate [[HP]] quickly and are fairly durable for early monsters. They are most commonly found in the late [[Dungeon]], [[Orcish Mines]], and [[the Vaults]]. More powerful [[List of trolls|trolls]] will harass you throughout most of the game.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Use caution when you first encounter trolls; low-level melee fighters may not be able to survive long enough in melee to land a killing blow, and trollish regeneration makes it so they always win wars of attrition. Use wands or some other form of ranged attack to soften them up before engaging.\n*[[Mephitic Cloud]] can render them fit for nuking from afar, but [[stabbing]] still has risks. They may still land a hit or two in melee, so don't move in for the kill unless you've got full health.\n*Killing a troll has a 33% chance to produce a [[troll leather armour]] (unless you blow it up with an [[Orb of destruction]] or a [[wand of disintegration]]). The armour provides you with slightly better defense than a [[leather armour]] and a source of health [[regeneration]].\n*If you insist on taking them in melee, a good [[venom]]-branded weapon will effectively counter their regeneration.\n\n[[Category:Troll]]"}

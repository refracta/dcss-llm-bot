{"title":"Source code","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Source_code","type":"raw","data":"The '''source code''' for [[Crawl]] is the complete set of programming instructions and data that are compiled into a playable game. Unlike most commercial programs, ''Crawl'' is released under an open source license (GPL V2+), meaning the source code is freely accessible by anyone. Crawl is written in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B C++].\n\nCrawl is actively in development, with new code changes being introduced rapidly (often weekly or even daily). [[Trunk]] is the version of the code containing the latest changes. Periodically these changes are gathered up into a [[Current release|release version]], which has been tested to minimize bugs and other problems.\n\nThe Crawl source code can be accessed at [https://github.com/crawl/crawl https://github.com/crawl/crawl]. The default view is of [[trunk]]; to view source code from prior release versions, click on the dropdown that says \"Branch: master\", choose \"tags,\" and then select the version you want.\n\nTo search through the code, type a search term in the box at the top of the page. Note that search is case-insensitive and only searches the trunk version.\n\nProspective developers should read the [https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/docs/develop/contribution-process.md contribution guide] and the [https://crawl.develz.org/wiki/doku.php?id=dcss:help:start introductory pages on the Crawl dev wiki]. Others may simply enjoy source diving to tease out many of the game's secrets.\n\n==Source diving==\n\"Source diving\" is the act of reading/searching through the source code of a program. Source diving is usually done when someone wants to know how something really works in the game. Source divers may also program their own [[patch]]es to the game.\n\nEven those who do not understand C++ may be able to source dive to discover Easter eggs or interesting comments in the source, or to look up basic data or text (such as in-game flavour messages).\n\n[[Category:Crawl]]"}

{"title":"Riposte","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Riposte","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n\n'''Riposte''' is an [[ego]] exclusive to the [[unrandart]] [[fencer's gloves]]. If a player [[Dodging|dodges]] or [[shield|blocks]] a monster's melee attack while wearing these gloves, there is a 1/3 chance they will riposte, letting them perform a reflexive attack against the monster (like a [[minotaur]] headbutt). A monster can only be riposted once per their turn. If you riposte, the effects from an [[amulet of the acrobat]] are negated.\n\nRiposte probability does not take into account weapon skill or weapon delay. They also do not interact with certain enemy passive abilities, such as [[hydra]] decapitation or [[spiny]] retaliation.\n\n== History ==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], riposte did not work on [[shield|blocked]] attacks.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], riposte was an innate quality of all [[Long Blades]] (which had reduced base damage to compensate).\n*Riposte was introduced in [[0.19]]."}

In ''Crawl'', monsters and players can be vulnerable to any of a number of elements, to varying degrees.\n\n==Players==\nPlayers can be vulnerable to [[fire]], [[cold]], [[poison]], [[holy]], [[silver]], and [[dragon slaying]] effects. In most cases, being vulnerable to an element causes that element to do 150% damage to the player. Poison vulnerability causes poison to last twice as long as it ordinarially would. For most vulnerablities, there is no difference between having one level or three, though more vulnerability needs more resistance to negate. \n\nSilver behaves differently than the others; the additional damage it causes scales with the number of [[mutation]]s you currently have instead of being determined by specific ranks of vulnerability. Dragon Slaying is only found on the unrand [[Wyrmbane]], dealing +75% damage.\n\nSources of player vulnerability are, by element:\n*Cold\n**[[Rings of fire]] give one level per ring worn.\n**Being in [[Dragon Form]] gives one rank of cold vulnerability (except for non-red [[Draconian]]s).\n**[[Artefact]]s can occasionally have the property.\n*Fire\n**[[Ring of ice|Rings of ice]] give one level per ring worn.\n**White draconians that cast Dragon Form gain one rank of fire vulnerability\n**Being a [[mummy]].\n**Occasionally found on [[artefact]]s.\n*Poison\n**[[Spider Form]].\n**[[Virulence]].\n*Holy\n**Being undead, whether naturally or through the spell [[Necromutation]]. The undead races can never be rid of this vulnerability, although thankfully, holy attacks are fairly rare.\n**Worshiping an evil god: [[Beogh]], [[Dithmenos]] [[Lugonu]], [[Kikubaaqudgha]], [[Makhleb]], or [[Yredelemnul]].\n*Silver\n**Each mutation you possess increases damage from silver weapons by 5% (up to a maximum of 175%).\n*Dragon slaying\n**All [[draconian]]s are vulnerable to dragon slaying.\n\n==Monsters==\nMonsters can be vulnerable to all of the same elements as players. Vulnerability works fairly similarly, except that it is only ever one level for monsters, and it causes them to take 200% damage from elemental melee damage. They can gain vulnerability through items just as players do, and many monsters start off with them.\n\nAs stated above, holy vulnerability does not specifically relate to weapons of holy wrath.  Holy weapons only cause extra damage to monsters which are demonic or undead; many \"evil\" spellcasters also have holy vulnerability, but do not take extra damage from weapons of holy wrath.  They will, however, take more damage from player-invoked [[cleansing flame]].\n\nA non-exhaustive list of monsters vulnerable to the various elements is given below:\n\n*Cold: Many \"fiery\" monsters are vulnerable to cold.  This includes but is not limited to:\n**[[Brimstone fiend]]s\n**[[Balrug]]s\n**[[Dragon]]s\n**[[Crimson imp]]s\n**[[Hellion]]s\n**[[Fire elemental]]s\n*Fire: Many \"icy\" monsters are vulnerable to fire, along with a few others.  Some examples are:\n**[[Ice fiend]]s\n**[[Blizzard demon]]s\n**[[Simulacrum|Simulacra]]\n**[[Azure jellies]]\n**[[Mummy (monster)|Mummies]] - but note that the more dangerous types of mummies found in Tomb are '''not''' vulnerable to fire.\n**Another notable exception to what one might expect: Despite their description as dessicated corpses, [[lich]]es are not vulnerable to fire, although they do not resist it either.\n*Poison: In general, poison-vulnerable monsters are insects, who absorb air through their skin instead of breathing it, making them more vulnerable to poison.\n**[[Worker ant]]s\n**[[Scorpion]]s - but note that [[emperor scorpion]]s are not vulnerable; in fact, they are poison-resistant.\n**[[Killer bee]]s\n**[[Fire crab]]s\n**[[Spriggan rider]]s - vulnerable since their [[giant firefly]] mounts are vulnerable.\n*Holy: This includes everything that could vaguely be classified as a demon or undead, as well as many \"evil\" creatures.  Examples include:\n**All monsters with the \"demonic\" flag: in console, demons are quite easily distinguished by their numeric glyphs.  All the typical denizens of Hell and Pandemonium fall under this category.\n**All undead monsters.  These include [[lich]]es, [[List of mummies|mummies]] of all types, [[skeletal warrior]]s, and all [[skeleton]]s, [[simulacra]], and [[zombie]]s. Note that [[profane servitor]]s are resistant to [[cleansing flame]].\n**[[Abomination]]s.\n**Many \"evil\" uniques: [[Jessica]], [[Josephine]], [[Saint Roka]], [[Frances]], [[Nergalle]], and a few others.\n**Monsters that cast powerful necromantic spells, such as [[deep elf death mage]]s, [[deep dwarf necromancer]]s, and [[orc sorcerer]]s.\n**Monsters in the service of evil gods, including [[orc priest]]s, [[deep elf priest]]s, and [[deep dwarf death knight]]s.\n*Silver\n**Monsters which are native to [[the Abyss]], such as [[wretched star]]s and [[apocalypse crab]]s.\n**Monsters with [[mutation]]-inflicting attacks, such as [[orbs of fire]] and [[neqoxec]]s.\n**Anything you've [[Polymorph Other|polymorphed]].\n*Dragon slaying\n**All [[list of dragons|dragons]].\n[[category:intrinsic]]"}

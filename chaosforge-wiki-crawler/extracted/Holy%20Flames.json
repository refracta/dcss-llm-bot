These flames are especially dangerous to undead and demonic creatures, and have no effect on holy creatures.}}\n\n'''Holy Flames''' is a monster-only spell which fills every tile around the target with short-lived [[cloud]]s of [[Cloud#Blessed_fire|blessed fire]]. These can deal very heavy damage to [[demonic]] and [[undead]] characters if they choose to walk through them, but [[blink]]ing out is safe. The clouds do no harm to worshippers of [[good gods]] or [[Qazlal]], though.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

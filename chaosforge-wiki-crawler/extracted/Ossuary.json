Sand surrounds the staircase and is continuously pouring onto it. Before long the staircase will be gone. They say that some distant relatives of the pharaohs were entombed here.}}\n\n[[File:Ossuary portal.png]][[Ossuary]] is a temporary [[portal]] level found in the early Dungeon. Ossuraries are filled with [[undead]] monsters, including [[mummy (monster)|mummies]], often contain [[trap]]s, and have a pile of treasure at the end.\n\nOssuaries may appear on [[Dungeon]]: 4-8. The portal is signaled by a \"hiss of flowing sand\"; if you take too long, the entrance closes. Ossurary entrances usually have yellow walls around them.\n\n==Layout==\nThe Ossuary's layout is unpredictable. Although it's always a fairly small floor, it ranges from a wide open crypt with little cover, to a series of interconnected rooms, all separated by doors.\n\n==Monsters==\nMost ossuary layouts house the usual undead:\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n|-\n| {{Brown|Z}} [[File:Small_zombie.png]] '''[[Zombie]]''' || {{LightGrey|Z}} [[File:Skeleton_medium_humanoid.png]] '''[[Skeleton]]''' || {{LightGrey|M}} [[File:Mummy_(monster).png]] '''[[Mummy_(monster)|Mummy]]''' \n|}\n\nOther monsters only appear in specific layouts and are usually more dangerous:\n\n{{monsterlink|Wight}} - Have normal speed, enchanted weapons and are capable of draining you.\n\n{{monsterlink|Wraith}} - Very strong for an Ossurary, and capable of [[slow]]ing you down from melee attacks. Many layouts with them start with some wraiths locked behind transparent [[wall]]s.\n\n{{Blue|Z}}[[File:Simulacrum small humanoid.png]]'''[[Simulacrum (monster)|Simulacrum]]''' - Fragile icy constructs that deal extra cold damage.\n\n{{Green|Z}}[[File:Spectral small humanoid.png]]'''[[Spectral thing]]''' - Slow and weak but intelligent spirits that can regenerate and have draining attacks\n\n{{monsterlink|Scorpion}} - The only living monster encountered in ossuaries. Can inflict [[poison]]ing.\n\n{{monsterlink|Menkaure}} - A unique mummy, capable of [[torment]]. Fragile, but extremely dangerous.\n\n{{monsterlink|Flying skull}} - Fast and dangerous at this point of the dungeon. Will wake up everything with their shrieking.\n\n{{Green|M}} [[File:Mummy.png]] '''Bog mummy''' - A [[mummy (monster)#Variant Mummy|mummy]] that can cast [[Throw Frost]] and [[Slow]]. Can be found in a partially submerged ossuary level.\n\nFor the various [[derived undead]] you'll encounter, the base types will be monsters that tend to be seen in the upper dungeon, ranging from [[goblin]]s and [[kobold]]s through [[elf|elves]] and [[human (monster)|humans]] up to around [[water moccasin]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The Ossuary is often found very early in the game. [[Ice Elementalist]]s, [[Venom Mage]]s and [[Necromancer]]s without [[Dispel Undead]] may want to skip it if they have no means of dealing with undead enemies.\n*The mummies you encounter are slow, but hit hard. Fire [[damage]] or weapons of [[holy wrath]] will make short work of them.\n*Even average speed species are faster than mummies and zombies, so are able to disengage if things get sour. Fast species like [[spriggan]]s can handle many layouts without a single fight.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], players could find a decayed [[bog body]] instead of a [[mummy (monster)#Variant Mummy|bog mummy]] in a flooded ossuary. It was weaker than its [[swamp]]-dwelling brethren and had [[Throw Frost]] instead of [[Bolt of Cold]].\n*Ossuary was added in [[0.5.0]] and was first called \"Minitomb\".\n\n{{Portals}}\n\n[[Category:Portals]] [[Category:Mummy]]"}

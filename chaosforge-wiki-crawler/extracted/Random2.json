{"title":"Random2","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Random2","type":"raw","data":"'''random2''' is a function used in Crawl's code to select a random number. It is defined in the following way:\n\n<code>random2(''int max'')</code>\n\nand returns a random number from 0 to ''max-1'', which is <code>1d''max'' - 1</code> in the dice notation. Therefore, '''random2(2)''' returns either 0 or 1, which is how the '''coinflip''' function is defined.\n\n'''random2''' is defined in [https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/source/random.cc random.cc], along with many other important random functions. Most calculations of damage, quantities, and properties, will use it, so wiki editors who are looking into the source to find out these values should familiarise themself with the function.\n\n[[Category:Source]]"}

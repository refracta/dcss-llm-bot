{"title":"Atropa","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Atropa","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{flavour|It is tipped with a substance that causes blindness and brief confusion.}}\n\n'''Atropa''' is a [[brand]] found only on [[dart]]s. When a creature is struck with an atropa-tipped dart, it will be [[blind]]ed and may become [[confusion|confused]]; the blindness will last longer than the confusion.\n\nUnlike most brands, atropa's effectiveness is determined by the player's skill in [[Throwing]] and [[Stealth]], and resisted by the target's [[hit dice]]:\n*The chance is <code>100 - 100 * (HD - 2) / (4 + pow)</code>, where <code>pow = (Throwing + Stealth) * 2 / 3</code><ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|throw.cc|249}}</ref>.\n*For monsters with [[HD]] < 15, there is a 3% chance to succeed anyway even if the above chance fails.\n\n==Strategy==\nAtropa is probably most effective when used for setting up [[stab]]bing opportunities, but any fight is made easier if your opponent can't see you or think straight.\n\nAtropa works well enough on early threats like [[list of gnolls|gnolls]] or [[orc warrior]]s, but without investment in Throwing and/or Stealth, these darts will be mostly useless on monsters by the time you reach the [[Lair]].\n\n==Trivia==\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropa Atropa] refers to a genus of poisonous plants, the most well-known of which is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropa_belladonna Belladonna] (a.k.a. Deadly Nightshade).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], atropa-tipped darts couldn't blind players.\n*Atropa was introduced in [[0.24]], replacing the old [[confusion (brand)|confusion]] brand found on [[needle]]s.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{brands}}"}

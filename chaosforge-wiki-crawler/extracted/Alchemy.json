{"title":"Alchemy","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Alchemy","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n\nThe '''Alchemy''' school focuses on inflicting poison and altering your surroundings. Despite its name, no Alchemy spells affect items in any way.\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n{{spell table by level|Alchemy}}\n\n==Strategy==\n*Many Alchemy spells can be considered as \"side\" spells. They often have a major limitation, but come with strong/useful effects to compensate.\n**For example, Irradiate has only 1 range, and can only be used a few times in a row safely, but can otherwise tear apart enemies. Most of the [[poison]]-themed spells do little against foes with [[poison resistance]], but are great against foes without.\n*Most of Alchemist's starting spells are strong, but don't do much against foes with [[poison resistance]]. Sticky Flame can be used to take out rPois monsters, though as a level 4 spell, it'll take a while to use consistently.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Alchemist]]\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.32]], [[Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot]] was removed, and [[Hoarfrost Cannonade]] and [[Fulsome Fusillade]] were added. \n*In [[0.31]], Alchemy was introduced, replacing [[Poison Magic]] and part of [[Transmutations]].\n\n{{Skills}}\n\n[[Category:Magic skills]] [[Category:Alchemy Spells]]"}

Electrical bolts can pierce through enemies and bounce from walls, potentially causing a [[doublezap]]. As BEAM_ELEC damage, it ignores 1/2 of your [[AC]]. Compared to Lightning Bolt, this spell is more accurate, has more dice, and doesn't create nearly as loud of a [[noise]].\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

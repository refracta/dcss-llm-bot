{"title":"Master elementalist","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Master_elementalist","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{stub}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe '''master elementalist''' is a powerful caster with spells from all four elemental schools of magic, as well as some potent support spells. It can only be found in the \"Elemental Laboratory\" vault, and it will always guard a [[randart]] elemental magic [[spellbook]], as well as an elemental [[magical staff]] or the [[Elemental Staff]] [[unrand]]art. Also, it spawns with a [[ego|branded]] [[robe]].\n\nThe master elementalist appears only in the [[Elven Halls]] or [[Depths]]. When this vault generates in other branches, the boss is modified to be a depth-appropriate monster wielding the Elemental Staff. In the [[Dungeon]], you can find a [[deep elf pyromancer]], [[deep elf zephyrmancer]], or a [[tengu reaver]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The master elementalist is essentially a [[deep elf annihilator]] with the addition of Chain Lightning, Fire Storm, and Haste. An incredibly dangerous foe, but not without a few weaknesses:\n**Both [[silence]] and [[waterlog]] will completely disable the elementalist's spellcasting, making the fight extremely easy.\n**A [[tin of tremorstones]], if you have high Evocations, is likely to kill in one charge.\n**Going [[invisible]] or [[blind]]ing the elementalist will make it less likely for spells to target you.\n*Regardless, if the master elementalist gets [[haste]]d, either silence/waterlog or escape the fight immediately. You don't want to take 222+ damage per turn.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the master elementalist had the following spells: [[Iron Shot]] (3d28), [[Summon Air Elementals]], [[Sticky Flame Range]] (3d6), [[Summon Water Elementals]], [[Haste]], and [[Blink]].\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

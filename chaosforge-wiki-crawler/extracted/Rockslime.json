{"title":"Rockslime","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Rockslime","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | jellies}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful info==\n'''Rockslimes''' are durable, [[trample|trampling]] jellies that resemble [[dire elephant]]s more than anything amorphous. Like other jellies, they are commonly found in the [[Slime Pits]], but can show up in a few [[vault]]s elsewhere.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Their resistance to fire is designed to counteract [[Ignition]] and [[immolation]]-based strategies. These are perfect for taking out [[TRJ]] and other slimes, but you'll need some way to fight and/or escape the rockslime aftermath.\n*With 12 speed, they will \"outrun\" most adventurers who try to walk away. Fortunately, unlike [[quicksilver ooze]]s, [[acid blob]]s, or [[azure jelly|azure jellies]], their damage output is a bit more manageable. Dealing up to 50 damage per swing isn't ''trivial'', but it's better than getting engulfed, corroded, or eating a bunch of AC-ignoring cold damage.\n*Stairs are normally safe to use in Slime, but if a rockslime is within 2 tiles of you, it can trample you off. Note that it can't trample if there's no place to trample - having a creature (ally, enemy, or [[Fulminant Prism]]) behind you prevents the trample effect.\n*While rockslimes have extremely high AC for a jelly, their EV is terrible, and they have a number of weaknesses:\n**They have average [[willpower]] for the stage of the game they tend to appear in, so hexes and hex [[wand]]s work.\n**They are vulnerable to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]], which handily bypasses their AC (and hits other creatures around the rockslime).\n**They are resistant to fire and electricity, but have few other resistances (not even resistant to [[acid]]). All sorts of high-power attacks, even if low accuracy, can take out a rockslime.\n\n==History==\n*Rockslimes were added in [[0.27]]."}

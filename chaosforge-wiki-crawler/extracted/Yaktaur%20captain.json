{"title":"Yaktaur captain","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Yaktaur_captain","type":"raw","data":"{{version017}}\n''For a list of all centaur-type creatures, see [[list of centaurs]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Yaktaur captains''' are the [[yaktaur]] equivalent of [[centaur warrior]]s - an elite among [[yaktaur]] marksmen. They have higher [[HP]] and deal significantly more damage with their [[crossbow]]s, but are otherwise almost identical. They can be found throughout [[the Depths]] and [[the Vaults]], often leading a pack of their less talented cousins.\n\n==Tips &Tricks==\n*Treat them like normal yaktaurs, but expect them to take a little more abuse and definitely give them priority if you have several targets to choose from. You don't want to give them time to shoot at you while you deal with their underlings. Whenever possible, lure them around corners and deal with the entire pack at melee range."}

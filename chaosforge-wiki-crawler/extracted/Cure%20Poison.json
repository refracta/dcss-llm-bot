It can also be good in branches full of poison, namely the [[Lair]], [[Spider's Nest]] and [[Snake Pit]].\n\nHowever, the effect is very niche. Unlike poison resistance, it does nothing against poison impact damage ([[Spit Poison]], [[Venom Bolt]], [[Poison Arrow]]). It takes a turn to cast, meaning the actual combat uses are limited. Plus, outside of a few branches, poison isn't especially common. And a [[potion of curing]] can do the same thing. But you might as well have this spell if you don't care about the [[spell level]]s. Some characters ''do'' care about spell levels, and will want to [[scroll of amnesia|forget]] this spell quickly.\n\n[[Deep Dwarves]] prefer this spell, as it can prevent them from being damaged.\n\n==History==\n*Cure Poison was removed in [[0.19]].\n*In very early versions of Crawl, this belonged to the [[holy spell school]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

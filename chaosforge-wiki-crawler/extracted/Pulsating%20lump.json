They are weak and move very slowly, but their melee attacks can [[mutate]] you, making them worth being cautious around. They can also be found in certain [[vault]]s, [[the Slime Pits]], and [[Cigotuvi's Fleshworks]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Most forms of mutation resistance come with at least a small failure rate, so try to kill them at range. Fortunately, their slow speed means even [[naga]]s can [[kite]] them.\n*If you encounter these creatures in [[Cigotuvi's Fleshworks]], they are not actually pulsating lumps, but pulsating lump [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]]s: treat them accordingly.\n\n==History==\n*Pulsating lumps were removed in [[0.15]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], you could transform opponents into pulsating lumps by drawing a [[Vitriol card]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], you could transform opponents into pulsating lumps with the [[Cigotuvi's Degeneration]] spell.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

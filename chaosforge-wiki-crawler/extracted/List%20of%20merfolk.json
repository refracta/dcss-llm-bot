They are only lightly armoured, but many carry decent [[polearms]], and some even carry [[throwing net]]s or [[javelin]]s. Be careful not to face them in the water, as they gain combat bonuses when in their own element.\n\nMerfolk have different professions, granting them unique powers.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nThe real danger with merfolk is that the Shoals are completely wide open. If you make too much noise, you can draw a merfolk army on you, not to mention the other monstrous threats in the area. Without a way to [[fly]] or swim, it's entirely possible to get pinned down while splashing around helplessly in [[shallow water]].\n\n==Merfolk Types==\n{{LightRed|m}} [[File:Merfolk (monster).png]] '''[[Merfolk (monster)|Merfolk]]''' - Lightly armed foot soldiers of the merfolk people.\n\n{{monsterlink|Merfolk impaler}} - Rugged [[trident]] fighters who rapidly poke their foes to death.\n\n{{monsterlink|Merfolk javelineer}} - Deadly fish people who hurl [[javelin]]s from the safety of the seas.\n\n{{monsterlink|Merfolk aquamancer}} - These dangerous casters wield water magic and control the waves.\n\n{{monsterlink|Water nymph}} - Playful, murderous creatures who bring the sea with them wherever they go and compel it to drown anyone within its reach.\n\n{{monsterlink|Siren}} - Enchanting singers, with voices so lovely they can compel you to stay and listen, no matter the danger around you.\n\n{{monsterlink|Merfolk avatar}} - These sadistic singers enthrall their audiences so thoroughly that the ghosts of their drowned victims rise and obey their commands.\n\n===Unique Merfolk===\n{{monsterlink|Ilsuiw}} - An infuriating, often [[invisible]] aquamancer who leads an army of merfolk and calls [[water elemental]]s to her aid.\n\n===Obsolete Merfolk===\n{{monsterlink|Mermaid}} - Merfolk with enchanting voices that prevented their listeners from moving away.\n\n==History==\nMermaids and sirens were renamed to sirens and merfolk avatars respectively in [[0.16]]\n\n[[Category:Merfolk]]\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

This spell cannot be used if another cloud is on your tile.\n\nBlastmotes will explode when:\n*A creature moves onto the tile.\n*The cloud is hit directly by fire damage.\n\nIt explodes in a 3x3 square centered on its tile, dealing fire damage. Any creature (including the player) not on the center will be knocked away. This knockback does not deal extra damage if a creature would collide into a wall.\n\nYou can stay on a cloud of blastmotes as long as you want without detonating it. The process of stepping into the blastmotes causes an explosion, however.\n\n==Strategy==\nVolatile Blastmotes essentially creates a landmine on your tile. Once something walks into the blastmotes, it explodes. Enemies will not try to avoid stepping on the blastmotes, even if they are [[monster intelligence|intelligent]]. \n\nAssuming you can get creatures to walk into the blastmotes, this spell's damage per MP is higher than [[Scorch]], and unlike [[Flame Wave]], can be used at a distance.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Beware: when placing blastmotes adjacent to each other, exploding one will cause the others to explode as well.\n*This spell can be used to (painfully) escape from [[attack of opportunity]] range. Cast the spell, then step back one tile. The monster gets 1 attack of opportunity, then activates the blastmotes, which damages you and knocks you back.\n\n==History==\n*This spell was added [[0.30]], as a replacement for [[Conjure Flame]]."}

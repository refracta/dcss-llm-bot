These clouds of negative energy will rapidly drain the living of small fractions of their maximum health.}}\n\n'''March of Sorrows''' is a monster-only spell that created [[clouds]] of excruciating misery. It's an upgraded version of the [[weeping skull]]'s\nmisery cloud spell - a cloud line that lasts 8-12 turns and doesn't skip over the target. Also, there is a [[Mephitic Cloud]]-style 1-radius burst of 2-5 turn clouds at the end of the cloud line.\n\nUnless you have [[negative energy resistance]], clouds of excruciating misery will quickly drain your health. These clouds deal 10% of the player's max HP damage (6.6% with rN+, 3.3% with rN++, none with rN+++) and 15% of monster max HP whenever they hit.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*This spell was added in [[0.31]].\n\n[[Category: Monster spells]]"}

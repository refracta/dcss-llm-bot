It uses its own magic reservoir for casting spells, and recharges automatically according to the recharging rate.\n\n----\n\n“At this particular moment in time, I don't believe I have a healthier or more deeply-felt respect for any object in the universe than this here shotgun...”<br>-Steven ‘Body Bag’ Behling and Michael ‘Splatter’ Steward, _Doom_. 1996.}}\n\nThe wielder of an '''iron rod''' may evoke it to cast the [[Scattershot]] spell, launching several randomly aimed bits of shrapnel within a medium-ranged cone. The individual shots don't do very heavy damage on their own, but firing it in melee range often focuses multiple shots on one target, dealing heavy damage. It can only be fired a few times before needing to recharge, comes with a hefty [[spell hunger|hunger cost]], and generates exceptional amounts of noise, but it excels at putting out a lot of damage to a low-[[AC]] target within a very short period of time.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.20]], [[rods]] were removed, and the iron rod was converted to the [[wand of scattershot]].\n\nThe iron rod was added in [[0.16]]."}

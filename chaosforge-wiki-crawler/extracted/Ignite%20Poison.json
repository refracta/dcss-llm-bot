{"title":"Ignite Poison","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ignite_Poison","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Ignite Poison''' is a level 4 [[Fire Magic|Fire]]/[[Alchemy]] spell which causes all nearby [[poisoned]] creatures and poisonous [[cloud]]s to burst into flames.\n\n==Useful Info==\nAll poisoned monsters in line of sight take [[fire]] damage and lose their poisoned status.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-damage.cc|2138}}</ref> All poisonous clouds and noxious fumes (i.e. mephitic clouds) in the caster's [[line of sight]] are replaced with flame clouds. Tiles affected by [[Eringya's Noxious Bog]] have a chance to create short-lived flame clouds. \n\nHigher [[spell power]] increases the duration of the flame clouds and the damage taken by poisoned creatures.\n\n*Poisoned creatures take direct damage according to how many [[Poison#Monster Formula|poison stacks]] they have, dealing approximately 200%-300% of the potential poison damage immediately, depending on spell power.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-damage.cc|2095}}<br>Specifically, Ignite Poison deals <code>(Stacks * 2)</code>d<code>(12 + 6*pow/100)</code> damage. At maximum poison (4 stacks; \"extremely poisoned\"), this ranges from 8d12 to 8d18. Like poison damage, this spell ignores [[AC]].</ref>\n*Duration of the flame clouds from poison and noxious clouds is <code>3 + (1d(20 + <power>) - 1) / 10</code> turns<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-damage.cc|2051}}</ref>â€”that is, from 3-5 turns to 3-15 turns.\n**Duration of the flame clouds from Noxious Bog is instead <code>1 + 1d(1 + <power>/30)</code> turns (2-5 turns).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-damage.cc|2013}}</ref>\n\nNote that the spell can't affect monsters with fire immunity, e.g., [[lava snake]]s or [[salamander]]s. Casting the spell won't damage them, and they will retain their poison. It will still affect clouds under these monsters, however.\n\n==Strategy==\nIgnite Poison deals heavy, unavoidable fire damage to every poisoned creature in sight.\n\n*With [[Mercury Vapours]], it becomes a strong, reliable, and reasonably MP efficient way to kill lone monsters. While it deals less damage/turn than something like [[Iron Shot]], Ignite Poison never misses, ignores AC, and saves MP.\n*With [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]], it's strong against whole groups. It's Mercury Vapours, but applied to everything on screen.\n*With [[Mephitic Cloud]], it will create flame clouds. While not as impressive as the above effects, it can deal decent damage after you've confused an enemy.\n*Particularly great with [[Eringya's Noxious Bog]], which inflicts high amounts of poison, even against those with poison resistance.\n\nThe biggest downside is that Ignite Poison relies on poison, making it worse against enemies with poison resistance. It is also somewhat poor with turn economy. Otherwise, Ignite Poison is a very strong spell, usable even in the late game.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*It doesn't matter where the poison clouds come from, they'll be turned into fire. You can turn a [[swamp drake]]'s or [[swamp dragon]]'s breath against it. You can ignite clouds from a [[scroll of poison]] - just make sure you have no immediate plans to move anywhere. Can also convert clouds from a low-power [[condenser vane]].\n*Ignite Poison doesn't count as a fiery beam; it doesn't create [[steam]] clouds on water, and it won't get rid of [[freezing vapour]]s.\n*[[Vehumet]] considers this spell destructive; [[Alchemist]]s looking for this spell should consider worshipping this god.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Ignite Poison was a level 3 Fire / Poison / Transmutation spell.\n*[[Venom Mage]]s started with this spell in [[0.25]] and [[0.26]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Salamander mystics had [[Localized Ignite Poison]] in their spellset.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Ignite Poison was a level 5 Fire / Transmutation spell, but it also affected monsters with [[venom]]-branded attacks, poisonous [[chunk|flesh]], and [[potions of poison]].\n*Prior to [[0.8]], Ignite Poison used to be an amazingly painful way to eliminate poison from one's own system.\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

Being a mass enchantment, it has a +50% bonus to the final spellpower, which makes this spell much more effective than enslavement. The effect is temporary, and can be shrugged off by [[magic resistance]].\n\n==History==\n*Control Undead was removed in [[0.21]].\n*Prior to [[0.10]], Control Undead was a level 5 Hexes-Necromancy spell."}

{"title":"Gender","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Gender","type":"raw","data":"{{version}}\n'''Gender''' is mostly irrelevant in Crawl, but does appear in a few minor cases.\n\n==Players==\nPlayer gender is entirely irrelevant, and the game does not even allow the player to specify one.  Should you wish your character to be explicitly gendered for (non-gameplay) role-playing purposes, choose a name that best expresses your intent. Note that this can be a problem on public servers, where all characters of a particular player have the same name.\n\n==Monsters==\nFor the most part, monsters are gender neutral, merely being referred to as 'it'. This includes humanoid monsters that would normally have an explicit gender, such as humans and elves. A few monsters are established as male or female, most notably [[unique]] monsters and those that are gendered in their source mythology such as  [[sphinx]]es, [[harpies]], [[mermaid]]s, [[siren]]s, and [[water nymph]]s.\n\nMonster gender is purely cosmetic; there are no gameplay effects of any sort.\n\n==Gods==\nBy convention, Crawl's gods are ungendered. Rather, every message and description about the gods is meticulously constructed to avoid using any personal pronouns, leaving their genders a matter of complete ambiguity. In fact, a message referring to an explicit gender for a god would be considered a bug by the developers.\n\nThat being said, in common conversation among players the gods are often given genders, if only for convenience. Most notably, [[Lugonu]] is invariably referred to as female. This dates back to her first introduction, where her working title was in fact Lucy. Other gods that are frequently referred to as female include [[Sif Muna]] and [[Elyvilon]]; most others are generally referred to as male by players."}

{"title":"Dispersal (brand)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dispersal_(brand)","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n:''This page describes the Dispersal [[brand]]. For the spell, see [[Dispersal]].''\n{{flavour|It will cause any target it hits to blink, with a tendency towards blinking further away from the one who threw it.}}\n\nThe '''dispersal''' [[brand]] is only found on [[dart]]s. It causes ammunition to force enemies that it damages to [[blink]] semi-randomly, usually away from the shooter. It does not check [[willpower]], but can miss, and fails against [[stationary]] monsters (e.g. [[statue]]s, [[oklob plant]]s).\n\nDarts of dispersal are single-use; they will always [[mulch]] after being thrown.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*You don't need to keep dispersal darts quivered to have easy access to them, and probably don't want to be using them for most fights anyway; just hit '''F''' and select them from your inventory to fire.\n*You cannot target yourself with this effect.\n*The dart needs to hit for the blink effect to occur, so investing a few levels into Throwing can be helpful.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], the dispersal brand could be found on [[boomerang]]s, not [[dart]]s. In addition, dispersal boomerangs needed to deal damage in order to cause the blink effect.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], mulched items did not deal extra damage.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], [[tomahawk]]s existed and could have this brand.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], arrows could be branded, including with dispersal.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], dispersal [[dart]]s also existed.\n\n{{brands}}\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

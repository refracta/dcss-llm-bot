Behind each door waits a monster of greatly varying strength, from [[giant newt]]s to [[ogre]]s, [[ettin]]s, and [[freezing wraith]]s. The last door opened reveals an exit behind the monster. All monsters are initially sleeping; spellcasting inside the trap will wake them, this also includes blinking and teleporting.\n{{flavour|Iron gates slam shut around you.\n\nYou now see doors in the walls!}}\n*'''Monster Chamber''': A portion of the wall adjacent to the pressure plate will disappear, revealing a room full of monsters which immediately attack you.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.16]], you could [[levitate]]/[[fly]] over them if you managed to find one before stepping on it.\n\n[[Category:Traps]]"}

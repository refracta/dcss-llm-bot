{"title":"Unique monster","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Unique_monster","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n'''Unique monsters''' are [[monster]]s that are generated at most once per game. They are usually much more powerful than normal monsters, but provide much greater [[experience]]. As such, they can be considered the \"boss monsters\" of ''Crawl'' (although not every unique is guaranteed to appear in every run, and by no means are you required to slay every unique you encounter).\n\nCertain uniques have alternate versions of themselves from earlier or later in their lives. You will only ever encounter one of these alternates in a given run.\n\n===Wandering Uniques===\n{{monsterlink|Agnes}} '''the Wanderer''' - A zippy [[spriggan (monster)|spriggan]] fighter who wields a branded [[lajatang]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Aizul}} '''the Neglectful Guardian''' - A disgraced [[guardian serpent]] who uses powerful poison magic and a nasty sleeping spell.\n\n{{monsterlink|Amaemon}} '''the Diabolical Poisoner''' - A demonspawn [[poison]] specialist capable of [[Concentrate Venom|intensifying the venom]] of his allies.\n\n{{monsterlink|Asterion}} '''the Fallen King''' - A bloodthirsty king who was turned into a [[minotaur]] and exiled.

Warning: Reading may be hazardous to you or your surroundings!<br>\n<br>\n“On leaf of palm, on sedge-wrought roll;<br>\nOn plastic clay and leathern scroll,<br>\nMan wrote his thoughts; the ages passed,<br>\nAnd lo! the Press was found at last!”<br>\n-John Greenleaf Whittier, _The Library_, st. 4.}}\n\nA '''Tome of Destruction''' is an unreliable evocable book which creates a wide variety of magical effects. When read, it opens to a page with randomly colored text or code, and then causes one of the following effects to occur:\n*(14%) A [[cloud]] of harmless smoke centered on you is created.\n*(4%) As above, but [[poison]].\n*(5%) As above, but [[cold]].\n*(7%) You are engulfed in a fiery explosion. The Tome of Destruction may be destroyed (20% chance).\n*(3%) A hostile [[small abomination]] is summoned.\n*67% You cast a random spell.\n\nIn the event a spell is cast, it is chosen by rolling 1d23 + 1d(Evocation/3):\n*2: [[Magic Dart]]\n*3: [[Throw Frost]]\n*4: [[Throw Flame]]\n*5: [[Mephitic Cloud]]\n*6: [[Polymorph Other]]\n*7: [[Dazzling Spray]]\n*8: [[Teleport Self]]\n*9: [[Sticky Flame]] (ranged)\n*10: [[Bolt of Inaccuracy]]\n*11: [[Bolt of Draining]]\n*12: [[Venom Bolt]]\n*13-18: [[Fireball]]\n*19-20: [[Lightning Bolt]]\n*21-23: [[Bolt of Cold]]\n*24-26: [[Bolt of Fire]]\n*27+: [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]]\n\n[[Spell power]] (used mainly to determine accuracy and damage) is equal to 5 + Evocations + 5d(Evocations), making it potentially much more powerful than [[rod]]s or [[wand]]s. The Tome of Destruction cannot be read while [[silence]]d, and the Blurry Vision [[mutation]] gives you a 25% chance of failure per rank. Unidentified, it displays as an \"ancient heavily glowing book.\"\n\n==Strategy==\nIf you are [[poison]] resistant, [[fire]]/[[cold]] resistant, can handle an abomination or two, and don't mind losing a few [[potion]]s, the Tome of Destruction can provide a decent ranged attack. Of course, if you meet all those conditions, you probably have a few ranged attacks already. The only characters who might find this useful are [[Xom]]'s playthings, as the mad god is very amused by any explosions or hostile abominations the book may accidentally summon.\n\n==History==\nThe Tome of Destruction was removed in [[0.16]].\n\nPrior to [[0.13]], the Tome of Destruction contained [[Cigotuvi's Degeneration]] in place of Dazzling Spray."}

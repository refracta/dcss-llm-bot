{"title":"Anguish","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Anguish","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Anguish''' is a Level 4 [[Hexes]]/[[Necromancy]] spell. Enemies within [[line of sight]] check [[willpower]], and enemies that do not resist are inflicted with the Anguish status. Affected enemies take HP damage equal to whatever their attacks deal, which cannot be resisted. This spell will never affect [[mindless]] monsters.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Anguished monsters don't have to hit you! They'll take damage, from, say, attacking your [[derived undead]] - while you remain safe and sound. Therefore, it works well with Necromancy allies, such as [[Death Channel]]. Enemies that strike allied spectral things will be killed by Anguish, turning into spectral things themselves and letting themselves be hit by more Anguished enemies, creating a snowball.\n*Anguish is useful for fragile characters threatened by low HP, high ranged damage enemies such as [[orc priest]]s, [[steam dragon]]s or [[centaur warrior]]s. Turning the very high damage output of these threats against themselves will swiftly take them down.\n*Like many other Necromancy spells, the effectiveness of Anguish depends massively on which enemies it is used against. The legions of low-to-medium Willpower guards in the [[Vaults]] are extremely easy to hex, but the unthinking horrors of the [[Slime Pits]] won't be impressed.\n*[[Scroll of vulnerability|Scrolls of vulnerability]], or the willpower-draining strikes of [[Haunt]]'s [[phantasmal warrior]]s pair well with this spell, allowing the hexing of notoriously lethal threats such as [[Mennas]].\n\n==History==\n*Anguish was added in [[0.28]]."}

{"title":"Burial acolyte","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Burial_acolyte","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Burial acolytes''' can be found in [[ossuary|ossuaries]] and rarely in [[the Crypt]]. They are often found alongside [[derived undead]] allies and will buff them with [[swiftness]] and [[might]]. They can also heal them for small amounts with [[Malign Offering]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Take them out before they can buff their undead friends. Use [[javelin]]s or other piercing/smite targeted abilities if they are behind said undead. \n*Undead players should be wary of letting them get into melee range, where they will become susceptible to [[Dispel Undead]].\n*[[Negative energy resistance]] can mitigate the damage of Malign Offering.\n*By the time you see them in Crypt, they are flimsy enemies compared to most of the other inhabitants.\n\n==History==\n*Burial Acolytes were added in [[0.31]]."}

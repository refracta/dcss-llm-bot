{"title":"Walking crystal tome","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Walking_crystal_tome","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Walking crystal tomes''' conjure living [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]]s. While they make melee attacks at half speed, they cast living spells at the normal rate. [[Walking tomes]] are most often seen in [[the Depths]] and the wizlab, [[Tukima's Studio]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n* If you don't have any sort of AOE, crystal tomes are impeccably scary in an open area, dealing up to 204 damage per turn. While the chance of actually taking 204 damage is minuscule (each crystal spear can miss, be [[SH|blocked]], or be reduced by [[AC]]), the damage output can still be very, very high.\n* Living spells work similarly to the player [[Foxfire]] spell. It creates a living spell entity, which must have a direct path to a hostile target. If you are in melee range with a tome in a corridor, most of the living spells will be unable to hit you. But unlike the foxfire spell, living spells can spawn behind the player (radius-2 of the walking tome), so a corridor is not foolproof.\n** You can attack a living spell, which will destroy it before it gets the chance to cast itself. Most types of AOE attacks can destroy a few spells while damaging the tome in the process.\n* [[Silence]] works on walking tomes, preventing them from creating living spells.\n\n==History==\n* Prior to [[0.31]], walking crystal tomes created 2-3 living spells per cast. This was a bug.\n* Prior to [[0.30]], walking tomes could use Conjure Living Spells when [[silence]]d.\n* Prior to [[0.29]], walking crystal tomes had 20 HD, so they dealt 3d40 damage per crystal spear.\n* Walking crystal tomes were added in [[0.28]]."}

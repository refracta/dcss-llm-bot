{"title":"Bolt of Fire","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bolt_of_Fire","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Fires a penetrating bolt of flames.}}\n\n'''Bolt of Fire''' is a monster-only spell capable of striking multiple targets along its path, dealing a considerable amount of [[fire]] damage. [[Fire#Fire_Resistance|Fire resistance]] reduces the damage dealt by this spell by 50% (rF+), 66% (rF++), or 80% (rF+++). The [[Fire Breath]] monster ability is very similar to this spell.\n\nLike other types of Fire Magic, bolts of fire that pass through [[water]] will create [[steam]], and are negated by [[freezing vapour|freezing clouds]].\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n{{Spell\n|name=Bolt of Fire\n|level=6\n|school1={{Conjurations}}\n|school2={{Fire Magic}}\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Fire]]\n*[[Book of the Dragon]]\n</div>\n|castingnoise=6\n|spellnoise=6\n}}\n{{AttackSpell\n|name=Bolt of Fire\n|formula = 6d(3+Power/9) [[fire]]\n|maxdmg = 6d25\n|maxsp = 200\n|range = 6\n|target = Bolt\n|tohit = 10+Power/25\n|special = N/A\n|hit_type = normal\n|hit_adder = 10\n|hit_num = 1\n|hit_denom = 25\n|dam_calculator = calcdice\n|dam_numdice = 6\n|dam_adder = 18\n|dam_num = 2\n|dam_denom = 3}}\n* Prior to [[0.26]], [[bolt spell]]s would decrease by 1 range for every target they hit.\n* Prior to [[0.25]], Bolt of Fire was a level 6 [[Conjurations]]/[[Fire Magic]] spell available to players.\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

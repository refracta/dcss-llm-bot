It inflicts the rage and suffering of those souls upon its wielder.}}\n[[File:Demon_blade_bloodbane.png]] '''''the +8 demon blade \"Bloodbane\"'''''<br>\n\n+8 [[demon blade]]\n\n[[Vorpal]] brand<br>\nAllows [[berserk]]<br>\nForces berserk (on 5% of attacks)<br>\n-50 [[stealth]]\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Bloodbane''' is an endgame quality weapon, but going berserk on random very risky. Being [[undead]] or having [[clarity]] will prevent berserkitis, allowing you to use a +8 vorpal demon blade with minimal penalty. Since Bloodbane doesn't [[curse]] itself on equip, other characters can switch to in situations where berserking is safe.\n\n==History==\n*Bloodbane was removed in [[0.25]]. Its berserking mechanics were added to the other unrandart demon blade, [[Leech]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], the forced berserk happened on 9% of attacks.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the stealth penalty was -20.\n*Truly a shapeshifting weapon, Bloodbane was originally a [[long sword]], then a [[katana]] (even after katanas were removed in [[0.9]]), and is now a demon blade.\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Long blades]]"}

It acts like a normal shield, but its stopping power depends solely on the power of the spell, not on the Shields skill. The disc is controlled by the caster's mind and thus will not conflict with the wielding of a two-handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Condensation Shield''' is a level 4 [[Ice Magic]] spell which creates a floating disc of icy vapour. This functions like shield without requiring a free hand, adding (3 + Spellpower*0.08) to your [[SH]] value (max: 19). This is unaffected by your [[Shields skill]]. You cannot cast it while wearing an actual shield, but it does stack with the SH-boosting effects of a [[Helm card]] and [[the Shining One]]'s Divine Shield ability. Condensation Shield's effects will end immediately if you are hit with [[Fire Magic]].\n\n==History==\nCondensation Shield was removed in [[0.18]].\n\nPrior to [[0.16]], Condensation Shield was dependent on Ice Magic skill and added  (8 + 0.6*[[Ice Magic]]) to your [[SH]] value (max: 24). If you character was vulnerable to cold (rC-), Condensation Shield would additionally deal 2-14 cold damage to you per turn. It was also unable to block any ranged attacks.\n\nPrior to [[0.12]], Condensation Shield was affected by the Shields skill and it allowed to train this skill. Its SH value was 3 + Ice Magic/4.\n\nPrior to [[0.5]], Condensation Shield's SH value was 2 + Ice Magic/6."}

{"title":"Awaken Forest","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Awaken_Forest","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Gives some limited motility to nearby trees, allowing them to sway their branches and shift their roots. Such enchanted trees will lash out at any adjacent enemy.}}\n'''Awaken Forest''' is a monster-only spell which angers all [[tree]]s in [[line of sight]]. When the caster's foes are adjacent to a tree, they'll take irresistible damage. The damage from Awaken Forest checks both [[AC]] and [[EV]]. The first cast of Awaken Forest takes priority - e.g. if a friendly dryad uses Awaken Forest, hostile monsters can't turn the trees against you.\n\nDamage from the trees depends on the monster's [[HD]]. When a [[spriggan druid]] casts Awaken Forest, its trees deal 11-22 damage (per 1.0 [[decaAut]]). The strength of a [[dryad]]'s Awaken Forest depends on the [[spellpower]] of the [[Summon Forest]] it was created from.\n\n{{crawlquote|'''Caster awakens forest in your LOS:''' \"The forest starts to sway and rumble!\"}}\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

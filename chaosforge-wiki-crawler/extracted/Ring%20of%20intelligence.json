{"title":"Ring of intelligence","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ring_of_intelligence","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{item\n |itemtype = Jewellery\n |name = Ring of intelligence\n |cost = ?\n}}\n{{flavour|A ring that increases the intelligence of its wearer.}}\n\nA '''+6 ring of intelligence''' affects the [[intelligence]] of the wearer.\n\n==Desirability==\nGood for spellcasters. While +6 intelligence will always be worse than a [[ring of wizardry]] for decreasing failure rate, intelligence also increases [[spell power]]. Having more power means that spells are more effective, which is always useful.\n\nCan also be used to prevent [[stat zero]] from having 0 intelligence. Other than that, it's useless for those who can't cast spells.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], you could find rings of intelligence with a -4 enchantment; such rings were always [[curse]]d.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], enchantment values ranged from 2 to 6 (positive and negative).\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

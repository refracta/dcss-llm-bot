Characters may wear one ring on each hand, paw, or tentacle; this usually limits you to two rings at a time, but [[octopode]]s may wear eight, and followers of [[Ru]] who have sacrificed their hand can only wear one ring. The [[artefact]] [[macabre finger necklace]] grants one additional ring slot. Despite their additional limbs, [[formicid]]s are still limited to two ring slots.\n\nRings have the advantage of only requiring 0.5 [[aut]]s to remove or put on (1 turn to swap entirely), letting characters change their resistances on the fly.\n\nThere are 18 different base types of rings; [[randart|random artefact]] rings each use one type of base ring when generated, but will have one or more additional properties.

{"title":"Halazid warlock","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Halazid_warlock","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|liches}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Halazid warlocks''' are powerful undead spellcasters who guard the deteriorating treasure vaults of the [[Desolation of Salt]]. Their [[Shadow Creatures]] will quickly swarm you with reinforcements, and their Bolt spells will punish any player lacking the proper resistances. Occasionally, they will sacrifice an ally, creating an explosion of up to 110 [[negative energy]] damage. In addition to Desolation, they can appear in [[Vestibule of Hell]], [[Tartarus]], and [[Borgnjor's Mausoleum]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Unlike the other swarms of enemies found in the Desolation of Salt, the Shadow Creatures from a halazid warlock are summoned, not permanent. [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]] is an excellent method of clearing away summons while dealing damage to their summoner (and anything else that happens to be nearby). If you lack that spell, do what you can to engage them close up quickly. There may not be any blind hallway corners to lure them around, but the cloud cover can be very useful for avoiding a long-range battle.\n*Due to the sheer damage potential of Ghostly Sacrifice, negative energy resistance is particularly important for fighting halazid warlocks. Use as much as you can; rN+++ will render you immune to their worst spells.\n*Don't forget that these units, unlike many things that appear in the same areas, are undead. Negative energy attacks will do nothing against them, but [[Dispel Undead]] quickly tears them to ribbons.\n\n==History==\n*These enemies were added to the [[Hell]]s in [[0.28]].\n*Halazid warlocks were added in [[0.19]]"}

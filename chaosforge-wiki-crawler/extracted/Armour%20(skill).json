{"title":"Armour (skill)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Armour_(skill)","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n\nThe '''Armour''' skill improves the effectiveness of your armour and reduces most of the penalties associated with the more cumbersome varieties of body [[armour]].\n\n{{skill aptitudes|Armour}}\n\n[[Felid]]s, [[Draconian]]s and [[Octopodes]] cannot train Armour due to their body restrictions.\n\n==Useful Info==\nEach level in Armour skill will:\n* Give bonus [[AC]], equal to ~4.5% Base AC per level. (\"Base AC\" is the combined AC of all your armour, excluding AC from their [[enchant]]ment)\n* Reduce body armour [[encumbrance]] by ~2.22% per level.\n: This reduces the penalties to [[evasion]], [[spellcasting]], and [[Ranged Weapons]]. Note that body armour also penalizes the [[Dodging]] skill directly; this penalty is ''not'' impacted by Armour skill. Armour skill won't reduce the [[stealth]] penalty, either.\n\n==Strategy==\nArmour skill provides a percent boost to AC and a percent reduction to encumbrance. Therefore, you don't need a specific amount of Armour skill to wear a given body armour. If you're playing a [[Fighter]], for instance, you'll want something heavy like [[plate armour]] - whether you have 3 Armour skill or 15 Armour skill.\n\n[[Strength]] has a big impact when determining what body armour you should wear, arguably more so than Armour skill. As an arbitrary example, say you have 10 strength and are considering [[swamp dragon scales]]. For this specific character, gaining +2 strength would be worth ''more'' than ~6.92 levels of Armour skill (the exact value also depends on [[Dodging]] skill).\n\nIn the [[Early Game Character Building|early game]], the impact of the Armour skill is relatively small, so you may want to train offensive skills first.\n\n{{skills}}\n\n[[Category:Skills]]"}

Against poorly armoured characters, they can deal huge amounts of damage very quickly, especially since they usually [[haste]] themselves at the start of a fight.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Spellcasters should kill executioners at range or escape as quickly as possible, as anything with low [[AC]] will be torn to shreds in melee. They can't fly, so hiding behind [[deep water]] or [[lava]] will thwart them.\n*Characters with high AC and [[GDR]] can engage them in melee with reasonable safety, as their individual attacks aren't too bad.\n*They are somewhat resistant to all elements, so use physical attacks, [[holy wrath]], or irresistible attacks against them.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], executioners could cast [[Pain]].\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

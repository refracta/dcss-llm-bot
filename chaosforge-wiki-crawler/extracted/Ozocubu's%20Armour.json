{"title":"Ozocubu's Armour","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ozocubu%27s_Armour","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Ozocubu's Armour''' is a level 3 [[Ice Magic]] spell which can greatly increase your [[AC]], provided the player remains stationary.  \n\n[[Ice Elementalist]]s begin with this spell in their libraries.\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe caster gains a boost of AC for a short duration. This spell is less effective for casters wearing heavier armour. The duration and size of this AC boost is shown below:\n\n{{crawlquote|'''Normal AC Boost''': 5 + (4*Spellpower/50) AC (max. 13)<br>\n'''Penalty''': - ([[encumbrance rating|Encumbrance]]/2) AC<br>\n'''Duration''': 20 + 2d(Spellpower) turns.}}\n\nFor the spell to remain in effect, you must remain in place. You can still move, but doing so ends the effect. Even \"involuntary\" movement (e.g. being [[teleport]]ed or [[trample]]d) breaks the armour. In addition, taking fire damage from beams greatly reduces the armour's duration.\n\n==Strategy==\nOzocubu's Armour provides a very useful AC boost to any character who wears light armour and can manage the (minimal) skill investment. Even at its lowest spellpower, it's still on par with a [[ring of protection]]. [[Transmuter]]s and [[species]] with no body armour slot ([[Felid]]s, [[Octopode]]s, and [[Draconian]]s) appreciate this spell more, while it lets other species \"get away\" with lighter pieces of armour.\n\n[[Frozen Ramparts]] is a natural companion; it too is a level 3 Ice Magic spell that breaks when you move.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], this spell wouldn't work with [[Statue Form (spell)|Statue Form]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], certain involuntary movements, such as [[Blink]], would not break the armour. Also, the spell would melt when used over [[lava]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Ozocubu's Armour was an Ice/[[Charms]] spell, and did not function entirely with heavy armour ([[encumbrance rating]] > 5), instead of an encumbrance being a penalty.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], Ozocubu's Armour did not expire immediately upon movement and had a speed penalty instead.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Ozocubu's Armour did not come with a speed penalty.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the effects of this spell were boosted in Ice Form and used the formula was 6 + 7 * (Spellpower/50) AC. (Max 20)\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the bonus AC calculation was link to your Ice Magic skill, not your spellpower:\n**'''Normal AC Boost''': 4 + (Ice Magic/3)\n**'''Ice Form AC Boost''': 5 + (Ice Magic * (7/12))\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the encumbrance rating limit for this spell was 6, allowing it to work with [[mottled dragon armour]]."}

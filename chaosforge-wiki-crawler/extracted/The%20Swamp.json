Four levels deep, it is home to all manner of small water creatures and swamp insects, as well as [[hydra]]s, [[dragon]]s, and [[worm]]s.\n\nThe Swamp's entrance is located between [[Lair]]:2 and Lair:3. If you find the Swamp, you will not find [[the Shoals]] in your current game. \n\n==Useful Info==\nEach floor is large and open, with [[tree]]s and plants providing the only cover most of the time. You'll find small islands of land and the occasional ruin or vault amid large masses of [[shallow water]]. [[Cloud]]s of thin mist occasionally generate, which do nothing except prevent other clouds from occupying its tile.\n\nYou can set trees on fire to create passages. The resulting forest fire will create immense amounts of steam and may go out of control, however!\n\nThe Swamp features more [[wand]]s than the Shoals; both [[eleionoma]]e and [[fenstrider witch]]es can drop wands on death. You may want to train some [[Evocations]] if you see Swamp generate in your game.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Due to [[Mephitic Cloud]]-breathing [[swamp drake]]s, [[Poisonous cloud]]-breathing [[Swamp dragon]]s, and the general watery nature of the Swamp, it's a bad idea to attempt this branch without [[poison resistance]] or a source of [[cloud immunity]].  You could also rely on a large supply of [[potions of curing]] or [[Elyvilon]]'s Purification ability to overcome confusion and poisoning, but these will end up costly if used this much.\n**Players lacking poison resistance can acquire it in the Swamp itself. If you can find, kill a [[swamp dragon]] for a chance to get [[swamp dragon scales]], which have the rPois intrinsic.\n*Two other resistances may prove helpful: [[Acid#Corrosion|rCorr]] for [[Goliath frog]]s, and [[willpower]] for [[Fenstrider witch]]es. You might be fine with careful play, but may regret it when you are [[paralyzed]] and heavily corroded while [[hydra]]s gnaw all over you.\n*Consider having some means of [[flying]]; without it, the shallow water can fatally slow you down if you need to retreat. Many of the monsters encountered in the Swamp receive speed boosts in the water.\n*Edged weapon users may also need some alternative means of killing hydras. See the [[hydra]] article for an in-depth list of methods.\n\n==Monsters==\n===Common monsters===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Alligator}} || {{monsterlink|Swamp worm}} || {{monsterlink|Tyrant leech}} || {{monsterlink|Goliath frog}} || {{monsterlink|Eleionoma}}  \n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Swamp drake}} || {{monsterlink|Hydra}} || {{monsterlink|Swamp dragon}} || {{monsterlink|Bloated husk}} || {{monsterlink|Will-o-the-wisp}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Vampire mosquito}} || {{monsterlink|Bunyip}} || {{monsterlink|Bog body}} || {{monsterlink|Ghost crab}} || {{monsterlink|Hornet}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Spriggan rider}} || {{monsterlink|Spriggan druid}} \n|}\n\n===Dangerous monsters===\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Thorn hunter}}\n| {{monsterlink|Shambling mangrove}}\n| {{monsterlink|Fenstrider witch}}\n| {{monsterlink|Tentacled monstrosity}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Spriggan air mage}}\n| {{monsterlink|Spriggan berserker}}\n| {{monsterlink|Ghoul}}\n| {{monsterlink|Death drake}}\n|}\n\n===Uniques===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Aizul}}\n| {{monsterlink|Bai Suzhen}}\n| {{monsterlink|Donald}}\n| {{monsterlink|Frances}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Jorgrun}}\n| {{monsterlink|Josephine}}\n| {{monsterlink|Kirke}}\n| {{monsterlink|Mlioglotl}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Louise}}\n| {{monsterlink|Mara}}\n| {{monsterlink|Nikola}}\n| {{monsterlink|Roxanne}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|The Lernaean hydra}}\n|}\n\n*Depending on which ending you get, you might also come upon undead variants of the usual Swamp inhabitants or a number of other dangerous monsters. Tread carefully on the last floor!\n\n==Swamp:4 vaults==\nThe decaying rune of Zot is in a monster-filled [[vault]] on Swamp:4. While it's always a good idea to clear the rest of the floor first, the exact nature and difficulty of this vault varies each game.\n\n*'''Swamp:''' The classic \"swamp\" vault is an ovoid vault heavily defended by hydras, swamp dragons and swamp drakes. While otherwise unremarkable, the sheer number of foes you'll face upon reaching the vault can easily prove overwhelming. Keep the path back to the [[stairs]] clear, just in case.\n\n*'''Swamp alternative:''' \"swamp_alternative\" bisects the original \"swamp\" vault with a [[lava]] pool, and adds a few fiery monsters ([[lindwurm]]s, [[fire dragon]]s) to the mix.\n\n*'''Old school:''' This vault resembles the pre-[[0.5]] Swamp layout - it's a large, haphazard room which contains the usual mix of swamp dragons, drakes, and hydras. What sets this vault apart is [[the Lernaean hydra]] hiding in one of its niches.\n\n*'''Fiery:''' \"swamp_fiery\" is full of [[dragon]]s and other fiery monsters. Flame [[cloud]]s occur here naturally. [[Fire resistance]] obviously helps.\n\n*'''Icy:''' \"swamp_icy\" is full of [[simulacrum|simulacra]] and other frozen monsters ([[freezing wraith]]s, [[azure jelly]]); [[hydra]] simulacra can really pack a punch. Freezing clouds block the entrance this time.\n\n*'''Pestilence:''' \"swamp_pestilence\" is guarded by [[zombie]]s, [[spectral thing]]s, and other undead. This time, [[miasma]] clouds block the way.\n\n*'''Vile:''' \"swamp_vile\" is an abandoned, flooded temple, occupied by demons and beasts. It contains demonic monsters, including [[large abomination]]s, [[green death]]s, [[death ooze]]s, [[hell beast]]s or even a [[tentacled monstrosity]].\n\n*'''Castle:''' \"grunt_swamp_rune_castle\" is a square-shaped vault with inner 4 rooms - one will contain the Lernaean hydra.\n\n*'''Basic:''' \"swamp_basic_johnstein\" has a small chamber leading to 3 separate inlets. Has a small chance of containing the Lernaean hydra.\n\n*'''Death and Undeath:''' A hallway leading to two separate rooms. One contains life, including [[thorn hunter]]s and [[shambling mangrove]]s. The other features death, including two [[vampire knight]]s and a [[zombie|zombified]] Lernaean hydra.\n\n*'''Witches Coven:''' A pentagram circumscribed into a circle. Features [[fenstrider witch]]es, other wizardly creatures, and a few demons (including [[blizzard demon]]s and [[green death]]s).\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], two [[vampire knight]]s in one Swamp:4 rune vault will be replaced with [[ghoul]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the Swamp was found between Lair:2 and Lair:4.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the Swamp wasn't [[noise|loud]].\n*In [[0.26]], new monsters were introduced: [[Eleionoma]], [[Bunyip]], [[Goliath frog]], [[Will-o-the-wisp]], [[Bloated husk]], and [[Fenstrider witch]], which all made the branch much more dangerous. Deep water was mostly removed from the branch. Prior to this version, the Swamp was often considered to be the easiest lair branch.\n*In [[0.25]] came a new Swamp ending themed as a conflict between Yred and Fedhas that includes an undead version of the Lernaean Hydra.\n*During its history, the Swamp has received countless changes to the list of monsters inhabiting it. Many unthreatening monsters have been pruned.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the Swamp was five levels deep.\n*In [[0.11]], the Swamp was given an improved layout, with smaller and more compact levels, and more trees. It is also less misty than before.\n\n{{branches}}\n[[Category:Crystal Ball Articles]]"}

It does not affect [[invisible]] monsters if you can't [[see invisible]], nor does it affect the player.\n\nLike [[Shatter]], the number of dice 'N' is dependent on the monster hurt:\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" style=\"width:28em;border-bottom:thin solid black;\"|Target\n!align=\"right\" style=\"width:3em;border-bottom:thin solid black;padding-left:1em;\"|N\n|-\n|Monsters made from metal, stone or crystal\n|align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n|[[Insubstantial]] monsters\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|-\n|[[Petrify]]ing/Petrified (reduced later by petrification reduction)\n|align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n|Monsters made from ice or bone\n|align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n|Slimy monsters\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|-\n|[[Flying]] monsters\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|-\n|All other monsters\n|align=\"right\" | 3\n|}\n\nNote that N is calculated for each individual monster, so targeting a metallic monster won't make the explosion cause more damage to flying monsters nearby. \n\nAgainst a regular non-flying monster, you can expect an average of <code>7.5 + (75% * wpn_dmg)</code> explosion damage, but unlike [[brand]]s, it is affected by [[AC]].\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Devastator'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|1233}}</ref> is basically a well-enchanted [[club]] with a \"brand\" that deals extra splash damage. It's especially useful against swarms of fragile enemies, like [[killer bee]]s, but it's still great against lone enemies in the early- and mid-game. Later on, you'll want to switch to an [[eveningstar]] or [[demon whip]] - these deal more damage against single targets.\n\nThis artefact is more likely to spawn in the early game, where it is more likely to be useful.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], Devastator creates [[noise]] again, though is much quieter.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Devastator was not explicitly likely to spawn in the early-game.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Devastator's explosions were very loud instead of being completely silent.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Devastator had a +4, +8 enchantment level.\n*Devastator was added in [[0.10]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

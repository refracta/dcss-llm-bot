{"title":"Infusion (ego)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Infusion_(ego)","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For the removed spell this ego is based off, see [[Infusion (spell)]].''\n{{flavour|It empowers each of its wearer's blows with a small part of their magic.}}\n\n'''Infusion''' is an [[ego]] found only on [[gloves]]. When the wearer strikes a foe in melee, they get up to a +4 damage bonus but consume 1 [[MP]] in the process.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|player.cc|3563}}</ref> The damage bonus from infusion is calculated in the same way as the bonus from [[slaying]], but unlike slaying it does not affect [[auxiliary attacks]], ranged attacks, or accuracy.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|attack.cc|1056}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|attack.cc|167}}</ref> Characters with no MP left simply won't get the slaying bonus.\n\n[[Djinn]] do not have MP; instead, they spend 1 HP with each attack.\n\n==Strategy==\n*For purely martial characters with zero use for magic points, these gloves are purely beneficial. However, many [[gods]] require MP for their abilities -- make sure you don't run out!\n*As it requires a completely voluntary act to trigger, gloves of infusion can be acceptable even for pure spellcasters to wear, so long as they are careful not to accidentally strike anything in melee when they didn't mean to. You can [[inscription|inscribe]] your held item with <code>!a</code> to force a prompt when attacking.\n*Note that only melee attacks will trigger the infusion ego. Ranged attacks and wands remain MP-free ways of killing foes while wearing gloves of infusion.\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Mad Mage's Maulers]] - [[unrand]] gloves which provide a supercharged version of this ego.\n* [[Weapon damage]] calculations.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==History==\n*The Infusion ego was added in [[0.28]].\n\n[[Category:Egos]]"}

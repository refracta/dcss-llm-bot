You are highly evasive and are resistant to fire, cold, electricity and acid, and immune to poison, and negative energy.\n\nAny equipped weapons, armour and jewellery are melded, and you are unable to cast spells. The effectiveness of your melee attacks while in this form is based on experience level instead of on Unarmed Combat skill.}}\n'''Wisp Form''' is a [[bad form]] that can be forced on the player character when they are [[polymorph]]ed. It has the following characteristics:\n\n===Pros===\n*<code>5 + 0.5Ã—XL</code> AC\n*[[Unarmed Combat]] base damage set to 5 and uses XL instead of [[Unarmed Combat]] skill\n*rF++\n*rC++\n*rElec\n*rPois\n*Non-living holiness ([[Torment]] immunity)\n*rN+++\n*rCorr\n*[[Insubstantial]] (immune to [[constriction]], [[petrification]], [[Sticky Flame]], and [[Leda's Liquefaction]]; take less damage from [[Shatter]])\n*Tiny [[size]], increasing EV\n*[[Unbreathing]]\n*Permanent [[flight]]\n\n===Cons===\n*You can't use weapons, armour, or jewellery.\n*You can't cast spells.\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile somewhat dubious, Wisp Form may be useful in the [[Tomb]]. Its full suite of resistances (with mobility) is incredibly useful for stealing the rune and getting out. Using a [[scroll of teleportation]] can get you closer. A [[potion of haste]] and [[potion of invisibility|invisibility]] and a few [[scrolls of blinking]] should increase your chances of stealing the rune and getting back upstairs safely. Of course, this comes at the risk of the form running out. A [[wand of polymorph]] on the stairs of Tomb:2 can be used until you become a wisp.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

Also, the form granted extra speed (0.8 movement delay, i.e. [[Felid]] speed).\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the form had [[rot]] resistance.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], wisp form, along with most other [[bad form]]s, disallowed the use of [[wand]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], players in the wisp form had a 10% chance to move as if confused. Although, you wouldn't bump into walls or into allies.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], wisp form allowed the player to [[blink]] as an ability, but prevented you from reading [[scroll]]s. It also granted perfect [[conservation]], protecting your consumables from [[item destruction]].\n*Wisp Form was added in [[0.12]].\n[[Category:Status effects]]\n{{Forms}}"}

They will also explode if destroyed. If no hostile monsters are in sight, ball lightings generally disperse away from the player.\n\nEach ball lightning deals <code>3d(5 * pow/24 - 2.5)</code> electricity damage (min. 3d6),<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|mon-explode.cc|77}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-summoning.cc|803}}</ref> in a 2 or 3 tile radius (same chance). As BEAM_ELEC damage, the explosions ignore 1/2 of the target's [[AC]].\n\nLike [[Foxfire]] and player-created [[cloud]]s, ball lightnings dissipate when out of the player's [[LOS]]. However, the explosions themselves can hit monsters outside LOS.\n\n==Strategy==\nConjure Ball Lightning is an AOE spell that is strong in open areas. However, there's always the risk of the explosions hitting you.\n\n[[Electricity resistance]] is highly recommended unless you want [[YASD]]. If you lack a reliable source of rElec ([[potions of resistance]] will work in a pinch, but not for general, repeated use), strongly consider choosing a different spell. Even with resistance, you can take upwards of 30 damage on a high roll.\n\nIf you decide to use CBL anyways, cast it only in where there is no other alternative and use these precautions: your target should be at the furthest possible range, with no nearby enemies (or plants); the enemy should ideally not be able to [[blink]], [[summon]], or use ranged attacks or spells (any of which might prematurely set off the ball lightnings); the player should move backwards right after casting, to get out of range; should the target be destroyed, the player should remain at a safe distance until all ball lightnings have detonated.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Ball lightning only has 1-2 HP, so you can intentionally detonate one with virtually any non-elemental attack. [[Stone]]s and [[Magic Dart]]s work well.\n*Ball lightnings cannot see invisible. Casting the spell against an invisible enemy will simply cause your summons to wander aimlessly and ineffectively. If your target is, or has turned, invisible, you can always fire a projectile at a ball lightning to trigger detonation.\n*Only [[:Category:Electricity resistance|very few, specific creatures]] have electricity resistance, making this a great all-around spell for area attacks on large numbers of creatures.\n\n==Monster Version==\nThe monster version functions similarly to the player version, though monster-created ball lightnings do not dissipate when out of the monster's LOS. \n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n== History ==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], ball lightnings would home onto you if there were no valid targets.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the spell could conjure 2-5 instances of ball lightning, formula <code>1 + pow / 100 + 1d(pow / 50 + 1)</code> (max. 5, rounded down), but damage was always 3d20. Also, random [[pandemonium lord]]s couldn't cast this spell.\n*In [[0.25]], ball lightning AI was changed to work like [[Foxfire]]. Previously, ball lightnings would home onto targets it didn't see, so it was easier to hit things from outside [[LOS]]. It could also home onto [[plant]]s and other harmless \"enemies\".\n*Prior to [[0.14]], CBL was a level 7 spell, and all ball lightnings were permanently [[confused]].\n*Prior to [[0.10]], ball lightnings had no duration after which they would explode.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

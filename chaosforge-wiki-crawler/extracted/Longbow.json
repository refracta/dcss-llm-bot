They fire faster than [[arbalest]]s.\n\n==Strategy==\nLongbows are one of the stronger weapons for a ranged weapons user. At around 16 skill (or higher), a longbow will outdamage an [[arbalest]] against a 0 AC target. An arbalest can still be better if it has higher enchantment, but the base delay introduces [[Heavy#Risks of >1.0 attack delay|risks in combat]].\n\nOf course, a [[triple crossbow]] is more powerful, but it's rarer and requires more skill to reach mindelay.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Longbow 1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Longbow 2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Longbow 3.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Piercer]]''' || [[File:Longbow piercer.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Storm bow]]''' || [[File:Longbow storm bow.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Zephyr]]''' || [[File:Bow of krishna sharnga.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], longbows had 13 damage and 16 base delay. Also, it was significantly more likely to find a longbow in the early-mid game (as [[centaur warrior]]s could have them.)\n*Prior to [[0.30]], longbows had 12 damage, 17 base delay, and a mindelay of 6.\n*In [[0.29]], longbows had their damage and mindelay reduced (previously 15 damage, 7 mindelay) . They were affected by the [[Ranged Weapons#History|ranged weapons rework]] that applied to all launchers, including the removal of the dedicated [[Bows (skill)|bows skill]] and [[arrow]] requirement.\n*Longbows were introduced in [[0.15]].\n\n{{weapons}}\n\n[[Category:Bows]]"}

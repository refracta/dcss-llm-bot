It imbues the bolts it fires with the raw power of its namesake. Thankfully, the blasts this weapon produces never harm the one firing.}}\n[[File:Urand damnation.png]] '''''the +6 arbalest \"Damnation\"'''''\n\n+6 [[arbalest]]\n\nCauses fired [[bolt]]s to explode with [[damnation]] (2d14<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-func.h|890}}</ref>) when striking a target<br>\n[[Evil]]\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Damnation'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|543}}</ref> is a decently enchanted arbalest with an amazing \"[[brand]]\". A 100% chance for 2d14 damage is over ×4 stronger than [[electrocution]], it can hit multiple enemies in its 3×3 blast, and [[:Category:Damnation resistance|damnation resistance]] is exceedingly rare. Note that when used against adjacent targets, the blast will not harm you. The explosions Damnation generates are significantly louder than normal crossbow shots, so expect to wake up nearby foes. \n\nAs a primary weapon, Damnation is viable for the entirety of a 3-rune game (at least). A [[triple crossbow]] may be stronger, but it requires much more skill to get to mindelay.\n\n[[Dimensional Bullseye]] doesn't work with this launcher.\n\nThis artefact can be found in many [[Gehenna]]:7 vaults, but may also be generated randomly.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], the unrand could harm the shooter when shooting at an adjacent target.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Damnation dealt 3d14 damnation damage, but always [[mulch]]ed [[bolt]]s that it fired, in addition to the other [[ranged weapons#history|ranged weapon changes]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Damnation's bolts would explode wherever they landed, not requiring a hit target. By aiming at the ground with '''f.''' instead of '''ff''', users could set off explosions near evasive enemies, or fire at adjacent enemies without worrying about recoil damage.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Damnation gave rF++, rC-, and [[MR]]+.\n*In [[0.18]], both the crossbow and its damage type were renamed to Damnation from Hellfire. Previously, hellfire damage was increased against fire vulnerability, but ignored fire resistance.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Hellfire was a +6, +9 [[crossbow (item)|crossbow]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], it had the [[flame]] brand.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Crossbows]]"}

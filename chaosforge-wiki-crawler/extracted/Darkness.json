Under normal circumstances, this reduces LOS by two tiles. The effect stacks with the [[Robe of Night]] and the [[demonspawn]] [[Demonspawn_mutations#Nightstalker|nightstalker]] mutation. Higher spell power increases the effect's duration.<ref>{{source ref|0.25.0|spl-other.cc|462}}</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\n*Darkness is an excellent spell for situations where you don't want to be seen, obviously. It makes it easier to move into range for [[stabbing]], helps when fleeing from monsters at the edge of your LOS, forces ranged enemies to move closer to you, and generally reduces the amount of attention you attract simply by keeping you out of sight.\n\n==History==\n*Darkness was removed in [[0.26]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Darkness was a level 7 spell.\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

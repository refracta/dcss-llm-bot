{"title":"Shard shrike","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shard_shrike","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Shard shrikes''' are durable, extremely aggressive animals which can be found either individually or in packs. These birds swarm their prey, slashing and impaling them with [[cold]] damage attacks. They are thankfully rare, only occurring in the depths of [[Cocytus]], or very rarely inside hard [[Ice cave]]s.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*As they're found in Cocytus, you'll likely have plenty of cold resistance by the time you encounter them. Don't let that fool you into thinking them harmless, however; they have absurdly high speed, and their constant Throw Icicle spells deal partially-irresistible damage and aren't stopped by [[Silence]]. A large group of shrikes can hit you with plenty of these in a fairly short amount of time.\n*Unlike most enemies in Cocytus, shard shrikes are natural, living creatures, so [[holy]] damage will barely make a dent in them.\n*They have high [[HD]], but only moderate [[willpower]]. Keep that in mind before trying to inflict them with [[status effect]]s.\n*Shard shrikes cannot [[see invisible]], but unfortunately, the freezing cold of Cocytus means you can't use a [[potion]] to gain the effect. A [[scarf]] or other item with the [[invisibility (ego)|ego]] can help give you an edge here -- mind the [[drain]]ing, though.\n*[[Repel Missiles#Player sources|Repel Missiles]] will certainly help keep you alive, if you have access to it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], shard shrikes could [[see invisible]].\n*Shard shrikes were added in [[0.16]]."}

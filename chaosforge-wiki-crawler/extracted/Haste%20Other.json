{"title":"Haste Other","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Haste_Other","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{Flavour|Speeds the actions of a nearby ally.}}\n\n'''Haste Other''' is a monster-only spell which gives the [[Haste]] status to a creature other than the caster. This makes it a pure support spell, and one whose threat level is entirely dependent on how dangerous the nearby monsters are. \n\nMonsters can only use this spell on other monsters of the same [[type|genus]], e.g. [[deep troll shaman]]s can only haste trolls. Note that salamanders are considered part of the \"naga\" genus, so [[salamander mystic]]s can target both salamanders and nagas.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Might Other]]\n*[[Berserk Other]]\n\n==History==\n*Haste Other was added in [[0.6]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

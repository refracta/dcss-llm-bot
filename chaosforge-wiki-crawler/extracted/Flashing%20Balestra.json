It deals damage, similar to [[Iron Shot]], and spawns a short-lived [[dancing weapon]] near its target. The dancing weapon spawns [[might]]ed. This spell is usable only from range, so you won't get hit by it while standing next to the caster.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|this spell will be added to the game.}}\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

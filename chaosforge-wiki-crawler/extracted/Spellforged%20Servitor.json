For the summoned construct, see [[Spellforged servitor (monster)]].''\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Spellforged Servitor''' is a level 7 [[Conjurations]]/[[Summonings]] spell which calls a [[spellforged servitor (monster)|spellforged servitor]] into existence. This is a fairly durable, omni-resistant construct which knows one destructive spell from your own list of known spells. \n\n==Useful Info==\nOne spellforged servitor is summoned.\n\nIt will know the first among the following spells that you have memorized and can cast with a failure rate less than 20%:<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|spl-summoning.cc|1553}}</ref> \n*[[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]]\n*[[Orb of Destruction]]\n*[[Bombard]]\n*[[Plasma Beam]]\n*[[Fireball]]\n*[[Arcjolt]]\n*[[Stone Arrow]]\n*[[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]]\n*[[Airstrike]]\n*[[Irradiate]]\n*[[Conjure Ball Lightning]]\n*[[Freezing Cloud]]\n*[[Mephitic Cloud]]\nThe current spell choice is displayed in the full spell description for Spellforged Servitor. \n\n[[Spell power]] determines how strong the spellforged servitor's spells are. It does not influence servitor HP or its duration.\n*Servitors have a [[hit dice]] of <code>7 + pow/14</code>; this determines the strength of a servitor's spells.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-summoning.cc|1605}}</ref>\n*Servitors have HP equal to <code>60 + 7d5</code> (67 - 95).\n*Duration of the summons is around 36 turns, it does not depend on the spell power.\n\nThere is a summon limit of 1; casting the spell again will cause the old summon to very quickly time out.\n\nUnlike most other summons, spellforged servitors won't vanish or become hostile if you attack them.\n\n==Strategy==\nAn excellent, MP-efficient spell for an otherwise [[Conjurations]]-focused caster. Spellforged Servitor offers all the benefits of a summon (MP efficiency, blocks enemy line of fire, takes hits for you), and it's a great spell for combat too. It can cast [[Iron Shot]] or [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] multiple times for only 7 MP. Since its offenses are based on the spells you know, a summoner won't benefit ''as'' much from this spell. However, it's easy to pick up a spell like [[Stone Arrow]], which gives a 3d20 or so attack from the get go. Plus, summoners can always appreciate an extra ally.\n\nAs a summon, servitors have moderate durability and great resistances. A lucky servitor with a solid spell can beat [[orbs of fire]] in a straight fight (while blocking [[malmutate]]s).\n\nA notable downside is that you can get hit by the servitor. If a monster is between you and the servitor, it can miss the monster and end up hitting you.\n\n===Spells===\nSpells that are good with Spellforged Servitor:\n*[[Earth Magic]]: Bombard and LCS both work well, simple and strong spells. Even [[Stone Arrow]] is a good option, since monsters will cast Stone Arrow ''much'' stronger than you can.\n*[[Plasma Beam]]: Like Earth Magic, with better range, though it can be resisted.\n\nSpells that you should avoid with Spellforged Servitor:\n*[[Conjure Ball Lightning]]: It's even more dangerous in a servitor's hands than in yours.\n*[[Orb of Destruction]]: Monster AI isn't the best at firing OODs; it often misses. Worst case scenario, orbs can end up hitting you.\n\nThe servitor's stats depends on your abilities at time of cast. You can use [[wizardry]] or [[intelligence]] to decrease a spell's failure rate, then swap back after summoning.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Servitors cast slowly. Every ~2 turns, it has a 75% chance to cast a spell (if it doesn't have to move to get in range). Don't rely on the servitor casting a spell to survive a sketchy situation.\n*Your servitor won't disappear or become hostile you if you harm it. So feel free to sling a Fireball or Fire Storm right on top of your servitor. At worst, you kill it.\n*Servitors can't see [[invisible]]. A friendly servitor can hit you if you're invisible and there's a monster in the path. It won't work against invisible monsters.\n\n==Monster Version==\nSpellforged Servitors summoned by monsters will know all of the caster's destructive spells.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nFrederick's spellforged servitor will know [[Plasma Beam]] and [[Bombard]].\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|players will be able to choose which spell the servitor casts via the Imbue Servitor ability. The ability takes 5 turns and dismisses any existing servitors. By default, the servitor will choose a spell the same way it does in 0.31. Also, if the player has at least 4* piety with [[Vehumet]], the servitor will benefit from the range increase.}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], servitors could cast spells that had a 50% failure rate or lower. Also, they couldn't cast [[Irradiate]], but could cast [[Sticky Flame]]. In addition, they had 2 more HD.\n*Prior to around [[0.29]],  allies weren't smart enough to stop their attacks before they'd hit you. So in this kind of position:\n .....\n .@y9.\n .....\n:The servitor could miss monster 'y' with a projectile, hitting you in the process.\n*In [[0.27]], many low level and (now) monster-only spells were pruned from the eligible spell list, in order to accommodate [[Djinn]].\n*Prior to [[0.25]], your servitor gained a random selection of up to 5 of your destructive spells.\n*Spellforged Servitor was added in [[0.14]].\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

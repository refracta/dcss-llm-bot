While it does not have crushing jaws, nor the strength to put on massive bursts of speed, it is more limber than the adult form, and its milk-tooth is still very sharp.\n----\n“Alligators commit errors of diet.”<br>\n-Bennet Bowler, M.D., _Contributions to the Natural History of the<br>\nAlligator, (Crocodilus Mississipiensis), with a Microscopic Addendum_,<br>\np. 17. 1846.}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Baby alligators''' are small cold-blooded pests that lurk underwater before rushing you with surprising speed, much like a full grown [[alligator]] would. Although they can only deal moderate damage, they may appear in packs, often in the company of a mature alligator. Baby alligators can be found in [[the Swamp]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*All alligators move frighteningly fast when travelling through water, and the Swamp provides few opportunities for limiting the number of units you face at once. If you're not a heavily armoured melee fighter, don't be afraid to [[teleport]] or [[blink]] to safety if you see a pack closing in on you.\n\n==History==\nBaby alligators were removed in [[0.17]]."}

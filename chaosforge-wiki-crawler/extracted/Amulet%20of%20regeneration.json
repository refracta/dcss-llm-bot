In order to function, it must first attune itself to the wearer's body at full health.}}\n\nAn '''amulet of regeneration''' increases its wearer's [[regeneration rate]] by +0.8 HP/turn, greatly hastening the HP recovery rate of your character. This benefit becomes less pronounced as your max HP rises, but its effect is always substantial.\n\nIncreased regeneration does not begin until after your HP has been at maximum while wearing the amulet, so there's no point in swapping one on after a battle to recover faster. -Regen from [[Inhibited Regeneration]] prevents this amulet from working.\n\n==Desirability==\nAn amulet of regeneration is welcome. For a good portion of the game, this amulet's regen is a noticeable help in combat. In addition, reducing your recovery time lowers your [[piety]] decay, and makes it less likely for wandering enemies to find you while you rest. You may prefer an amulet that's more suited towards combat, such as an [[amulet of reflection]] or [[amulet of faith|faith]], but this isn't a bad choice.\n\nRegeneration is welcome for players looking to [[speedrun|minimize turn count]]. If you're using magic, though, an [[amulet of magic regeneration]] is usually a better choice for this goal.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the regeneration bonus was +1 HP/turn.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the regeneration bonus was +0.4 HP/turn.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], the amulet of regeneration began working immediately, and also increased the wearer's metabolism.\n*The amulet of regeneration was added in [[0.16]], replacing the [[ring of regeneration]].\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

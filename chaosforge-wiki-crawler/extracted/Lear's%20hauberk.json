It includes a chainmail coif, chausses and maille gauntlets.}}\n[[File:Lear's_hauberk.png]] '''''the +18 Lear's hauberk'''''\n\n+18 [[chain mail]]\n\nFills your body, head, gloves, and feet armour slots\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Lear's hauberk'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|897}}</ref> is an unusual piece of equipment, a heavily enchanted [[chain mail]] that fills 4 equipment slots. To wear it, you must be able to wear chain mail, [[hat]]s, [[boots]], and [[gloves]]. Therefore, many species ([[Troll]]s, [[Ogre]]s, [[Spriggan]]s, [[Armataur]]s, [[Djinn]], [[Formicid]]s, [[Naga]]s, and [[Tengu]]) are unable to wear it, [[Merfolk]] will meld it when in/above [[water]]. and certain level 3 [[mutation]]s will block it.\n\nIn practice, Lear's hauberk is less spectacular than it seems. If you already have a +2 [[helmet]], [[gloves]], and [[boots]], Lear's hauberk is equivalent to a +9 chain mail. However, a +9 chain mail is still a decent choice for melee brutes, and the hauberk has a few other advantages:\n*You'll often find it before getting any sort of headgear/gloves/boots. Getting a +18 chain mail is a ''massive'' boost to defense, especially in the early game.\n*Lear's hauberk saves [[scrolls of enchant armour]], which can be used on a [[shield]] or other pieces of equipment. A +9 [[plate armour]] might give more AC than the hauberk, but having a +9 chain mail and +8 [[tower shield]] is much better for defense.\n\nThe main downside is that the hauberk takes up 3 extra equipment slots; wearing it means losing any [[ego]]s or [[artefact]] properties from the head, hand, and foot slots. As you find good equipment in those slots, you may value the resistances or other intrinsics over a plain, +9 chain mail. So you'll often want to switch to a different body armour eventually (depending on what you find, of course).\n\nThis artefact is more likely to spawn in the early game, where it is more likely to be useful.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Lear's hauberk was +[[27]], and its generation was not favored for the early-game.\n*Lear's hauberk was added in [[0.13]], replacing [[Lear's chain mail]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

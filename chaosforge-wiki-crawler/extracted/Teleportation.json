{"title":"Teleportation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Teleportation","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Teleportation''' is the act of moving from one place to another instantaneously. Teleports differ from [[blink]]s in two main ways: teleports can send you to any valid location on the floor, while blinks are limited to [[LOS|visible]] locations. And blinks are instantaneous, while many teleports take some time to kick in.\n\n==Sources==\nThere are several ways to teleport in ''Crawl'':\n*Reading a [[scroll of teleportation]].\n*Stepping on a [[teleport trap]].\n*You occasionally teleport while wandering in [[the Abyss]].\n\nA few methods will try to teleport you next to monsters:\n*The teleport effect from [[sourceless malevolence]] (i.e an explore-based teleport trap).\n*Being randomly teleported by the [[Bad mutations#Teleportitis|Teleportitis]] mutation.\n*Unwielding a [[distortion]] [[brand]]ed weapon.\n\nYou can instead teleport monsters by casting [[Teleport Other]] or the [[Dispersal]] spell.\n\n==Useful Info==\n===Tele Status===\nScrolls of teleport and Teleport Other give the {{LightBlue|Tele}} status. This status has a delay before it teleports you:\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n! Circumstance || Duration\n|-\n| Normal || 3-5 turns\n|-\n| In [[the Realm of Zot]] or when carrying [[Orb of Zot|the Orb]] || 8-14 turns\n|-\n| In [[the Abyss]] (even when carrying the Orb) || 8-19 turns\n|}\n\nAll other teleports are instantaneous, though the player does not have as much control with them.\n\n===Location===\nTeleports send you to any random location on the floor, with the following conditions:\n*You must be able to step on the tile. E.g. you can't be sent into [[lava]] if you don't have [[flight]] (temporary or not). You can't be teleported into an occupied or solid tile, either.\n*You cannot be teleported into a dangerous [[cloud]].\n*You cannot be teleported into [[vault]]s with the \"no tele into\" flag. This includes most [[door#Runed Door|runed door]] and [[transporter]] [[vault]]s, and every [[player ghost]] vault. A notable exception is the [[Elven_Halls#Elf:2_-_The_Hall_of_Blades|Hall of Blades]] in [[Elven Halls|Elf]]:2, which does allow teleport inside. \n\nOther than those restrictions, it can bring you to ''any'' random tile, including the one you were on originally (\"Your surroundings flicker for a moment.\").\n\nLike [[blink]]ing, teleports leave a cloud of translocational energy behind; these clouds have no effect (beyond stopping other [[clouds]] from existing on their tile).\n\n==Preventing Teleport==\nIf the player has the {{LightBlue|Tele}} status, then they can either use a [[potion of cancellation]] or read another [[scroll of teleport]] to end it. A [[Quicksilver Bolt]] (including from the [[wand of quicksilver]]) will also end the Tele status.\n\nThe {{LightRed|-Tele}} (from [[Dimension Anchor]]) and {{LightRed|Stuck}} (from [[miscast effect|miscasting]] Translocations) statuses both prevent teleportation. These statuses can be removed by quaffing a [[potion of cancellation]]. -Tele may also be obtained via certain [[artefact]]s or by playing a [[Formicid]]; having these won't stop shifts in the Abyss.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], monsters could cast [[Teleport Self]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], non-[[player ghost]] monsters could cast [[Teleport Other]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the *Tele intrinsic could be obtained from a [[ring of teleportation]], acting like teleportitis.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], suffering a [[Miscast effect#Translocation|Translocations miscast]] effect could teleport the player, and being hit by a distortion weapon could too.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], teleport destination could be controlled with [[teleport control]]. Also, 20% of Abyss teleports had a delay of only 3-5 turns.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], the teleport control [[status effect]] did not delay teleports.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], players had access to Teleport Self.\n\n[[Category:Gameplay]]\n[[Category:Strategy]]"}

{"title":"Necromancy","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Necromancy","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\nThe '''Necromancy''' school of magic focuses on calling upon the unsavory power of death itself. It also boosts the abilities of [[Kikubaaqudgha]] and the bonus damage you can inflict with a [[pain (brand)|pain]] [[brand]]ed weapon. Characters under the influence of the [[Necromutation]] spell (itself of the Necromancy school) receive a bonus to the power of Necromancy spells, as do [[mummies]] upon reaching levels 3 and 13.\n\nThe most obvious use for Necromancy is the creation of [[derived undead]] allies, though there are also several offensive and defensive spell options. It contains a very diverse spell set, and is a useful school of magic to study.\n\nUsing Necromancy has more consequences than other magical schools, however, as certain high-level Necromancy spells have side effects for the caster beyond the usual chance of [[miscast]]s. Necromancy is also considered [[unholy]], and the good-aligned gods [[divine retribution|severely punish]] its use.\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n{{spell table by level|Necromancy}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{spell sources|Necromancy|Book of Death,Book of Decay,Book of Necromancy,Book of Unlife,Necronomicon}}\n\n==Undead Creation==\nWhile the [[corpse]]s you'll find (and create) are useless, certain undead-creating spells will destroy corpses when they take effect. Only one of these effects may apply per monster (in order of priority, highest to lowest):<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|mon-death.cc|1458}}</ref>\n*[[Infestation]]\n*[[Animate Dead]]/[[Reaping]] [[brand]]\n*[[Necrotise]]\n\nHowever, all four effects will stack with [[Death Channel]]<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|mon-death.cc|2484}}</ref>, meaning you can create up to 2 [[derived undead]] per enemy.\n\nA monster's [[Bind Souls]] enchantment overrides all four of the player corpse-based effects. [[Gozag]] turns corpses to [[gold]], preventing Necrotise and Animate Dead from creating allies. [[Yredelemnul]]'s passive reaping prevents necromantic creation of allies through any means except Infestation (Death Channel does ''not'' stack). Followers of [[Okawaru]], as well as followers of [[Ru]] who have sacrificed love, cannot create undead allies.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Necromancer]]\n\n==History==\n*[[0.29]] Necromancy reworked to remove functional [[corpse]] items. Added [[Necrotise]], removed [[Animate Skeleton]], [[Excruciating Wounds]], and [[Pain]] from players.\n*[[0.28]] Added [[Anguish]].\n*[[0.25]] To focus more on melee support, removed [[Regeneration]] (leaving [[Vampiric Draining]] to regain health) and [[Bolt of Draining]]. Reduced range of [[Dispel Undead]] and [[Agony]] to 1. [[Corpse Rot]] clouds surround the caster instead of the corpses.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], [[Fedhas]] forbid use of Necromancy, as it disturbed the natural cycle of corpses.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Skills}}\n\n[[Category:Magic skills]]"}

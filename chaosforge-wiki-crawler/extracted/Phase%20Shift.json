Its duration is determined by your [[spell power]] (4+1dPower), but is fairly short regardless, maxing out at 30 turns.\n\nPlayers afflicted by [[Dimension Anchor]] will instantly have their Phase Shift canceled and are prevented from recasting it for the duration of its effect. Note that other forms of teleportation prevention ('''-TELE'''), such as from [[randart]]s, do not affect this spell.\n\n==Strategy==\nAlthough too expensive and short lived to keep up constantly, +8 EV can make a big difference in single fights with dangerous opponents. Use it while waiting for the enemy to move into range.\n\n==History==\nPhase Shift was removed in [[0.18]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

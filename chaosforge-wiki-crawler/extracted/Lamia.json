She always generates with a powerful [[polearm]] (often of [[distortion]]) and a [[superb item]] [[naga barding]], can [[mesmerize]] her prey to prevent them from escaping her [[constriction|coils]], and devastates those who fight at range with brutal attack spells.\n\n==Location==\n*The [[Snake Pit]]: 2-5\n\n<!--spl-bot-begin-->\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Orb of Destruction]] (9d16)\n|slot2=[[Mesmerise]]\n|slot3=[[Haste]]\n|slot4=[[Poison Arrow]] (3d25)\n|slot5=''none''\n|slot6=[[Teleport Self]]\n}}\n{{clear}}\n<!--spl-bot-end-->\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Lamia is one of the deadlier uniques in the mid-game, capable of dealing very heavy damage both in melee and at range. If you cannot casually defeat [[naga warrior]]s in melee, don't even think of attempting it against Lamia.\n*Although you probably won't be in the Snake Pit without it, [[poison]] resistance is extremely useful when fighting Lamia, if only to significantly reduce the impact of her [[Poison Arrow]]s.\n*[[Clarity]] will render you immune to her [[Mesmerise]], as will very high [[magic resistance]]. Losing the ability to flee her, especially when other enemies happen to be around, can be extremely fatal. If all else fails, an ''uncontrolled'' [[teleport]] will allow you to escape, even if constricted.\n*Although you may be able to outrun her, you can't outrun her [[Orb of Destruction]]. See that spell's article for tips on dealing with it.\n\n==History==\nLamia was added in [[0.12]] and removed in [[0.14]].\n\nPrior to [[0.13]], Lamia traveled with a large band of naga allies.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

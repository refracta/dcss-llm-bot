{"title":"Deep elf demonologist","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Deep_elf_demonologist","type":"raw","data":"{{version|031}}\n{{list of | deep elves}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Deep elf demonologists''' are devastating summoners which call terrifying forces to their aid, [[banish]]ing opponents who come too close. They can be found in the [[Elven Halls]] (particularly on Elf:3), [[the Vaults]] (mainly Vaults:5), and occasionally in [[the Depths]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*High [[willpower]] is useful when fighting them (three pips is generally enough to avoid banishment). [[Silence]] makes them harmless (but not their summons!)\n*Be sure to teleport away or otherwise escape if they manage to summon [[fiend]]s around you: fighting them is a bad idea, as the demonologist will just summon more, but ignoring them is even more dangerous unless you know you can kill the summoner in the next turn or so. Once it's down, all its allies will vanish.\n*[[Fiend]]s and [[tormentor]]s will be much less likely to cast [[Symbol of Torment]] if their torment-vulnerable master is within their line of sight.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.14]], deep elf demonologists also knew [[Summon Minor Demon]].\n\n[[category:Elf]]"}

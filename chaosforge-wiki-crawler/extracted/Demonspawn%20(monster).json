{"title":"Demonspawn (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Demonspawn_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | demonspawn}}\n{{monster info|demonspawn}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Demonspawn''' are fairly ordinary humanoid monsters. They can appear in a [[Pandemonium]]-themed [[Orcish Mines]] [[vault]], inside [[Wucad Mu's Monastery]], and very rarely in the [[Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nLike all demonspawn, they are vulnerable to holy weapons and [[silver]], so use those if you have them. If you see them outside of a vault (and outside [[Pandemonium]]), then they are most likely [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]]s.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], regular demonspawn were buffed significantly and now appear in various vaults. They replace the \"base\" (occupationless) demonspawn that were removed in this version.\n*In [[0.14]], a new set of [[List_of_demonspawn|demonspawn monsters]] were introduced to [[Pandemonium]].\n\n[[Category:Demonspawn]]"}

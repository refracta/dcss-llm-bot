{"title":"Inventory","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Inventory","type":"raw","data":"{{version016}}\n\nYour '''inventory''' is a list of all items you are currently carrying. To view your inventory while playing online, press '<b>[[i]]</b>'. When playing offline, your inventory will be visible in the bottom right portion of the screen.\n\nYou can carry at most 52 items at a time, though many items ([[food]], [[scroll]]s, [[potion]]s, and [[ammo]]) can be stacked, conserving space. Items you have no use for when actually in combat should often be left behind or stored in a [[stash]], freeing up space for future loot.\n\nCommon consumable items often always carried, include:\n*Potions of [[potion of heal wounds|heal wounds]], [[potion of curing|curing]], [[potion of might|might]], [[potion of brilliance|brilliance]], [[potion of berserk rage|berserk rage]], [[potion of magic|magic]], [[potion of invisibility|invisibility]]\n*[[Scrolls of teleportation]], [[scroll of blinking|blinking]], [[scroll of fog|fog]]\n*[[Bread ration]]s, [[meat ration]]s, or [[honeycomb]]s.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.15]], items had individual weights, and each character had a maximum carrying capacity determined by their [[size]] and [[strength]] stat. Also, certain items in your inventory could be [[item destruction|destroyed]], making it unwise to carry more of an item around than you really need."}

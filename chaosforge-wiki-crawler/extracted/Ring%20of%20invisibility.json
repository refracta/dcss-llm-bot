It requires a high [[Evocations]] skill to use reliably or for a long duration, but there are no penalties for failing to evoke it, so even low-level characters can make some use of it. However, invisibility's benefits come with significant [[hunger]] and potential [[magic contamination]] costs, and are less dramatic than one might expect.\n\nThis ring also grants its wearer the ability to become visible at will, a useful option when trying to minimize magic contamination.\n\nThe chance of successfully evoking this ring rises with your [[Evocations]] skill:\n\n{{#invoke:Failure rate table|table|Evocations|60|2}}\n\n==Strategy==\n*A character with a high [[Stealth]] skill can benefit from use of a ring of invisibility by dealing extra [[stabbing]] damage to enemies who cannot see you. This is by no means a long-term strategy, however, as many mid- to late-game monsters can [[see invisible]]. You can find a list of monsters which see through invisibility [[:Category:See invisible|here]]. \n\n==See Also==\n*[[Invisible]]\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.18]], rings of invisibility were removed.\n\n{{amulets}}\n{{rings}}"}

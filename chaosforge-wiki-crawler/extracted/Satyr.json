{"title":"Satyr","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Satyr","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For a list of all centaur-type creatures, see [[list of centaurs]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Satyrs''' are the powerful leaders of [[faun]] packs. Like their weaker brethren, satyrs attack you at range and have crippling Hexes. They'll also [[might]] nearby enemies with Battlecry, increasing allies' melee damage by +50%. They can be found in [[the Shoals]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*It's good to have high [[willpower]] in the Shoals, and satyrs are one of the main reasons for it. \n**[[Sleep]] might only last for 1 turn, but it's 1 turn where a squad of mighted fauns can shoot at you, melee enemies hit for 250% damage, and [[EV]]/[[SH]] are set to 0. If you're around a group of enemies, sleep can mean ''lots'' of extra damage.\n**[[Cause Fear]] can be annoying to melee characters. At the least, breaking [[line of sight]] will end the effect. It's more annoying if you rely on [[summon]]s or other [[allies]]; allies without enough will can be feared, too, reducing their effectiveness to near 0.\n**Note that [[faun]]s have [[Strip Willpower]], making it more likely for you to be hit by these effects.\n*While the Hexes are dangerous, don't underestimate the ranged attacks. Fauns can deal moderately high damage from a distance, and when [[might]]ed, they are strong in melee too. Try to take out the satyr quickly to prevent Battlecry from being used.\n\n==History==\n*Satyrs were added in [[0.14]].\n*During the brief period in which the [[Enchanted Forest]] was available in [[trunk]], satyrs could be found there."}

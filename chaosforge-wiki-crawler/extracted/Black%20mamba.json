{"title":"Black mamba","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Black_mamba","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{list of | snakes}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Black mambas''' are very fast [[list of snakes|snakes]] with painfully [[poison|venomous]] bites. Although not the deadliest of the snakes, they are hard to escape and can be very dangerous to squishy characters when first encountered. They can be found in [[the Lair]] and the [[Snake Pit]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Be cautious around this creature if you lack poison resistance or decent [[AC]]. Their bites can cause serious damage even if poison isn't an issue.\n*Their [[willpower]] isn't especially high, which makes them susceptible to [[Hexes]] and [[wands of disintegration]]. Considering their high [[ev]]asion, disabling them (or simply blowing them up) may be your best bet at surviving an early encounter even if it takes you a couple tries."}

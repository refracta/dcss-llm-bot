{"title":"Macabre mass","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Macabre_mass","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Macabre masses''' are the sad result of allowing [[crawling corpse]]s to fuse with each other. These husks have no offensive or defensive capabilities, and will generally do nothing but fuse with each other, with [[crawling corpse]]s, or with [[small abomination]]s. When there is nothing left to fuse with, they will simply follow you around, waiting for you to generate more flesh for fusing. They have slightly more durability than a crawling corpse (a [[bat]] won't kill them in a single attack), but move much more slowly.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Macabre masses will happily charge through [[trap]]s to follow you, and are easy pickings for any monster. Try to convert them up to abominations as quickly as you can, as you'll be wasting them if they fall in battle.\n\n==History==\n*Macabre masses were removed in [[0.27]]."}

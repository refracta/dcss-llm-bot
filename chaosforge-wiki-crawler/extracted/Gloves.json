They may generate with the following [[ego]]s:\n*[[Strength]] (+3)\n*[[Dexterity]] (+3)\n*[[Stealth]] (+50)\n*[[Hurling]]\n*[[Infusion (ego)|Infusion]]\n\n==Restrictions==\nGloves are incompatible with the [[Claws]] [[mutation]]; wearing gloves over a rank 1 or 2 mutation will negate the mutation, and a rank 3 mutation makes gloves unwearable.\n\n[[Oni]] and [[troll]]s are too large for gloves, [[spriggan]]s are too small, and [[octopode]]s and [[felid]]s don't have hands to wear them on.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], the [[Infusion (ego)]] was introduced, and the [[archery]] ego was replaced with [[hurling]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], gloves couldn't have [[Stealth]] ego.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], [[gauntlets]] and [[bracers of archery]] also existed for the hand slot. Also, gloves needed to be removed before changing rings, meaning [[curse]]d gloves made it impossible to change your [[ring]]s.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Glove1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical/Artifact''' || [[File:Glove2.png]] [[File:Glove3.png]] [[File:Glove4.png]] [[File:Glove5.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]] gloves\n|-\n| '''[[Fencer's Gloves]]''' || [[File:Fencer's gloves.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Gauntlets of War]]''' || [[File:Gauntlets of war.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Delatra's gloves]]''' || [[File:Delatra's gloves.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Mad Mage's Maulers]]''' || [[File:Mad Mage's Maulers.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Gloves]]"}

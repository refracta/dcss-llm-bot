Like other amulets of guardian spirit, it is somewhat risky for spellcasters to use. Characters that weren't going to use their MP anyway will find it better than nothing, especially if they're already using a [[shield]] or other source of SH. Still, you might prefer some other artefact amulet with resistances or other properties.\n\nThe brooch of Shielding is the shield equivalent of the [[ring of the Tortoise|rings of the Tortoise]] and [[ring of the Hare|Hare]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the brooch of Shielding was an [[amulet of reflection]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], the brooch of Shielding was an [[amulet of warding]] with AC+4 and EV+4.\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Amulets]]"}

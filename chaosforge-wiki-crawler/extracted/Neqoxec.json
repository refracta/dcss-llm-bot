{"title":"Neqoxec","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Neqoxec","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe '''neqoxec''' is a particularly dangerous tier-[[3]] [[demon]]. Although it doesn't deal much damage directly, it will gladly [[malmutate]] you and drain your [[MP]]. They are found in [[the Abyss]] and [[Pandemonium]] (particularly in [[Mnoleg]]'s domain), and can be summoned by other monsters with the [[Summon Demon]] spell.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Neqoxecs require a clear line of fire to mutate you, so keep other monsters or summoned allies in the way to block them.\n**If that isn't an option, neqoxecs also cannot [[see invisible]]; a source of invisibility will provide at least some protection in a pinch.\n**Their Brain Bite doesn't require a line of fire, however. Casters should watch out.\n*Fortunately, they're fragile and have few resistances. Take them out first whenever possible.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], neqoxecs had [[Brain Feed]] instead of [[Brain Bite]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], neqoxecs had [[Summon Minor Demon]].\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

{"title":"Potion of brilliance","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Potion_of_brilliance","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{item\n |itemtype = Potion\n |name = Potion of brilliance\n}}\n''For the removed [[unrand]], see [[Brilliance (artefact)]].''\n{{flavour|A magic potion which increases the power of the drinker's spells and halves their magic cost (rounding up).}}\n\nQuaffing a '''potion of brilliance''' gives the '''Brilliance''' status, with the following temporary bonuses:\n*Halves the MP cost of spells (rounded up)\n*An increase to [[spell power]] (1 [[spell enhancer]]; equal to wearing an item of [[Archmagi]])\n\nThese effects last for 35-74 (more) turns. The duration can stack, but you can only store up to 80 turns at a time.\n\nThe [[robe of Folly]] gives a permanent Brilliance effect - the potion and this robe do not stack.\n\n==Strategy==\nBrilliance is a useful consumable for casters, akin to a [[potion of might]]. It is best for long, \"sustained\" encounters, where you'd otherwise run out of MP.\n\n==Monster Version==\nMonsters can get the Brilliance effect by using the spell [[Aura of Brilliance]]. Also, [[Boris]] gains Brilliance if you're holding the [[Orb of Zot]].\n\nInstead of the above effects, Brilliance grants monsters an effective +5 [[HD]] when casting [[spell slot flags|\"wizardly\"]] spells, and makes it more likely for them to cast said spells.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], brilliance gave +5 [[intelligence]], and reduced the [[spell success|raw spell failure rate]] by 1/3 (with another bonus of -6% raw failure). Also, brilliance gave a [[spell power]] boost equal to 3 levels of a skill, instead of acting like a spell enhancer.\n\n{{potions}}"}

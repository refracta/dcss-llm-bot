This page probably contains spoilers.*\n\nDiary of Skeg, Ogre Gladiator (Crawl 0.5)\n\n***\n\nIntro: The Boring Start\n\nI was a little bewildered at first, running down the stairs to the Dungeon of legend. I'd been saving rations, eating the flesh of my fellows, for weeks before I broke out of the arena, yet I only had one left when I finally reached the place. The city would have recovered in the meantime; their riders would be after me; I couldn't afford to stick around for long, whatever horrors might be in the Dungeon, so I swallowed, gripped my shield and club, and ran down...\n\nMy first thought was confusion. Why was there a castle with a moat down here, reached by going downstairs? Then I opened a door and saw a hobgoblin, and groaned; such scrawny wimps would have been my food back in the pit, I could have strangled them with my bare hands. Somehow, there were only hobbos, gobbos, and some giant vermin on the first floor - although I picked up a couple of strange scrolls, and (bizarrely) felt stronger than ever before after squashing all the enemies I could find. Maybe the myth of how this dungeon turned wimps into heroes was true, maybe my real ogre blood was finally surfacing after years in a cage, I didn't know, but it felt great!\n\nPart of me was thanking my lucky stars that I'd had it so easy. I'd heard of people who were slaughtered long before their time down here.\n\nDL2 & 3: The Premature Finish\n\nGoing downstairs I met with little opposition at first, a goblin, an oversized newt, then similar. The layout seemed to be a bunch of big rooms connected by narrow corridors, which was fine by me - I could slay enemies one at a time if they came from there. I saw a big red worm, and thought this was it, this would be my first worthy challenge... a few bashes later, not only was it dead, but another wave of strength had suffused me, some kind of reward for killing more individuals in a short time than ever before. I hadn't eaten yet... well, OK, the raw flesh of my fallen foes, but no real food. I blundered into a trap that teleported me... somewhere, but again I had only weaklings in my way, weaklings who were easily killed. I found this weird wand, and decided to test it on a giant newt... to literally no effect - not even the telltale feel of an empty wand. I'd find out what it was later; for now, time to kill. Again, nothing interesting came for me, although a few jackals tried to make me dinner when I went down the next set of steps.\n\nThen I took a worm on in melee combat, got sloppy, missed a few times, let him enter my guard too much, and I died.\n\nAnd I hadn't done anything exciting yet.\n\n***\n\n*I had no excuse to not retreat. Guess I should have at least had another coffee before beginning play while a little sleepy. Remind me to make Skeg the Ogre Chaos Knight of Lugonu, for story reasons.*\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<meta

of Skeg, Ogre Gladiator (Crawl 0.5)\n----\n\nIntro: The Boring Start\n\nI was a little bewildered at first, running down the stairs to the Dungeon of legend. I'd been saving rations, eating the flesh of my fellows, for weeks before I broke out of the arena, yet I only had one left when I finally reached the place. The city would have recovered in the meantime; their riders would be after me; I couldn't afford to stick around for long, whatever horrors might be in the Dungeon, so I swallowed, gripped my shield and club, and ran down...\n\nMy first thought was confusion. Why was there a castle with a moat down here, reached by going downstairs? Then I opened a door and saw a hobgoblin, and groaned; such scrawny wimps would have been my food back in the pit, I could have strangled them with my bare hands. Somehow, there were only hobbos, gobbos, and some giant vermin on the first floor - although I picked up a couple of strange scrolls, and (bizarrely) felt stronger than ever before after squashing all the enemies I could find. Maybe the myth of how this dungeon turned wimps into heroes was true, maybe my real ogre blood was finally surfacing after years in a cage, I didn't know, but it felt great!\n\nPart of me was thanking my lucky stars that I'd had it so easy. I'd heard of people who were slaughtered long before their time down here.\n\nDL2 & 3: The Premature Finish\n\nGoing downstairs I met with little opposition at first, a goblin, an oversized newt, then similar. The layout seemed to be a bunch of big rooms connected by narrow corridors, which was fine by me - I could slay enemies one at a time if they came from there. I saw a big red worm, and thought this was it, this would be my first worthy challenge... a few bashes later, not only was it dead, but another wave of strength had suffused me, some kind of reward for killing more individuals in a short time than ever before. I hadn't eaten yet... well, OK, the raw flesh of my fallen foes, but no real food. I blundered into a trap that teleported me... somewhere, but again I had only weaklings in my way, weaklings who were easily killed. I found this weird wand, and decided to test it on a giant newt... to literally no effect - not even the telltale feel of an empty wand. I'd find out what it was later; for now, time to kill. Again, nothing interesting came for me, although a few jackals tried to make me dinner when I went down the next set of steps.\n\nThen I took a worm on in melee combat, got sloppy, missed a few times, let him enter my guard too much, and I died.\n\nAnd I hadn't done anything exciting yet.\n\n----\n\n''I had no excuse to not retreat. Guess I should have at least had another coffee before beginning play while a little sleepy. Remind me to make Skeg the Ogre Chaos Knight of Lugonu, for story reasons.''"}

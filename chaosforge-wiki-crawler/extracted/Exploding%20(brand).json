{"title":"Exploding (brand)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Exploding_(brand)","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|It will explode into fragments upon hitting a target, hitting an obstruction, or reaching its maximum range.}}\n\n'''Exploding''' is an [[ammunition]] [[brand]] found solely on [[tomahawk]]s. Throwing an exploding item at a target creates an unavoidable 3x3 explosion that deals 2d5 physical damage to the target and everything adjacent to it. Explosive ammo always [[mulch]]es when thrown.\n\n==Strategy==\nExploding tomahawks are useful for taking out evasive, fragile opponents and enemy summoners hiding behind their summons. However, be aware that the explosions they produce are loud enough to attract a lot of attention. They are also quite rare outside of the [[Orcish Mines]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.24]], this ammunition brand could be found on [[tomahawk]]s. Also, there was a rare ammunition shop that had exploding [[large rock]]s and [[javelin]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], exploding could generate on [[sling bullet]]s.\n*In [[0.17]], exploding tomahawks were added.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], exploding [[dart]]s were common.\n\n{{brands}}\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

Such a tree is quite resilient, although it is rooted in place while the transformation lasts, and cannot teleport.}}\n\n{{item\n |itemtype=Potion\n |name=Potion of lignification\n |cost=70\n |weight=4.0\n}}\n\nQuaffing a '''potion of lignification''' transforms you into [[Tree Form]] for a little while. As a tree, your [[armour]] is melded, [[EV]] is reduced to almost nothing, and you cannot move, [[blink]], or [[teleport]]. However, Tree Form grants significant HP, natural defenses, and plant resistances (rPois, immune to [[pain]] and [[torment]]). You ''can'' wield weapons, cast spells, and do other sorts of actions. \n\n[[Ghoul]]s and bloodless [[vampires]] are unaffected, while followers of [[Zin]] incur [[piety]] loss and [[penance]] if they knowingly drink this potion.\n\n==Strategy==\nLignification is great at both the beginning and end of an adventure. Early on, the high AC, rPois, and unarmed branch attacks make it very useful for defeating tough and/or poisonous monsters like [[killer bee]]s. In the extended portions of the game, immunity to [[torment]] give it a dedicated use against enemies like [[curse toe]]s. It's especially good in [[the Tomb]], avoiding [[death curse]]s as well as the ever-common [[dispersal trap]]s.\n\nSpecies with armour restrictions ([[Felid]]s, [[Octopode]]s, oddly-[[size]]d species) will enjoy the AC for a greater amount of time. [[Troll]]s have a special use for Tree Form, as its high AC and boosted, non-chopping unarmed attacks are perfect for taking out [[hydra]]s.\n\nOf course, this comes at a major cost - the complete lack of movement and teleportation - which should not be taken lightly. Hallways are as important as ever, to prevent being swarmed if/when new enemies show up. If you don't have a ranged attack, ranged enemies can strike you from impunity. A [[potion of cancellation]] will let you end Tree Form early, but such potions are rare and valuable; choose when to enter Tree Form carefully. \n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*A [[potion of attraction]] will force reaching/ranged enemies, such as polearm wielding [[Gnoll (monster)|gnolls]], to come closer.\n*A [[scroll of torment]] can be very powerful, given your immunity in Tree Form.\n*The inability to move also gives immunity to enemies that shove you around ([[wind drake]]s, [[swamp worm]]s, monsters with [[Force Lance]], [[Roxanne]]).\n*Tree Form will negate the attack penalties of standing in [[shallow water]].\n*Keep in mind that transforming into Tree Form will suppress the innate abilities associated with your original species, leading to possibily unexpected results. For example, if you were a [[formicid]], quaffing the potion to fight an invisible enemy might be counter-productive, since you will lose your [[Good_mutations#Antennae|Antennae]] which allowed you to see invisible.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], plants, including players in treeform, gave rN+++.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], treeform gave you 48% [[GDR]] (instead of AC determining it).\n*Prior to [[0.24]], vampires below full were unaffected.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], you could not quaff potions, eat, or speak while in [[Tree Form]].\n*Potions of lignification were added in [[0.14]], replacing [[potions of slowing]].\n\n{{potions}}"}

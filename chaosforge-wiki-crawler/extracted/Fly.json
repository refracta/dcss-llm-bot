Most types of flight will time out - be careful what you are above when that happens!}}\n'''Flight''' ('''Fly''') is a [[status effect]] that sends you soaring above the ground. It makes traversing terrain with water and lava much easier.\n\n==Effects==\n*Ability to safely cross [[deep water]] and [[lava]].\n*Ignore all harmful effects of [[shallow water]].\n**Note that [[Merfolk]] and [[Octopode]]s still get their water bonuses while flying above water.\n*Resistance to [[Shatter]] and [[staff of earth|staves of earth]]\n\n==Sources==\nSome sources of flight are temporary and will eventually expire. If your flight expires over deadly terrain (such as [[deep water]] or [[lava]]), you remain in the air but take significant [[drain]]ing every turn until you reach safety.\n*[[Potion of enlightenment]].\n*Casting or being caught in a [[Polar Vortex]] (''very'' short-lived).\n\nThese sources of flight are permanent, allowing you to fly continuously:\n*Intrinsic of [[Gargoyle]]s, [[Tengu]], and black [[Draconian]]s once reaching high enough [[XL]].\n**Other Draconians may gain the ability by randomly [[mutation|mutating]].\n*Equipment with the [[flight (ego)|flight ego]] (normally found on [[boots]], [[barding]], and some [[artefact]]s).\n*A [[ring of flight]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], flight wasn't a strictly positive effect for players. [[Airstrike]] dealt bonus damage to flying targets. Player-caused sources of flight could be cancelled and re-evoked. The [[ring of flight]] was also temporary. [[Hooves]] had a stealth penalty which was negated when flying. Also, octopodes and merfolk didn't get their water bonuses while flying above water.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], Tengu only gained temporary flight at XL 5, only getting permanent flight at XL 14.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], you would die instantly if your flight ran out over deadly terrain.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], flight could be achieved using the [[Flight (spell)|Flight]] spell.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], flight protected you from mechanical [[trap]]s. There was also a [[Flight card]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], flying creatures had a 2/3rds chance of dodging thrown nets. \n*Prior to [[0.13]], flight could protect you from electrical attacks.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], flight increased the caster's carrying capacity. Also, [[wand of paralysis|wands of paralysis]], the [[Petrify]] spell, and [[net]]s could instantly kill flying creatures by dropping them into [[deep water]] or [[lava]].\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]\n[[Category:Movement]]"}

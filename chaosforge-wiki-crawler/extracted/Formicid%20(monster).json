For the player race, see [[Formicid]].''\n{{monster info|formicid}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Formicids''' are humanoid monsters with ant-like traits.

Like the player race, the monster can burrow through walls.\n\n==History==\n*Formicids were considered for general inclusion in [[0.14]], but were ultimately disabled outside of vaults."}

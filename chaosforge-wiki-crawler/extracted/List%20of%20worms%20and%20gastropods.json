{"title":"List of worms and gastropods","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_worms_and_gastropods","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n''Crawl''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s '''worms and gastropods''' are an assortment of enemies whose defining traits are moderately powerful attacks and mindless hunger. That said, they are generally quite slow and often have virtually no defenses to speak of, so most characters will not find them terribly difficult to handle. Much like ''Crawl''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[list of arthropods|arthropods]], they are largely weak to [[poison]] and lack endoskeletons, meaning they cannot be raised as [[skeleton]]s.\n\nMost of them have been removed over time, as they presented few challenges to competent players. Those that remain are known for having dangerous abilities that compensate for their slow speed.\n\n==Worm types==\n{{monsterlink|Worm}} - These enormous pests can mangle inexperienced adventurers. They recover swiftly from injuries.\n\n{{monsterlink|Steelbarb worm}} - Fast, armored worms whose bites leave painful [[barbs]] in their prey.\n\n{{monsterlink|Swamp worm}} - Exceptionally swift worms with painful bites that can [[Harpoon Shot|pull passersby]] into the murk of [[the Swamp]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Tyrant leech}} - Loathsome swamp-dwellers that gorge themselves on blood as they tear prey limb from limb.\n\n==Gastropod types==\n{{monsterlink|Dart slug}} - A small slug that can launch [[Slug Dart|chitinous darts]] with remarkable range & power.\n\n{{monsterlink|Torpor snail}} - An enormous snail sacred to [[Cheibriados]] whose very presence [[slow]]s its prey.\n\n===Unique gastropod===\n{{monsterlink|Gastronok}} - A particularly massive and powerful slug wearing a fancy [[hat]]. He's slow, but he has various spells to get around that.\n\n==Retired worms and gastropods==\n{{monsterlink|Brain worm}} - Unnatural creatures that fed on the minds of sentient beings.\n\n{{monsterlink|Lava worm}} - Easily avoidable lava-dwelling annelids with fiery bites.\n\n{{monsterlink|Giant slug}} - Beefy and fairly strong, but extremely slow and with no defense to speak of.\n\n{{monsterlink|Elephant slug}} - A slug the size of an elephant. Basically just an even bigger giant slug.\n\n{{monsterlink|Rock worm}} - Cautious predators which could swim through rock and stone as though it were water.\n\n{{monsterlink|Spiny worm}} - Aggravating [[acid]]ic worms that corroded your equipment with toxic stings.\n\n{{monsterlink|Agate snail}} - A variety of snail that would withdraw into its shell when injured, gaining extra defense and regeneration.\n\n==History==\n*[[0.28]] added steelbarb worms.\n*In [[0.18]], brain worms were removed and dart slugs were added.\n*In [[0.15]], lava worms, giant slugs, and elephant slugs were removed while torpor snails were added. Additionally, gastropods had their glyph changed from 'j' to 'w', lumping them in with worms.\n*In [[0.14]], rock worms, spiny worms, and agate snails were removed.\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

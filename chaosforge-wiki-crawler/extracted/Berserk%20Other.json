Going berserk temporarily increases health, speed, and damage dealt in melee.}}\n'''Berserk Other''' is a monster-only spell which allows a monster to send other monsters [[berserk]]. This makes it a pure support spell, and one whose threat level is entirely dependent on how dangerous the nearby monsters are. Queen bees can only use this spell on [[killer bee]]s and [[meliai]], while moths of wrath can target any monster that is allowed to go berserk.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Berserker Rage]]\n*[[Might Other]]\n*[[Haste Other]]\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

Although they hit fairly hard, they are easy to escape from or [[kite]], so long as you have room to flee. They appear in the [[Ice Cave]], the middle-[[Dungeon]], and [[Cocytus]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They are vulnerable to fire, along with the usual undead solutions ([[Dispel Undead]] and [[holy wrath]]).\n*Without cold resistance, their melee attacks can be very hazardous, particularly for low-level characters exploring the Ice Caves and encountering several of them at once. Don't be afraid to quaff a [[potion of resistance]] if you find them early on.\n*You can summon your own freezing wraiths with the [[Haunt]] spell."}

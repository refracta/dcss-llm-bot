It also refers to various effects that do the same thing.\n\n[[Hedge Wizard]]s and [[Warper]]s begin with the spell in their libraries.\n\n==Useful Info==\nBlink sends you to any random tile in [[line of sight]], with the following restrictions:\n*It can't send you to [[deep water]] or [[lava]] if those tiles would be impassible to you. E.g. [[amphibious]] players can be sent into deep water, [[flying]] players can be sent to either tile.\n*The tile cannot contain another creature.\n*For the purposes of this spell, translucent walls (but not [[iron grate]]s) block line of sight.\n\nBlink ''can'' send you over [[trap]]s, dangerous [[cloud]]s, etc. It can also send you to the tile you were originally on (\"You feel jittery for a moment\").\n\nAfter casting (or evoking) the Blink spell, you will be given the temporary [[Blink (status)|-Blink status]]. This shortens with [[spell power]]; at maximum power, it wears off instantly. -Blink prevents you from casting or invoking the Blink spell until it wears off; it does not block [[scrolls of blinking]], [[dispersal]], or other sources of blink.\n\nIf you have -Tele ([[Dimension Anchor]], [[Tree Form]], [[Formicid]] stasis, [[artefact]] property), or have the [[Miscast effects|Stuck]] effect (from miscasting a [[Translocations]] spell), you cannot blink by any means.\n\n==Sources==\nThe term \"blink\" means \"an instant teleportation within your [[LOS]]\".\n\nOther than the Blink spell, the following cause a blink effect on yourself:\n*Blink may come as an evocable [[artefact]] property (+Blink). This is identical to the spell, but is activated in the '''[[A]]'''bility menu, and its power is raised by [[Evocations]].\n*[[Dispersal trap]]s, when you or a monster steps on it, causes a random blink to everything around it. (This sends you to any random location in your current LOS, not the trap's LOS.)\n*A [[scroll of blinking]] causes a \"controlled blink\" - you can choose the location.\n\nThe following can cause other creatures to blink:\n*[[Dispersal (brand)|Dispersal-branded]] boomerangs causes targets to blink away.\n*[[Distortion]] weapons can randomly blink enemies, among other effects.\n*The spells [[Dispersal]] and [[Disjunction]] cause monsters around you to blink away.\n\n==Strategy==\nBlink can be a lifesaver, particularly in the earlier game. It's one of the easiest [[Escaping from (and avoiding) trouble|escape spells]] to learn and find. Since Blink sends you to any random location in LOS, there are a few quirks:\n*If you're in [[attack of opportunity|melee range]] of a lone enemy, Blink is likely able to get you out. There are many more tiles away from the enemy than next to the enemy.\n*Blink can only send you to tiles within LOS - which, in the right circumstances, can be manipulated. You can use terrain to limit the # of tiles close to the enemy, and increase the # of tiles away from the enemy. A [[scroll of fog]] is especially helpful - use fog, step back, and everything behind the clouds will be blocked. This can significantly increase your chance of blinking away.\n\nOf course, the Blink spell isn't perfectly reliable. But, when used in the right circumstance, it can save items here and there. It's recommended to use Blink when everything around you is explored; you don't want to be sent into unknown territory.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Remember that blink can drop you into a cloud, so take care when blinking around miasma, flame, or any other cloud you really don't want to land in.\n\n==Monster Version==\nMany monsters can cast the spell Blink too. Additionally, some monsters are capable of casting the following Blink variations:\n*'''[[Blink Close]]''' - Blinks the caster to a space closer to a target.\n*'''[[Blink Away]]''' - Blinks the caster to a space farther away from a target.\n*'''[[Blink Range]]''' - Blinks the caster to a space as far away from a target as possible while still remaining within range for their ranged attacks.\n*'''[[Blink Allies Encircling]]''' - Blinks nearby allies (excluding the caster) around a target, surrounding them.\n*'''[[Blink Allies Away]]''' - Blinks nearby allies farther away from a target while maintaining their ability to use ranged attacks.\n*'''[[Blink Other]]''' - Randomly blinks a target.\n*'''[[Blink Other Close]]''' - Blinks a target towards the caster.\n\nSome monsters, most notably [[phantom]]s and [[blink frog]]s, have a chance to blink when they hit you. Most such monsters have the spell as well, meaning they tend to blink around rather a lot. Monsters are not subject to a cooldown.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the Blink spell did not have a [[Blink (status)|cooldown]].\n*In [[0.27]], the [[Blink (mutation)|Blink]] mutation was removed.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the [[teleport control|cTele status]] would turn an uncontrolled blink into a semi-controlled blink.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], blinking in the [[Abyss]] would sometimes fail. [[Warp card]] could be used to blink.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], a random blink would never place you within a dangerous [[cloud]]. This allowed you to steer uncontrolled blinks by casting cloud-producing spells in areas you don't want to go first.\n\n[[Category:Movement]]"}

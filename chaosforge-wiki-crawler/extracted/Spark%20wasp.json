{"title":"Spark wasp","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spark_wasp","type":"raw","data":"{{version|028}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Spark wasps''' are fast, flying insects with an especially nasty [[electrocution|electrical]] sting and the ability to [[blinkbolt|launch themselves as lightning bolts]] at range. Spark wasps are the insect equivalent of [[raiju]]. They are thankfully rare, only occasionally appearing in the [[Spider's Nest]] and [[the Depths]]. \n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Spark wasps are susceptible to poison, so [[Mephitic Cloud]] is your friend, and poison [[dart]]s will deal damage to them quickly.\n*Alternatively, their low [[willpower]] makes it easy to affect them with [[Hexes]] or [[status effect]]-inflicting [[wand]]s.\n\n==History==\n*Spark wasps were introduced in [[0.18]]."}

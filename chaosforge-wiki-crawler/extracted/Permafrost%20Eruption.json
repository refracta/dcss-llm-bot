{"title":"Permafrost Eruption","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Permafrost_Eruption","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{spell info}} \n\n'''Permafrost Eruption''' is a level 6 [[Ice Magic|Ice]]/[[Earth]] spell which targets the largest clump of enemies in your [[line of sight]]. It deals physical damage to the targeted square, and cold damage in a 3x3 area.\n\n==Useful Info==\nTargets the largest clump of enemies in your [[line of sight]]. It deals physical damage to the enemy at the center targeted tile. Then, it deals a cold hit, ignoring [[AC]], to that enemy and every adjacent enemy.\n\nThe explosion can never be centred next to you, meaning you will never take damage from this spell. However, this spell cannot be cast when all monsters you are fighting are in melee range.\n\nPermafrost Eruption is considered a destructive spell and is supported by [[Vehumet]]. Without [[Vehumet]]'s range extension, this spell cannot be cast when all monsters are at range 7 or 8 from the player. \n\n==Strategy==\n\n==History==\n*Added in [[0.32]]."}

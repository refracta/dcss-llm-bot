{"title":"Attack flavour","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Attack_flavour","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n\nAlmost all monsters are capable of dealing physical damage to you by attacking in melee, but many of them also cause elemental damage or inflict a wide variety of detrimental [[status effect]]s. What a monster's melee attacks are capable of is determined by the monster's '''[[:Category:Attack flavours|attack flavour]]'''. These modify a monster's melee attacks in many ways, and apply whether the monster is attacking unarmed or while wielding a weapon.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=1 border-style=\"solid\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n!Flavour\n!Example\n!Description\n|-\n! [[:Category:Plain flavour|Plain]]\n| {{monsterlink|Goblin}}\n| No special effects.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Reach flavour|Reaching]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Snapping turtle}}\n| Inherent [[reaching]] (can melee attack from two tiles away).\n|-\n! [[:Category:Constrict type|Constrict]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Ball python}}\n| Inflicts [[constriction]] (pins victim in place, dealing damage over time).\n|-\n! [[:Category:Barbs flavour|Barbs]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Steelbarb worm}}\n| The attacker inflicts [[barbs]] on the target when attacking, making further movement painful.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Trample type|Trample]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Elephant}}\n| Has a chance of knocking the defender back one tile (chance depends on defender's [[size]] relative to the attacker). If successful, the attacker moves into the tile the defender occupied.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Fire flavour|Fire]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Fire bat}}\n| Adds [[HD]] + 1d(HD) - 1 [[fire]] damage. \n|-\n! [[:Category:Pure fire flavour|Pure fire]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Fire elemental}}\n| Deals no physical damage. Consists solely of [[HD]] + 1d(HD + 1) + (HD / 2) [[fire]] damage. \n|-\n! [[:Category:Sear flavour|Sear]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Searing wretch}}\n| May strip one level of [[fire resistance]] from the defender.\n|-\n!

[[:Category:Reach tongue flavour|Reach tongue]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Goliath frog}}\n| Inherent [[reaching]] and splashes the defender with [[acid]], possibly [[corrosion|corroding]] it.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Poison flavour|Poison]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Adder}}\n| Inflicts HD*2 to HD*4 poison damage, with a 1 in 3 chance to affect poison-resistant targets. See [[Poison#Poison_Types|poison types]] for specifics.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Strong poison flavour|Strong poison]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Redback}}\n| Inflicts HD*11/3 to HD*13/2 poison damage, with a 1 in 3 chance to affect poison-resistant targets. See [[Poison#Poison_Types|poison types]] for specifics.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Paralyse flavour|Paralytic poison]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Hornet}}\n| If not immune to poison, the defender will be poisoned, [[slow]]ed for 1d3 turns, and has a 1 in 6 chance to be [[paralysis|paralysed]] for 1d3 turns. Has a 1 in 3 chance to affect poison-resistant targets.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Reach sting flavour|Reach sting]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Orange demon}}\n| Inherent [[reaching]] and inflicts [[poison]].\n|-\n! [[:Category:Drown flavour|Drown]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Water nymph}}\n| Attacks do a small amount of [[asphyxiation]] damage.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Engulf flavour|Engulf]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Water elemental}}\n| Attacks have a chance of engulfing the target, which continuously deals [[asphyxiation]] damage and mimics the effect of [[silence]] on targets that need to breathe. Asphyxiation resistance negates both effects. Moving away from the attacker will break the engulf.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Holy flavour|Holy]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Pearl dragon}}\n| Does an additional 75% damage against [[evil]] and [[unholy]] targets. This is similar to the [[holy wrath]] weapon brand, but without a random component.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Distort flavour|Distortion]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Spatial vortex}}\n| Inherent [[distortion]] brand (deals additional irresistible damage, causes the defender to [[blink]], or [[banish]]es defender to [[the Abyss]]).\n|-\n!

This only has a 3% chance of activating if the attack deals less than 6 damage, and a 33% chance if the attack normally does no damage (i.e., \"touch\"). In spite of the name, player experience is completely unaffected by this attack flavour.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Vampiric flavour|Vampiric]]\n| {{Glyph|Vampire}} [[File:Vampire_(monster).png]] '''[[Vampire_(monster)|Vampire]]'''\n| Will [[heal]] the attacker for 1d(damage inflicted) if the defender is [[cold-blooded]] or [[warm-blooded]].

[[:Category:Mutate flavour|Mutate]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Mnoleg}}\n| Each hit has a 25% chance of [[malmutating]] the defender (or [[polymorph]]ing if the defender is a monster).\n|-\n!

[[:Category:Ensnare flavour|Ensnare]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Jumping spider}}\n| If the attack does any damage, it has a 50% chance of trapping the defender in a [[web]].\n|-\n! [[:Category:Steal flavour|Steal]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Maurice}}\n| Each attack steals one item from [[inventory]] (only affects players).\n|-\n! [[:Category:Corrode flavour|Corrode]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Rust devil}}\n| [[Corrode]]s the defender.\n|-\n!

[[:Category:Confuse flavour|Confuse]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Tarantella}}\n| Has a 33% chance of [[confusing]] the defender, or 10% if the attack did less than 3 damage. Duration is 1d(HD + 3) / 10 turns, rounded up, with a cumulative maximum of 4 turns.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Rage flavour|Rage]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Moth of wrath}}\n| Has a 33% chance of sending the defender into a [[berserk]] rage, if it is capable of doing so.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Bloodzerk flavour|Bloodzerk]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Skyshark}}\n| When striking targets that bleed, the user is [[Might|strengthened]], then sent into into a [[berserk]] rage.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Vuln flavour|Vulnerable]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Phantasmal warrior}}\n| Has a 33% chance of temporarily halving the defender's [[willpower]]. If the defender is already so afflicted, it instead increases the duration of the effect.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Antimagic flavour|Antimagic]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Mana viper}}\n| Inherent [[antimagic]] brand (drains player [[MP]], or causes monsters to have a spell failure chance that rises with antimagic damage dealt and decreases with time).\n|-\n! [[:Category:Swoop flavour|Swoop]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Hellwing}}\n| The attacker swoops in to perform a melee attack if far away.\n|-\n! [[:Category:Flank flavour|Flank]]\n| {{Monsterlink|Ufetubus}}\n| Slips behind the target before attacking.\n|-\n!

It also made Drain Speed apply slow even through rN+.\n*As of [[0.15]], the [[:Category:Plague flavour|Plague]] flavour was removed and the [[:Category:Sticky flame flavour|Sticky flame]] attack flavour was added. Item destruction was removed, reducing the threat from Fire and Cold attacks, as well as anything which can duplicate them (Chaos and Klown).\n*[[0.14]] contained many monster flavour changes:\n**The Klown attack flavour chose from the following types: Fire, Cold, Nasty poison, Drain XP, Rot, Blink, and Anti-magic.\n**[[Harpies]] had a Steal Food brand; attacks would occasionally consume one or more food items from your inventory or on the ground, if the target was standing on any food.\n**There were Poison (stat) attack flavours. These vaguely copied the Drain stat brand: they had a 33% chance of temporarily reducing a point of a given [[stat]] if the target was not resistant to poison.\n**[[Poison]]'s overhaul removed the Nasty Poison and Medium Poison attack flavours, as detailed in [[poison#poison types|poison types]]. Each were moved to normal poison and strong poison as appropriate per monster.\n*[[0.13]] removed the [[:Category:Disease flavour|Disease]] flavour and introduced the Plague flavour.\n[[Category:Attack flavours|*]]"}

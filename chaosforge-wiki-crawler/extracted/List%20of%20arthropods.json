{"title":"List of arthropods","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_arthropods","type":"raw","data":"{{version|028}}\nConsidering that [[the Dungeon]] is a dark, dank place filled with moist corners and rotting [[corpse]]s, it's no surprise that it contains countless '''arthropods''' ranging in size from freakishly huge to terrifyingly gargantuan. These creepy-crawlies are some of the weaker opponents you'll encounter, but they shouldn't be underestimated; a great many of them have [[venom]]ous bites or stings, more than a few also have exotic and dangerous special abilities, and they tend to come in swarms. While there are some exceptions, vulnerability to [[poison]] is a common arthropod weakness. They lack internal skeletons, so [[Necromancer]]s are unable to raise them as [[skeleton (monster)|skeletons]] (they may still be [[zombie|zombified]], however).\n\nArthropods in general are fairly common throughout [[the Dungeon]] and [[the Lair]], but certain varieties are quite common in other areas. The [[Spider's Nest]] in particular is full of spiders, as well as a variety of other bugs.\n\n==Crabs==\n{{monsterlink|Fire crab}} - Scuttling pyromaniac menaces that turn the Dungeon into a furnace with their fiery breath.\n\n{{monsterlink|Ghost crab}} - [[Undead]] fire crabs which spew ghostly flames, harming the living and summoning hostile [[spectral thing|spirits]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Apocalypse crab}} - Rare [[Abyss]]-dwellers that bathe their prey in the unpredictable forces of raw [[chaos]].\n\n==Flying Insects==\n{{monsterlink|Killer bee}} - Painful alone and deadly in swarms, these pack hunters are a menace to the unprepared.\n\n{{monsterlink|Queen bee}} - Extremely venomous and capable of sending other bees into a [[berserk]] frenzy.\n\n{{monsterlink|Meliai}} - Beefolk priestesses with axes and [[smiting]] that always come in threes.\n\n{{monsterlink|Hornet}} - An oversized wasp dyed red in the blood of its [[paralyzed]] victims. Occasionally used as mounts by [[spriggan rider|spriggans]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Spark wasp}} - [[Electricity|Electric]] swarming insects capable of launching themselves as bolts of living lightning. \n\n{{monsterlink|Vampire mosquito}} - Pesky [[undead]] insects that will happily suck the unwary dry.\n\n==Moths & Butterflies==\n{{monsterlink|Butterfly}} - Harmless and pretty and occasionally in the way.\n\n{{monsterlink|Moth of wrath}} - These fluttering nuisances are capable of [[berserk|enraging]] anything they come across.\n\n{{monsterlink|Sun moth}} - [[Holy]] moths surrounded by [[halo]]es. They attack with light and flame when provoked.\n\n{{monsterlink|Ghost moth}} - [[Invisible]] psychic predators with debilitating poisons.\n\n==Arachnids==\n{{monsterlink|Scorpion}} - Swift, stinging arthropods that are capable of seriously poisoning careless adventurers.\n\n{{monsterlink|Culicivora}} - [[Vampiric|Bloodsucking]] spiders that can also heal their brethren.\n\n{{monsterlink|Jumping spider}} - A hyperactive spider which [[blink|leaps]] in and out of combat, covering its prey in sticky [[web]]bing all the while.\n\n{{monsterlink|Tarantella}} - Strange spiders with a touch that [[confusion|disorients]] their prey.\n\n{{monsterlink|Redback}} - A notoriously venomous arachnid, capable of seriously poisoning even those who are resistant.\n\n{{monsterlink|Orb spider}} - Cowardly, unnatural spiders that can launch [[Orb of Destruction|orbs of devastating energy]] at their foes.\n\n{{monsterlink|Wolf spider}} - A powerful spider capable of tearing foes apart even without its venom.\n\n{{monsterlink|Broodmother}} - Enormous spiders that constantly swarm prey with their endless offspring.\n\n{{monsterlink|Emperor scorpion}} - The beefiest arthropod of them all, they shrug off blows that would fell lesser bugs.\n\n===Unique Arachnid===\n{{monsterlink|Arachne}} - Formerly human, this hybrid creature rules over and defends the Spider's Nest with powerful [[Poison Magic]] and endless [[web]]bing.\n\n==Other Arthropods==<!--sorted by approximate order you encounter them-->\n{{Green|B}} [[File:Formicid (monster).png]] '''[[Formicid (monster)|Formicid]]''' - Rarely-seen humanoid ants who are most notable for their ability to burrow through rock walls.\n\n{{monsterlink|Giant cockroach}} - Common pests of the upper floors of the Dungeon; mostly harmless.\n\n{{monsterlink|Boulder beetle}} - Heavily armored bugs with powerful mandibles that pursue prey by [[roll]]ing at high speed.\n\n{{monsterlink|Demonic crawler}} - Swift, [[demon|hellish]] arthropods that partially resist most elements, including poison.\n\n{{monsterlink|Entropy weaver}} - Odd insectoid casters that can rapidly [[corrode]] their foes' equipment.\n\n{{monsterlink|Pharaoh ant}} - Undead ants with life-draining bites. Their destruction empowers the souls of others to rise as [[simulacra]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Jorogumo}} - Predatory spirits that take spider-like forms.

Extra venomous!\n\n{{monsterlink|Spider}} - Scuttling poisonous pests. Individually weak, but they came in swarms.\n\n{{monsterlink|Trapdoor spider}} - Cowardly vermin that struck at those who walked past their hiding places and retreated underground when injured.\n\n{{monsterlink|Polymoth}} - Fluttering menaces that constantly [[polymorph]]ed nearby monsters. Dummied out in [[0.13]] and were fully removed in [[0.14]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Queen ant}} - Less nimble than other ants, but came with a highly venomous bite and was always guarded by her numerous offspring.\n\n{{monsterlink|Moth of suppression}} - Sickly moths that [[suppression|suppressed]] all magical items within their zone of effect.\n\n{{monsterlink|Giant centipede}} - Fragile, but had highly venomous stings.\n\n{{monsterlink|Wasp}} - Although slower and more solitary than killer bees, their stings slowed and paralysed their victims.\n\n{{monsterlink|Worker ant}} - Venomous critters that sought out puny adventurers to drag back to their nests.\n\n==History==\n*[[0.28]] - Added culicivoras, jorogumos, radroaches, broodmothers, sun moths, and pharaoh ants.\n*[[0.27]] - Removed worker ants, soldier ants, and queen ants.\n*[[0.26]] - Returned boulder beetles.\n*[[0.19]] - Added meliai and removed wasps and boulder beetles\n*[[0.18]] - Added spark wasps, removed trapdoor spiders and plain spiders.\n*[[0.17]] - Added entropy weavers, removed giant mites, boring beetles and goliath beetles.\n*[[0.16]] - Added death scarabs, renamed yellow wasps and red wasps to wasps and hornets, respectively.\n*[[0.15]] - Added ghost crabs, removed giant fireflies.\n*[[0.14]] - Removed giant centipedes and moths of suppression.\n*[[0.13]] - Added and quickly removed polymoths.\n*[[0.12]] - Added moths of suppression and chaos butterflies, and removed bumblebees and ant larvae.

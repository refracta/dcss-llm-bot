{"title":"Torpor snail","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Torpor_snail","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|gastropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Torpor snails''' are massive gastropods which slowly drag themselves toward their prey, pounding you for moderate damage when in melee. While almost any character could easily outrun a torpor snail under ordinary circumstances, they naturally inflict the [[slow]] [[status effect]] on you and your allies simply by being within your [[line of sight]], though grates and statues will block this effect. Torpor snails can be found in [[the Lair]] and [[the Spider's Nest]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Unless you are a [[Formicid]], you'll want to dispatch these foes quickly when they're encountered along with other opponents. Treat them like a milder version of [[floating eye]]s; while slow is less deadly than [[paralysis]], it still greatly increases the danger of any encounter, and it ignores your [[willpower]].\n*[[Wand of charming|Charming]] them will not only stop your slow, but it'll also slow enemies. However, their willpower is quite high. A [[scroll of vulnerability]] will lower it to reasonable levels. Without charming, using [[Wand of polymorph|polymorph]] will at least stop their slow effect.\n*If you can't see it, it can't affect you. Reading a [[scroll of fog]] or walking past a corner will break the effect, allowing you to deal with anything that pursues you at normal speed (at least until the snail catches up).\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|grates and statues will no longer block torpor snails from applying [[slow]].}} <!-- TODO: in 0.32, add \"Has aura flag\" to torpor snails' entry in the module:table_of_monsters (it's the same flag polterguardians have) -->\n*Prior to [[0.29]], [[allied]] or [[charm]]ed torpor snails would not slow enemies. However, they only had 40 willpower.\n*In [[0.17]], their meat became edible.\n*Torpor snails were added in [[0.15]]."}

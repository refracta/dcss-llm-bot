Confusion can be extremely dangerous: the victim may attack empty tiles or even allies when they attempt to fight, and may fall into deep water or lava if they attempt to move.\n\n==Effects==\nWhen confused,\n\n'''All creatures:'''\n*Cannot cast [[spell]]s, use [[wand]]s, or use most special abilities. (Players can use abilities that [[#Dealing with Confusion|cure confusion]].)\n*Cannot read [[scroll]]s.\n*Cannot use [[shields]] ([[SH]] [[stat]] set to 0).\n*Move in a random direction if they try to move or melee attack. [[Ranged weapon]]s will be fired in a random direction. Behavior differs between players and monsters.\n**Players move in a completely random direction.\n**Monsters have a 33% chance of moving/attacking in the intended direction, else move in a random direction.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|mon-act.cc|1852}}</ref>\n: This can cause [[allies]] to be attacked by accident. The player is warned if this is possible.\n\n'''Players:'''\n* Have trouble moving up [[stair]]s.\n**Going upstairs: 50% chance of falling, losing 1 HP, and remaining on the level.\n**Going downstairs: 50% chance of falling and losing 1 HP, but you make it down the stairs.\n**If you are [[fly]]ing or using an [[escape hatch]], these confusion penalties don't apply.\n\n'''Monsters:'''\n* Are vulnerable to low-tier [[stab]]s. (See the [[Stabbing#Stabbing Odds|Stabbing]] article for more details)\n* Cannot make [[attacks of opportunity]].\n* May fall into [[deep water]] or [[lava]], instantly killing them.\n* May attack themselves on accident.\n\n==Sources==\nConfusion can be inflicted by:\n\n'''Sources that the player can inflict:'''\n*[[Confusing Touch]] (blocked by [[willpower]])\n*[[Cloud#Noxious fumes|Noxious fumes]], from [[Mephitic Cloud]], a [[condenser vane]], or monster's [[Noxious Cloud]] (blocked by [[poison resistance]])\n*[[Alistair's Intoxication]] (blocked by poison immunity)\n*[[Atropa]] darts (blocked by monster [[HD]] and poison resistance)\n*[[Chaos]] weapons (2.7%) and [[chaotic]] effects (2.8%)\n*[[Uskayaw]]'s Line Pass\n*[[Xom]], who ignores [[clarity]]\n\n'''Sources that only monsters can inflict'''\n*The [[Confuse]] spell and [[Mass Confusion]] (blocked by [[willpower]])\n*The Confuse [[attack flavour]] confuses on melee attacks.\n**If it is considered a [[attack type|\"spore\" attack]] ([[wandering mushroom]]s, [[deathcap]]s, players in [[Fungus Form]]), it is blocked by [[unbreathing]].\n**Attacks from [[tarantella]]s and [[Norris]] don't have a special resistance.\n*[[Ballistomycete spore]]s can confuse valid victims on explosion (blocked by [[unbreathing]])\n\n'''Sources that can only confuse the player:'''\n*Drinking a [[potion of ambrosia]]; also greatly increases HP and MP regeneration while the confusion lasts.\n*Players hit by a [[wand of charming]] or [[wand of light]], in place of their usual effects.\n*\"Overwhelming\" [[divine retribution]] from any god, which has a 20% chance of occurring.\n\n==Dealing with Confusion==\nWays to remove confusion include:\n*[[Potion of curing]].\n*[[Elyvilon]]'s Purification ability.\n*[[Ru]]'s Draw Out Power ability.\n\n===Immunity===\nThe following prevent most/all sources of confusion directly:\n*[[Clarity]] gives immunity to all sources of confusion (except [[ambrosia]] or [[Xom]]).\n*[[Zin]]'s Vitalisation ability.\n*The [[obsidian axe]] ends confusion while you are mesmerized.\n\nThese are the only ways to defend from [[tarantella]]'s and [[Norris]]' confusion attacks.\n\n==Strategy==\nAvoid confusing creatures that may carry useful items near lava or deep water. Great items or [[artifact]]s that they carry may otherwise be lost forever.\n\n[[Mummies]] should be particularly careful about becoming confused at the wrong time, as they lack access to most methods for removing it at will.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.23]], confused monsters didn't have a 33% chance to move normally.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], confusion had its [[wands of confusion|own specialized wand type]].\n*Prior to [[0.20]], it was possible to use wands while confused, though doing so would zap it in a random direction.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], randart equipment could grant confusion if it spawned with [[Randart#Properties|{*confuse}]] ego.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Mass Confusion was a spell available to all players.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], cleaving attacks didn't function under confusion. [[Gell's Gravitas]] was able to cause confusion, and all high-intelligence monsters were immune to drowning while confused.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], confusion also came in the form of [[potions of confusion]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]\n[[Category:Threats]]"}

{"title":"Electrocution","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Electrocution","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|It sometimes electrocutes victims (1/4 chance, 8-20 damage).}}\nThe '''electrocution''' [[brand]] does the following:\n*Has a 25% chance per hit to inflict <code>7 + 1d13</code> [[electricity]] damage per hit, regardless of damage from the weapon itself. Electricity resistant monsters do not take any extra damage. (Average 3.5 damage per swing)\n\n==Strategy==\nElectrocution deals a flat rate of damage, independent of your actual weapon damage. Therefore, it works best on fast, low [[mindelay]] weapons (such as [[Short Blades]], [[whip]]s, and [[spear]]s); dealing 3.5 damage every 0.5 turn is better than 3.5 damage every 0.7 turn. This brand isn't terrible for \"heavy\" weapon types, either. On a +9 [[broad axe]], for instance, it's overall slightly worse than [[flaming]] and [[freezing]]. As a bonus, few enemies resist electricity until you get to [[Zot]] and [[extended]].\n\nElectrocution's damage is completely independent from [[AC]]. This brand tends to be favored on fast weapons, though; the weapons themselves are reduced more by AC.\n\n===Comparisons===\n*[[Distortion]] is a flat effect which deals more damage (on average) and has no resistance. However, unless you worship [[Lugonu]], unwielding a distortion weapon isn't safe. Minor negatives: you can [[banish]] monsters with desirable gear, or [[blink]] them away from you.\n*The [[pain brand]] starts to outdamage electrocution when you have more than 7 [[Necromancy]] skill. However, pain is resisted by more monsters than electrocution.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], electrocution had a 33% chance of activating.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], this brand did 10-24 damage instead of 8-20.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], discharges of electricity would occur when hitting monsters in water, damaging multiple targets nearby (including the player character).\n*Prior to [[0.13]], this brand had no effect on flying monsters, considerably limiting its utility in certain branches.\n\n{{brands}}\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

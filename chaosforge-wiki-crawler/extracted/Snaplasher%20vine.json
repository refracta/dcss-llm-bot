{"title":"Snaplasher vine","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Snaplasher_vine","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For a list of plant monsters, see [[List of plants]]. For a list of tentacles, see [[List of tentacles]].''\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Snaplasher vines''' are animated plants created by a [[dryad]]'s [[Awaken Vines]] spell. These [[list of tentacles|tentacle]]-like vines emerge from nearby [[tree]] tiles, dragging and [[constrict]]ing victims in range. Up to three sets of snaplasher vines can be summoned by a dryad at once.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you need to get vines out of your way, attack the dryad - this will cause the dryad and all the vines to vanish.\n*If you face hostile vines, avoid [[tab]]bing; you'll usually wind up chopping at the vines rather than the dryad.\n\n==History==\n*Snaplasher vines were originally intended for use in the [[Enchanted Forest]]. When that [[branch]] failed to be released in any stable version of ''Crawl'', they were still added to the game's code in [[0.13]], but could only be encountered in-game as of [[0.14]] (when you [[Summon Forest|summon a dryad]])."}

Opening it might set loose a friendly mutant beast: bizarre creatures, each with their own combination of traits. Increased skill with Evocations will allow stronger beasts to be released.\n<br/>\nThere are six known traits:\n*Bat beasts fly and move very quickly, but erratically.\n*Fire beasts resist and breathe fire.\n*Ox beasts resist cold, are armoured with thick fur, and can knock back foes.\n*Shock beasts resist electricity and can transform into living lightning.\n*Sting beasts resist poison and have a reaching poison-tail attack.\n*Weird beasts can see invisible and attack with constricting tentacles.\n<br/>\nAs far as anyone knows, all beasts have exactly two of these traits.}}\n\nA '''box of beasts''' is a [[evocable items|miscellaneous magic item]] which can summon an irregular, albeit friendly, monster, classified generally as a mutant beast.\n\nThe box of beasts becomes empty after one use; it can be recharged by gaining experience. Like with other miscellaneous evocables, only 1 box of beasts will spawn in a given game.\n\n==Mutant Beast==\nA mutant beast usually combines two random traits/facets: \n*Bat: [[flying]], [[fast]], [[batty]]. \n*Sting: [[Reaching|reach]]/[[poison|poison]], rPois. \n*Fire: [[Fire Breath|fire breath]], rF. \n*Weird: [[constrict]], [[See invisible|sInv]]. \n*Shock: rElec, [[blinkbolt]]. \n*Ox: [[trample]], rC, +5 AC.\n\nEach beast also has one of five tiers, corresponding to HD and melee attack damage. \n*Larval (HD 3) (12 damage)\n*Juvenile (HD 9) (19 damage)\n*Mature (HD 15) (26 damage)\n*Elder (HD 21) (33 damage)\n*Primal (HD 27) (40 damage)\n\n[[HD]] of mutant beasts is roughly <code>(Evocations skill + 1d7 - 1d7)</code>, rounded up to the nearest tier & capped at 27.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], boxes of beasts had a 1/3 chance to fall apart after every use and didn't recharge with XP.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], boxes of beasts didn't stack.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], a box of beasts would instead summon a [[chimera]].\n*In [[0.16]], box of beasts became considerably stronger than before. \n*Prior to [[0.13]] this item summoned individual (non-chimera) monsters.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], it appeared as a '''small ebony casket''' while unidentified.\n\n{{Evocables}}"}

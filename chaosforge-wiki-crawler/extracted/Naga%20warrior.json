{"title":"Naga warrior","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Naga_warrior","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | nagas}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Naga warriors''' are stronger, beefier, and better equipped than ordinary [[naga (monster)|nagas]]. They deal significant damage in melee, and can boost the melee damage of other nagas and salamanders nearby. You can find them throughout the [[Snake Pit]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Naga warriors are strong, high HP brutes. Try to soften or kill them at range. If things get sketchy, remember that all nagas move slowly - you can walk away. Also remember that nagas [[constrict]], which prevents movement.\n*Much like [[orc knight]]s, their Battlecry greatly amplifies the melee damage of all other nagas and salamanders in the area. Take care not to fight more foes than you can manage.\n*Naga warriors often carry [[kite shield]]s and [[tower shield]]s. If you're looking for a shield, you may want to investigate the first floor of the Snake Pit.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], naga warriors dealt 32 base damage in melee, and had a bit more HP.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], naga warriors had 25% more HP.\n*In [[0.28]], naga warriors were made more likely to get a \"[[good item]]\" shield.\n*In [[0.27]], naga warriors got increased damage (28 -> 32) and [[Battlecry]]. Also, monster weapon penalties were removed, so all monsters attack faster with weapons.\n\n[[Category:Naga]]"}

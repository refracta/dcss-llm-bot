They are not terribly dangerous, especially since you can simply walk away from battle with them if you feel threatened; likewise, they'll retreat underwater when near-death. They can be found in any area where water exists, except for the first few floors of the [[Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*A weapon of [[venom]] or other means of [[poison]]ing them lets you kill them even if they try to flee, though you'll likely lose the body in [[deep water]].\n*Try not to fight them while standing in the water yourself; this will reduce your combat performance for most playable [[species]]. Fight from the shore, and use corners to only fight one fish at a time.\n*If you plan to be traveling up and down the length of the dungeon a lot, consider leaving any big fish you see alive. They make handy snacks for when you've already killed and eaten everything else on a floor.\n\n==History==\nBig fish were removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

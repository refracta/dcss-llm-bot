{"title":"Gargoyle","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Gargoyle","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''This page refers to the player [[species]]. For the monster, see [[Gargoyle (monster)]]. For a list of all monstrous gargoyles, see [[List of gargoyles]].''\n{{flavour|A cross between ordinary stone gargoyles and living beings, Gargoyles are hideous humanoids with an affinity to rock. They have low health, but large amounts of innate armour which increases further as they gain levels. They eventually gain the ability to fly continuously.\n\nGargoyles' partially living form grants them immunity to poison, as well as resistance to electricity, and protection from some effects of necromancy. Their natural armour makes them strong melee fighters, and they are naturally skilled with blunt weapons and in unarmed combat. They can also be exceptional earth-based conjurers.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*Gargoyles are composed of [[nonliving]] stone, rather than flesh:\n**'''[[Poison|Poison immunity]]:''' Gargoyles are immune to poison.\n**'''[[Electricity resistance]]:''' Gargoyles are well insulated and take little damage from [[electricity]] attacks. Note that multiple sources of rElec do ''not'' stack.\n**'''[[Negative_energy#Negative_Energy_Resistance|Life Protection 1]]:''' Gargoyles have one innate level of resistance against negative energy (rN+).\n**'''Partial [[torment]] resistance:''' Gargoyles take 1/2 normal damage when affected by [[torment]]. This resistance ''does'' stack with other effects that reduce damage of torment.\n**'''[[Petrification]] resistance:''' Gargoyles cannot be [[petrified]].\n**'''[[Unbreathing]]:''' Gargoyles can survive without breathing.\n**Gargoyles cannot be put to [[sleep]] and do not have [[blood]].\n**Gargoyles are vulnerable to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] and [[Shatter]].\n**Gargoyles cannot enter [[Statue Form]], as they are already made of stone.\n*'''Natural [[AC]]:''' Gargoyles receive a large innate boost to AC, which increases with XL.\n\n===AC Bonuses===\nThe AC bonus begins at +2.4 at XL 1. From XL 2-7, it increases by +0.4 AC per XL. From thereafter, it increases by 0.8 per XL, reaching a maximum of +20 at XL 27.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|player.cc|6054}}</ref> This bonus is then rounded down. See below for a table:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Level || AC || Level || AC || Level || AC\n|-\n| 1 || +2 || 10 || +7 || 19 || +14\n|-\n| 2 || +2 || 11 || +8 || 20 || +15\n|-\n| 3 || +3 || 12 || +8 || 21 || +16\n|-\n| 4 || +3 || 13 || +9 || 22 || +16\n|-\n| 5 || +4 || 14 || +10 || 23 || +17\n|-\n| 6 || +4 || 15 || +11 || 24 || +18\n|-\n| 7 || +4 || 16 || +12 || 25 || +19\n|-\n| 8 || +5 || 17 || +12 || 26 || +20\n|-\n| 9 || +6 || 18 || +13 || 27 || +20\n|-\n|}\n\nGargoyles have a base [[Strength]] of 11, [[Intelligence]] of 8 and [[Dexterity]] of 5 (before Background modifiers).\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\nGargoyles are recommended for the following backgrounds: \n*'''Warriors:''' [[Fighter]], [[Gladiator]], [[Monk]]\n*'''Zealots:''' [[Berserker]]\n*'''Warior-mages:''' [[Reaver]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Fire Elementalist]], [[Earth Elementalist]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[strength]] or [[intelligence]] (equal chance) every 4th level.\n*20% less HP than average.\n*Average MP.\n*+3 [[willpower]] per level.\n*Gargoyles gain [[Big Wings]] at level 14, granting them permanent [[flight]].\n\n==Starting Skills and Equipment==\nGargoyles receive the skills and equipment listed for their background. \n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Beginner}}\n\nWhile Gargoyles may have low HP (-20%), this is compensated by many strong traits. Most notably, Gargoyles have high innate [[AC]], which usually makes up for the lack of health. Beyond armour, Gargoyles have a variety of innate resistances, which range from \"mildly convenient\" to \"very helpful\". \n\nPoison immunity turns early [[adder]]s, [[kobold]]s with [[dart]]s, and many critters from [[the Lair]] into non-threats. It also makes Lair's branches ([[Spider's Nest|Spider]], [[Snake Pit|Snake]], [[Swamp]]) easier to manage. As stone creatures, they are immune to a variety of \"gimmicks\", like [[basilisk]]'s petrification and [[dream sheep]]'s sleep. Also, Gargoyles are one of the strongest species to take on the [[extended game]]. Torment resistance is rarely helpful in a 3-rune game, but it shines in the [[Pandemonium]], [[Hell]]s, and [[Tomb]]. \n\nHowever, AC doesn't protect against everything. [[Smiting]] is a lethal threat in the early game. Later on, Gargoyles have to deal with [[damnation]], as well as certain [[attack flavour]]s (such as [[simulacra]]). In addition, they must be cautious around foes with [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] (which include [[deep troll earth mage]]s and [[Jorgrun]]) or [[Shatter]].\n\nOtherwise, their aptitudes are fairly well balanced. Gargoyles do well in a variety of backgrounds and subsequent development strategies.\n\n==Strategy==\nAlthough it may seem tempting to raise your AC as high as possible, realize that [[ev]]asion is also tremendously useful, even with a Gargoyle's unimpressive [[Dodging]] aptitude. With a Gargoyle's large boost to AC regardless of armour, a suit of light or medium armour can still provide excellent defenses without penalizing your spellcasting or evasion nearly as much as heavier armour would.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Gargoyle}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Gargoyles could not worship [[Yredelemnul]]. [[Flight]] was an activatable ability that could be ended and restarted. And prior to simplification of [[GDR]] in this version, Gargoyles had a special-case bonus to it, displayed [[Gargoyle/GDR|here]].\n*Prior to its removal in [[0.26]], gargoyles were immune to [[rot]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Gargoyles could cast [[Statue Form]], though they received four less AC than other species when doing so.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the skill aptitudes of [[Maces & Flails]], [[Unarmed Combat]], and [[Staves]] were +1.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Gargoyles had [[Fangs]] 1, [[Talons]] 1 and [[Slow Metabolism]] 1. Gargoyles got slightly less (only 5/6ths) of the GDR from their body armour, but this was more than compensated for by a large innate bonus (+24% GDR). This innate bonus was suppressed when they were transformed, except for Statue Form, in which Gargoyles had a total of 62% GDR.\n*Gargoyles were added in [[0.13]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{species}}"}

{"title":"Enfeeble","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Enfeeble","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Enfeeble''' is a Level 7 [[Hexes]] spell that always applies the [[weak]]ness and [[antimagic]] statuses to the targeted foe. In addition, succeeding on a [[willpower]] check will [[daze]] and [[blind]] the target. \n\nAll statuses from this spell have a duration of <code>5 + [[spellpower]]/20</code> turns (min. 5 turns). This is especially important for the antimagic status, which is more powerful the longer it has left. Unlike other most effects, casting Enfeeble again won't stack the duration, it only resets it.\n\nFor the daze and blind effect, Enfeeble has an [[enchantment power]] multiplier of x4,<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|zap-data.h|1767}}</ref> which makes it significantly harder to resist than most other Hexes. See the [[Willpower#Resisting enchantments|Willpower]] article for more details.\n\n==Strategy==\nUnlike most Hexes, Enfeeble inflicts an irresistible status. While not the greatest killing tool on its own, it can be good spell for Hexes specialists in the later end of the game. Even if you plan to switch away from Hexes, it can be used to disable monsters.\n\n*Antimagic is a strong status on anything that [[Spell slot flags|casts spells susceptible to it]], including [[silence]]-immune enemies like [[demon]]s. Creatures with only natural or priestly abilities are unaffected, however.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], Enfeeble was added.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

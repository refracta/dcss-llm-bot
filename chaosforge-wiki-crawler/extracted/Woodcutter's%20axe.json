The unchanging rhythm of its work has settled on it with the force of natural law, and no amount of force or skill can make it swing faster or slower.}}\n[[File:woodcutter's axe.png]] '''''the +5 woodcutter's axe'''''\n\n+5 [[battleaxe]]\n<br>Always swings at 10 [[aut]]s, regardless of any other factors (such as [[Haste]], [[Slow]] or weapon skill).\n\n==Desirability==\nAs a +5 battleaxe, the '''woodcutter's axe'''<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|art-data.txt|1625}}</ref> is already a respectable weapon in the early game. Combine that with the fact that it can be swung at normal speed with no Axes skill at all, and any early character will find it a worthy weapon indeed.\n\nHowever, as you invest in your weapon skills, you will find that other weapons begin to outspeed and out-damage a weakly enchanted battleaxe. Even if you decide to specialise in Axes, you'll eventually want to upgrade to a [[broad axe]] or regular battleaxe when you have the chance.\n\nStill, guaranteeing that no regular-speed monster can hit you twice per swing remains quite useful for a long time. Characters who do not plan to invest in a weapon will appreciate having a solid backup melee option, though it does get in way of a [[shield]].\n\nThis artefact is more likely to spawn in the early game, where it is more likely to be useful.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the woodcutter's axe was a +3 [[vorpal]] [[battleaxe]].\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the woodcutter's axe was a +8 vorpal [[war axe]].\n*The woodcutter's axe was added in [[0.28]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Axes]]"}

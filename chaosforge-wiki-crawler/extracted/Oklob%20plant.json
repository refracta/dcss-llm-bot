{"title":"Oklob plant","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Oklob_plant","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | plants}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Oklob plants''' are vicious plants that spit [[acid]] at you from a distance. Not only will this take a large chunk out of your health, but it can also [[Acid#Corrosion|corrode]] you. Fortunately, oklob plants do not move and cannot pursue you if you flee. They are most often found in [[the Lair]], but they can appear in various [[vault]]s elsewhere.\n\nIn addition to turning all existing oklob plants neutral, worshipers of [[Fedhas Madash]] may use Grow Oklob ability to summon an allied oklob plant that will spit acid more often and will be summoned for longer with increasing [[Invocations]]. Another Fedhas' ability, Overgrow, sometimes produces oklobs or [[oklob sapling]]s when turning dungeon walls into allied plants.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Like most things in ''Crawl'', if you aren't prepared to deal with them, you can usually stay away, and fight them later. It's rare for oklobs to be guarding something vital, and even then, you can go to Dungeon or Orc.\n:The game automatically travel-excludes tiles in range of an oklob, so it's hard to get hurt unless you're actively taking them on.\n*Hostile oklobs won't fire past regular [[plant]]s. Many oklob vaults will spawn them behind a wall of plants, allowing you to use [[smite-targeted]] or [[piercing]] attacks ([[javelin]]s, [[Fulminant Prism]], [[Airstrike]]...) to take them out. (Like with all enemies, oklobs ''can'' fire past [[bush]]es, though.)\n:The exclusion zone won't take into account any plants in the way, so it can be tricky to determine their \"real\" line of fire.\n*If you absolutely need to destroy a group of oklob plants, it's best done slowly and carefully. It can't go anywhere, so there's no need to hurry. It's often best to clear the rest of the floor before taking it on; fighting something while heavily corroded isn't a good idea.\n**Ranged attackers should fight at the edge of [[line of sight]]. If things get too hairy, you can go out of sight, allowing you to regenerate. This can be combined with an [[amulet of regeneration]] to eventually take it out. Don't let multiple oklobs fire you at once, since 2+ acid bolts can kill most characters in Lair.\n**[[Summon]]s can waylay an oklob plant while you hang back. Command them to attack it using the 't' key, though you must keep the plant in your line of sight (preferably from behind a plant or summoned meatshield).\n**You can use [[invisible|invisibility]] to avoid attracting their attention or to allow you sneak up on them. This significantly reduces their ability to hit you with acid, but they do still occasionally get lucky.\n**Oklobs don't have much [[willpower]], so [[Hexes]] or hex [[wand]]s can easily disable a plant. A [[wand of polymorph]] can create [[thorn hunter]]s and [[shambling mangrove]]s, so it might not be wise to polymorph.\n*For Fedhas worshippers, oklobs are powerful allies. The [[corrosion]] status is very useful; inflicting -8 AC is a strong effect in practice. The oklobs themselves deal good damage, too. Plants under Fedhas can fire through each other.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Spit Acid had 3d7 base damage, but dealt an extra \"acid splash\" (4d5 damage on players, 2d4 damage on monsters). Also, oklobs created by [[Fedhas]] fired more often."}

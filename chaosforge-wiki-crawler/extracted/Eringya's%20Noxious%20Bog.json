All valid floor tiles within a 4-tile radius are converted into toxic sludge. This spell requires open space; tiles that are next to more than one solid feature (like walls, trees, statues) are not converted. [[Deep water]] and [[lava]] are unaffected. However, it ''does'' cover non-solid features such as stairs, escape hatches, shops, and traps, preventing them from being used.\n\nThe sludge acts like [[shallow water]], but it will damage and poison non-flying creatures. The bog itself deals <code>4d6</code> damage (70% poison, 30% physical).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-damage.cc|4139}}</ref> If the bog dealt any damage, it ''additionally'' causes an extreme amount of poison to non-immune monsters. It deals 4 \"[[Poison#Monster Formula|stacks]]\" of poison (the maximum) to monsters without poison resistance, and 2 \"stacks\" (half-max) to monsters with poison resistance.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-damage.cc|4158}}<br>The poison function deals <code>1 + (<X>/7)</code> stacks of poison (see {{source ref|0.30.0|monster.cc|3985}}). For normal monsters, 1 + (21/7) = 4 stacks, for rPois, 1 + (7/7) = 2 stacks.</ref> Resistance doesn't reduce chance of being poisoned, just the amount of poison. Bog damage and poison are not impacted by spell power.\n\n[[Flying]] creatures are completely immune to the bog. The caster is immune to the damage, but still gets the penalties (if any) from being in shallow water.\n\nCasting [[Ignite Poison]] will create short-lived [[Cloud#Flame|flame clouds]] above some bog tiles (33% chance per tile). These in turn will create clouds of steam.\n\nThe bog status lasts for <code>3 + 1d(2 + pow/10)</code> turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-damage.cc|4474}}</ref> If you leave line of sight of a bog, it reverts back to regular tile. If you leave the level, the bog status ends immediately. This spell cannot be recast while active.\n\n==Strategy==\nEringya's Noxious Bog is a level 6 spell that does not work outside open areas, blocks staircases, has a range of 4, does nothing against flying or poison-immune opponents, and penalizes ''you'' if you can't fly/swim. But, even with all these limitations, this spell can be worthwhile due to its strength.\n\nIt combos ''incredibly'' well with [[Ignite Poison]]. With Bog active, Ignite Poison is strong and MP-efficient; anything without immunity to poison/fire will take massive damage every turn. Against non-resistant monsters, Ignite Poison does 8d14+ damage per cast, ignoring both AC and EV, plus the damage from the bog and clouds. Poison resistance reduces the poison by half; either 2 turns for full damage, or 1 turn for half damage. Even monsters with both rPois and rF+, such as [[tentacled monstrosities]], will end up dying to 2-4 casts.\n\nOverall, it's definitely not a spell that can be used to kill everything. Instead, it's best thought of as a \"side\" spell - use it to deal with non-fying, non-poison immune enemies in an efficient manner. Also, without Ignite Poison, it becomes a lot weaker, but still alright.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*While you are slowed by the bog's water, any non-flying non-swimming non-large monsters are penalized in the same way. The bog will make it harder to escape from ranged attackers, but it is not as bad as it initially seems. If all else, a [[potion of flight]] works.\n*As the bog covers traps, you can use this spell to prevent enemies from stepping on unfortunately-placed traps. However, you won't be able to use it to bypass traps in narrow corridors (such as the entrance to [[Zot:5]]'s orb chamber).\n*The bog counts as shallow water, meaning other sorts of fire attacks can be used to create [[LOS]]-blocking [[steam]].\n*Note that the bog doesn't deal damage on the turn it's created.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis spell refers to a mage called Eringya; it is the first reference to them in-game since the removal of the spell [[Eringya's Surprising Bouquet]] and the [[wizlab]] level [[Eringya's Formal Garden]] (which has now been re-introduced).\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|the spell will have less strict placement restrictions, allowing placing a bog on tiles next to 2 solid features.}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Eringya's Noxious Bog was a dual-school, level 6 [[Poison Magic]]/[[Transmutations]] spell.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Eringya's Noxious Bog did not place a bog under the caster, as they were not immune. It also did not place a bog in tiles next to ''any'' solid features.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Eringya's Noxious Bog would cause the caster to leave toxic bog tiles behind them as they traveled. Additionally, [[Ignite Poison]] always created flame clouds over bog tiles and for a much greater duration.\n*Eringya's Noxious Bog was added in [[0.25]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

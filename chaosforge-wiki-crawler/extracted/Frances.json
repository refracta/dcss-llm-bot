{"title":"Frances","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Frances","type":"raw","data":"{{version|027}}\n\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Frances the Duchess of Pandemonium''' is a [[unique]] [[human (monster)|human]] with [[demon]]ic powers. In addition to hitting you hard with dangerous [[conjurations]], she can also summon demonic aid.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:12-14\n*[[Elven Halls]]:1\n*[[The Swamp]]:1-2\n*[[The Snake Pit]]:1-2\n*[[The Shoals]]:1-2\n*The [[Spider's Nest]]:1-2\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Once she's managed to summon a few demons, the fight will become significantly more dangerous. Consider [[teleport]]ing away if you can't take her down before she calls in reinforcements. Come back later once her demons have timed out, buffed and ready to defeat her quickly.\n*Summoners might try attempting to swarm her with various different summons (to get around the caps): her conjurations are both single target and require a clear line of fire, meaning she won't be able to hit you or kill your summons too quickly. However, she can abjure summons, so using spells that create single, powerful creatures (like [[Summon Hydra]]) will probably result in you wasting MP.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.18]], she got a fifth spellslot which contained the (now obsolete) [[Abjuration]] spell.\n*Her spellset was changed in [[0.12]], making her much more dangerous.\n*Frances was added to the game in [[0.6]].\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

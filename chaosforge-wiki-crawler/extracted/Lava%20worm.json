Unable to leave their [[lava]], they are rarely a threat as you can simply walk away from them if you wish. Their extra fire damage can add up, and may destroy your [[scroll]]s. They can appear anywhere with lava except for the first few floors of [[the Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nLava worms can't leave their molten habitat and aren't worth much XP compared to other things you'll probably be seeing by the time you find them, so feel free to avoid them if you wish. If the dungeon layout forces you into melee range, they're not difficult to kill, especially if you have cold damage. Just drop your more valuable scrolls beforehand.\n\n==History==\nLava worms were removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

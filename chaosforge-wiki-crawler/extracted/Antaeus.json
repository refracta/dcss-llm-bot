{"title":"Antaeus","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Antaeus","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{list of | giants}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Antaeus''' is a [[list of giants|gigantic]] [[demon]] lord who guards the icy [[rune]] in [[Cocytus]]. He has the highest [[HP]] of all normal monsters in the game, overpowering melee attacks, and threatening [[cold]] and [[Electricity|lightning]] magic. But unlike other demon lords, he cannot [[summon]] demonic aid. He is found on the bottom floor of [[Cocytus]], usually accompanied by a gang of [[Ice Fiend]]s.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Having rC+++ and rElec will take a lot of the lethality out of this fight. \n*Antaeus is vulnerable to fire and lacks poison resistance. [[Curare]] darts are ''very'' effective, allowing you to get a \"haste\" of sorts in Cocytus. [[Alistair's Intoxication]] can [[confuse]] Antaeus, even through infinite willpower.\n*Try to clear out his Ice Fiend allies before attempting to kill him. While [[Fire Storm]] casters can quickly accomplish both at the same time, others may want to initially flee and then take them on once they've scattered throughout the floor. Taking on that many sources of [[torment]] and high damage all at once is very unwise.\n*It's not impossible to defeat him in melee, but it's certainly risky. High [[AC]] is critical, but good [[EV]] and [[SH]] are just as important. Buff yourself as much as possible, call up whatever summons you can, and make sure you've got rC+++ and rElec; you want to avoid as many of his hits as possible, and to take most of the sting out of any that get through.\n\n==Trivia==\nIn Greek myth, Antaeus was a tireless giant who drew strength from the earth. Heracles defeated him by holding him aloft, robbing him of his powers. Forcing Antaeus to fly with [[Polar Vortex]] is a very thematically suitable way of defeating him, but does not affect him any differently than it does any other enemy. (Plus, he resists the cold-themed damage of Polar Vortex.)\n\nIn Dante's ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante) Inferno]'', Antaeus is found in the last circle of Hell, a frozen lake known as (surprise) Cocytus. The only unfettered giant, he agrees to help Virgil and Dante down into Cocytus; in exchange, Virgil promises that Dante, still living, will increase Antaeus' fame in the mortal world. Whether Dante ever fulfills this promise (or the many other similar promises he makes) is not revealed, although one might argue he did in fact fulfill it by writing of his travels through Hell.\n\nDespite his description in-game, Antaeus was not in fact a titan, but simply a giant who was born of Poseidon and Rhea.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], Antaeus' realm, Cocytus, now prevents drinking [[potion]]s. This has obvious effects on the fight itself.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Antaeus knew [[Bolt of Cold]] instead of Flash Freeze.\n\n[[File:Santaeus.png]]\n\nDuring the Christmas holiday of 2014 and 2015, Antaeus' home was changed from Cocytus to the [[North Pole]], and he donned a festive hat, fur-lined loincloth, and sack full of (presumably) toys to celebrate. This had no effect on gameplay whatsoever."}

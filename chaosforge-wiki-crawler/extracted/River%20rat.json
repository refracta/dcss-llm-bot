{"title":"River rat","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/River_rat","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|rodents}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''River rats''' are slightly tougher than regular [[rat]] but still pretty weak. They can be found in small numbers in the [[Sewer]], and in large swarms throughout the [[Lair]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nThey tend to come in packs, but since they have no resistances, standard crowd control tactics will work. Although individually harmless, a swarm of them surrounding a character with low defenses may find themselves getting nibbled to death faster than they can eradicate the pests. Try not to fight them in or around water, as they can swim through it normally and suffer no penalties while attacking in it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to 0.31, river rats didn't [[shout|squeak]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], river rats were known as green rats."}

Unlike most amulets, rings take effect immediately, so you can quickly switch between them at need. \n\nRings of evasion are more effective, on average, than a [[ring of protection]]. However, [[AC]] is more ''reliable'' than EV; with evasion, you either dodge or you don't. If you already have high AC, then a ring of evasion can be a good defensive choice (AC has a somewhat diminishing return, since it can't reduce attacks below 0)\n\nA [[ring of dexterity]] can end up providing more EV for characters with high [[Dodging]] skill (among dexterity's [[dexterity|other benefits]]).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], rings of evasion gave only +4 evasion.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], you could find rings of evasion with a -4 enchantment; such rings were always [[curse]]d.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], enchantments were random values between 1 and 6 (positive and negative).\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

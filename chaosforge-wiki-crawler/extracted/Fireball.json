This explosion can hit monsters outside your [[line of sight]].\n\n==Strategy==\nFireball is a good midgame attack spell. While it does less damage than [[Starburst]], Fireball always hits, can be fired an an angle, and has a lower spell level (thus, a lower MP cost). Since this spell ignores EV, it is great against annoying, hard-to-hit foes, like [[List of spriggans|spriggans]] or [[killer bee]]s.\n\nIf you learn the quirks of monster movement, you can potentially hit 8 monsters at a time with a single fireball. If your defenses are up to scratch, you may even want to take a hit or two to maximize your damage output, or to avoid running out of MP midfight.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n* Fireball's explosion can hit from a tile outside [[line of sight]]. While Fireball can't reach past the usual sight radius (even with [[Vehumet]] support), it can be used to hit targets around corners, or through [[fog]].\n* Firing it at an opponent in melee range can be dangerous. Try to aim at a tile behind the foe you're engaged with, or the fireball will hit you. \n: When fighting a single foe, aiming at a tile ''diagonal and behind'' the opponent will prevent you from being hit.

It could be learned for only two spell levels if you had already learned regular Fireball. The spell had the same mechanics as regular Fireball, but could be stored for later use."}

{"title":"Ring of slaying","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ring_of_slaying","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{item\n |itemtype = Jewellery\n |name = Ring of slaying\n}}\n{{flavour|A ring that increases the wearer's accuracy and damage with ranged weapons and melee attacks.}}\n\nA '''+4 ring of slaying''' increases the [[accuracy]] and [[damage]] of your melee (including unarmed), ranged, and auxiliary attacks. Its boost is equivalent to 4 levels of weapon [[enchant]]ment.\n\nA functionally identical effect occasionally appears on [[artefact]] jewellery and armour, denoted as \"Slay Â±X\" (not limited to 4).\n\n==Desirability==\nFairly high. More damage and accuracy means you can kill enemies faster, which means less exposure to their attacks. Since each attack gets the same +4 bonus, fast weapons (like [[Short Blades]]) get the most benefit out of slaying. Slaying also works well if your character has multiple [[auxiliary attack]]s, since each aux attack gets its own slay bonus.\n\nWhen judging artefacts with slaying, keep things in perspective. Having +1 slaying is virtually useless, while negative slaying is obviously negative. Unless the slaying is particularly high (or low), the other qualities of an artefact are more important.\n\n===Comparison to Stats===\nFor the sole purpose of weapon damage, 1 [[strength]] (or [[dexterity]]) equals <code>0.025 * <weapon base dmg> * [[Weapon damage#Damage formula|skill multipliers]]></code> slaying. For example, when <code>(<base dmg> * <skill multi>) = 40</code>, then 1 str/dex = 1 slaying. Therefore, +6 strength = +4 slaying at 26.7 (<base dmg> * <skill multi>). The higher the base damage, the better strength becomes for weapon damage.\n\nNote that each stat has its other bonuses: strength reduces [[encumbrance]] of armour and shields, dexterity increases [[EV]] and [[SH]] (among other things), and slaying increases accuracy. Slaying can be stronger if you have good [[auxiliary attack]]s, since aux attacks have low damage overall.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], you could find rings of slaying with a -4 enchantment; such rings were always [[curse]]d.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], rings of slaying were randomly generated between 1 and 6 (positive and negative).\n*Before the weapon enchantment merge in [[0.15]], rings of slaying had two distinct bonuses--one for accuracy, and one for damage.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], slaying was more powerful, as it was included before the weapon skill multiplier. \n\n{{jewellery}}"}

{"title":"Steelbarb worm","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Steelbarb_worm","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | worms}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Steelbarb worms''' are swift-moving annelids found in the [[Spider's Nest]]. They can inflict the [[Barbs]] status effect on melee hit, which hurts you if you try to move.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Barbs are less threatening when you consider that nearly every resident of the Spider's Nest is faster than you. You should be positioning well ''before'' you get hit in melee. It can still be annoying, especially if you're trying to escape at low HP.\n*Steelbarb worms are not vulnerable to [[poison]], but they aren't resistant to it either. Most poison attacks will work well on a steelbarb worm.\n**Note that these worms are resistant to fire, so the combo of [[Poison Magic]] spells and [[Ignite Poison]] is not very effective against them.\n*Steelbarb worms have exceptionally poor [[willpower]]. Any sort of disabling [[Hex]] or [[wand]] will be highly effective against them.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], steelbarb worms had fast regeneration.\n*Steelbarb worms were added in [[0.28]]."}

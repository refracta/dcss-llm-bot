{"title":"Attacks of opportunity","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Attacks_of_opportunity","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{crawlquote|When you move away from an enemy, they have a small (1/3) chance of taking advantage and launching a free attack. Repositioning and retreating is often still good, but keep an eye out for those extra attacks.}}\n\n'''Attacks of opportunity''' ('''AOO''', '''AOOp''') can trigger whenever you move away from an enemy in melee.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhenever you move away from an enemy's melee attack range, and the monster would pursue, it has a 33% chance to trigger an attack of opportunity. This allows it to move and attack simultaneously. They can only occur if a monster would choose to pursue. Enemies with [[reaching]] attacks can make attacks of opportunity from 2 tiles away. Even if you are faster than the opponent, attacks of opportunity can still be made.\n\nThe time spent for this combined move is a single monster turn, but with a 50% chance for it to lose an extra 10% of a turn. If a monster attacks slower than it moves, or moves slower than the attacks, it takes time equal to the slower of the two actions.\n\nNote that [[random energy]] does not apply whenever an attack of opportunity happens. However, if a monster would be eligible for an attack, but doesn't actually get one, random energy will apply.\n\n===Avoiding===\nThe following conditions will prevent attacks of opportunity entirely:\n*If a monster would choose not to move or melee attack, it won't make attacks of opportunity. For example, a [[centaur (monster)|centaur]] will prefer to use its bow over a weak melee attack. \n*Monsters who cannot move or melee attack will not perform attacks of opportunity, so the following statuses stop them entirely:\n**Incapacitation: [[Asleep]], [[paralysed]], [[petrified]], or [[confused]]\n**Cannot move: [[Constrict]]ed, caught in a [[web]]/[[net]]\n**Cannot attack: [[Fear|Fleeing]]\n**Cannot see you: you are [[invisible]] to the attacker or the attacker is [[blind]]ed\n*If you swap places with an [[ally]], so that the ally blocks the monster's movement, you avoid an attack of opportunity. \n*[[Zin]]'s Sanctuary prevents all attacks. This protection is retroactive - if you were previously outside the area and moved inside, the Sanctuary still protects you.\n*You become immune to attacks of opportunity while performing [[Wu Jian|martial attacks]], [[rampaging]], or Serpent's Lash.\n*[[Translocation]]s don't count as movement, so you can use them safely.\n\nBeing faster than the monster can help you escape from a melee monster, but attacks of opportunity can still occur. For example, against a 100% speed monster, a [[haste]]d player can take at most 2 attacks of opportunity before escaping melee range.\n\n==Strategy==\nWatch out! When retreating, a 100% speed enemy with AOO gets more attacks than an [[adder]] would without AOO. Always try to reposition (say, to a [[stair dancing|upstairs]]) ''before'' you get adjacent to them.\n\nShould you need to retreat from a bad fight, your options are limited. Common ways to escape include:\n*Swapping places with a [[summon]] or other type of [[ally]]\n*Prevent the monster from moving: [[Throwing net]], [[BVC]], [[wand of roots]]\n*Translocating yourself away: [[Blink]], [[Passage of Golubria]], [[scroll of teleport]], [[scroll of blinking]]\n*Sending the monster away: [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]], [[Dispersal]] ([[Dispersal|spell]] and [[dispersal (brand)|darts]]), [[scroll of butterflies]], [[phial of floods]]\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], attacks of opportunity were reworked. Prior to this version:\n**Monsters didn't have a 50% chance to lose 0.1 of a turn after making an opportunity attack.\n**Monsters only made attacks of opportunity if you were ''adjacent'', not in ''melee range''. Therefore, monsters with [[reaching]] attacks couldn't make attacks of opportunity. Their AI would let you get 2 tiles away before chasing, thus invalidating opportunity attacks.\n**You were immune to attacks of opportunity if you moved faster than the monster.\n**Certain [[attack flavour]]s, such as [[engulf]], [[constrict]], and any effect that moved the player or monster, were disabled during attacks of opportunity.\n:Also, [[random energy]] was re-introduced in this version.\n*Attacks of opportunity were introduced in [[0.29]], as a replacement for [[energy randomisation]].\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

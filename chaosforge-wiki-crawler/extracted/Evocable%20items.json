{"title":"Evocable items","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Evocable_items","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n\n'''Evocable items''' are magical items, with abilities that are [[evoke]]d using the '''V''' key. Evocables generally use the [[Evocations]] skill to determine strength.\n\nMany evocable items are comparable to spells, with some sharing a similar effect. Unlike spells, evocables do not have a failure rate (though some may check [[willpower]] to cause an effect), can be cast during [[Silence]], usually have no MP cost, and are allowed by [[Trog]]. However, most evocables are limited by charges. You'll need to gain XP, or find more of the same item, in order to use them again. So instead of being a primary means of attack, Evocations tends to be used sparingly, in order to solve sketchy situations.\n\n==Staves==\nMagical staves deal extra elemental damage in melee, scaling with skill in both their respective magic school and [[Evocations]]. Staves are not proper evokers, so are the exception to a few rules. They are ''magical'', and forbidden by Trog. Staves do not have charges. Artefacts may have directly evoked abilities, but they must be wielded and use MP or some other cost in order to cast.\n\n*[[File:Magic staff 1.png]] [[Magical staff|List of magical staves]]\n*[[File:Elemental staff.png]] The [[Elemental Staff]] is boosted by Evocations skill, similar to, but distinct from, other magical staves.\n\n===Artefacts===\nTwo [[unrandart]] items provide an ability, which scales with [[Evocations]] skill and can be activated from the [[a]]bilities menu:\n*[[File:Staff of olgreb.png]] [[Staff of Olgreb]]: Casts [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] and also acts as a somewhat more powerful [[staff of poison|staff of alchemy]].\n*[[File:Orb of Dispater.png]] [[Orb of Dispater]]: Hurls [[damnation]], but costs 10% HP.\n\n==Wands==\n<div style=\"padding-left: 2em\">''Main article: [[Wands]]''</div>\nA wand is a magical device that contains several charges of a specific spell. It does not need to be wielded to be used.\n*[[File:Wand_wood.png]] [[Wands#List of wands|List of Wands]]\n\n==Miscellaneous Evokers==\nThese items can be used to evoke effects. Each miscellaneous evocable can appear once per game, except for figurines of a ziggurat. They cannot be eaten by [[Jiyva]] slimes.\n\n===Elemental===\nThe higher the user's [[Evocations]] skill, the more powerful the effect will be. Once used, all items of that type will become inert until you have gained enough experience.\n\n*[[File:Phial of floods.png]] [[Phial of floods]]: Launches a damaging wave of water, creating a pool of shallow water and waterlogging creatures caught in the wave.\n*[[File:Lightning rod.png]] [[Lightning rod]]: Fires a bolt of electricity; evoking it in successive turns strengthens the bolt and lets you sweep it over an area\n\nOnly one of these two items will appear in a given game:\n*[[File:Tin of tremorstones.png]] [[Tin of tremorstones]]: Creates multiple explosions of shrapnel near the player; always risks hitting yourself, but damage is greatly reduced by armour.\n*[[File:Condenser vane.png]] [[Condenser vane]]: Creates harmful [[cloud]]s around every enemy in sight.\n\n===Summoning===\n<div id=\"summoningitems\"></div>\nThese items can be used to summon a creature or two, possibly along with other effects. In most cases, their power depends upon your Evocations skill. Like elemental evokers, they are rendered inert until you gain more experience.\n\n*[[File:Phantom mirror.png]] [[Phantom mirror]]: Creates a short-lived copy of a single monster\n*[[File:Horn of geryon.png]] [[Horn of Geryon]]: Summons a few [[hell beast]]s, some of which may be hostile.\n\nOnly one of these two items will appear in a given game:\n*[[File:Box of beasts.png]] [[Box of beasts]]: Summons a randomly-generated [[mutant beast]]\n*[[File:Sack of spiders.png]] [[Sack of spiders]]: Summons multiple spiders, and has a chance to [[web]] nearby monsters.\n\n===Other Evocables===\n*[[File:Figurine of a ziggurat.png]] [[Figurine of a ziggurat]]: Creates an entrance to a [[ziggurat]].\n\n==Other Items==\n*[[Artefact]]s may come with evocable [[Blink]].\n*[[File:Scarf2a.png]] [[Scarves]] and [[artefact]]s of [[invisibility (ego)|invisibility]] can be evoked to turn you [[invisible]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], miscellaneous evocables were not unique: you could find multiple in 1 game, and they could be eaten by [[Jiyva]] slimes. Also, the [[condenser vane]] and [[tin of tremorstones]] were not [[item set|mutually exclusive]] with each other.\n\n===Added Evocables===\n*[[0.31]] - [[Sack of spiders]]\n*[[0.27]] - [[Piece from Xom's chessboard]]\n*[[0.26]] - [[Condenser vane]]\n*[[0.25]] - [[Tin of tremorstones]]\n*[[0.16]] - [[Phantom mirror]]\n*[[0.13]] - [[Phial of floods]]\n*[[0.11]] - [[Lightning rod]]\n\n===Removed Evocables===\n*[[0.31]] - [[Piece from Xom's chessboard]]\n*[[0.25]] - [[Crystal ball of energy]], [[fan of gales]], [[lamp of fire]], [[sack of spiders]]\n*[[0.20]] - [[Disc of storms]], [[rod]]s\n*[[0.19]] - [[Stone of tremors]]\n*[[0.18]] - [[Lantern of shadows]]\n*[[0.16]] - [[Tome of destruction]]\n*[[0.14]] - [[Bottled efreet]]s\n*[[0.10]] - [[Crystal ball of seeing]]\n*[[0.8]] - [[Crystal ball of fixation]]\n\n===Removed Evocations Scaling===\nThese items remained in the game, but lost their Evocations component.\n*[[0.30]] - [[Sceptre of Asmodeus]], [[energy|orb of energy]]\n*[[0.19]] - [[Deck]]s\n\n{{Evocables}}\n[[Category:Items]]"}

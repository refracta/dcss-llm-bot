It will not affect weapons which are otherwise subject to special enchantments.}}\n\n'''Lethal Infusion''' is a level 2 [[Charms]]/[[Necromancy]] spell which temporarily assigns the [[draining (brand)|draining brand]] to the unbranded melee weapon you are currently wielding. This increases its damage output and inflicts a [[draining]] effect upon any enemy you strike, significantly reducing its threat level but also reducing the [[experience]] you gain for defeating it. Unwielding the weapon will cause the brand to be lost.\n\nUsing a [[scroll of brand weapon]] while under the effect of this spell will make the brand permanent.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Bear in mind that the [[undead]], [[plant]]s, [[demon]]s, and unliving monsters are all completely immune to this effect. [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]]s, however, are an excellent target for draining attacks; the forms they assume are based on their HD, which draining reduces.\n\n==History==\nLethal Infusion was removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

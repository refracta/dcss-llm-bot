{"title":"Control Flight","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Control_Flight","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n'''Control Flight''' is an [[intrinsic]] that causes sources of [[levitation]] to instead let you [[fly]]. This allows you to grab items off the ground or to descend [[stairs]] and exits (such as from [[the Abyss]]) without landing first. \n\nAll [[draconian]]s have Control Flight innately. [[Tengu]] receive it while using their unique flight [[ability]], but not when using other sources of levitation. Other characters can acquire it by wearing the [[unrandart]] [[Amulet of the Air]] or by casting [[Flight (spell)|Flight]].\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.12]], this intrinsic was completely removed along with [[levitation]].\n*Prior to [[0.11]], it was also available through the [[amulet of controlled flight]].\n\n[[Category:Egos]]"}

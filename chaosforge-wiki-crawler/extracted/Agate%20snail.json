When badly injured, it will [[withdrawn|withdraw]] into its shell, granting it +10 [[AC]] and [[regeneration]] but rendering it harmless and stationary. They can be found in [[the Lair]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Before they've withdrawn into their shell, any character can easily [[kite]] them to death. Even flimsy characters with decent weapons should be able to finish them off safely after they withdraw.\n\n==History==\nAgate snails were removed in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

It requires a degree of magical ability to be used reliably; otherwise it can produce unpredictable and possibly harmful results.}}\n\nA '''crystal ball of seeing''' is an evocable item which, when used successfully, reveals a portion of the current floor around you, much like a [[scroll of magic mapping]]. It has no cost to use, but does have a high failure rate and may cause [[Divinations]] [[miscast effect]]s when used incorrectly. Your [[Evocations]] skill determines both the likelihood of success and the [[spell power]] of the effect (and thus how much of the map it reveals).\n\nWhen you evoke it, the game rolls 1d(6Ã—Evocations). If it rolls:\n\n{{crawlquote|'''1''': 1 point of [[intelligence]] damage<br>'''2-4''': Sets your [[MP]] to zero<br>'''5-9''': You are [[confused]] for 10-20 turns<br>'''10-14''': Nothing happens<br>'''15+''': 50% chance of revealing part of the map<br><br>'''Spell Power''': 50+1dEvocations}}\n\n==Strategy==\nBy the time your Evocations skill hits double-digits, you should be able to use it almost-reliably (though you are never completely safe from miscast effects). Even so, it's not the sort of item you'd be using in combat anyway, so it's mostly harmless to play with at lower skill levels. Possible uses for this include finding the [[stairs]] when trying to rush through a floor and hunting down vaults behind secret doors or locked inside of impenetrable walls.\n\n==History==\nCrystal balls of seeing were removed in [[0.10]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete]]"}

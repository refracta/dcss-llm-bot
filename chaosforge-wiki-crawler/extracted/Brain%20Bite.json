If the enemy has near-emptied magic reserves, they will take doubled damage.}}\n\n'''Brain Bite''' is a monster-only spell that does 4-8 irresistible damage, and drains the player's MP. The MP lost is equal to 20% of your max MP, rounded down (min. 1 MP). If the player has less than 20% of their max MP, they take double damage, 8-16. Monsters gain the [[antimagic]] status instead. This spell is [[smite-targeted]].\n\nThe following enemies cast Brain Bite:<!-- replace with {{monsters with spell}} -->\n*{{monsterlink|Brain worm}}\n*{{monsterlink|Glowing orange brain}}\t\n*{{monsterlink|Neqoxec}}\t\n*{{monsterlink|Norris}}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], Brain Bite was added, replacing [[Brain Feed]].\n\n[[Category: Monster spells]]"}

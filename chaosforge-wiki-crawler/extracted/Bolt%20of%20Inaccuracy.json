It deals severe irresistible damage to anything it strikes, and has a range almost equal to your [[line of sight]] that is unaffected by the number of targets it hits, but it can only reliably hit the least [[ev]]asive monsters in the game.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Although this spell will miss its target often, its damage output is surprisingly high, especially at high Evocations skill. Considering that it costs you nothing except for a very small amount of [[hunger]] and the half turn it takes to wield the rod, it is actually a very powerful (if situational) spell for any character willing to train the needed skill.\n*[[Sleep]]ing or [[petrified]] opponents are easy targets, and even if you miss, the spell produces such a small amount of noise that you're unlikely to wake a sleeping target up. Consider it a long-range equivalent to [[Stabbing]]. Long lines of opponents in narrow hallways are also good targets; although you probably won't hit everything, you're likely to at least hit ''something''.\n*The following monsters have such lousy [[EV]] that you should be able to hit them semi-regularly (not a complete list):\n**[[Hydra]]s\n**[[Statue]]s\n**[[Curse skull]]s\n**[[Oklob plant]]s\n**Most [[list of jellies|jellies]]\n**Most [[list of eyeballs|eyeballs]]\n**Most [[list of mummies|mummies]]\n**All [[list of giants|giants]]\n**[[Bone dragon]]s\n**[[Gold dragon armour]]-wearing [[player ghost]]s\n**[[Gastronok]]\n*Hitting your target with [[Corona]], [[Sticky Flame]], or [[Fedhas Madash]]'s [[Sunshine]] ability will significantly increase your accuracy against it, making it a much easier target. [[The Shining One]]'s Halo [[aura]] is even better, automatically highlighting almost everything on the screen.\n*[[Vehumet]] worshipers also enjoy improved use of this spell, as he increases Bolt of Inaccuracy's range to include your entire line of sight.\n*[[Naga]]s and [[octopode]]s can [[constriction|constrict]] opponents, dramatically reducing their EV. This greatly increases the odds of hitting with a bolt of inaccuracy. \n\n==History==\n*Before the removal of [[rods]] in [[0.20]], this spell was available through the [[rod of inaccuracy]]. \n*Prior to [[0.16]], this spell was available through use of a [[tome of Destruction]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], this spell was available in one of the [[rod of destruction|rods of destruction]].\n*In the pre-DCSS days, this was actually found in the book of Greater Conjurations (which later became the [[Book of Annihilations]]), as a level 4 Conjurations spell."}

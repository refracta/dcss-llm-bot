It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Broad axes''' are the most powerful one handed axes, though have the highest base delay. They don't do as much damage as two-handed axes, but they are still good enough to make them a viable choice throughout the game, especially if you find a nice [[artefact]] axe.\n\nLike all axes, this weapon allows the player to [[cleave]], which helps compensate somewhat for its relatively mediocre base damage and speed.\n\n==Strategy==\nBroad axes are as strong as a [[morningstar]], but with a 1 higher base delay. Morningstars are strong enough to win the game, and broad axes, with the extra cleave, are no different.\n\nThey aren't ''common'' per-se, but are somewhat less rare than other \"top tier\" one-handers like the [[eveningstar]] or [[double sword]]. This is because broad axes can be wielded by a number of enemies, including [[orc warrior]]s, [[orc knight]]s, and [[vault guard]]s.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|mon-gear.cc|339}}</ref> You shouldn't rely on this fact, but it's worth noting anyhow.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Broad axe1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Broad axe2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Broad axe3.png]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || [[Unrandarts|Unrandart]] Broad Axes\n|-\n| '''\"[[Arga]]\"''' || [[File:Mithril_axe_arga.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Obsidian Axe]]''' || [[File:Obsidian_axe.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], the base delay was changed back to 16.\n*In [[0.26]], the broad axe's base delay was increased from 16 to 17, with the minimum attack delay requiring 20 [[Axes]] skill instead of 18.\n*Prior to 0.12, broad axes had 14 base damage and no [[cleaving]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\nA more complete list of monsters that can spawn with a broad axe can be found at {{source ref|0.31.0|mon-gear.cc|585}} and {{source ref|0.31.0|mon-gear.cc|621}}.

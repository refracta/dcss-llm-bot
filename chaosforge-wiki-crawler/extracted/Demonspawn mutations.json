{"title":"Demonspawn mutations","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Demonspawn_mutations","type":"markdown","data":"***Version [0.30](/0.30 \"0.30\")**: This article **may not be** up to date for the [latest stable release](/0.32 \"0.32\") of Crawl.*\n\nAs [demonspawn](/Demonspawn \"Demonspawn\") characters level up, they gain useful [mutations](/Mutations \"Mutations\") due to their demonic ancestry. [Demonspawn mutations]() are semi-random, according to the following rules. A 'facet' is a set of three ranks in one mutation:\n\n- 90% of the time, they mutate as follows:\n\n  - They gain one body-slot facet\n  - They gain one scales facet\n  - They gain two tier 2 facets\n  - They gain one tier 3 facet\n\n- 10% of the time, they are \"monstrous\", and instead mutate as follows:\n\n  - They gain three body-slot facets.\n  - They have *no* scales facets\n  - They gain two tier 2 facets\n  - They gain one tier 3 facet\n\nHere is a list of all possible demonspawn mutations. Note that many of these mutations can also be gained randomly. However, demonspawn mutations are unique in that they cannot be removed by any means. You can check your current mutations with shift-A.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Body-Slot Facets](#Body-Slot_Facets)\n\n  - [1.1 Claws](#Claws)\n  - [1.2 Demonic Touch](#Demonic_Touch)\n  - [1.3 Horns](#Horns)\n  - [1.4 Antennae](#Antennae)\n  - [1.5 Hooves](#Hooves)\n  - [1.6 Weakening Stinger](#Weakening_Stinger)\n\n- [2 Scales Facets](#Scales_Facets)\n\n  - [2.1 Molten Scales](#Molten_Scales)\n  - [2.2 Icy Blue Scales](#Icy_Blue_Scales)\n  - [2.3 Slimy Green Scales](#Slimy_Green_Scales)\n  - [2.4 Thin Metallic Scales](#Thin_Metallic_Scales)\n  - [2.5 Yellow Scales](#Yellow_Scales)\n  - [2.6 Rugged Brown Scales](#Rugged_Brown_Scales)\n  - [2.7 Large Bone Plates](#Large_Bone_Plates)\n  - [2.8 Repulsion Field](#Repulsion_Field)\n  - [2.9 Thin Skeletal Structure](#Thin_Skeletal_Structure)\n  - [2.10 Sturdy Frame](#Sturdy_Frame)\n  - [2.11 Sanguine Armour](#Sanguine_Armour)\n  - [2.12 Big Brain](#Big_Brain)\n  - [2.13 Sharp Scales](#Sharp_Scales)\n\n- [3 Tier 2 Facets](#Tier_2_Facets)\n\n  - [3.1 Ignite Blood](#Ignite_Blood)\n  - [3.2 Icemail](#Icemail)\n  - [3.3 Powered by Death](#Powered_by_Death)\n  - [3.4 Mana Shield](#Mana_Shield)\n  - [3.5 Demonic Guardian](#Demonic_Guardian)\n  - [3.6 Spiny](#Spiny)\n  - [3.7 Powered by Pain](#Powered_by_Pain)\n  - [3.8 Foul Stench](#Foul_Stench)\n  - [3.9 Demonic Magic](#Demonic_Magic)\n\n- [4 Tier 3 Facets](#Tier_3_Facets)\n\n  - [4.1 Hurl Damnation](#Hurl_Damnation)\n  - [4.2 Robust](#Robust)\n  - [4.3 Black Mark](#Black_Mark)\n  - [4.4 Augmentation](#Augmentation)\n  - [4.5 Corrupting Presence](#Corrupting_Presence)\n\n- [5 History](#History)\n\n## Body-Slot Facets\n\nMonstrous demonspawn develop 3 body-slot facets, while others gain 1. All body-slot facets give the player some extra passive abilities, but will eventually preclude wearing some non-body armour.\n\n- [Gloves](/Gloves \"Gloves\") negate the [Claws](/Claws \"Claws\") facet and are prohibited when [Claws](/Claws \"Claws\") or [Demonic Touch](/Demonic_Touch \"Demonic Touch\") facets reach the third rank. [Claws](/Claws \"Claws\") and [Demonic Touch](/Demonic_Touch \"Demonic Touch\") facets are mutually exclusive.\n- [Helmets](/Helmet \"Helmet\") cannot be worn with any rank of [Antennae](/Antennae \"Antennae\") or [Horns](/Horns \"Horns\") facet. No headgear can be worn when these facets reach the third rank. [Antennae](/Antennae \"Antennae\") and [Horns](/Horns \"Horns\") facets are mutually exclusive.\n- [Cloaks](/Cloak \"Cloak\") cannot be worn when the [Weakening Stinger](/Weakening_Stinger \"Weakening Stinger\") facet reaches the third level of mutation.\n- [Boots](/Boots \"Boots\") negate the [Hooves](/Hooves \"Hooves\") facet and are prohibited when the [Hooves](/Hooves \"Hooves\") facet reaches the third rank.\n\nSince most demonspawn only have one body-slot facet, the armour restriction is minor. Monstrous demonspawn, who have three body-slot facets, suffer from many more armour restrictions. However they gain two more passive abilities than their non-monstrous brethren. This lends themselves to a more offensive play style.\n\n### Claws\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                      |                                  |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |\n| Rank                                                                                                                                                               | Effect                                                                               | Flavor                           |\n| 1                                                                                                                                                                  | +2 [unarmed](/Unarmed \"Unarmed\") base damage.

The [Talons](/Talons \"Talons\") facet was removed.\n- In [0.27](/0.27 \"0.27\"), [Passive Freeze](/Passive_Freeze \"Passive Freeze\") and [Iridescent Scales](/Iridescent_Scales \"Iridescent Scales\") were removed, [Corrupting Presence](/Corrupting_Presence \"Corrupting Presence\") and [Demonic Magic](/Demonic_Magic \"Demonic Magic\") were added, and several other facets were reworked.\n- In [0.26](/0.26 \"0.26\"), [Nightstalker](/Nightstalker \"Nightstalker\") facet was removed and [Sharp Scales](/Sharp_Scales \"Sharp Scales\") and [Big Brain](/Big_Brain \"Big Brain\") facets were added.\n- Prior to [0.19](/0.19 \"0.19\"), Powered by Death gave regeneration from nearby corpses, regeneration is now given from kills.\n- Sanguine Armour was added in [0.19](/0.19 \"0.19\").\n- Sturdy Frame was added in [0.18](/0.18 \"0.18\").\n- Rough Black Scales were removed in [0.18](/0.18 \"0.18\").\n- Prior to [0.14](/0.14 \"0.14\"), the negative energy facet granted a second level of rN, instead of the [Black Mark](/Black_Mark \"Black Mark\") passive ability.\n- Prior to [0.13](/0.13 \"0.13\"), Demonic Guardian would function for Okawaru worshipers, often resulting in massive piety losses. Hellfire cost 25% of max HP instead of 15.\n- Mana Shield was added in [0.13](/0.13 \"0.13\").\n- Prior to [0.12](/0.12 \"0.12\"), Augmentation kicked in at low HP instead of high HP.\n- Prior to [0.11](/0.11 \"0.11\"), [magic resistance](/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\") was available as a Tier 2 facet.\n- Many mutations were added in [0.10](/0.10 \"0.10\").\n- The Demonspawn mutation system was substantially overhauled in [0.7](/0.7 \"0.7\"). Prior to that version, they mutated in a generally more random fashion: mutations were only grouped into low power and high power, and Demonspawn would receive six total mutations (two low, four high power). Demonspawn mutations were also influenced by a character's skills and deity. While the old Demonspawn may have had much more powerful mutations available to them, the lack of any coherence to the mutations, or any guarantee of getting useful ones, made them in general a much more difficult species under the old system.\n  - The mutation lists, which can be found on [this page](http://r1gm.free.fr/Crawl/crawlSS_052_mutations.txt), were extremely varied. For instance, \"high power\" mutations could be absolutely mediocre things such as 1d3 levels of negative energy resistance, or potentially game breaking, like fast movement or complete torment immunity.\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\"/>\n<title>Demonspawn mutations -

[[demonspawn]] characters level up, they gain useful [[mutations]] due to their demonic ancestry. [[Demonspawn mutations]] are semi-random, according to the following rules. A 'facet' is a set of three ranks in one mutation:\n*90% of the time, they mutate as follows:\n**They gain one body-slot facet\n**They gain one scales facet\n**They gain two tier 2 facets\n**They gain one tier 3 facet\n*10% of the time, they are \"monstrous\", and instead mutate as follows:\n**They gain three body-slot facets.\n**They have ''no'' scales facets\n**They gain two tier 2 facets\n**They gain one tier 3 facet\n\nHere is a list of all possible demonspawn mutations. Note that many of these mutations can also be gained randomly. However, demonspawn mutations are unique in that they cannot be removed by any means. You can check your current mutations with shift-A.\n\n==Body-Slot Facets==\n\nMonstrous demonspawn develop 3 body-slot facets, while others gain 1.\nAll body-slot facets give the player some extra passive abilities, but will eventually preclude wearing some non-body armour.\n* [[Gloves]] negate the [[Claws]] facet and are prohibited when [[Claws]] or [[Demonic Touch]] facets reach the third rank. [[Claws]] and [[Demonic Touch]] facets are mutually exclusive.\n* [[Helmet]]s cannot be worn with any rank of [[Antennae]] or [[Horns]] facet. No headgear can be worn when these facets reach the third rank. [[Antennae]] and [[Horns]] facets are mutually exclusive.\n* [[Cloak]]s cannot be worn when the [[Weakening Stinger]] facet reaches the third level of mutation.\n* [[Boots]] negate the [[Hooves]] facet and are prohibited when the [[Hooves]] facet reaches the third rank.\nSince most demonspawn only have one body-slot facet, the armour restriction is minor.\nMonstrous demonspawn, who have three body-slot facets, suffer from many more armour restrictions. However they gain two more passive abilities than their non-monstrous brethren. This lends themselves to a more offensive play style.\n\n===Claws===\n{{:Claws}}\n\n\n===Demonic Touch===\n{{:Demonic Touch}}\n\n\n===Horns===\n{{:Horns}}\n\n\n===Antennae===\n{{:Antennae}}\n\n\n===Hooves===\n{{:Hooves}}\n\n\n===Weakening Stinger===\n{{:Weakening Stinger}}\n\n==Scales Facets==\nMost demonspawn develop scales; monstrous demonspawn do not. Demonspawn may still acquire scales through random mutation, but non-monstrous demonspawn can only get ranks of a scales mutation if it matches the one they would eventually develop later.\n\n===Molten Scales===\n{{:Molten Scales}}\n\n\n===Icy Blue Scales===\n{{:Icy Blue Scales}}\n\n\n===Slimy Green Scales===\n{{:Slimy Green Scales}}\n\n\n===Thin Metallic Scales===\n{{:Thin Metallic Scales}}\n\n\n===Yellow Scales===\n{{:Yellow Scales}}\n\n\n===Rugged Brown Scales===\n{{:Rugged Brown Scales}}\n\n\n===Large Bone Plates===\n{{:Large Bone Plates}}\n\n\n===Repulsion Field===\n{{:Repulsion Field}}\n\n\n===Thin Skeletal Structure===\n{{:Thin Skeletal Structure}}\n\n\n===Sturdy Frame===\n{{:Sturdy Frame}}\n\n\n===Sanguine Armour===\n{{:Sanguine Armour}}\n\n\n===Big Brain===\n{{:Big Brain}}\n\n\n===Sharp Scales===\n{{:Sharp Scales}}\n\n==Tier 2 Facets==\nAll demonspawn develop two tier 2 facets.\n\n===Ignite Blood===\n{{:Ignite Blood}}\n\n\n===Icemail===\n{{:Icemail}}\n\n\n===Powered by Death===\n{{:Powered By Death}}\n\n\n===Mana Shield===\n{{:Mana Shield}}\n\n\n===Demonic Guardian===\n{{:Demonic Guardian}}\n\n\n===Spiny===\n{{:Spiny (mutation)}}\n\n\n===Powered by Pain===\n{{:Powered By Pain}}\n\n\n===Foul Stench===\n{{:Foul Stench}}\n\n\n===Demonic Magic===\n{{:Demonic Magic}}\n\n==Tier 3 Facets==\nAll demonspawn gain one tier 3 facet.\n\n===Hurl Damnation===\n{{:Hurl Damnation (mutation)}}\n\n\n===Robust===\n{{:Robust}}\n\n\n===Black Mark===\n{{:Black Mark (mutation)}}\n\n\n===Augmentation===\n{{:Augmentation}}\n\n\n===Corrupting Presence===\n{{:Corrupting Presence}}\n\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], [[Weakening Stinger]] and [[Demonic Touch]] were added. The [[Talons]] facet was removed.\n*In [[0.27]], [[Passive Freeze]] and [[Iridescent Scales]] were removed, [[Corrupting Presence]] and [[Demonic Magic]] were added, and several other facets were reworked.\n*In [[0.26]], [[Nightstalker]] facet was removed and [[Sharp Scales]] and [[Big Brain]] facets were added.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Powered by Death gave regeneration from nearby corpses, regeneration is now given from kills.\n*Sanguine Armour was added in [[0.19]].\n*Sturdy Frame was added in [[0.18]].\n*Rough Black Scales were removed in [[0.18]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the negative energy facet granted a second level of rN, instead of the [[Black Mark]] passive ability.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Demonic Guardian would function for Okawaru worshipers, often resulting in massive piety losses. Hellfire cost 25% of max HP instead of 15.\n*Mana Shield was added in [[0.13]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], Augmentation kicked in at low HP instead of high HP.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], [[magic resistance]] was available as a Tier 2 facet.\n*Many mutations were added in [[0.10]].\n*The Demonspawn mutation system was substantially overhauled in [[0.7]].  Prior to that version, they mutated in a generally more random fashion: mutations were only grouped into low power and high power, and Demonspawn would receive six total mutations (two low, four high power). Demonspawn mutations were also influenced by a character's skills and deity.  While the old Demonspawn may have had much more powerful mutations available to them, the lack of any coherence to the mutations, or any guarantee of getting useful ones, made them in general a much more difficult species under the old system.\n**The mutation lists, which can be found on [http://r1gm.free.fr/Crawl/crawlSS_052_mutations.txt this page], were extremely varied.  For instance, \"high power\" mutations could be absolutely mediocre things such as 1d3 levels of negative energy resistance, or potentially game breaking, like fast movement or complete torment immunity.\n\n[[Category:Intrinsic]]\n[[Category:Mutations]]\n[[Category:List]]"}

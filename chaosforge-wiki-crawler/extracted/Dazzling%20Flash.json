{"title":"Dazzling Flash","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dazzling_Flash","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Dazzling Flash''' is a Level 3 [[Conjurations]]/[[Hexes]] spell that attempts to [[blind]] all monsters within range.\n\n[[Enchanter]]s start with this spell available.\n\n==Effect==\nWhen Dazzling Flash is cast, all vulnerable creatures within range and [[LOS]] may be blinded for 4 to 8 turns, with the chance of success increasing with [[spell power]] and decreasing with monster [[hit dice]]. At full power, the odds are <code>95% - (4 * [[HD]])</code>.\n\nDazzling Flash has no effect on the [[undead]], [[nonliving]], or [[plants]]. Additionally, some creatures with powerful senses (or no eyes!) are immune to blinding, such as [[wolf|wolves]] and [[jelly|jellies]].\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile useful to anyone as an occasional escape spell or to slow down a crowd while you whittle it down to size, [[stabbing|stabbers]] benefit the most, as this spell ignores both [[willpower]] and [[see invisible]]. Its effectiveness tapers off toward the endgame, where more monsters are immune or have high HD. For single targets, [[Confusing Touch]] lasts much longer and has multiple chances to hex per cast.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Dazzling Flash will be a [[Fire]]/[[Hexes]] spell.}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], [[Conjurer]]s also started with Dazzling Flash.\n*Dazzling Flash was added in [[0.25]], replacing [[Dazzling Spray]]."}

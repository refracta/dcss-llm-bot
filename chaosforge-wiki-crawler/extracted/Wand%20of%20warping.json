{"title":"Wand of warping","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wand_of_warping","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{item\n |itemtype = Wand\n |name = Wand of warping\n |cost = ?\n}}\n{{flavour|A magical device which creates a brief but violent rift in space, damaging everything caught in its wake and sometimes blinking them a short distance away.}}\n\nA '''wand of warping''' creates a 3x3 explosion that has a chance to blink everything caught in the blast radius, including the player. It does less damage than the [[wand of iceblast]], but the damage is irresistible.\n\nThe chance of blinking is <code>50 + 3.5 * [[Evocations]]</code>%, capped at 90% (~12 Evocations).\n\nIt is [[alternate items|mutually exclusive]] with the [[wand of roots]] and [[wand of iceblast]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Against monsters with dangerous short-range attacks such as [[Iron Shot]] and [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]], this wand can create some distance, allowing you to fight at long range more safely. Note that this doesn't work on [[Roxanne]], since she's stationary.\n*If you're [[silence]]d, you can use this wand on the silencer to get out of the silence radius, allowing you to use [[spell]]s, [[scroll]]s, and god abilities.\n\n==History==\n*Added in [[0.32]] to the blast wand [[item set]].\n\n{{wands}}"}

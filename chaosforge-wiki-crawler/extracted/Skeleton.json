{"title":"Skeleton","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Skeleton","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''For the monster, see [[skeleton (monster)]]''\n{{flavour|A decaying skeleton.}}\n\nA '''skeleton''' is a decayed corpse. Like corpses, skeletons cannot be picked up. Skeletons are produced when corpses rot away over time, and the skeleton itself will rot away some time afterward. Note that some creatures, such as [[List of arthropods|arthropods]], do not have a proper skeletal system to raise.\n\nSkeletons serve no gameplay purpose. Followers of [[Beogh]] can still revive orc skeletons, however.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n| [[File:Skeleton 1.png]] || [[File:Skeleton 2.png]] || [[File:Skeleton 3.png]] || [[File:Skeleton 4.png]]\n|-\n| [[File:Skeleton 5.png]] || [[File:Skeleton 6.png]] || [[File:Skeleton 7.png]] || [[File:Skeleton 8.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|skeletons will no longer decay over time.}}\n*Prior to [[0.29]], skeletons could be raised into [[skeleton (monster)|skeleton]] monsters.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], butchering a [[corpse]] for its [[chunk]]s produced a skeleton.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], corpses had a chance to leave no skeletons behind.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], you could carry skeletons with you.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], skeletons would sprout toadstools.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Derived undead]]"}

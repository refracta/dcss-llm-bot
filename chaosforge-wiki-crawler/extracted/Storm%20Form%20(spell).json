The caster's melee attacks are strengthened, electrified, and strike all adjacent foes. The caster also flies, is more evasive, gains immunity to poison and miasma, and resists electricity. They can launch themselves as a lightning bolt, blasting through everything in their way. The damage and evasion granted by storm form are highly dependent on the power with which it was cast.\nWhile transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded.\n----\n“Stormform is said to cause<br>\nA tempest of winds and showers,<br>\nBeware its powers, beware its powers.<br>\nThough its coming brings the gods their night,<br>\nIt obliges a bloodred spren.<br>\nBeware its end, beware its end.”<br>\n-Brandon Sanderson, “Words of Radiance”. 2014.}}\n\n'''Storm Form''' is a level 7 [[Transmutations]] / [[Air]] spell that changes you into an agile, destructive being of lightning. \n\n==Useful Info==\nStorm Form turns you into lightning, with the following changes:\n\n'''Combat Bonuses'''\n*'''Innate AC:''' <code>10 + pow/10</code> AC.\n*'''Bonus EV:''' <code>pow/10</code> bonus EV, added on top of your base EV.\n*'''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' <code>2 + pow/3</code> base damage. Attacks gain [[cleaving]] and the [[electrocution]] brand.\n*'''[[Blinkbolt]]:''' Bolt-targeted ability that deals electric damage to everything in its path, then blinks you to the end. Has a cooldown.\n\n'''Resistances'''\n*[[Poison resistance|Poison immunity]].\n*[[Electricity resistance|rElec]].\n*Innate [[flight]].\n*'''[[Non-living]]:''' [[Unbreathing]], lacks [[blood]], immune to [[sleep]].\n*'''[[Insubstantial]]:''' Immune to [[constriction]] / [[throwing net|ensnarement]], [[Sticky Flame]], and [[petrification]].\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n*'''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' All [[armour]], [[weapon]] and [[shield]]. (Can only wear [[jewellery]])\n*Cannot [[throw]].\n\nUses your [[species]] body size. [[Movement delay]] set to 1.0, even if your [[species]] is faster or slower.\n\n==Strategy==\nStorm Form is a high damage form that scales heavily with [[spell power]]. At low power, [[Dragon Form]] deals more damage to single targets.\n\nThis form is surprisingly durable. You retain your natural EV, and gain bonuses to both EV and AC. Even though Dragon Form has 150% health, because it is [[Size#Giant|giant]], it loses EV. When your only defensive skills are [[Fighting]] and [[Dodging]], that isn't great.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Like other forms, Storm Form benefits greatly from support magic such as [[Ozocubu's Armour]] and [[Manifold Assault]].\n*Since Storm Form melds equipment, it's usually a good idea to wield a robe of the [[Archmagi]] and/or [[staff of air]] before transforming. Just be careful if you transform out.\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

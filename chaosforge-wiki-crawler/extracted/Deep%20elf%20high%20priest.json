Along with the usual priestly [[smiting]], expect to be blasted with [[damnation]]. They can most often be found in the [[Elven Halls]] (especially the bottom level) and [[the Vaults]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Having a deep elf high priest around makes other deep elves significantly more dangerous. Not only can they heal their allies while damaging you, but Aura of Brilliance makes deep elven spellcasters even more dangerous than they already are.\n*If you can fight deep elf high priests on their own, they become significantly less threatening. This is especially true once you close to melee range, which generally discourages them from blasting you with [[damnation]].\n*[[Silence]] is always useful, especially since it shuts down any other dangerous casters in the vicinity.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|[[Aura of Brilliance]] will be renamed to '''Prayer of Brilliance''' and become an AoE buff instead of an aura.}}\n*Prior to [[0.28]], deep elf high priests could [[see invisible]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], they could cast [[Twisted Resurrection]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], deep elf high priests could cast [[Summon Demon]]. \n*In [[0.13]], [[Malign Offering]] replaced [[Minor Healing]].\n\n[[category:Elf]]"}

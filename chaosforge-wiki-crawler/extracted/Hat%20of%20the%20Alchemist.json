The '''hat of the Alchemist'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|1009}}</ref> covers all six \"major\" resistances, gives willpower, and it blocks mutations too. Having all that in one slot is very nice; at the least, it allows you to use gear slots that would otherwise be used to gather resistances. If you have solid defenses, this is an all around great item.\n\nHowever, wearing this hat means a net loss of 5-6 AC from a regular, +2 [[helmet]]. Thus, not all characters will want to wear it right away:\n*In the early game (early/mid [[Dungeon]], [[Lair]]...), resistances aren't particularly important, so the AC from a regular helmet can be more helpful than this hat.\n*Species with limited armour slots, like [[Ogre]]s and [[Spriggan]]s, appreciate all the resistances in one slot, but the lack of AC hinders them more. [[Octopode]]s may wish to rely on its abundance of [[ring]] slots for resistances rather than this hat.\n*If you happen to cover most/all resistances with other [[artefact]]s, this hat may be redundant.\n\nNote that other equipment slots can make up for the AC loss. For example, wearing the hat of the Alchemist with a [[ring of protection]] is better than having a plain +2 hat with a [[ring of willpower]].\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.18]], the [[amulet of resist mutation]] was removed, leaving this artifact as one of the few remaining sources of mutation resistance.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], it provided only rF+, rC+, rElec, and [[MR]]+, but had a +2 enchantment.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Headgear]]"}

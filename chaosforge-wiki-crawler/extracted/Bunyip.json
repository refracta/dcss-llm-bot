{"title":"Bunyip","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bunyip","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Bunyips''' are fast-moving, slow-attacking monsters found in [[the Swamp]]. While they can do gruesome damage in melee, they must rest for around 2 turns after each set of attacks.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*A very dangerous enemy. With a maximum of 120 damage, bunyips can one-shot many characters entering Swamp. Avoiding them is tricky; the watery terrain makes it difficult for any non-[[Merfolk]] to escape. \n**[[Flight]] and a [[potion of haste]] allow most species to move at the same speed as a bunyip. [[Passage of Golubria]] (or a [[scroll of blinking]], in an emergency) can give you some space.\n**Think of bunyips as good practice for fighting any [[juggernaut]]s you might see later on -- they share the same speed and attack mechanics, and even the same maximum damage.\n*Due to their exceptionally slow attack speed, bunyips often won't follow or attack you if you take some stairs to a different floor.\n*Bunyips have only moderate [[willpower]] for this stage of the game. [[Hexes]] or hex [[wand]]s can prove useful, and a [[scroll of fear]] is likely to work. Unfortunately, their resistance to [[poison]] makes [[curare]] [[dart]]s ineffective.\n*You can use [[Fulminant Prism]] or [[Summoning]] spells in order to force the bunyip to attack, causing it to waste turns. This can be combined with damage over time effects like [[Freezing Cloud]] or a [[wand of roots]] to kill it from a distance.\n\n==Trivia==\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyip Bunyips] are creatures from Australian Aboriginal mythology.\n\n==History==\nBunyips were added in [[0.26]]."}

When a monster hit by Inner Flame is damaged, it takes fire damage, and on death, it explodes.\n\n[[Fire Elementalist]]s and [[Hexslinger]]s start with this spell. A [[scroll of immolation]] can also inflict the Inner Flame status.\n__NOTOC__\n==Spell== \nIf you overcome the target's [[willpower]], the spell inflicts the Inner Flame status for 25 to 35 turns. It is [[smite-targeted]], so can affect any target in your [[line of sight]]. Allies are not turned hostile if you affect them.\n\n==Effect==\nWhenever the afflicted target is injured, a flaming cloud is generated at their position for three turns. On death, the victim will explode like a [[Fireball]], dealing heavy fire damage to all adjacent squares and leaving clouds of fire. The amount of damage and radius of the explosion is dependent on the monster's [[size]]:\n\n*Tiny monsters have a radius 1 explosion and deal 3d15 damage.\n*Little through large monsters (i.e. most creatures in the game) have a radius 1 explosion and deal 3d20 damage.\n*Giant monsters have a radius 2 explosion and deal 3d25 damage.\n\nNote that the flame clouds deal 6-21 damage per turn, including the turn of the explosion. If a [[corpse]] would be created by the exploding monster, it is destroyed and leaves a spray of blood instead, as with a [[wand of mindburst]].\n\nMonsters with infinite [[willpower]] are immune to the inner flame status, even from a [[scroll of immolation]]. \n\n===Oddities===\nInner Flame interacts oddly with certain mechanics:\n*[[Trample]] - When a trampling enemy kills a monster with Inner Flame, the victim is moved, then it explodes, then the trampler moves on to the new square. So if a trampler kills an inner flame foe, it won't get hit by a normal-size explosion.\n*[[Quicksilver Bolt]] - The monster is damaged, then if killed, it explodes (before the status is dispelled).\n*[[Ally]] betrayal - The [[good god]]s don't mind the act of inflicting Inner Flame on your allies. However, the flame clouds created by the status count as \"your\" damage, which ''does'' count towards ally betrayal. This means that, if you Inner Flame your ally and it doesn't die in 1 hit, the good gods will get angry. If the ally dies in 1 hit (i.e. before flame clouds are created), you don't get penance. Of course, if the explosion hits another ally in the vicinity, it does count towards penance.\n**The ally itself won't get angry at the flame clouds; it will remain friendly until it dies.\n**[[Summon Guardian Golem]]'s Inner Flame does not count at all. Even if the golem's explosion hits your own allies, you don't get penance.\n*[[Beogh]] - If there are no orcs on the level and you're at 4* piety or higher, Beogh can gift orcs ''in-between'' a chain of explosions. This can cause penance even if you don't intend it (enemy dies, explodes -> orc gift -> another enemy explodes, hits orc -> penance).\n\n==Strategy==\nUsed correctly, Inner Flame can deal tremendous damage to multiple enemies early in the game. Used incorrectly, you'll probably blow yourself to bits. Regardless, [[fire resistance]] is heavily recommended in order to reduce the damage you take from a badly-timed kill, allowing you to survive things blowing up in your face. \n\n*The most obvious way to avoid blowing yourself up is to kill the afflicted monster from a distance. [[Fire Elementalist]]s have spells, [[Hexslinger]]s have a ranged weapon. Other classes can make use of similar methods; even an attack [[wand]] will do in a pinch, if you use Inner Flame on a weakened foe.\n**Slowing or stopping your opponents, whether by use of spells like [[Slow]], [[Leda's Liquefaction]], and [[Petrify]], or through methods like throwing [[curare]] [[dart]]s or [[throwing net]]s, can give you enough time to run to a safe distance before setting your target off.\n**Unlike in most situations, placing a harmful cloud in an Inner Flamed monster's path will ''not'' prevent them from closing to melee. Monsters will freely move from one harmful cloud to another, and the clouds of fire they generate when hit will be enough to convince them to charge into your defensive cloud banks.\n\n*The next best way is to Inner Flame your own allies; whenever they be [[wand of charming|charmed]], [[summon]]ed, or [[undead]]. You can sit back while you '''t'''ell them to '''a'''ttack. Your allies won't get angry when they are afflicted by Inner Flame (though the [[good god]]s might - see [[#Oddities|Oddities]]).\n\n*If the target is behind some other creatures, make use of smite-targeted attacks (such as [[Portal Projectile]]) or one of the various piercing attacks ([[javelin]]s or [[bolt spells]]) to set it off in the midst of its fellows. Attack wands come in handy here.\n\n*You don't have to take advantage of the explosion for Inner Flame to be useful. The flame clouds (created on-hit) deal good damage, at least for the early game. Inner Flame an enemy, then attack from a distance.\n\nInner Flame works best against a group of monsters, such as a band of [[list of orcs|orcs]], swarm of [[killer bee]]s, or herd of [[yak]]s. However, you can take advantage of the on-hit clouds against a single target, or ignite your own summons to take out a [[unique]].\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*[[Poison]] will continuously trigger the flame cloud effect. Combining Inner Flame with [[Poisonous Vapours]] or poison [[dart]]s works well.\n*When a monster with Inner Flame explodes, they'll create long-lasting flame clouds. These can be used to block corridors, discouraging enemies from walking through.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Inner Flame was not smite-targeted. It also had a power cap of 200.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], corpse-leaving monsters would explode into [[chunk]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], monsters afflicted with Inner Flame did not generate clouds of flame on themselves when injured. Also, [[summon]]ed creatures could not be inflicted with Inner Flame."}

Its stony hide seems to heal almost instantaneously from most wounds.}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Rock trolls''' are monsters with stony skin which closely resemble normal [[troll (monster)|trolls]], except that they're bigger, dirtier, and even less coordinated. They move slowly due to their crusty hide, but still have rapid [[regeneration]]. They can be found in the middle-[[Dungeon]], the [[Orcish Mines]], and [[the Vaults]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*All the rules that apply to normal trolls apply here, only more so. Until you can kill a troll comfortably, don't attempt to go into melee with a rock troll.\n*Fortunately, their slow speed makes it easy to escape them. If a fight starts turning ugly, run.\n\n===Variant Rock Troll===\n[[File:Rock troll monk ghost.png]] The ghosts of '''rock troll monks''' will occasionally coalesce as you travel in [[Wucad Mu's Monastery]]. Everything that applies for fighting normal rock trolls applies for these ghosts; since they count as summons, they can also be dispelled with [[Abjuration]]. They stop spawning once the statue of Wucad Mu in the heart of the monastery has been destroyed.\n\n{{Flavour|It seems a flimsy representation of a monk; nothing more than a half-formed memory.}}\n\n==History==\nRock trolls were removed in [[0.12]]\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]\n[[Category:Troll]]"}

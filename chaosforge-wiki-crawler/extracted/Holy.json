{"title":"Holy","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Holy","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Holy''' is one of the least common elemental forces within [[the Dungeon]], but one of the strongest in the late game. Players who do not worship [[the Shining One]] or [[Zin]] will have almost no access to holy powers, and there are only a handful of rare monsters with innate holy abilities.\n\n==Holy Damage==\nHoly damage is the manifestation of the wrath of the Shining One or other [[good]] beings. Holy damage is usually only inflicted against targets that offend good beings: This includes all [[undead]] and [[demon]]ic monsters. [[Demonspawn]] or [[undead]] (including [[lichform]]) players are also affected. Players don't have a special resistance to holy, though [[AC]] still applies as usual.\n\n===Holy Wrath===\nThe [[holy wrath]] brand, while associated with The Shining One and considered holy (demonspawn and undead cannot wield them), does not in fact deal holy damage. Rather, it offers a large physical bonus against undead and demonic foes.\n\n==Holy Sources==\nThere are two [[good gods]] you can worship to gain access to holy damage abilities:\n*Followers of [[Zin]] can use Recite to target all those vulnerable to holy, potentially causing a damaging [[holy word]]. It also targets non-unholy monsters to a lesser, non-damaging degree.\n*Followers of [[the Shining One]] can attack with Cleansing Flames.\n\nAlthough monsters may occasionally wield holy wrath weapons themselves, most monsters have no access to holy damage. However, there are several holy monsters that can be found in [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], and certain [[Ziggurat]] floors which have very powerful holy attacks and special abilities. These monsters are a major threat to any holy vulnerable characters, so be extremely careful when facing them.\n\n==Holy Resistance==\nOnly holy monsters and the formerly holy [[profane servitor]] have holy resistance. This renders them completely immune to Cleansing Flame, the only (player) source of holy damage which can hurt non-evil creatures.\n\n===Holy Vulnerability===\nHoly vulnerability renders you susceptible to many holy attacks you would otherwise be immune to. You take 150% from beams, and 75% from holy flavored melee. Holy wrath will deal random extra damage, from +1 damage to +150% (average +75%). You can acquire it by:\n*Playing an undead or demonspawn character.\n*Being under the effect of the [[Necromutation]] spell.\n\n==Holy Spells==\nWay back in the days of yore (namely, pre-DCSS), holy spells existed and were player-castable. These included such now ''verboten'' effects as Minor/Major Healing, Restore Strength, and Purify. The last one, [[Cure Poison]], was removed in [[0.17]] (long after it lost Holy). Interestingly, the holy spell school had no miscasts, so unlike with [[Divinations]] they did not last as vestiges.\n\nThe school survived for monsters considerably longer, although its spells were gradually migrated away from it (as spells such as Healing needed to be used by evil monsters as well as good). The remains of the school were ultimately completely removed around [[0.10]]. While some monsters have spells that are themselves considered to be holy, there no longer exists a defined school of holy spells.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[List of holy monsters]]\n*[[:Category:Holy resistance|List of holy resistant monsters]]\n*[[:Category:Holy vulnerability |List of holy vulnerable monsters]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the [[scroll of holy word]] gave all players access to holy damage.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], [[Zin]]'s Sancturary dealt Holy Word inside it.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], monsters spellcasters and priests using \"evil\" magic would receive full damage from Cleansing Flame, while others would receive half. Followers of an evil god (players included) also took full.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], worshipping a [[good god]] would give bonus holy word damage."}

Note that while the base damage is 5, the base damage of a bolt is added to give an overall base damage of 14.}}\n\n'''Crossbows''' are powerful ranged weapons, capable of launching [[bolt]]s for high damage and with excellent accuracy. However, the complexity of their design gives them a significantly lower rate of fire than [[bow]]s, but sufficient skill, [[strength]], and [[dexterity]] will nearly make up for this. Be aware that crossbows and bolts are fairly uncommon early on, making ammo conservation a legitimate issue. They become common in [[the Vaults]] and the later portions of [[the Dungeon]] once [[yaktaur]]s start appearing. Note that using [[shield]]s will considerably slow your attack speed.\n\nCrossbow users benefit more from a high strength score than bow-users, but benefit less from high skill levels. Because of this, while crossbows are more powerful than longbows in the early game, they become less effective in the late. However, crossbow-users have access to bolts of [[penetration]], which are significantly more powerful than the bow-user's unique [[arrow]] of [[Dispersal_(brand)|dispersal]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Crossbow 1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Crossbow 2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Crossbow 3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]<br>crossbows\n|-\n| '''[[Hellfire (unrand)|Hellfire]]''' || [[File:Crossbow hellfire.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Sniper]]''' || [[File:Crossbow sniper.png]]\n|}\n\n{{weapons}}\n\n==History==\n*Crossbows were retired in [[0.15]], replaced with [[hand crossbow]]s, [[arbalest]]s, and [[triple crossbow]]s.\n*In [[0.14]] [[Hellfire (unrand)|Hellfire]] was revamped to fire bolts that actually explode in [[hellfire]].\n\n[[Category:Crossbows]]"}

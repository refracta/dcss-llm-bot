{"title":"Purple draconian","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Purple_draconian","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{list of | draconians}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Purple draconians''' are the [[magic]]-themed members of the [[list of draconians|draconian]] family. They have the same irresistible breath attacks as [[quicksilver dragon]]s, dealing moderate damage (3d20) and greatly reducing the duration of any magical buffs you may have in place. Fortunately, they have only normal speed, and thus can't hit you with this nearly as often.\n\nWhile they lack any sort of elemental resistance, they have much higher [[willpower]] than any other draconians. They can be found primarily in [[the Realm of Zot]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Their energy breath cannot be resisted, only dodged or blocked with a [[shield]], which makes them fairly dangerous. You probably won't want to bother with any buffs until you've cleared them out.\n*[[Freezing]]-[[brand]]ed weapons and [[curare]]-tipped [[dart]]s help make combat against them much easier."}

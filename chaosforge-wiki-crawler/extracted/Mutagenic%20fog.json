{"title":"Mutagenic fog","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mutagenic_fog","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n\n'''Mutagenic fog''' is a dangerous kind of [[cloud]], a condensed form of [[magical contamination]]. Ending a turn standing within a mutagenic fog cloud will give your character 1300-2500 points of contamination, quickly reaching dangerous levels if you spend significant amounts of time in one. Monsters will [[polymorph]] instead, occasionally becoming a higher [[HD]] creature than they were before.\n\nMutagenic fog is thankfully very rare, usually found in [[vault]]s in [[the Abyss]] and [[Cigotuvi's Fleshworks]] or emitted if you worship [[Xom]] and he thinks this place needs a bit more athmosphere.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.15]], mutagenic fog inflicted [[bad mutation]]s on the player each turn, rather than giving them magical contamination.\n*Mutagenic fog was added in [[0.8]].\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

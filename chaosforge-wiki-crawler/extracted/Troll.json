{"title":"Troll","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Troll","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''This page is about the player [[species]]. For the monster, see [[Troll (monster)]]. If you were looking for monstrous trolls in general, see [[List of trolls]].''\n{{flavour|Trolls are monstrous creatures with powerful claws. They have thick, knobbly skins of any colour from putrid green to mucky brown, which are covered in patches of thick fur.\n\nThey are incredibly strong, and regenerate rapidly from even the most terrible wounds. However, they are hopeless at spellcasting and learn most skills very slowly.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*Trolls are '''[[Size#Player Sizes|large]]''' species:\n**Like all large creatures, they receive an [[EV]] and [[Dodging]] penalty.\n**Unlike regular sized species, they can use [[giant club]]s,  [[giant spiked club]]s, and [[large rock]]s.\n**Their bodies do not fit into [[boots]], [[gloves]], [[helmet]]s, or most [[body armour]] (they can only wear [[robe]]s, [[animal skin]]s, [[troll leather armour]], and [[dragon scales]]). In addition, [[buckler]]s are too small for them to use.\n**They can attack and move normally in [[shallow water]].\n*'''[[Tough Skin]] 1:''' Trolls get +1 [[AC]].\n*'''[[Shaggy Fur]] 1:''' Trolls get +1 [[AC]].\n*'''[[Claws]] 3:''' Trolls have claws for hands, greatly improving their performance in [[unarmed combat]]. Claws deal +6 damage, though they can decapitate [[hydra]]s.\n*'''[[Regeneration (mutation)|Regeneration]] 1:''' Trolls heal very quickly (+0.8 HP/turn).\n\nTrolls have a base [[Strength]] of 15, [[Intelligence]] of 4 and [[Dexterity]] of 5 (before Background modifiers) and one less base [[magic points|magic point]] than normal.\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Warriors:''' [[Fighter]], [[Gladiator]]\n*'''Zealots:''' [[Berserker]]\n*'''Warrior-Mages:''' [[Warper]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Hedge Wizard]], [[Earth Elementalist]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[strength]] every 3rd level.\n*30% more [[hit points]] than average.\n*+3 [[willpower]] per level.\n\n==Starting Skills and Equipment==\nTrolls start with the skills and equipment listed for their background, with these exceptions:\n*Incompatible body armour is replaced with an [[animal skin]] or [[robe]].\n*[[Helmet]]s are replaced with [[hat]]s.\n*[[Buckler]]s are replaced with [[kite shield]]s.\n*Any [[Armour]] skill is replaced with [[Dodging]].\n*[[Javelin]]s are replaced with [[large rock]]s.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Easy}}\n\nTroll is a simple, generally easy, species to play. With great HP, fast regeneration, high strength, and powerful [[Claws]], Trolls are great at being [[Unarmed Combat]] bruisers. With terrible aptitudes in most other skills, they aren't good at much else. As one of the two species big enough for [[large rock]]s, [[Throwing]] is a viable secondary skill.\n\nTrolls are one of the strongest species in the early game, due to the Claws and high HP. But, as the game progresses, their low [[AC]] (unable to wear most body armour) and [[EV]] (large size, poor aptitude) can become a big issue. So, despite having +30% HP, Trolls can feel flimsy by the mid game. [[Shield]]s are recommended to mitigate this.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Troll}}\n\n==Strategy==\nBeyond Unarmed Combat, Trolls have a couple of options:\n*Their [[Maces & Flails]] is at -1 aptitude, and Trolls are one of a few species that can wield [[giant club]]s. Unarmed is generally ''more practical'', since Claws are stronger early game, and it allows use of shield. But weapon use isn't out of the question, namely if you find an amazing [[artefact]].\n*[[Throwing]], as mentioned, is a great support skill. Even at 0 skill, large rocks can pack a punch (but are very slow to throw).\n*With poor [[intelligence]] and magical aptitudes, their casting isn't great. However, it doesn't mean it's impossible. Low-level support spells like [[Blink]], [[Swiftness]], and [[Mephitic Cloud]] can prove to be useful, especially if you're stuck in light armour.\n*Like with other species, [[Evocations]] can be a great resource. Trolls don't get any special bonus, but they don't get much of a penalty, either.\n\nTrolls should not use Unarmed Combat against [[hydra]]s - claws count as edged weapons, so they will cut and re-grow their heads. Viable options include large rocks, [[potion of lignification]] (which meld claws), [[Ice Form]], powerful attack [[wand]]s, or [[god]] abilities. Simply retreating can also work.\n\nDue to their large size, Trolls get a penalty to EV and the [[Dodging]] skill. Poor [[dexterity]] doesn't help. Nonetheless, it may be necessary to train Dodging to shore up your defenses.\n\n===God Choice===\n[[God|Religion]] tends to be a major factor in rounding out one's character, and Trolls are no exception. A few recommendations are below; note that this list is by no means comprehensive or exhaustive. \n*[[Okawaru]]'s Heroism is obtained quickly, and the +5 skill levels help Unarmed Combat the most. Armour gifts are guaranteed to fit your large body, which helps in finding a heavy body armour.\n*[[Trog]]'s abilities require no skill training to activate, and provide [[berserk]], [[willpower]], even greater health regeneration, and very strong summons.\n*[[Ignis]] provides an even stronger 'guarantee' in the early game, but fizzles out at a time where a lack of armour starts to become noticeable.\n*[[Elyvilon]] offers strong panic buttons and the ability to pacify most dangerous opponents with smite-targeting.\n*[[Jiyva]] can be a powerful and interesting god choice for Trolls, as for many other characters. Early altars are very rare, but if you see one, consider giving Jiyva a spin. However, if you cannot access Jiyva in the early dungeon, passing up on any god choices until late Lair will dramatically hurt your chances to win the game. \n*[[Ru]] can be a tempting choice for trolls. By sacrificing skills that you were unlikely to train anyway, you gain access to powerful and useful abilities while your aura of power makes enemies less threatening. Gather the hydras and death yaks together and reveal the annihilating truth to them! Lair has never been easier.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], [[size#Large|large]] species, including Trolls, could wield [[shield]]s more easily, received slightly less SH from [[kite shield]]s, and moved slowly in shallow water. \n*Prior to [[0.29]], Trolls had a -2 [[Shields]] aptitude. This was buffed due to the nerf to large-size shield wearing in 0.28.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Trolls had +1 HP/turn regeneration.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Trolls had [[Shaggy Fur]] 1 and two levels of [[Tough Skin]] (for net 2 AC), but Regeneration only gave +0.4 HP/turn.\n*Prior to the removal of the [[hunger]] system in [[0.26]], trolls had an innate [[gourmand]] intrinsic, which helped offset their incredibly fast metabolism (+3 from [[Fast Metabolism]] 3, as well as an additional +3 for being a troll). They started with an extra [[ration]] to compensate.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], only races with innate Claws mutation had the extra +2 [[to-hit]] bonus. That bonus now applies to anyone with the mutation.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Trolls started with the [[Saprovore]] 2 mutation.\n\n{{species}}"}

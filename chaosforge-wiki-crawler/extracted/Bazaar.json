They never stay in one place for very long.\n\nWhile some merchants set up shop in the dungeon, others travel in caravans from place to place. The bazaars of these intinerant traders feature a number of different shops and often have better stock than the sedentary ones, sometimes even at a bargain.\n}}\n{{Flavour|Aside from the vendors who've set up their stores at various places in the dungeon, there are others trying to make a living by traveling from place to place. Bazaars feature a number of different shops and often have better stock than the sedentary ones, sometimes even at a bargain. Once you hear the clinking of coins, be sure to hurry up and find the impromptu marketplace before the caravan moves on!\n\nAlso be warned that their nomadic lifestyle has taught these sellers to appropriate any items an adventurer might leave behind, and then leave quickly, probably to sell them elsewhere.}}\n\n[[File:Bazaar portal.png]] '''Bazaars''' are small [[portal]]s filled with various [[shop]]s. They can appear multiple times per run, each with a different selection of shops.\n\nBazaars are safe; they never contain hostile monsters. Some [[Disposition#Peaceful|peaceful]] monsters (\"customers\") will show up, but even if angered, they are weak and give no XP. If you worship [[Okawaru]] or have [[Ru#Sacrifices|Sacrificed Love]], these customers won't show up. If you worship [[Xom]], the customers will be random [[demon]]s and other chaotic monsters.<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|dat/des/portals/bazaar.des|100}}</ref> This is not the same as Xom's special bazaars, which you can only be brought to randomly while worshipping Xom.\n\n==Xom Bazaars==\nRarely, [[Xom]] can decide to bring you to a special bazaar with a unique set of items for sale. The environment is similar to the [[Abyss]], with random chaotic monsters wandering around, but is otherwise as harmless as a normal bazaar. You can be brought to multiple different Xom bazaars in a single game.\n\nThe shops in these special locations have a different set of items, usually selling chaotic items such as [[potions of mutation]] and artifacts with *Contam, or items with many properties but also a likely bad property (such as rF-).<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|dat/des/portals/bazaar.des|2081}}</ref> The main attraction, however, is that [[fixedart|unique artifacts]] can spawn with an additional chaos brand in the shops. This is unique to Xom bazaars, and also stacks with whatever brand they have normally.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], there were non-timed bazaars. You could enter these at any time, but leaving would cause them to disappear as normal. Also, Xom bazaars did not exist.\n*Prior to [[0.31]], peaceful customers didn't show up in bazaars.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Portals}}\n\n[[Category:Portals]]"}

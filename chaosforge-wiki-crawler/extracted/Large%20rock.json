Only [[troll]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[list of giants|giants]] have the sheer size necessary to throw these effectively. They have the best damage of all throwing projectiles, but have a high base delay. At Throwing 0, it takes 2 full turns in order to throw one.\n\nLarge rocks have a 4% chance of [[mulch]]ing when thrown, slightly lower than other physical projectiles. This destroys the rock, though does +33% more damage.\n\n==Strategy==\nStrong at high skill. It's often worth training Throwing on large species. Even at low skill, it can be worth throwing at melee enemies, though watch out for the delay. (If you don't have high Throwing skill, don't throw at a melee enemy at melee range.)\n\nAnother ''large'' benefit of rocks is that they are plentiful - often carried by [[cyclops]]es and [[stone giant]]s. Large rocks are more common than [[boomerang]]s and [[javelin]]s ''combined''.<ref>[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-SfdqTkjUkQ9kB9hyJTqt7grYzSDibv-XpPbEEFinCQ/edit#gid=523653744 Objstats 0.29 (Shoals/Spider)]</ref> In the late game, this makes large rocks a lot more disposable than javelins, since the latter can pierce through enemies.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

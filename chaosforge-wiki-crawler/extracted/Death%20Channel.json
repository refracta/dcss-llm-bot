{"title":"Death Channel","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Death_Channel","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Death Channel''' is a level 6 [[Necromancy]] spell that raises monsters into [[spectral thing]]s.\n\n==Useful Info==\nGrants the '''DChan''' status for a duration. While active, it raises slain [[natural]], [[holy]], and [[demon]]ic monsters into [[spectral thing]]s 100% of the time. Spectral things are based on the monster as it was in life.\n\nEach spectral thing lasts for around 81 turns. But if the DChan duration runs out, all spectral things immediately vanish. You cannot recast Death Channel to extend the spell duration. \n\nIncreasing your [[spell power]] increases the duration of the spell; it does not increase duration of individual spectral things. \n\nThis spell, uniquely, works with all other \"[[Necromancy#Undead_Creation|corpse-destroying]]\" [[Necromancy]] spells. You may have DChan and one other necromancy effect work on a monster at any given time. It also works with [[Gozag]]'s gold touch. However, it does ''not'' work with [[Yredelemnul]] (who is able to create spectral things).\n\n==Strategy==\nLike other Necromancy spells, Death Channel is great against crowds. Cast this spell once, kill a few monsters, and you'll have an army of [[drain]]ing spectral things. Devastates large packs of enemies, even in [[Zot]] and the [[extended game]].\n\nOther than the MP cost, there is no reason ''not'' to use Death Channel alongside [[Animate Dead]], or any other undead-creating spell.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Death Channel could be recast when active. This did not affect spectral thing duration, but did extend the DChan status.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Death Channel did not work on holy or demonic creatures, nor creatures that did not leave a corpse.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Death Channel had a summon duration of 6 (or ~170 turns) instead of 5, and the spectres did not time out once the spell ended.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], the spectral summons would take stairs with you.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Death Channel had a duration half as long.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Derived undead]]"}

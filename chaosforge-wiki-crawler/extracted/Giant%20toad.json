Unlike the [[water moccasin]], it's not poison resistant. These frogs are worth three times the [[XP]] of their green counterparts. They can be found in the Dungeon, but the most likely place to find one is in [[the Lair]].\n\n==Tips and tricks==\n\n==History==\nGiant toads were removed in [[0.10]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

This divine attention makes it easier to please your god, but your god will also take more notice of your transgressions. The amulet will drain some of your divine favour when removed.}}\n\nWearing an '''amulet of faith''' causes your current [[god]] (as well as any former gods you've abandoned) to pay more attention to you, causing the following effects:\n\n===Pros===\n*[[Piety]] gain is 25% faster.\n*Gods that grant god gifts do so 33% more frequently.\n\n===Cons===\n*Removing the amulet will result in the loss of one third of your piety, but will never cause excommunication, or drop piety too close to excommunication.\n*Having Faith during penance (even if you are currently atheist) will make godly-wrath happen 1/3 more often. This ends the penance more quickly, but causes wrath effects to happen more frequently to do so.\n\n===Unusual Behavior===\n*The following gods are not affected, either way:\n**'''[[Ashenzari]]''' - (benefits from cursing still apply)\n**'''[[Gozag Ym Sagoz]]''' - Gozag cares for nothing but gold!\n**'''[[Ignis]]''' - Already offers all the fire that remains.\n*The following gods have other behaviors:\n**'''[[Ru]]''' - Increases the rate at which sacrifices are offered, but slows the rate when removed. No effect at full piety.\n**'''[[Xom]]''' - Xom's piety fluctuation occurs 33% faster than normal, and it acts more often. Removing the amulet has no consequences.\n**'''[[Yredelemnul]]''' - Corpses rise 33% more often (to 67%), but takes away some undead (if any) when removed.\n*[[Demigod]]s will \"feel a surge of self-confidence\" upon putting on an amulet of faith. This has no mechanical benefit, however.\n*[[Mummies]] already have innate faith, and receive no extra benefit from the amulet.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe value of an amulet of faith is entirely dependent on how much use you can get out of your god's piety.\n\nGods with powerful abilities and/or gifts, such as [[Nemelex]], will obviously see more benefit. When worshipping such gods, faith can be as useful - if not more so - as the other combat-oriented amulets, ''assuming you are actually using said abilities''. Powerful abilities that are unused won't help you. Conversely, gods focusing more on passive abilities, like [[Vehumet]], won't find as much use from this amulet.\n\nThe piety cost to remove an amulet of faith can be intimidating, but it can be managed. For gods with finite gifts ([[Vehumet]] and [[Ru]]), you can take the amulet off after receiving them at minimal cost. For [[Uskayaw]], the piety loss is irrelevant since you'll quickly lose piety out of combat anyway. For other gods, the piety loss - which is entirely voluntary - is rarely devastating. On the other hand, the benefits of wearing faith for an extended period of time can be immense.\n\n== History ==\n*Prior to [[0.18]], this amulet granted a 33% bonus to piety, not a 25% bonus.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], this amulet increased the chance that certain gods might protect you from harm (your piety was treated as being 33% higher for such checks).\n\n{{jewellery}}\n[[Category:Religion]]"}

The caster randomly conjured only one of those effects at a time instead of two.\n*In [[0.19]], blood saints got [[Call of Chaos]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], they could temporally heal themselves and nearby allies with [[Ephemeral Infusion]]. Also, each casting of [[Legendary Destruction]] injured them for 10 HP.\n*Blood saints were added in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Demonspawn]]"}

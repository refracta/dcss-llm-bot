Not only does it enhance these spells, but the melee damage can be decent if you train some Staves and Evocations.\n\nFor those who never plan on using Alchemy, this staff can still be quite useful:\n*It can evoke [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]], even with 0 skill training. OTR is a devastatingly strong AOE spell in the early-game (Dungeon, [[Lair]], [[Orcish Mines|Orc]], and [[Spider's Nest]]). While the staff takes up the weapon slot, you can always swap it in or out.\n*It is one of the few sources of poison ''immunity''. In addition to all the benefits of rPois, it prevents the paralytic poison of [[hornet]]s and [[jorogumo]] 100% of the time. When tackling [[Spider's Nest|Spider]] or [[Snake]], some form of poison resistance/immunity is nice to have.\n\nThe staff will occasionally spawn in a special [[vault]] full of assorted poisonous enemies ([[list of arthropods|bees, spiders,]] and [[list of snakes|snakes]]). This can be an excellent find early on, though attempting to reach the staff at the end without already having a source of poison resistance can be risky. [[Frozen Ramparts]] is quite effective here, since it ignores the high evasion such creatures tend to share, nothing in the vault resists cold (and it will slow the cold-blooded snakes), and the tight quarters will force multiple enemies to take damage each turn.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], the staff boosted [[Poison Magic]] instead of Alchemy.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the staff had a fail check for evoking [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] (but only 5 [[Evocations]] skill was required to get 100% success rate). Also, OTR could be activated from the [[v]] menu, instead of being an '''a'''bility.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the staff of Olgreb had a chance to cast [[Venom Bolt]] as well as Olgreb's Toxic Radiance when evoked, and only had a resistance-piercing chance to inflict poison instead of dealing additional poison damage.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], its enchantment level was based on your skill with [[Poison Magic]] (Poison Magic/3).\n*Prior to [[0.14]], it only granted poison resistance instead of complete immunity.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Staves]]"}

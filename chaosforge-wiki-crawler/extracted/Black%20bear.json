{"title":"Black bear","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Black_bear","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | bears}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Black bears''' are the weakest members of the bear family. They have surprisingly puny attacks and no defenses to speak of, but they will go [[berserk]] when seriously wounded.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nTry to kill it quickly as soon as it goes berserk. Apart from that, any decent melee fighter can take one on toe-to-toe, while any school of magic can make short work of it. Just don't send your [[deep elf]] [[hedge wizard]] into melee with a berserk black bear.\n\n==History==\n* Prior to [[0.27]], black bears were practically immune to [[fear]]; they would go berserk when inflicted by fear, ending it in the process. This was because their Berserker Rage is an [[spell slot flags|emergency flag]] spell. In 0.27, fleeing monsters now use escape flag rather than emergency flag spells, which stopped this behavior.\n* Prior to [[0.6]], they could not go berserk."}

{"title":"Snake Pit","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Snake_Pit","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|The corridors of the Snake Pit are home to all varieties of serpent, and are inhabited by a society of powerful nagas and salamanders.\n\nA dungeon features only one of the Snake Pit and Spider Nest branches.\n\nThe entrance to this branch can be found between levels 2 and 4 of the Lair of Beasts.\n\nThis branch is 4 levels deep.\n\nThis branch contains the serpentine rune of Zot.}}\n\n[[File:Snake entry.png]] The '''Snake Pit''' is a 4-floor [[branch]] found in [[the Lair]]. Those who explore it are rewarded with the serpentine [[rune of Zot]], but must deal with the many [[list of snakes|snakes]], [[list of nagas|nagas, and salamanders]] that call these halls home.\n\nThe entrance to the Snake Pit is located between [[Lair]]:2 and Lair:3. If you find Snake, you will not find the [[Spider's Nest]] in your current game. \n\n==Layout==\nThe Snake Pit's layout is very variable, ranging  from collections of small square rooms connected by [[door]]ed hallways to wide open areas, occasionally spotted with bodies of water. It most closely resembles [[the Dungeon]], but without some of its more exotic layouts. Most walls are made out of rock, which can be [[wand of digging|dug]] through. \n\nUnlike Spider, this branch generates [[shop]]s, though this is by no means guaranteed.\n\n===Snake:4===\nSnake:4 will always contain a stone-walled, heavily-guarded rune vault which is drastically different from the rest of the Snake Pits, but the specific design will vary from game to game. This vault will take up a large portion of Snake:4, but the rest of the floor will generally be made up of simple rooms and hallways.\n\n==Strategy==\nAs with the other Lair branches, you won't want to enter Snake when you first encounter it; few characters can handle its threats so early. Poison resistance is highly recommended (but not required) - you may want to wait if you don't have rPois.\n\nMost of the monsters in Snake consist of naga packs (slow moving) and snakes (fast). \n*Nagas can [[constrict]], making it hard to escape (even a [[scroll of blinking]] can fail), and each naga comes with its own abilities. [[Naga warrior]]s are tough melee threats with all sorts of weapons, [[naga sharpshooter]]s can hit for upwards of 40 damage with [[smite-targeted]] projectiles.\n*Snakes are hard to escape from. [[Anaconda]]s are fast, constricting threats, [[mana viper]]s can drain your MP, and [[shock serpent]]s are high damage electric threats.\n*There's also salamanders, fiery enemies at normal speed. [[Salamander mystic]]s can [[haste]] other nearby nagas and salamanders, and [[salamander tyrant]]s have highly damaging fire spells.\n\nSince snakes and salamanders are faster than their naga brethren, a common tactic is to back away to separate the group. The same applies to [[naga mage]]s and [[nagaraja]]s that cast [[Haste]] on themselves.\n\nSome of the more dangerous monsters include:\n*{{monsterlink|Guardian serpent}} - these aren't terribly dangerous on their own. However, their [[Blink Allies Encircling]] can quickly surround you with monsters in the ''serpent's'' [[line of sight]] - including monsters that you didn't know about. Being constricted by 8 nagas is a very quick death.\n*{{monsterlink|Nagaraja}} - the most powerful nagas, nagarajas are tough and dangerous threats. They can [[Haste]] themselves, increasing their damage significantly (and making them faster than most players).\n*{{monsterlink|Salamander tyrant}} - As mentioned, these salamanders have very strong fire spells. Their [[Eruption]] creates lava, and [[Pyroclastic Surge]] can only be used if you're on or adjacent to lava. By avoiding lava (if at all possible), you make it less likely for you to be hit by a fire spell.\n*{{monsterlink|Shock serpent}} - Buffed [[electric eel]]s, these fast creatures fire Electrical Bolts. The bolts can [[doublezap]], much like [[Shock]], so try not to stand in front of walls.\n\n===Useful Traits===\nAs mentioned above, poison resistance is very helpful, since there's a high amount of poison-themed enemies. All nagas can [[Spit Poison]], but resistance also reduces the damage of [[Poison Arrow]], and [[naga ritualist]]s can inflict rPois- with their [[Virulence]] spell. Other than poison, the following elements are worth resisting:\n*[[Fire]] - [[List of nagas#Salamander Types|Salamander]] bands are common. rF+ resists against common salamanders and tyrants alike.\n*[[Electricity]] - [[Shock serpent]]s are the only common electric enemy, but they can deal high damage quickly. Their bolts can [[doublezap]], they can fire twice per turn, and their damage ignores 1/2 of your AC.\n\n==Snake:4 Vaults==\nThe bottom floor of the Snake Pit will always contain a large, heavily-guarded rune vault. There are a couple of possibilities:\n*'''Three Stairways''': One of the nastier rune vaults, this vault's entrance chamber is filled with a variety of nagas, including nagarajas and [[guardian serpent]]s, as well as three upward [[stairs|staircases]]. Because of this, players often find themselves out in the open facing several dangerous enemies as soon as they enter the floor (though due to the fact that one of these staircases may be an escape hatch, there may also be a normal staircase leading to another part of the floor). After clearing this chamber, there are several narrow hallways and small chambers densely packed with further guards, with the rune located all the way in the back.\n*'''Serpent's Egg''': A large rectangular chamber with an oval stone chamber in the middle, open at the top. The entire chamber is heavily populated with nagas of all sorts, and the rune can be found resting against the inner wall of the \"egg\".\n*'''Caduceus''': This vault consists of a large rectangular block with a straight hallway running through the middle and a winding hallway weaving back and forth over the central. All along these paths, nagas of various sorts will be waiting. The winding hallway eventually ends in a narrow, heavily-guarded chamber containing the rune, as well as several [[nagaraja]]s. This is by far the easiest rune vault, as almost any character can lure the guards out one or two at a time, eventually clearing their way to the end.\n*'''Naga Fortress''': The most elaborate of the Snake:4 vaults, this consists of a large trapezoidal stone structure taking up roughly half of the floor. Accessed from either the right or left corner of the structure, it consists of a series of hallways weaving back and forth over each other, eventually ending in the rune chamber. Each chamber contains a variety of nagas, and most also contain some lava with a few [[salamander mystic]]s or [[lindwurm]]s. However, the wide door to the final chamber instead hides anacondas and many other snakes, including [[shock serpent]]s.\n*'''Spirals''': A large corridor with two spirals branching off in each direction, guarded by various nagas and some guardian serpents. There are no chokepoints or sharp corners, but if you're stealthy you can pick off one or two nagas at a time. One spiral will contain the rune and the other will contain an acquirement-level item (or occasionally a rune mimic!)\n*'''Pools''': This vault is filled with pools and [[sea snake]]s. After opening a wide door you will find a small chamber with various snakes and a few nagas. Beyond this is another chamber with more nagas and sea snakes, and the final, larger chamber which contains similar threats.\n*'''Serpentine Throne''': A well-guarded snaking corridor leads to a large throne room filled with nagas. The rune is at the very back.\n*'''Scales''' : A triangular stone structure with a double door entrance. Guarded by nagarajas, nagas, snakes and possibly [[Vashnia]]. Rune can be found in one of the three rooms in the back of the vault.\n*'''Quicksilver Temple''': Has [[statue]]s of dragons on its entrance. Guarded by 2 [[quicksilver dragon]]s, this vault is very dangerous to tackle early - these dragons are fast and [[dispel]] buffs like haste and teleport.\n\nNote that salamanders are uncommon in these vaults, with the exception of the fortress.\n\n==Monsters==\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Anaconda}} || {{monsterlink|Black mamba}} || {{monsterlink|Electric eel}} || {{monsterlink|Guardian serpent}} || {{monsterlink|Mana viper}} || {{monsterlink|Sea snake}}\n|-\n| {{Green|N}} [[File:Naga (monster).png]] '''[[Naga (monster)|Naga]]''' || {{monsterlink|Naga mage}} || {{monsterlink|Naga ritualist}} || {{monsterlink|Naga sharpshooter}} || {{monsterlink|Naga warrior}} || {{monsterlink|Nagaraja}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Salamander}} || {{monsterlink|Salamander mystic}} || {{monsterlink|Salamander tyrant}} || {{monsterlink|Shock serpent}}\n|}\n\n===Uniques===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Agnes}}\n| {{monsterlink|Aizul}}\n| {{monsterlink|Asterion}}\n| {{monsterlink|Azrael}}\n| {{monsterlink|Bai Suzhen}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Donald}}\n| {{monsterlink|Frances}}\n| {{monsterlink|Jorgrun}}\n| {{monsterlink|Josephine}}\n| {{monsterlink|Kirke}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Louise}}\n| {{monsterlink|Mara}}\n| {{monsterlink|Nikola}}\n| {{monsterlink|Roxanne}}\n| {{monsterlink|Rupert}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Saint Roka}}\n| {{monsterlink|Vashnia}}\n|}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], [[salamander tyrant]]s were introduced.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], you could find [[salamander stormcaller]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], there were [[salamander firebrand]]s instead of stormcallers patrolling the Snake Pit.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Snake Pit was 5 levels deep instead of 4, like the other Lair branches.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], you could find [[ball python]]s and [[adder]]s in this branch.\n*The monster set for the Snake Pit was greatly expanded in [[0.14]], adding [[salamander]]s, [[salamander mystic]]s, [[naga sharpshooter]]s, [[naga ritualist]]s, [[shock serpent]]s, [[mana viper]]s, and [[Vashnia]].

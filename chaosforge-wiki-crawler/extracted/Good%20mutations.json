{"title":"Good mutations","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Good_mutations","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\nThis is a list of all of the '''good mutations''' which can be acquired. While most of these are useful to any character, some may in fact be significantly detrimental to some builds. Even so, they are included here because \"good mutation\" is a technical term in the game, not a qualitative judgment. Any of these can be acquired through any source of good mutations, such as a [[potion of mutation]].\n\n==Offensive==\nSome of these mutations will prevent your character from wearing items in certain equipment slots. While this penalty may outweigh the gain your character receives, bear in mind that races which cannot use those slots ([[ogre]]s, [[troll]]s, [[felid]]s, etc.) lose nothing.\n\n===Fangs===\n{{:Fangs}}\n\n===Beak===\n{{:Beak}}\n\n===Claws===\n{{:Claws}}\n\n===Horns===\n{{:Horns}}===Hooves=== <!-- This weird formatting was the only way I could get this page to render without there being extra white space in between these mutations. -->\n{{:Hooves}}===Talons===\n{{:Talons}}\n===Passive Freeze===\n{{:Passive Freeze}}\n===MP-Powered Wands===\n{{:MP-Powered Wands}}\n\n==Defensive==\n===Shaggy Fur===\n{{:Shaggy Fur}}\n\n===Camouflage===\n{{:Camouflage}}\n\n==Resistances==\n===Fire Resistance===\n{{:Heat Resistance}}\n\n===Cold Resistance===\n{{:Cold Resistance (mutation)}}\n\n===Electricity Resistance===\n{{:Shock Resistance}}\n\n===Poison Resistance===\n{{:Poison Resistance (mutation)}}\n\n===Strong-Willed===\n{{:Strong-Willed}}\n\n===Clarity===\n{{:Clarity (mutation)}}\n\n===Mutation Resistance===\n{{:Mutation Resistance (mutation)}}\n\n==Perception==\n===Acute Vision===\n{{:Acute Vision}}\n\n===Antennae===\n{{:Antennae}}\n\n===Sense Surroundings===\n{{:Passive Mapping}}\n\n==General==\n===Evolution===\n{{:Evolution}}\n\n===Wild Magic===\n{{:Wild Magic (mutation)}}\n\n===Improved Attributes===\n{{:Improved Attributes}}\n\n===Regeneration===\n{{:Regeneration (mutation)}}\n\n===Robust===\n{{:Robust}}\n\n===High MP===\n{{:High MP}}\n\n==Scales==\nAs they level, non-\"monstrous\" [[demonspawn]] naturally receive three ranks of a single scales mutation; other sources of mutation will only give the scales they would get naturally. [[Draconian]]s have natural scales independent of these mutations, and are unable to gain other scales. Currently only checked for iridescent scales, this may be a bug.\n\n===Iridescent Scales===\n{{:Iridescent Scales}}\n\n===Large Bone Plates===\n{{:Large Bone Plates}}\n\n===Thin Skeletal Structure===\n{{:Thin Skeletal Structure}}\n\n===Sturdy Frame===\n{{:Sturdy Frame}}\n\n==Species exclusive==\nThese mutations may only be acquired by certain [[species]]. Does not include [[demonspawn mutation]]s, and only includes mutations that can be acquired/improved randomly.\n\n===Spit Poison===\n{{:Spit Poison (mutation)}}\n\n===Stinger===\n{{:Stinger}}\n\n===Big Wings===\n{{:Big Wings}}\n\n===Tentacle Spike===\n{{:Tentacle Spike}}\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Bad mutations]]\n*[[Demonspawn mutations]]\n*[[Jiyva mutations]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], you could obtain many different [[demonspawn mutation#Scales Facets|scale mutations]]; there was a hard limit of 3 levels (of any combination of scale mutation) at a time. [[Blink (mutation)]] was removed, [[Noise Dampening]] was added.\n*Prior to [[0.14]] the Fast mutation was available as a random mutation and the Antennae mutation did not show invisible enemy indicators outside range 3 & 5 at ranks 1 & 2.\n*In [[0.13]], the [[Teleport Control]], [[Strong Stiff]], and [[Flexible Weak]] mutations were removed, and Improved Attributes was changed to only have 2 levels, each of which granted +2 to an attribute.\n\n[[Category:Intrinsic]]\n[[Category:Mutations]]\n[[Category:Good Mutations]]\n[[Category:List]]"}

{"title":"Rune of Zot","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Rune_of_Zot","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|A talisman which allows entry into Zot's domain.}}\n\n'''Runes of Zot''' are required to enter [[The Realm of Zot]]; there lies the [[Orb of Zot]], the goal of your quest, in its fifth floor.\n\n==Useful Info==\nRunes can be used to open [[rune lock]]s:\n* In order to enter [[Zot]], you need 3 runes of Zot.\n* In order to exit [[the Vaults]], you need a rune of Zot.\n* [[Treasure trove]]s may ask for either the Slimy or Abyssal rune for entry.\nRunes do not occupy inventory slots, and can never be destroyed. Once you've collected a rune, it stays collected for the rest of the game.\n\nIn any given game, there are 15 possible runes to obtain. You can see what runes you have by typing '''}''' (which also shows you what runes you can get) or by checking the '''% /''' character overview screen, below the lines for your abilities and traits.\n\nHaving more runes also increases your [[score]].\n\n==Rune locations==\nRunes can be found on the bottom floors of several dungeon [[branch]]es. There are 17 runes in total, but only 15 are possible in any given game:\n\n*[[The Lair]] has no rune itself but contains 3 branches which do.  It always contains:\n**[[Image:Slimy_rune.png]] '''[[The Slime Pits]]:5''' contains the slimy rune of Zot.\n:plus one of the two watery branches:\n:*[[Image:Decaying_rune.png]] '''[[The Swamp]]:4''' contains the decaying rune of Zot.\n:*[[Image:Barnacled_rune.png]] '''[[The Shoals]]:4''' contains the barnacled rune of Zot.\n:and one of the two poisonous branches:\n:*[[Image:Serpentine_rune.png]] '''[[The Snake Pit]]:4''' contains the serpentine rune of Zot.\n:*[[Image:Gossamer_rune.png]] '''[[The Spider's Nest]]:4''' contains the gossamer rune of Zot.\n*[[Image:Silver_rune.png]] '''[[The Vaults]]:5''' contains the silver rune of Zot. An entrance to The Crypt can be found earlier in the branch.\n**[[The Crypt]] has no rune itself, but contains an entrance to The Tomb.\n***[[Image:Gold_rune.png]] '''[[The Tomb]]:3''' contains the golden rune of Zot.\n\nYou will also come across runes in the following bonus levels:\n*[[Image:Abyssal_rune.png]] '''[[The Abyss]]''' contains the abyssal rune of Zot. \n**This rune has a low chance of being generated on floors 3 to 7, with deeper floors having higher rune generation rates (but also more monsters); you'll know its location when it spawns. If you happen to be a follower of Lugonu, this rate is greatly accelerated. If you see the rune but cannot get it (e.g. if the Abyss shifts before you can reach it), do not despair: the game will keep generating abyssal runes until you pick one up.\n*'''[[Pandemonium]]''' contains five runes.  \n**The four unique Pandemonium lords each guard a unique rune that is generated ''once''. Leaving the level without the rune means it is lost forever:\n***[[Image:Glowing_rune.png]] '''[[Mnoleg]]''' guards the glowing rune of Zot.\n***[[Image:Magical_rune.png]] '''[[Lom Lobon]]''' guards the magical rune of Zot.\n***[[Image:Fiery_rune.png]] '''[[Cerebov]]''' guards the fiery rune of Zot.\n***[[Image:Dark_rune.png]] '''[[Gloorx Vloq]]''' guards the dark rune of Zot.\n**The fifth is the '''demonic rune''' of Zot.  \n***This may be found in any Pan floor without another rune, usually guarded by a random [[pandemonium lord]]. Most floors have a 1/9 chance, but a few [[vault]]s always have it (see [[Pandemonium#The Demonic Rune|Pandemonium]] for details). When a vault with a guaranteed rune appears, it will be announced: {{crawlquote|The tension of great conflict fills the air! The demonic rune of Zot may be found here.<br>''or''<br>A powerful Pandemonium lord resides here. It guards the demonic rune of Zot.}} Like the abyssal rune, it will be regenerated until picked up.\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n| [[Image:Demonic_rune_1.png]] || [[Image:Demonic_rune_2.png]] || [[Image:Demonic_rune_3.png]]\n|-\n| [[Image:Demonic_rune_4.png]] || [[Image:Demonic_rune_5.png]] || [[Image:Demonic_rune_6.png]]\n|}\n*'''[[Hell]]''' contains a rune in each of its four subbranches:\n**[[Image:Iron_rune.png]] [[Dispater]] in [[The Iron City of Dis]]:7 guards the iron rune of Zot.\n**[[Image:Icy_rune.png]] [[Antaeus]] in [[Cocytus]]:7 guards the icy rune of Zot.\n**[[Image:Obsidian_rune.png]] [[Asmodeus]] in [[Gehenna]]:7 guards the obsidian rune of Zot.\n**[[Image:Bone_rune.png]] [[Ereshkigal]] in [[Tartarus]]:7 guards the bone rune of Zot.\n\n==Strategy and Difficulty==\nAll runes are not equal in difficulty of obtaining them. Below is a list of runes in rough order of difficulty, with some basic strategy notes. See the articles on the specific branches for more details. Depending on your character build, some of the branches may be different in difficulty from what is given here.\n\n===Easy===\nThe four Lair branch runes are the generally the easiest to get. If not in relative difficulty, then they at least have the lowest power level. Players will typically acquire both of the 2 runes that have generated in their game.\n\n*'''Serpentine''' ([[Snake Pit]]): Home to the [[venom]]ous, [[constriction|constricting]] [[list of nagas|snakemen]], their salamander brethren, and countless [[list of snakes|snakes]]. [[Poison resistance]] is extremely helpful, and [[fire resistance]] is also recommended. Still, among the easier branches. Make sure you can take a beating or have the ability to avoid melee combat.\n*'''Decaying''' ([[Swamp]]): A waterlogged forest guarded by [[hydra]]s, dangerous [[list of plants|plant]] monsters, amphibious [[undead]], [[list of spriggans|spriggans]], and even more esoteric foes. Poison resistance helps here, as does a source of [[flight]], but you'll probably want to have a good range of resistances just to be safe.\n*'''Barnacled''' ([[Shoals]]): An archipelago patrolled by [[list of merfolk|merfolk]] and other creatures of myth and legend. Teeming with [[polearm]]s and ranged attacks, this area is easier if you have good [[EV]] or [[Repel Missiles#Player sources|Repel Missiles]]. [[Flight]] is helpful here, and [[Invisibility]] (if flying) too.\n*'''Gossamer''' ([[Spider's Nest]]): Most of the monsters in this branch are faster than you and can easily swarm you. Very few of them have ranged attacks, though. [[Ghost moth]]s are especially painful for magical players. Like Snake, poison resistance is a must.\n\n===Medium===\nThese runes can challenge even XL 27 characters, but at least one of them is required for a three rune [[ascension]].\n\n*'''Silver''' ([[The Vaults]]): [[The Vaults#Vaults:5|Vaults:5]] has over a dozen [[vault guard]]s waiting for you around the stairs, requiring you to fight (and potentially attract more dangerous foes), or teleport and fight in dangerous teritory. Several other dangerous opponents such as [[titan]]s, [[storm dragon]]s, [[quicksilver dragon]]s, [[shadow dragon]]s, and [[lich]]es appear in the quadrants.\n*'''Slimy''' ([[Slime Pits]]): Most of Slime is unrewarding, but the final floor consists of a \"boss fight\" with [[the Royal Jelly]]. [[Resist corrosion]] is practically necessary, and [[mutation resistance]] is also very helpful, if available. Be very careful with the Royal Jelly: fight it in the corridors of the central vault. Make sure you can kill things very quickly or take a fair bit of damage, as everything down here hits hard in melee.\n*'''Abyssal''' ([[Abyss]]): The Abyss is an infinite and unmappable plane that contains many sources of mutation and some deadly monsters. It is also somewhat tedious, as the rune might not generate quickly. Try not to get bogged down in fights with dangerous monsters, as teleports take longer to kick in and stairs out are randomly generated.\n\n===Hard===\nFor those looking to expand beyond a basic extension, the runes of the [[Pandemonium]] are good to start with. They are part of the \"extended\" game, and should be treated with care.\n\nWhen entering the [[Pandemonium]], be prepared for a journey. Like the Abyss, the only way out is via a rare return portal. Stairways just conduct you to another of Pan's infinite levels. You will need some protection from [[torment]] - rN+++ is ideal. The place is also littered with [[neqoxec]]s and [[cacodemon]]s, so keep [[potions of mutation]] handy. \n\nOnce you enter the Pandemonium, you are unable to choose which realms appear, and, except for the demonic rune, ''leaving the level means that rune never generates again''. This means you must be ready for all 4 of the unique runes, so come packed with all the resistances you need.\n\n*'''Dark''': [[Gloorx Vloq]] is fast and evasive. rN+++ is vital, as are [[potions of haste]]. Unlike the rest of Pan, you also need [[poison resistance]], as [[miasma]] and [[Poison Arrow]]s will be very painful. Allies, if you can get them, are helpful in ensuring that all of Gloorx Vloq's many attacks, minions, and spells aren't directed against you.\n*'''Glowing''': [[Mutation resistance]] is even more vital here. Try to lure the [[neqoxec]]s around corners, so they don't get tons of free shots at you with [[Malmutate]]. [[Mnoleg]] itself isn't that difficult, although watch out if it starts summoning [[floating eye]]s. Try to fight Mnoleg in a corridor so you won't get mobbed by summoned [[large abomination]]s and [[tentacled monstrosities]].\n*'''Fiery''': As the name suggests, you really need [[fire resistance]] here. rF++ is a bare minimum, and rF+++ is really what you want, since [[Cerebov]]'s sword strips you of one rank of fire resistance. Cerebov has a lot of hit points, so be prepared to teleport away and reengage it several times: it won't have fully healed before you do. Cerebov has poor evasion, so spells such as [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] can be useful against it.\n*'''Magical''': Have at least two levels of [[cold resistance]] and some source of [[electricity resistance]]. [[Lom Lobon]] is fairly weak if you can engage it in melee, although its [[blink]]ing and [[Polar Vortex]] can make that quite difficult. Beware of [[Major Healing]], and be prepared to teleport out.\n*'''Demonic''': The demonic rune spawns with a 1/9 chance in most floors without another rune. A few specific [[vault]]s always have it (it is announced on floor entry):\n**The hellion island vault requires the use of ranged attacks: 10+ [[hellion]]s all dropping 3d15 [[damnation]] bursts on you up to twice a turn leads to a quick death. \n**The [[smiting]] vault is generally doable: [[Shatter]] can greatly assist in getting past it, but even without it sufficient speed will generally let you survive. \n**The draining vault (with [[ghost moth]]s) is not difficult, but requires a [[wand of digging]] to get the rune at all. As for random vaults which might contain the rune, they vary hugely in difficulty. Be prepared to run away.\n\n===Harder===\nThese runes are the riskiest to get. Only go for them if you know what you're doing.\n*'''[[Hell]]''': This area is one of the hardest in the game. It is filled with [[fiend]]s, both found naturally and summoned by the forces of Hell. [[Zin]] gives a piety-dependent chance of blocking Hell effects, making the Hells a lot easier to navigate. Other characters must be prepared for a constant HP and stat [[drain]], making an increased [[regeneration rate]] (or [[TSO]]'s regen on kill) and some form of [[torment]] protection absolutely vital. As with Pandemonium, specific strategies and resistances are needed for each rune:\n**'''Iron''' ([[Dis]]): Dis provides a -8 [[corrosion]] effect to all who enter it. Instead of one specific resistance, you will need a little of everything -- or sometimes a lot of everything, as the last level contains both [[Brimstone fiend]]s and [[Ice fiend]]s. [[Dispater]] himself is no pushover, with powerful earth spells and bringing lots of greater demons to the party.\n**'''Icy''' ([[Cocytus]]): [[Potions]] are unusable here. Have rC+++ for Cocytus. This place is filled with [[Ice fiend]]s, who have, in addition to torment and [[Bolt of Cold]], a horribly damaging cold-branded melee attack. [[Antaeus]] himself hits like a truck but luckily doesn't summon any friends. Unluckily, he tends to be escorted by four Ice fiends. Separate them first.\n**'''Obsidian''' ([[Gehenna]]): [[Scrolls]] are unreadable here. Have rF+++, but be aware that this doesn't help against the numerous [[Brimstone fiend]]s and [[hellion]]s who will gladly spam [[damnation]] at you until you die. Make sure to kill them quickly. [[Asmodeus]] himself is not horribly difficult, but be aware that he is surrounded by a ring of flames and loves summoning fiends and [[Balrug]]s.\n**'''Bone''' ([[Tartarus]]): [[Willpower]] is halved here. If you're not undead, Tartarus can be easier than the other branches. This occurs because rN+++ completely protects you against the draining attacks that are so common there. Be aware that [[Ereshkigal]] is a little meaner than she looks: she may be somewhat low on HP, but she is fast, has absurdly high evasion, can torment, and can summon greater demons that ''also'' torment. If you are undead, be very, very careful, as [[tzitzimimeh]] can and will make short work of you with [[Dispel Undead Range]].\n*'''Golden''' ([[Tomb]]): Like the [[Hells]] and [[Pandemonium]], you will have to endure a fair amount of [[torment]]. Unlike the Hells and Pan, you will also endure mummy [[death curse]]s. This includes stat drain, HP [[drain]], [[negative energy]] damage, [[slow]]ing, and even more [[torment]]. [[Kikubaaqudgha]] provides a good (but not infallible) protection against death curses and torment. [[Necromutation]] protects you from the worst of the curses as well as torment, but be careful of [[Dispel Undead]] from [[ushabti]]u and the occasional [[revenant]]. [[Zin]] can protect you from the stat drain, but [[The Shining One]] is more useful here for the recovery on kills. Either way, you can always do a quick conversion to [[Elyvilon]] and use Purification to cure all the stat damage, then build your piety back up by fighting all the [[list of mummies|mummies]]. See the [[Tomb]] article for more specific strategies, but know that it is very difficult to simply force your way through Tomb. You need something to deal with its nasty effects or you will die.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], getting the abyssal rune gets you 2 XL's worth of XP. This was removed in [[0.29]].\n*Formerly, there were many, indistinguishable demonic runes of Pandemonium, which could be collected ''ad infinitum'' (the record was 250-odd). As of version [[0.9]], the demonic rune is treated like the abyssal rune: once you've picked one up, no more demonic runes will be generated.\n*Before [[0.9]], runes were carried in main inventory, which led to silliness like piling extras on D:1 before going for the Orb, or characters locking themselves out of Zot by leaving their runes inside.\n\n[[Category:Items]]\n[[Category:Strategy]]"}

{"title":"Walking frostbound tome","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Walking_frostbound_tome","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Walking frostbound tomes''' conjure living [[Iceblast]] spells. In addition to their spells, frostbound tomes can deal up to 60 additional cold damage in melee. [[Walking tomes]] are most often seen in [[the Depths]] and the wizlab, [[Tukima's Studio]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n* [[Cold resistance]] definitely helps, though Iceblast ignores 50% of cold resistance.\n* Living spells work similarly to the player [[Foxfire]] spell. It creates a living spell entity, which must have a direct path to a hostile target. If you are in melee range with a tome in a corridor, most of the living spells will be unable to hit you. But unlike the foxfire spell, living spells can spawn behind the player (radius-2 of the walking tome), so a corridor is not foolproof.\n** You can attack a living spell, which will destroy it before it gets the chance to cast itself. Most types of AOE attacks can destroy a few spells while damaging the tome in the process.\n* [[Silence]] works on walking tomes, preventing them from creating living spells.\n\n==History==\n* Prior to [[0.30]], walking tomes could use Conjure Living Spells when [[silence]]d.\n* Walking tomes were added in [[0.28]]."}

Whether the name rings true or is merely appropriated to add mystique is something of a mystery. The armour's innate powers of regeneration and magical protection, however, are hard to dispute.}}\n[[File:Moon_troll_leather_armour.png]] '''''The +5 moon troll leather armour'''''\n\n+5 [[troll leather armour]]\n\n[[Spirit shield]]<br>\n[[MP]]+5<br>\n[[Regeneration rate|Regen]]++ (+1.6 HP/turn)\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''moon troll leather armour'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|1285}}</ref> is a major upgrade over standard [[troll leather armour]], with double the HP regeneration and spirit shield. As a light armour, it's a great option for [[EV]]-based fighters. Casters should be a little weary of spirit shield, which can drain MP at the wrong moment.\n\nMuch like other wearable sources of regeneration, the moon troll leather armour requires attunement at full HP to begin functioning. [[Inhibited Regeneration]] prevents Regen++ from working if monsters are visible.\n\nIf you ever discover [[Lehudib's Moon Base]], you are guaranteed to find the moon troll leather armour on the moon troll itself, unless it has already generated elsewhere.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], this armour only had +4 enchantment, but had 4 base AC.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], this armour provided a total of +2.0 HP/turn.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], this armour provided a total of +0.8 HP/turn.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the regenerative effect did not require attunement at full HP.\n*In [[0.17]], [[Lehudib's Moon Base]] was introduced, finally allowing players to encounter the fearsome [[Lehudib's Moon Base#Moon Troll|moon troll]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], player [[Troll]]s didn't get a regeneration bonus for wearing [[troll leather armour]], so they received only +40 out of +80 regeneration bonus from this unrandart armour.\n*In [[0.14]], the base regeneration rate of this armour was changed from +30 to +40 (Regen++), for a total of +80.\n*Moon troll leather armour was added in [[0.13]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

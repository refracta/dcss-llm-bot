They have a high damage per hit, but fire slowly, with a [[mindelay]] of 1.0 turn (rather than 0.7 turn of most weapons).\n\n==Strategy==\nArbalests are a mid-game ranged weapon. They are occasionally found on [[list of orcs|orcs]] and [[naga sharpshooter]]s, and often found on [[yaktaur]]s inside [[the Vaults]].\n\n[[Longbow]]s, due to their faster fire rate, will generally beat arbalests for damage per turn. If you want to go heavier, [[triple crossbow]]s are your end goal. If you want more defenses, [[hand cannon]]s are just as strong, but allow the use of a [[shield]].\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:arbalest1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:arbalest2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:arbalest3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]<br>arbalest\n|-\n| '''[[Damnation (unrand)|Damnation]]''' || [[File:Urand damnation.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], arbalests had 17 damage.\n*In [[0.29]], arbalests' stats were nerfed (previously: 18 damage, +2 accuracy) and they were affected by the [[Ranged Weapons#History|ranged weapons rework]] that applied to all launchers, including the removal of the dedicated [[Crossbows (skill)|crossbows skill]] and physical [[bolt]]s necessary to fire.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], [[Crossbows]] only contained one type of weapon called the [[Crossbow (item)|crossbow]]. They were split into arbalests, [[hand crossbow]]s, and [[triple crossbow]]s.\n\n{{weapons}}\n\n[[Category:Crossbows]]"}

{"title":"Sefie's diary","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sefie%27s_diary","type":"markdown","data":"*This page is a [Diary of a Crawler](/Category:Diary_of_a_Crawler \"Category:Diary of a Crawler\"), the journal of an individual character. This page probably contains spoilers.*\n\nThis character was started on the development version of 0.20 (i.e. in between 0.19 and 0.20). Sefie is a earth mage troll.\n\nI created this troll with the goal to get some runes \\_after\\_ I took the orb. My plan was to make the character sturdy by using statue form and become a follower of Lugonu, to have means to escape to Abyss.\n\nI started out as an earth mage, to ensure I would have some reasonable intelligence. On floor D:2 or D:3 I found an altar of Okawaru, and decided to follow him, because it seemed unlikely to soon find an altar of Lugonu. Also, Okawaru seemed more helpful to an early troll than Lugonu, even should I find an altar early.\n\nIn the beginning I mainly trained unarmed combat and a little throwing. Also, I found a middle sized shield of protection. Hence, I also trained shielding.\n\nThrough Lair I got by with softening strong enemies with thrown tomahawks and javelins and them finishing them in melee. Okawaru's Hero ability was invaluable here, as my shielding and throwing was only mediocre and could be raised to good that way. I had some difficulty with avoiding hydras, and before I got to the bottom I decided to go elsewhere.\n\nAfter I left Lair to avoid hydras I went into the orc mines. On the second floor there was an entrance to the labyrinth of the minotaur. I was surprised that the minotaur was shown as being extremely dangerous, and also that I easily defeated it. Again, Okawaru was very helpful here. I then cleared the orc mines. Sadly, the shops did not have anything interesting.\n\nI continued downwards in the main dungeon, and it was easy. I encountered the ogre unique mage and was concerned. However, she quickly died. Later, I encountered Loise a strong mage which could banish me with high chance of success. I was scared and used a scroll of blinking to escape.\n\nI decided to continue Lair. The first hydra in Lair I killed with Hero ability and was lucky so. I attacked it with my claws and when it dropped dead I was half dead and it had like 13 heads... The other hydras I killed with Hero and large rocks.\n\nAfter I cleared Lair I went to clear Swamp. I was cautious, as I did not have any poison resistance. However, down to Swamp:3 it went without incidents. After Swamp:3 I went to the Spiders Nest. Near the entry there was an island with orb spinning spiders. I had some difficulty disposing of them. Afterwards, I encountered Asterion on floor 2 or 3. I avoided him and cleared the rest of the spiders nest without incident, and collected my first rune.\n\nAs I had not found any magic resistance so far, I did not want to venture into the elven halls. I decided to take on Loise. I buffed myself and was lucky and defeated her without getting banished! Afterwards, I cleared the main dungeon down to D:15 and then defeated Asterion.\n\nNext I want to collect the swamp rune. I went down to the last swamp floor, and found an artefact hat. Next to it was the Lernaean hydra unique. As I was desperate for magic resistance and hoped the artefact will give me the same I decided to fight it. I used Okawaru's buffs, quaffed a potion of lignification to boost my armour and a potion of invisibility. Then I threw large rocks. It was almost dead when it stepped out of my field of view (as I was invisible it did not come rushing to me). But I was in tree form and could not chase after it. I waited and it came back somewhat healed. After two more rocks the hydra was dead. My prize, the hat, was useless...\n\nAs I still did not have any magic resistance I decided to go to the Vaults. So far, I mostly skilled unarmed combat, general fighting, throwing and shielding. Additionally, I invested in some dodging. Entering the Vaults I understood that there is a magic portal to the Wizards Labratory. I read a scroll of magic mapping and attempted to go to the portal. However, I was marked by a sentinel and was lucky to find my way back to the exit. I almost died when a number of ugly monsters and very ugly monsters surrounded and attacked me, even though I was at the exit. Not sure how that happened, perhaps too much tabbing.\n\nThe portal was still open, so I again attempted to reach it. This time I was successful and it brought me to the Moon Base. The first half of the base was somewhat eventful, with an Spriggan player ghost that I was able to defeat. At the end of the first half I defeated a quicksilver dragon and got quicksilver scales, which boosted my magic resistance. As I did not invest any training in my armour skill I decided not to wear the dragon scales. Afterwards, I encountered several eyes of confusion. It was a curious battle where I was constantly confused and after quaffing a potion of curring was confused immediately again. In the end I waited until they got close and then tried to attack them, and after some time managed to kill the first, and after some more time the second, and then the fourth and fifth... I was lucky I did not encounter other monsters together with those eyes... Afterwards I encountered a coca demon and a giant orange brain together. The brain confused and kept confusing me, so that I had to fight the demon confused. I was again lucky and managed to kill it, while confused. The Moon Troll was nothing special. In the end the only usable loot was the quicksilver armour.\n\nBack in Vault:1 I hoped I would be safe from the sentinels. However, I quickly was marked by a sentinel. I was in a good, narrow position with a corner, so I thought I would try to stand my ground and teleport away when things turned sour, hoping to outlive the mark (now, when writing things down I understand that I might have used a potion of cancelation, and then teleported...). Surprisingly (and thanks to Okawaru), I was able to stand my ground against the hordes of incoming monsters, and did not even have to use a scroll of teleport. So, at the time down this first leg of my journey (from start to here) I cleared Vaults:1. Next, I will either continue to Vaults:2 or venture into the elven halls.\n\nIn Vaults:4 I encountered the draconian unique Bai Suzhen and several high level elves. As I saw that some high level elves can cast banishment I decided to go to the upper elve levels, hoping to only encounter low level elves there. In Elf:2 I also encountered high level elves, but managed to kill them.\n\nI did not go to Elf:3, but instead went to the Depths. Right next to te entrance I encountered Sojobo, the Tengu unique.\n\nI left and went to the Crypts. So far, I still did not find more magic resistance, than this quicksilver dragon armor I am wearing. Also, I did not find Statue form that I hoped to master. On Crypt:2 I got a hat +2 of magic resistance!!! It was a gift of Okawaru! I love you! Crypt:3 had a lovely design. It was a cathedral in the words, with an adjacent graveyard. Behind some bushes there was a structure where two curse skulls hid. I had to use a scroll teleport for each, but managed to kill them. The loot was quite nice for once. Additionally, to the hat with mr+ I got a ring of protection +5 and two artefact rings:\n\n```\n q - the ring of Xom's Full Attention (left claw) {rElec rN+ Dex+8 Stlth-}.\n C - the ring \"Naich\" (right claw) {rPois rN+ Dex+4}.\n```\n\nI then went to kill Bai Suzhen and cleared Vaults:4. Afterwards, I cleared Elf:3. There, nothing dangerous happened. However, I finally found a book with Statue Form. I finished Vaults:5 without problems, and went for Zot. In Zot:2 I got bored of the character and killed him ofÂ :)\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\"/>\n<title>Sefie's diary -

character was started on the development version of 0.20 (i.e. in between 0.19 and 0.20). Sefie is a earth mage troll.\n \nI created this troll with the goal to get some runes _after_ I took the orb. My plan was to make the character sturdy by using statue form and become a follower of Lugonu, to have means to escape to Abyss.\n\nI started out as an earth mage, to ensure I would have some reasonable intelligence. On floor D:2 or D:3 I found an altar of Okawaru, and decided to follow him, because it seemed unlikely to soon find an altar of Lugonu. Also, Okawaru seemed more helpful to an early troll than Lugonu, even should I find an altar early.\n\nIn the beginning I mainly trained unarmed combat and a little throwing. Also, I found a middle sized shield of protection. Hence, I also trained shielding.\n\nThrough Lair I got by with softening strong enemies with thrown tomahawks and javelins and them finishing them in melee. Okawaru's Hero ability was invaluable here, as my shielding and throwing was only mediocre and could be raised to good that way. I had some difficulty with avoiding hydras, and before I got to the bottom I decided to go elsewhere.\n\nAfter I left Lair to avoid hydras I went into the orc mines. On the second floor there was an entrance to the labyrinth of the minotaur. I was surprised that the minotaur was shown as being extremely dangerous, and also that I easily defeated it. Again, Okawaru was very helpful here. I then cleared the orc mines. Sadly, the shops did not have anything interesting.\n\nI continued downwards in the main dungeon, and it was easy. I encountered the ogre unique mage and was concerned. However, she quickly died. Later, I encountered Loise a strong mage which could banish me with high chance of success. I was scared and used a scroll of blinking to escape. \n\nI decided to continue Lair. The first hydra in Lair I killed with Hero ability and was lucky so. I attacked it with my claws and when it dropped dead I was half dead and it had like 13 heads... The other hydras I killed with Hero and large rocks. \n\nAfter I cleared Lair I went to clear Swamp. I was cautious, as I did not have any poison resistance. However, down to Swamp:3 it went without incidents. After Swamp:3 I went to the Spiders Nest. Near the entry there was an island with orb spinning spiders. I had some difficulty disposing of them. Afterwards, I encountered Asterion on floor 2 or 3. I avoided him and cleared the rest of the spiders nest without incident, and collected my first rune.\n\nAs I had not found any magic resistance so far, I did not want to venture into the elven halls. I decided to take on Loise. I buffed myself and was lucky and defeated her without getting banished! Afterwards, I cleared the main dungeon down to D:15 and then defeated Asterion.\n\nNext I want to collect the swamp rune. I went down to the last swamp floor, and found an artefact hat. Next to it was the Lernaean hydra unique. As I was desperate for magic resistance and hoped the artefact will give me the same I decided to fight it. I used Okawaru's buffs, quaffed a potion of lignification to boost my armour and a potion of invisibility. Then I threw large rocks. It was almost dead when it stepped out of my field of view (as I was invisible it did not come rushing to me). But I was in tree form and could not chase after it. I waited and it came back somewhat healed. After two more rocks the hydra was dead. My prize, the hat, was useless...\n\nAs I still did not have any magic resistance I decided to go to the Vaults. So far, I mostly skilled unarmed combat, general fighting, throwing and shielding. Additionally, I invested in some dodging. Entering the Vaults I understood that there is a magic portal to the Wizards Labratory. I read a scroll of magic mapping and attempted to go to the portal. However, I was marked by a sentinel and was lucky to find my way back to the exit. I almost died when a number of ugly monsters and very ugly monsters surrounded and attacked me, even though I was at the exit. Not sure how that happened, perhaps too much tabbing.\n\nThe portal was still open, so I again attempted to reach it. This time I was successful and it brought me to the Moon Base. The first half of the base was somewhat eventful, with an Spriggan player ghost that I was able to defeat. At the end of the first half I defeated a quicksilver dragon and got quicksilver scales, which boosted my magic resistance. As I did not invest any training in my armour skill I decided not to wear the dragon scales. Afterwards, I encountered several eyes of confusion. It was a curious battle where I was constantly confused and after quaffing a potion of curring was confused immediately again. In the end I waited until they got close and then tried to attack them, and after some time managed to kill the first, and after some more time the second, and then the fourth and fifth... I was lucky I did not encounter other monsters together with those eyes... Afterwards I encountered a coca demon and a giant orange brain together. The brain confused and kept confusing me, so that I had to fight the demon confused. I was again lucky and managed to kill it, while confused. The Moon Troll was nothing special. In the end the only usable loot was the quicksilver armour.\n\nBack in Vault:1 I hoped I would be safe from the sentinels. However, I quickly was marked by a sentinel. I was in a good, narrow position with a corner, so I thought I would try to stand my ground and teleport away when things turned sour, hoping to outlive the mark (now, when writing things down I understand that I might have used a potion of cancelation, and then teleported...). Surprisingly (and thanks to Okawaru), I was able to stand my ground against the hordes of incoming monsters, and did not even have to use a scroll of teleport. So, at the time down this first leg of my journey (from start to here) I cleared Vaults:1. Next, I will either continue to Vaults:2 or venture into the elven halls.\n\nIn Vaults:4 I encountered the draconian unique Bai Suzhen and several high level elves. As I saw that some high level elves can cast banishment I decided to go to the upper elve levels, hoping to only encounter low level elves there. In Elf:2 I also encountered high level elves, but managed to kill them. \n\nI did not go to Elf:3, but instead went to the Depths. Right next to te entrance I encountered Sojobo, the Tengu unique.\n\nI left and went to the Crypts. So far, I still did not find more magic resistance, than this quicksilver dragon armor I am wearing. Also, I did not find Statue form that I hoped to master. On Crypt:2 I got a hat +2 of magic resistance!!! It was a gift of Okawaru! I love you! Crypt:3 had a lovely design. It was a cathedral in the words, with an adjacent graveyard. Behind some bushes there was a structure where two curse skulls hid. I had to use a scroll teleport for each, but managed to kill them. The loot was quite nice for once. Additionally, to the hat with mr+ I got a ring of protection +5 and two artefact rings:\n  q - the ring of Xom's Full Attention (left claw) {rElec rN+ Dex+8 Stlth-}.\n  C - the ring \"Naich\" (right claw) {rPois rN+ Dex+4}.\n\nI then went to kill Bai Suzhen and cleared Vaults:4. Afterwards, I cleared Elf:3. There, nothing dangerous happened. However, I finally found a book with Statue Form. I finished Vaults:5 without problems, and went for Zot. In Zot:2 I got bored of the character and killed him of :)"}

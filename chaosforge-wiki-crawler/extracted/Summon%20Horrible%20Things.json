{"title":"Summon Horrible Things","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summon_Horrible_Things","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Summon Horrible Things''' is a level 8 [[Summonings|Summoning]] spell that summons a horde of [[large abomination]]s and [[tentacled monstrosities]].\n\nPlayers colloquially refer to this spell as '''XXX'''.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen cast, 2 to 6 [[large abomination]]s and 0 to 2 [[tentacled monstrosities]] are summoned. After casting this spell, the player has a 20% chance to (temporarily) lose one point of intelligence.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-summoning.cc|1246}}</ref>\n\nHigher [[spell power]] may increase the number of the creatures.\n*The number of large abominations summoned is <code>1 + 1d3</code>, plus a <code>power / 200</code> chance for an extra one. \n*There is a <code>1 - (121 / power)</code> chance for two tentacled monstrosities, and if that fails an independent <code>1 - (51 / power)</code> chance for one monstrosity. If no monstrosities were created, one extra abomination is created instead.\n\nThere is a summon limit of 8 horrible things; additional summons will cause the oldest to very quickly time out.\n\nDuration of the summons is around 27 turns, this does not depend on the spell power.\n\n==Strategy==\nThis is one of the most powerful Summonings spells in the game. It has a high summon cap and summons multiple, relatively powerful, monsters at a time. Large abominations hit fairly hard, dealing up to 40 damage per hit. Tentacled monstrosities deal more damage, are resistant to many elements, and [[constriction|constrict]] foes, drastically reducing their [[ev]]asion.\n\nThe intelligence drain is mostly negligible, as long as you don't use this spell for every single encounter.\n\n==Monster Version==\nThe monster version of Summon Horrible Things creates 3 to 5 monsters, each one has 75% chance of being a large abomination and 25% chance of being a tentacled monstrosity.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|mon-cast.cc|5957}}</ref>\n\nThe [[duration class]] of the summons ranges from 2 (around 18 turns) to 6 (around 171 turns), based on the strength of the caster. Monsters do not suffer any ill effects from casting the spell.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], all summons would take a share of XP whenever they did damage. This made it somewhat harder to recover intelligence drain by only using this spell.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], casting this spell could inflict 1-2 points of intelligence drain.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], casting this spell could inflict 1-3 points of intelligence drain.\n*Prior to [[0.2]], the summons created were permanent.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

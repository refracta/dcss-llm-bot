With low power, items might not be moved all the way to the caster's position.\n\nExtremely powerful magical items, such as the Orb of Zot, may actively resist the pull of this spell.}}\n\n'''Apportation''' is a level 1 [[Translocations]] spell which moves a targeted item in your [[line of sight]] toward your character. \n\n==Useful Info==\nApportation pulls an item towards you; the distance is determined by [[spell power]]. It always drags the top set of items in the pile (the one assigned to the '''a''' slot). Monsters will not block Apportation, however [[iron grate]]s, translucent walls, and other solid features do. It can pull items past [[deep water]] and [[lava]], but if the item would fall in, this spell fails (wasting a turn).\n\nThe [[Orb of Zot]] resists 1/3 of Apportation attempts. Successfully apporting the Orb - even if you don't pick it up - will create a massive [[noise]] and immediately begin the [[orb run]].\n\n==Strategy==\nApportation is a very useful level 1 spell, and almost any non-[[Trog]] worshipper can reliably use this spell with little effort. While a [[Minotaur]] is unlikely to reach max power, even a moderate power Apportation can be useful for the following:\n\n*Stealing [[rune]]s without having to deal with all those inconveniently placed monsters. Especially helpful in [[the Abyss]].\n*Retrieving [[Throwing]] weapons.\n*Minimizing your turn count, for turncount [[speedrun]]s. The less time walking to an item, the less turns you use. If you find an item in a suspected dead-end, no need to walk to it. In addition, picking up 3 items in 3 separate tiles takes 3 turns, but picking up 3 items in 1 tile only takes 1 turn.\n\nApportation is ''technically'' optimal for picking up any item, since it lets you pick up items without revealing tiles. Not revealing tiles means you won't inadvertently reveal monsters. It also means that you'll avoid traps from [[sourceless malevolence]]. E.g. if you see a [[wand]], you could be [[shaft]]ed before you grab the wand. If you use Apportation, you'll be shafted after getting the wand.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.20]], Apportation had an effective power cap of 18.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Apportation was available in the [[Book of Spatial Translocations]], the starting book for the Warper background.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the act of apporting the Orb of Zot did not start the orb run. This allowed the player to apport the Orb to the nearest staircase before picking it up.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], the Orb only caused Apportation to fail 1-in-6 times.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], the Orb did not resist Apportation at all.\n*In earlier versions, apporting only part of a pile of similar items would cause the remaining items to be destroyed."}

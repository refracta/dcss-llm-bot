{"title":"Pearl dragon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Pearl_dragon","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | dragons}}{{list of | holy monsters}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Pearl dragons''' are one of the few non-angelic [[holy]] monsters in the game. Living characters won't find them much harder than [[gold dragon]]s, but [[undead]] and [[demonspawn]] can take great damage from their attacks. Pearl dragons are very rare, only occurring in holy-themed [[Pandemonium]], [[Ziggurat]] floors, or holy-themed vaults in the [[Depths]].\n\nKilling a pearl dragon may yield [[pearl dragon scales]] (33% chance).\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you're undead/demonic, Holy Breath can deal 81 damage, plus 39 damage per turn from the clouds of [[Cloud#Blessed_fire|blessed fire]]. Also, their melee attacks have the [[holy wrath]] brand. Watch out!\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.20]], pearl dragons' Holy Breath dealt 3d36 holy damage. However, all holy damage was halved if you were not vulnerable to holy and not worshipping an [[evil]] god. Therefore, pearl dragons were a ''much'' greater threat to undead and demonic players, but the same threat to living players."}

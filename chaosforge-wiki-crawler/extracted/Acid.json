{"title":"Acid","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Acid","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n'''Acid''' is a [[damage type]] most commonly dealt by [[List of jellies|jellies]] and [[Acid dragon|acidic]] [[Yellow draconian|dragonkind]], which can be resisted with corrosion resistance. Most types of acid damage can apply a temporary corrosion status, which lowers your [[AC]] and [[slaying]].\n\n==Sources of Acid==\n===Acidic Melee Attacks===\nThe following monsters have acidic melee attacks, which may apply corrosion:\n\n*{{monsterlink|Jelly}}\n*{{monsterlink|Acid blob}}\n*{{monsterlink|Dissolution}}\n*{{monsterlink|The royal jelly}}\n*{{monsterlink|Caustic shrike}}\n*{{Brown|u}} [[File:Ugly thing1.png]] '''Brown [[ugly thing]]s and [[very ugly thing]]s'''\n\nAcidic melee attacks may cause an \"acid splash\" (the message \"the acid burns!\"). Players receive 4d3 extra damage, and monsters only receive 2d4 extra damage.\n\n===Acidic Flesh===\nSome monsters have acidic flesh and will cause acid splashes when attacked with a melee weapon, like the extra \"splash\" from the melee attack (4d3 vs players):\n\n*{{monsterlink|Jelly}}\n*{{monsterlink|Acid blob}}\n*{{monsterlink|Dissolution}}\n*{{monsterlink|The royal jelly}}\n\n===Spit Acid===\nThe following monsters can [[Spit Acid]] as a ranged attack, dealing 3d14 acid damage that bypasses AC and may incur corrosion:\n\n*{{monsterlink|Acid blob}}\n*{{monsterlink|Acid dragon}}\n*{{monsterlink|Oklob plant}}\n*{{monsterlink|Oklob sapling}}\n*{{monsterlink|Yellow draconian}}\n*{{monsterlink|Tiamat}}\n\nPlayer yellow [[draconian]]s may use the [[Acid Splash]] ability, which is like Spit Acid but can hit surrounding enemies. Neither Spit Acid nor Acid Splash ability have the \"acid splash\" of melee attacks.\n\n===Corrosive Bolt===\nThe spell [[Corrosive Bolt]] deals significant acid damage and may inflict corrosion. Several monsters may cast it, as well as any creature that has picked up a [[wand of acid]].\n\n{{monsters with spell|Corrosive Bolt}}\n\n===Acidic Fog===\nAcidic fog is a type of [[cloud]] that deals acid damage to and corrodes anything unfortunate enough to be standing in it. It can only be produced by a high-powered [[condenser vane]].\n\n==Corrosion Resistance==\nCorrosion resistance reduces damage taken from acid and reduces the chance of being further corroded. Also, it gives immunity to [[Cloud#Acidic_fog|clouds of acidic fog]].\n\nThe sources of Corrosion resistance are:\n*being a yellow [[draconian]]\n*[[cloak of preservation]]\n*[[ring of resist corrosion]]\n*[[acid dragon scales]]\n*[[artefact]]s with rCorr\n*[[potion of resistance]]\n*[[Tiamat]]'s [[dragonskin cloak]] (50% chance per attack)\n*Having the [[Good_mutations#Yellow_Scales|yellow scales]] mutation at level 3\n*Having at least ** [[piety]] while following [[Jiyva]]\n\n===Damage Reduction===\nPlayers with corrosion resistance take 50% damage from acid. All monsters with any degree of acid resistance are completely immune to acid damage.\n\n==Corrosion==\nCorrosion is a temporary [[status effect]].\n\nOn players, it gives a stackable -4 to damage roll and [[AC]] for its duration. Players with corrosion resistance will only take a -2 penalty per application. All corrosion will be repaired after enough time has passed. It can be immediately removed with a [[potion of cancellation]] or other dispelling effects ([[Yara's Violent Unravelling]], [[Quicksilver Bolt]], or your own [[Draconian#Purple|purple draconian]] breath).\n\nIn addition to acid damage, players may also suffer corrosion from these sources:\n*Being hit by enemies with [[:Category:Corrode flavour|corrosive attacks]] (like the {{monsterlink|Rust devil}}).\n*The [[Entropic Weave]] spell of {{LightCyan|B}} [[File:Entropy weaver.png]] '''[[Entropy weaver]]s''' or {{LightGreen|6}} [[File:Demonspawn corrupter.png]] '''[[Demonspawn corrupter]]s'''\n*Taking damage while wearing an [[randart|artefact]] with the '''*Corrode''' property (3% chance per '''*Corrode''').\n*Being adjacent to [[Wall#Slime Covered Rock|slime covered rock]]. (Corrosion will cease as soon as you move away from the wall.)\n\nMonsters that have been corroded get a temporary -8 to their AC. This does ''not'' stack -- additional corrosion merely increases the duration.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], corrosion resistance did not reduce the effect of corrosion. Instead, it had a 50% chance to prevent each application of corrosion.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], slime-covered walls in [[the Slime Pits]] would inflict acid damage. \n*Prior to [[0.28]], Spit Acid, Acid Splash, and Corrosive Bolt caused additional \"acid splashes\" (extra 4d5 v. the player, 2d4 v. monsters). Their base damage was lower to compensate.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], corrosion instead caused permanent damage to weapons and armour, reducing their enchantment values, possibly into the negatives. Also, [[potions of resistance]] did not grant rAcid or rCorr.\n*There were previously three tiers of acid resistance, each one further reducing acid damage; now there is only one level which is merged with corrosion resistance.\n*In previous versions, acid splashes did more damage if you were wearing less armour (2 dice plus an additional die for each empty armour slot); cloaks provided a 50% chance per empty slot of negating this extra damage, and the damage was reduced by having the [[Shaggy Fur|fur mutation]]."}

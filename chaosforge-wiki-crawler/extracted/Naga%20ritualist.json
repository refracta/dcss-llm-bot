{"title":"Naga ritualist","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Naga_ritualist","type":"raw","data":"{{version027}}\n{{list of | nagas}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Naga ritualists''' are spellcasters who try to stack [[poison]] on their foes. Travelling with a pack of [[black mamba]]s, [[anaconda]]s, and [[mana viper]]s, they are always armed with weapons of [[venom]], regularly blast you with [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]], and can rapidly magnify your poison level even further while stripping you of your poison resistance through [[Virulence]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The beds of snakes naga ritualists travel with would normally not be too threatening, but that can change quickly if you wind up with your poison resistance removed. Take advantage of the fact that a ritualist's snakes move much faster than it does and separate them to make the fight much easier.\n*High [[willpower]] will allow you to shrug off Virulence easily enough, but this isn't a necessity unless you're fighting several foes at once. A lone ritualist shouldn't put up too much of a fight, though you may need to rest after the battle until the toxins leave your system.\n*Remember that a single [[potion of curing]] will remove all poison from your system, no matter how massive the dose.\n\n==History==\n* Prior to [[0.27]], naga ritualists could cast [[Force Lance]].\n* Naga ritualists were added in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Naga]]"}

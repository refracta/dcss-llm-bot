{"title":"Worldbinder","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Worldbinder","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Worldbinders''' are irritating summoners which call forth lesser creatures from other [[branch]]es in [[the Dungeon]]. They are fragile and mostly-harmless themselves, but fast enough to make pursuit difficult. They can be found in the [[Abyss]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Worldbinders should pose little threat to characters who willingly enter the Abyss, as none of the monsters they summon are particularly dangerous. At worst, [[orb spider]]s can deal significant damage with their spells, [[vault sentinel]]s can hit you with [[Sentinel's Mark]] (very undesirable in the Abyss), and [[manticore]]s can inflict [[barbs]] that make movement painful.\n*Characters [[banish]]ed to the Abyss against their will, however, may be in a lot of trouble once the worldbinder begins summoning. Regardless, as worldbinders lack [[fire]], [[cold]], or [[electricity]] resistance, your best bet is to kill the fragile summoner with [[javelin]]s, [[bolt spells]], or powerful attack [[wand]]s, ignoring the summons entirely.\n*As with any summoner, once the worldbinder dies, all its summons will vanish.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], worldbinders could [[see invisible]]. [[Forceful Invitation]] was also changed in this version.\n*Worldbinders were added in [[0.14]]."}

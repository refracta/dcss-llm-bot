{"title":"Petrify","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Petrify","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n'''Petrify''' is a level 4 [[Earth Magic|Earth]]/[[Alchemy]] spell that inflicts the '''Petrifying''' status, which first slows, then fully disables its target a few turns later.\n\n==Useful Info==\nTargets a creature, and up to two hostile creatures adjacent to any previous target (randomly chosen).\n\nIf a victim fails a [[willpower]] check, it will gain the Petrifying status, which [[slow]]s them down, reduces [[EV]], and makes monsters vulnerable to low-tier [[stab]]s. They will turn to stone ('''Petrified''') soon after. Successfully casting Petrify on a target that is already petrifying causes immediate petrification.\n\nPetrified victims are unable to move or act for several turns. [[EV]] and [[SH]] are set to near 0. Monsters are vulnerable to high-tier [[stab]]s. Victims, now made of stone, receive significantly less damage: -33% while petrifying, and -50% while petrified (after AC).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|monster.cc|4199}} - monsters<br>{{source ref|0.30.0|ouch.cc|882}} - players</ref> Being petrified also grants immunity to [[negative energy]] and [[torment]].\n\nWhile petrifying or petrified, creatures are vulnerable to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] and [[Shatter]].\n\nThe Petrify spell is less likely to succeed on the side targets. The main target is affected with the spell's full [[enchantment power]]; side targets are only affected by 66% of the enchantment power.\n\n===Duration===\nWhen a player is hit by Petrify, the petrifying status lasts for 2 [[decaAut]]. The petrified status lasts for 5 to 9 decaAut.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|player.cc|6927}}</ref> However, since Petrify resolves at the end of the player's turn, monsters can usually get 6.5 - 10.5 actions in a row. (You get to act, then monsters move, then you're petrified for 9 turns, so monsters get 10 actions in a row.)\n\nWhen a monster is hit by the player's Petrify, the petrifying status lasts for 3 decaAut. The petrified status lasts for <code>150 / <([[HD]] + 5) * (10/[[Movement#Monster Speed|speed]]) + 1></code> decaAut, with a minimum of 8 decaAut.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-ench.cc|2263}}</ref> Note: a monster displayed as \"Speed: 100%\" has a speed stat of 10 for this formula.\n\n===Restrictions===\n*Creatures with rPetrify are immune. For monsters, this includes those already made of stone ([[earth elemental]]s, [[gargoyle (monster)|gargoyle]]s, [[statue]]s), as well as [[catoblepae]]. For players, being a [[Gargoyle]], in [[Statue Form]], or under [[Zin]]'s Vitalisation grants rPetrify.\n*[[Insubstantial]] creatures are immune, including insubstantial player forms ([[Wisp Form|Wisp]], [[Storm Form|Storm]], and [[Shadow Form]]).\n\nPlayers can cure ''petrifying'' with a [[potion of cancellation]], [[Elyvilon]]'s Purification, or [[Ru]]'s Draw Out Power. [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]] and [[Quicksilver Bolt]] are more dangerous ways to cure petrifying, and if aimed at a hostile target, they can cure petrified. Unfortunately, being completely petrified leaves you unable to act; at that point, your only recourse is to hope you survive until the status wears off.\n\n==Sources==\nOther than the Petrify spell, [[Clouds#Calcifying dust|calcifying dust]] (such as from the [[Petrifying Cloud]] spell) and [[chaos]] effects may cause the Petrifying effect.\n\n==Strategy==\nPetrify is essentially a [[Hexes]] spell that is not in the Hexes school. After a few turns, a Petrified monster becomes unable to do anything, and is vulnerable to high-tier [[stab]]s. It has a number of uses:\n\n*It can 'frontload' a battle. If Petrify works, a monster is basically dead, given it is alone and you are good enough at stabbing. If a few Petrify attempts don't work, you can escape the fight (e.g. by retreating upstairs before the monster gets into melee) and try again. In other words, Petrify lets you \"win\" against a dangerous monster before losing any HP.\n*It can make it easier to escape. Pursuers can be frozen while you run to a safe place to heal - for example, you can petrify a monster to clog up a hallway. Petrify lasts longer than a spell like [[Confusing Touch]].\n*It can be strong against tough foes with low [[willpower]], such as [[hornet]]s and [[two-headed ogre]]s.\n\nNote that being petrified reduces all damage by 50%, so [[Stone Arrow]]-ing a petrified target is significantly less effective. In order to get the full use of Petrify, invest into stabbing ([[Short Blades]] and [[Stealth]]), since the bonus from high-tier stabs is so high.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\nPetrified targets are vulnerable to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] and [[Shatter]]. \n*Against monsters, casting LRD on a wall (without Petrify) is usually better for damage than using Petrify + LRD on a monster. But, if there are no convenient walls, then you can use Petrify to create an LRD target. \n*Watch out for [[Jorgrun]], who has both Petrify and LRD.\nCasting this spell multiple times on the same target will speed the petrification process up. Two successful applications will turn most targets to stone immediately.\n*Followers of [[Dithmenos]] can petrify a target in just one turn if their shadow successfully repeats the spell.  \nWhen escaping a mob, it can be useful to petrify a nearby, low-level target in a hallway/bottleneck to block the progress of the rest of the mob.\n\n==Monster Version==\nA few monsters also have access to Petrify, which works in the same way as the player version (except the changes to duration, as listed above).\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nAdditionally, some monsters have other abilities that can result in petrification:\n\n*{{monsterlink|Catoblepas}} ([[Petrifying Cloud]])\n*Any creature with a [[chaos]]-branded attack or weapon\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Petrify did not affect targets adjacent to the caster, but it had a full-[[LOS]] range. It was also a level 4 Earth/[[Transmutations]] spell.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], creatures in the process of petrifying could not use [[SH]], and petrifying monsters couldn't use ranged attacks (but could use spells or melee normally). Also, being Petrified did not interrupt taking stairs; you'd be petrified, then the climbing action would complete.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], petrifying monsters that flew using wings ([[harpy|harpies]], [[hippogriff]]s, etc.) would ground them. Petrifying such enemies over deep water or lava would kill them instantly.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

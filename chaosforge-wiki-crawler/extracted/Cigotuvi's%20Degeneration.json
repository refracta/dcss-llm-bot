Works on natural monsters only.}}\n\n'''Cigotuvi's Degeneration''' is a level 5 [[Transmutations]]/[[Necromancy]] spell which turns an enemy into a [[pulsating lump]], a slow, weak monster with a [[mutation]]-inducing melee attack. The spell requires a clear line of fire, checks [[magic resistance]], and only works on [[natural]] monsters.\n\n==Strategy==\nThis is a safer choice than [[Polymorph Other]] for eliminating brutal enemies, since you know what the monster will turn into. However, pulsating lumps are still dangerous due to their mutation attacks and worth far less experience than most monsters you would want to use this spell on.\n\nThe spell is fairly high-level, and most players who can cast it and have the free spell slots would be better off learning [[Agony]], since the two spells work on almost exactly the same set of monsters and both check [[magic resistance]].\n\n==History==\nCigotuvi's Degeneration was removed in [[0.12]]\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

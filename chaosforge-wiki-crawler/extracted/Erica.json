{"title":"Erica","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Erica","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Erica the Fiery-Tempered''' is a [[unique]] caster of destructive and disabling magic. She wields a [[flaming]] [[scimitar]], but prefers to fight from a distance while invisible. Also, she always spawns with a [[ring]].\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:8-11\n*The [[Orcish Mines]]:1\n*[[The Lair]]:1-2\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Poison resistance]], [[Repel Missiles]], [[see invisible]], and high [[willpower]] will counter most of her spells, but that's a lot to ask for. She's flimsy, so a strong offense that takes her out quickly may be the best defense.\n*Her mediocre [[hit dice]] and lack of poison resistance make her susceptible to [[Mephitic Cloud]].\n*Erica is commonly encountered in [[the Lair]]. If you already have some skill in [[Long Blades]], her flaming scimitar is a good choice for fighting the [[hydra]]s you'll find there.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|she will have less Will (60 -> 40) and EV (14 -> 13). Also, her melee attacks will be nerfed: 15 -> 11 and 4 -> 3.}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Erica was a human. She had less EV and a weaker melee attack, but could cast Force Lance (3d13) and Confuse.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Erica had [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] instead of [[Force Lance]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], she could also cast [[Teleport Self]].\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

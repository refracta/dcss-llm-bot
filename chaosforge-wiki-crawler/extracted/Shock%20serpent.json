{"title":"Shock serpent","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shock_serpent","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | snakes}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Shock serpents''' are snakes which can release a powerful electric discharge when hit, striking the attacker. They are also able to shoot highly accurate electrical bolts. They can be found in the [[Snake Pit]].\n\nWhen hit by an attack that dealt more than 4 damage, and if the attacker is within range 3, it retaliates for <code>3d(4 + pow*3/2)</code> electric damage, where <code>pow = damage_taken / 12</code>, randomly rounded.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|monster.cc|5666}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|fineff.cc|545}}</ref> This activates for ''all'' attacks, melee or not. It even works if the shock serpent is disabled ([[paralysed]], [[petrified]], etc.) or [[invisible|can't see you]]. As <code>BEAM_ELEC</code> damage, it ignores 1/2 [[AC]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Without rElec, shock serpents can deal lots of damage. Electrical Bolt's 3d13 might not seem like a lot, but serpents are fast (they can fire twice/player turn), and in the correct position, each bolt can [[doublezap]] (hitting you twice). In addition, electric damage ignores 1/2 of your [[AC]], and Electrical Bolt is noticeably more accurate than [[Lightning Bolt]]. And since they're fast, it's hard to escape from one.\n**Try to avoid doublezaps whenever possible - see the [[doublezap]] article for more details.\n*Even if you have rElec, attacking them (at close range) will inflict significant damage over time. Attack from a distance if you can.\n*Shock serpents don't have great [[willpower]]. A [[wand of polymorph]] will often change them into something more manageable.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.30]], shock serpent retaliation damage was reduced by 25%.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], shock serpent retaliation didn't check rElec properly.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], when they took more than 4 points of damage, they lost all the accumulated charge dealing some minor damage to any creature near them.\n*Shock serpents were added in [[0.14]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

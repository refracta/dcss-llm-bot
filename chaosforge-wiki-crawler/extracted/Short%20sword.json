Many [[backgrounds]] have a short sword as a choice of weapon, and early monsters (such as kobolds, goblins and orcs) often wield them.\n\n==Strategy==\nAs a starting weapon, a short sword is weaker than a [[falchion]] or [[mace]] in \"raw\" combat, but is better at [[stab]]bing.\n\nAt 0 skill, a short sword is better than nothing. It's also better than a [[dagger]] (if you aren't [[stab]]bing things) or club of the same [[brand]]. So if you started without a weapon, you might as well pick one of these up. [[Whip]]s and [[spear]]s are, in turn, better than the short sword.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Short sword1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Short sword2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Short sword3.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], short swords had a base delay of 11 (1.1).\n*Prior to [[0.29]], short swords had 6 base damage, and scaled with strength rather than dexterity.\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Short blades]]"}

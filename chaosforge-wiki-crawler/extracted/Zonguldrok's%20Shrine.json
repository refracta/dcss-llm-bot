{"title":"Zonguldrok's Shrine","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Zonguldrok%27s_Shrine","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|No life grows here. It is completely dead.}}\n\n'''Zonguldrok's Shrine''' (also known as ''Zonguldrok's Mausoleum'') is a [[Wizard Laboratory]] that serves as the final resting place for the great [[necromancer]] Zonguldrok. It consists of an outer graveyard which slowly fills with powerful undead, as well as an inner chamber which houses Zonguldrok's remains and the guardians of the shrine.\n\nInitially, the outer graveyard is empty except for a multitude of gravestones. These will be gradually replaced with monsters as you explore. The door leading to the inner chamber will only appear after enough of these monsters have been killed. Once inside, you'll be attacked by several more skeletal warriors, and beyond them, you'll find the grave of Zonguldrok.\n\n{{flavour|A gravestone. The name \"Zonguldrok\" is engraved on it in golden letters.}}\n\n[[File:Zonguldrok's grave.png]] Past this gravestone you'll find a pair of treasure chambers, filled with an assortment of [[potion]]s, [[scroll]]s, and the evil [[Sword of Zonguldrok]], a powerful artefact [[double sword]] which raises the fallen to serve you.\n\n==Monsters==\n*{{Brown|Z}} [[File:Large_zombie.png]] '''[[Zombie]]''' - Slow melee attackers that will continually rise from the many gravestones in the graveyard. Eventually they will stop coming. [[Ettin]] and [[juggernaut]] zombies still hit hard, so be careful not to get swamped by them.\n*{{monsterlink|Phantasmal warrior}} - Ghosts that will annoyingly [[blink]] around you and halve your willpower on a successful hit. Beware of them in conjuction with vampires.\n*{{monsterlink|Vampire (monster)}} - These can be dangerous if you have low [[willpower]] or let them live long enough to go [[invisible]] and pester you while you deal with more pressing concerns. Rarely a major threat, however.\n*{{monsterlink|Vampire knight}} - Far more dangerous than normal vampires, these enemies can make themselves hasted and invisible while paralyzing and chopping you to pieces.\n*{{monsterlink|Jiangshi}} - [[Vampiric]] zombies that move extremely quickly, but skip most turns.\n*{{monsterlink|Ghoul (monster)}} - Bulky, undead melee brutes. Hits harder than most of the other enemies here, but have no special abilities to speak of. There aren't really any chokepoints on the floor, however, so avoid getting surrounded.\n*{{monsterlink|Skeletal warrior}} - These melee fighters are stronger than the zombies or vampires, but you should be able to handle them easily enough if you've survived to this point.\n*{{monsterlink|Ancient champion}} - These are much more dangerous than skeletal warriors. They are capable of hasting themselves and blasting you with [[Iron Shot]].\n*{{Blue|z}} [[File:Antique champion.png]] '''Antique champion''' - Two of these will spawn in the central chamber, guarding the loot (see below).\n\n==Antique Champions==\n{{monster info|antique champion}}\n\nThese opponents are capable of dealing obscene damage, especially to the living or poorly armored, and should be prepared for accordingly.\n\n{{monster spells|antique champion}}\n\n==Map==\n<pre>\nMAP\nM   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n   xx?????????????????xx\n  xx?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?xx\n xx?!!.G.G.G.G.G.G.G.!!?xx\nxx?!!.G.G.G.G.G.G.G.G.!!?xx\nx?!!.G.G.G.G.G.G.G.G.G.!!?x\nx?!.G.G.GcccccccccG.G.G.!?x\nx?!G.G.G.cdddcdddc.G.G.G!?x\nx?!.G.G.ccdd'+'ddcc.G.G.!?x\nx?!G.Gcccddcc+ccddcccG.G!?x\nx?!.G.c$dddcLLLcddd$c.G.!?x\nx?!G.Gc$$ccc'''ccc$$cG.G!?x\nx?!.G.c$$c'''''''c$$c.G.!?x\nx?!G.Gcccc'RW'WS'ccccG.G!?x\nx?!.G.c''+'RR'SS'+''c.G.!?x\nx?!G.Gc'3ccc'''ccc2'cG.G!?x\nx?!.G.c''3'c'''c'1''c.G.!?x\nx?!G.GcCc''ccccc1'cCcG.G!?x\nx?!.G.G.cc'''+'''cc.G.G.!?x\nx?!G.G.G.c'''c'''c.G.G.G!?x\nx?!.G.G.GccccDccccG.G.G.!?x\nx?!!.G.G.G.GV.VG.G.G.G.!!?x\nxx?!!.G.G.G..<..G.G.G.!!?xx\n xx?!!.G.G.G.A.G.G.G.!!?xx\n  xx?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?xx\n   xx?????????????????xx\n    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nENDMAP\n</pre>\n\n==History==\n*Zonguldrok's Shrine was buffed again in [[0.31]], replacing the single '''Antique Lich''' ([[ancient lich]]) with two Antique Champions, heavily buffing the undead spawns as well as gaining a greater focus on martial items.\n*Zonguldrok's Shrine received a buff in 0.14, with an upgraded monster set and shorter spawning intervals.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon_Branches]]"}

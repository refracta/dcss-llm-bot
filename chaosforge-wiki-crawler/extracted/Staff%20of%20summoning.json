Equipping it will cause it to auto-identify. Any Summonings spells cast while wielding a staff of summoning will gain a boost to [[spell power]], usually causing it to summon more monsters/last longer (the specific impact of this, if any, depends on the spell).\n\nThe staff can also be used in combat, functioning as a +0 [[staff]]. Physical damage bonuses can be gained through training [[Fighting]] and [[Staves]]. The Staves skill also increases your accuracy and the speed at which you can attack, which is useful if you have a staff that is effective in melee. This isn't worthwhile if you are only using a staff of summoning however, as it is a terrible melee weapon.\n\n==History==\n*Staves of summoning were removed in [[0.26]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], the wielder also gained the [[warding]] intrinsic.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the staff could [[Abjuration|abjure]] enemies when swung in melee, making it somewhat useful against summons.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], the chance of a staff of summoning auto-identifying when wielded depended on the Summonings skill of the wielder."}

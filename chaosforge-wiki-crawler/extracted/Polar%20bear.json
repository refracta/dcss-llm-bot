{"title":"Polar bear","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Polar_bear","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | bears}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Polar bears''' are the largest of the bears found in the [[Dungeon]], boasting [[cold resistance]], and dealing significantly more damage than [[black bear]]s. When severely injured, they may go [[berserk]], greatly increasing their threat level. Polar bears are amphibious and easily traverse deep water. They can occasionally be found in the [[Dungeon]] and [[the Lair]], but are much more common in the [[Ice Cave]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While other bears are mostly pushovers, polar bears do enough damage to deserve some respect.\n*Due to their cold resistance, polar bears are immune to [[Ensorcelled Hibernation]]. Other [[Hexes]] or [[Mephitic Cloud]] will work just fine, though.\n\n==History==\n* Prior to [[0.27]], polar bears were practically immune to [[fear]]; they would go berserk when inflicted by fear, ending it in the process. This was because their Berserker Rage is an [[spell slot flags|emergency flag]] spell. In 0.27, fleeing monsters now use escape flag rather than emergency flag spells, which stopped this behavior.\n* Prior to [[0.6]], polar bears did not berserk."}

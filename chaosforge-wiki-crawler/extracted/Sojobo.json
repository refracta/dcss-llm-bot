{"title":"Sojobo","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sojobo","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | tengu}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Sojobo, Queen of Tengu''' is a [[unique]] [[list of tengu|tengu]] air elementalist who is always generated with a band of [[tengu reaver]]s. She's fairly durable, has significant [[ev]]asion, an innate [[Repel Missiles]] effect, and can summon paralysing [[air elemental]]s to her aid. She carries a [[great sword]] (83%) or [[triple sword]] (17%); regardless of type, it has a high chance (66%) to carry the [[electrocution]] brand.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Depths]]\n*[[The Vaults]]: 2-5\n*[[The Crypt]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Sojobo's band can be nasty. Fighting 2-3 tengu reavers, by themselves, can quickly turn sour. Adding Sojobo and summoned [[air elemental]]s to the mix only makes it ''that'' much worse. Try to lure her allies away one by one, and only engage Sojobo when she's all alone. Note that all tengu are faster than the average species, so [[Swiftness]] or [[haste]] is required to outrun them.\n:Even by herself, Sojobo is quite strong:\n:*Air elementals are very dangerous. Each air elemental is an extremely fast enemy that casts [[Stunning Burst]], which can [[paralyse]] for a turn. It isn't great when Sojobo, the air elementals, and any reavers get a free shot against you.\n:*[[Electricity]] resistance is highly recommended. Getting hit by [[Lightning Bolt]] [[multizap]]s really racks up damage, and rElec gives you a chance to resist Stunning Burst's paralysis.\n*When Sojobo is around, don't depend on [[stairs]] for escape or [[stair dancing]], since her Wind Blast can push you off.\n*The usual anti-spellcaster tools, such as [[Silence]], [[phial of floods]], or [[antimagic]], work pretty well against her. But be careful, as Sojobo can deal a lot of damage with just her sword.\n*Anything that never misses can get past her high evasion. Spells like [[BVC]] and [[MCC]] ignore evasion entirely. Also, [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]] can dispel Repel Missiles, inflicting [[malmutate]] and removing the status until she uses a turn to cast Repel Missiles again.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Sojobo was resistant to [[Tornado]] and [[Vortex]]. Also, air elementals cast Vortex instead of Stunning Burst.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Sojobo had less EV (22 EV instead of 24 EV), but had the stronger [[Deflect Missiles]] instead of [[Repel Missiles]].\n*In [[0.22]], Sojobo's wind resistance was replaced with Tornado resistance.\n*Sojobo was added in [[0.13]]."}

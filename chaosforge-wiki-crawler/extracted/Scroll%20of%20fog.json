These are centered around the player and last for several turns. Fog clouds can spread to other adjacent tiles.\n\nOpaque clouds, including from fog, can block [[line of sight]]. If 2 or more opaque clouds are in the way, then you will be unable to see further in that direction.\n\n==Strategy==\nAt first, this scroll appears to have little use, but it can be very helpful in certain situations:\n\n* Fog can be used to block line of sight. If you can't see enemies because of the fog, enemies can't see you. This prevents dangerous ranged attackers, [[smite]]rs, and [[torment]]ers from attacking for a few turns. This can be enough time to flee, to reposition, or to get a monster in melee range.\n**Enemies are totally unable to attack tiles blocked by fog. But certain player spells, like [[Fireball]] and [[Fulminant Prism]], can attack past it.\n**Note that a scroll of fog may not block the desired tiles immediately. If LOS isn't blocked right away, try moving backwards, which will block sight in the forward direction. \n*Clouds cannot replace other clouds. Placing a fog cloud will prevent other, more dangerous clouds like [[miasma]] from occupying your tile.\n*The locations of [[invisible]] monsters standing in clouds are more likely to be revealed by the disturbances they create.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.22]], not all fog types from scrolls of fog would spread.\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

{"title":"Reaching","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Reaching","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Reaching''' is a property exclusive to and innate to [[polearm]]s. Reaching weapons may attack from two spaces away, one tile greater than usual. You may also attack through monsters, though not with perfect success.\n\n==Useful Info==\nYou will automatically make reach attacks when appropriate while auto-attacking with [[Tab]], and you can manually make a reach attack with the '''v''' command.\n\nOther than the extra range, reaching is nearly identical to other melee attacks. When attacking from a distance, you won't make [[auxiliary attack]]s, and you won't be hurt from attacking [[spiny]] monsters. That ''only'' applies when attacking from a distance; using a polearm on an adjacent enemy will trigger aux attacks and spiny as normal.\n\nIf there is a monster or obstacle between you and your target, there is a chance that your reaching attack will fail. See below for details.\n\n===Reach Attack Failure===\nReaching may fail if there is a monster in the way. If there are two possible paths to attack the tile (i.e., the attack is like a chess knight's move [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_%28chess%29] with no walls in the way), they are randomized. Then, if a monster is in the way, there is a 50% chance that reaching fails. You will then hit the intervening monster if it is [[neutral]] or hostile, and fail if they are [[friendly]]. See the below examples:\n\n  A reaching attack on Monster M:\n  Example 1:                      Example 2:                    Example 3:\n  .......  .......  .......       .......                       .......\n  ..@....  ..@AM..  ..@A...       ..@A...                       ..@A...\n  ...A...  .......  ####M..       ...BM..                       ....M..\n  ....M..  .......  ####...       .......                       .......\n  With A interposed.              With A and B interposed.      With A interposed, plus\n                                                                one free avenue of attack.\n\n*Example 1: There's a 50% chance that the attack on M fails. If A is friendly, the attack fails outright. If A is hostile, the attack is redirected to A.\n*Example 2: There's a 50% chance that the attack on M fails and is instead directed on the intervening monster at A/B (randomly chosen). If A/B is friendly, the attack fails outright. If A/B is hostile, the attack is redirected to A/B.\n*Example 3: There's a 25% chance that the attack on M fails. If A is friendly, the attack fails outright. If A is hostile, the attack is redirected to A.\n\nThe message given when an attack fails due to a friendly monster blocking your attack is less than informative:\n{{crawlquote|\"You could not reach far enough!\"}}\n\nImmobile and/or neutral monsters like [[bush]]es and [[toadstool]]s are treated like mobile, hostile monsters when determining whether they block an attack. Reaching attacks ''may'' be freely made through inanimate [[statue]]s with no penalty. However, reaching attacks may ''not'' be made through [[iron grate]]s.\n\nFriendly monsters you can fire projectiles through, such as [[Fedhas]] plants or [[Hepliaklqana]] ancestor, are treated as empty squares for reaching attacks.\n\n===Reach+===\nThe [[artefact]] [[demon trident]] [[Rift]] has a special, smite-targeted reaching attack. It has an extra tile of reach (3 tiles), and completely ignores intervening monsters and obstructing terrain (including grates).\n\n==Strategy==\n*Even when you consider the 50% failure rate of attacks made through friendly units, reach attacks can be extremely useful for characters with access to summoned or permanent allies. When dealing with monsters capable of casting dangerous enchantments like [[Banish]] or [[Malmutate]], letting your summoned units block the enemy's line of fire while you poke it from behind is a perfectly valid strategy.\n*If you can both move and attack faster than your enemy can move, it's possible to [[kite]] melee opponents with reach attacks. Simply flee the enemy until you're two spaces away, then stab at the enemy until it closes the gap. Repeat until the enemy is dead.\n\n==Reaching Attacks by Monsters==\nAny monster wielding a polearm can make reach attacks, just like you. However, there are also some monsters that have ''inherent'' reaching attacks:\n*{{monsterlink|Orange demon}}\n*{{monsterlink|Snapping turtle}}\n*{{monsterlink|Alligator snapping turtle}}\n*{{Magenta|X}} [[File:Cigotuvis monster.png]] '''[[Cigotuvi's Monster]]'''\n*{{monsterlink|Geryon}}\n*{{monsterlink|Serpent of Hell (Dis)}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], reaching was also available as a [[brand]] which could generate on [[whip]]s and [[demon whip]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], polearms did not have intrinsic reaching. They would only be capable of reaching if they had the reaching brand.\n\n{{brands}}\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

{"title":"Hellion","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hellion","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Hellions''' are dangerous [[tier-2 demon]]s that blast you with [[smite]]-targeted [[damnation]], dealing moderate damage no matter your [[AC]] or resistances. They are found in [[Pandemonium]] and the [[Hell]]s, and can be summoned by many spellcasting monsters through the [[Summon Greater Demon]] spell.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*On their own, hellions aren't dangerous to an [[extended]] character. The problem is when you combine damnation with [[torment]]. Damnation never misses, ignores [[AC]], and hellions can fire 2 bursts per turn. This is an issue after you've had your HP cut in half a couple of times. It's also a problem when you have [[Pandemonium#The Demonic Rune|12 of them shooting at once]].\n*They are relatively fragile and have few resistances. Melee characters can use [[javelin]]s, a [[wand of iceblast]] / [[wand of roots|roots]], or [[The Shining One]]'s Cleansing Flame to take them out. Casters can just hit them with a preferred spell.\n*Keep in mind what does and doesn't work against hellions:\n**Hellions can't see [[invisible]], so a [[potion of invisibility]] greatly reduces the chance to take damnation.\n**[[Silence]] does not prevent demonic spellcasting.\n**Hellions have moderate willpower, so status [[wand]]s can work, and a [[scroll of fear]] can scare them off with some reliability.\n**Hellions are generally unwilling to blast allies with high [[HD]] (that aren't immune to damnation). If you're standing next to a [[pandemonium lord]], it's very unlikely for you to  be blasted.\n*If you have a friendly hellion serving you, be careful not to stand next to its target. It will make no attempt to preserve you if you walk into its damnation blast zone.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], hellions were resistant to [[fire]], rF+++, and vulnerable to [[cold]] and [[:Category:Water_vulnerability|water]]."}

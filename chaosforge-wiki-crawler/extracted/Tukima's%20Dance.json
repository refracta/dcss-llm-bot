{"title":"Tukima's Dance","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tukima%27s_Dance","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n[[Tukima's Dance]] is a level 3 [[Hexes]] spell which temporarily animates a melee weapon held by a hostile monster.\n\n[[Enchanter]]s begin with this spell available.\n\n==Useful Info==\nIf the targeted monster fails a [[willpower]] check, its melee or ranged weapon will be animated as a [[dancing weapon]]. The weapon will only target its former owner and quickly expires after their wielder has been killed, though it may attack other nearby creatures before the spell expires. Only 1 of a monster's weapons will be animated at a time, though there is no limit on the weapons you can animate. Note that, unlike most types of allies, these weapons can attack even when they are outside the caster's [[line of sight]].\n\nThe weapon's strength is determined by both the caster's [[spell power]] and the weapon's base stats, while the duration of the effect is dependent entirely upon spell power. The caster's weapon skill has no impact on the dancing weapon's performance.\n\nThis spell works on melee and [[ranged weapons]], but not [[magical staves]]. Animating a weapon with a [[brand]] that your current god hates will trigger [[piety]] loss and [[penance]].\n\n==Strategy==\nTukima's Dance is a somewhat niche, but powerful spell. Monsters with good weapons, preferably with low [[willpower]], are the best targets for this spell. For example, an [[ogre]] with a [[giant spiked club]] goes from 39 max damage to 17 max damage, and the ensuing weapon is bound to deal some damage. Other good targets include [[orc warrior]]s, [[ettin]]s, and more.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*While the animated weapon will initially only target its wielder, it will switch targets if the weapon cannot cannot reach, (e.g. if the player blocks the only path toward the original wielder). Use this technique with a weaker monster with a big weapon to get a few strong hits on a bigger monster.\n*The spell is also useful for removing [[distortion]] or [[chaos]] from your enemies.\n*Note that enemies must wield their weapon in order for it to be used. This isn't a problem against melee enemies, but [[Centaur (monster)|centaurs]] won't wield their bows while sleeping or in melee range.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], worshippers of [[Gozag]] would not receive weapons from Tukima's Dance.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Tukima's Dance had a 1.5x power boost, which made it more likely to succeed.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Tukima's Dance couldn't be used on ranged weapons. It worked on [[curse]]d weapons, but did not remove the curse. Also, dancing weapons attacked slower (as all monsters with a weapon attacked slower).\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Tukima's Dance did not have a power boost. Said boost was nerfed in [[0.18]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], it was a level 5 [[Hexes]] spell which temporarily animated the user's melee weapon into a friendly [[dancing weapon]] (though it did not function on certain [[artefact]] weapons).\n*In [[0.12]], the power of this spell was increased, and its level was raised to 5.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], dancing weapons were immune to elemental damage and had flat statistics independent of spell power and weapon weight."}

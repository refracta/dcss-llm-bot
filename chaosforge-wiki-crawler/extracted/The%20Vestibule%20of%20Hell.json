Please enjoy your stay.}}\n\n[[File:Hell entry.png]] '''The Vestibule of Hell''' is the entrance to the four other branches of [[Hell]]. It is presided over by [[Geryon]], the gatekeeper of Hell.\n\n==Useful Info==\nYou'll find multiple portals to the Vestibule in [[the Depths]]. Its most noteworthy inhabitant is [[Geryon]], a huge three-headed demon, but you'll also find flocks of demons and [[hell knight]]s. These monsters guard the entrances to the four main branches of Hell:\n\n*[[File:Cocytus entry.png]] [[Cocytus]], the frozen hell.\n*[[File:Dis entry.png]] [[The Iron City of Dis]], the metallic hell.\n*[[File:Gehenna entry.png]] [[Gehenna]], the fiery hell.\n*[[File:Tartarus entry.png]] [[Tartarus]], the deathly hell.\n\nEach of these four branches contains a [[rune of Zot]].\n\n==Strategy==\nBy the time your character is ready for [[the Depths]], chances are that they can clear the Vestibule, too. Even if you don't plan on doing the rest of the extended game, the [[horn of Geryon]] can be useful to [[Evocations]] specialists.\n\nGeryon himself is not too difficult to kill. It is Geryon with the rest of the Vestibule that's difficult to kill.\n*Most [[wall]]s within the Vestibule are made of rock. If you have a [[wand of digging]], you can make a [[killhole]] and fight most of the enemies there.\n\n*Geryon himself will never follow you outside of hell. You ''can'' bring other monsters up. However, [[stair dancing]] can be dangerous; Geryon can summon [[hell beast]]s, which can [[trample]] you off stairs. Monsters with [[constriction]] attacks, such as [[tentacled monstrosities]] or [[anaconda]] [[skeleton (monster)|skeletons]], can prevent you from using the stairs too.\n\n*A second unique monster, [[Murray]] the [[curse skull]], appears in 25% of games while exploring the Vestibule. He can rapidly reduce you to very low HP if you lack [[torment]] resistance, and summons hordes of undead to bury you with. Don't be afraid to use a [[scroll of blinking]] to get away from him the moment you see him, as he can be hard to run from for normal-speed characters.\n\n==Monsters==\n'''Common'''\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Ice devil}}\n| {{monsterlink|Reaper}}\n| {{monsterlink|Soul eater}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Sun demon}}\n| {{monsterlink|Hell hog}}\n| {{monsterlink|Hell knight}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Necromancer (monster)}} || ||\n|}\n\n'''Uncommon'''\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Demonic crawler}}\n| {{monsterlink|Hell hound}}\n| {{monsterlink|Rust devil}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Lorocyproca}}\n| {{monsterlink|Hell rat}}\n| {{monsterlink|Red devil}}\n|}\n\n'''Rare'''\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Balrug}}\n| {{monsterlink|Blizzard demon}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Cacodemon}}\n| {{monsterlink|Green death}}\n|}\n\n'''Very Rare'''\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Hellephant}}\n| {{monsterlink|Hellion}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Tentacled monstrosity}}\n| {{monsterlink|Tormentor}}\n|}\n\nAdditionally, the entrances to Hell branches are guarded by monsters from these Hells:\n*Cocytus: [[ice statue]]s, [[water elemental]]s, [[simulacrum (monster)|simulacrums]], [[skeleton (monster)|skeletons]], and [[zombie]]s.\n*The Iron City of Dis: [[iron troll]]s, [[war gargoyle]]s, [[iron golem]]s and [[iron dragon]]s.\n*Gehenna: [[fire elemental]]s, [[molten gargoyle]]s.\n*Tartarus: [[skeletal warrior]]s, [[ancient champion]]s, [[shadow dragon]]s, [[lich]]es, and [[shadow wraith]]s.\n\n===Uniques===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Geryon}}\n| {{monsterlink|Murray}}\n|}\n\n'''Sumoned by Geryon'''\n*{{monsterlink|Hell beast}}\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.14]], it was necessary to kill [[Geryon]] and sound his [[Horn of Geryon|horn]] to open up the entrances to the four main branches of Hell, and all portals to the Vestibule were closed when you picked up the Orb.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon_Branches]]"}

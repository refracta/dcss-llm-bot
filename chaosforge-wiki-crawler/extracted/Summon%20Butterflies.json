How pretty!}}\n\n[[Summon Butterflies]] is a level 1 [[Summonings|Summoning]] spell which summons multiple [[butterfly|butterflies]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nA kaleidoscope of butterflies is created around the caster. Higher [[spell power]] may result in more butterflies.\n\nNumber of summons is <code>2 + 1d3 + (1d<power> - 1) / 10</code>, capped at 8.<ref>{{source ref|0.25.1|spl-summoning.cc|98}}</ref>\n\nDuration of the summons is around 27 turns. It is not affected by spell power.\n\nThere is a cap on how many creatures created by this spell you can have at the same time. Summoning more than 8 creatures means that the older ones will time out immediately.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Summon Butterflies is amazing for making escapes, despite the wimpy name. The butterflies can block your enemies' movement and ranged attacks. At low power the spell only summons a few, but at high power it can surround you completely to a considerable radius.\n*The butterflies have no attack. They will fly off in random directions at high speed, making them especially good for blocking corridors.\n\n==Tips & tricks==\n*If you know spells like [[Conjure Flame]] or [[Freezing Cloud]], you can use Summon Butterflies to keep you enemies on top of the clouds for as long as you want.\n*For obvious reasons, this spell is also very useful for characters with smite-targeted spells, like [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]], although beware of doing so with gods which punish you hurting allies, like the [[good]] gods and [[Okawaru]].\n\n==Monster version==\nThe following enemies may be able to cast Summon Butterflies, depending on their spell set:\n\n*{{monsterlink|Pandemonium lord}} (4.2% chance)\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], players, [[player ghost]]s, and pandemonium lords could cast this spell. This spell was completely removed from the game, but the [[scroll of butterflies]] or Xom may produce the same effect.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], butterflies could be used for detecting hidden [[trap]]s.\n*In [[0.14]], maximum summons per single cast was lowered from 15 to 8.\n*Prior to [[0.8]] the spell always summoned at least 15 butterflies, regardless of spell power.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

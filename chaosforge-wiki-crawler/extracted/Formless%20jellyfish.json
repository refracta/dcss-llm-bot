{"title":"Formless jellyfish","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Formless_jellyfish","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Formless jellyfish''' are gelatinous sea creatures which [[paralyse]] and [[constrict]] its victims. Their stings have a 100% chance to paralyse for 1 turn; [[poison resistance]] gives a 2/3 chance to block this effect, but only poison immunity prevents it completely. They can be found throughout [[the Vaults]], rarely in [[Shoals]], and in small groups inside [[Slime Pits]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Even 1 turn of paralysis can really sting when you're around a group of enemies. A single turn of [[yaktaur]]s shooting at you, [[slime creature]]s mobbing up on you, etc. will quickly rack up damage.\n*Their [[willpower]] is moderate, the same as [[hydra]]s and [[jorogumo]]. High power [[Hexes]] or hex [[wand]]s can take them out.\n\n==History==\n*Formless jellyfish were introduced in [[0.31]]."}

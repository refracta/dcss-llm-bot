{"title":"Mimic","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mimic","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n'''Mimics''' are mischievous entities which harmlessly toy with passing adventurers. They disguise themselves as [[shop]]s, and in certain areas, items - most notably the [[rune of Zot]] in [[Vaults]]:5. However, once you come within a one-tile radius of them, they will \"vanish and cackle,\" disappearing from the game forever. Mimics are most often harmless, though a mimic rune may lead to hazardous situations.\n\nTo clarify, mimics are ''not monsters'', and cannot be killed in any way. \n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], [[portal]] entrances could be a mimic.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], mimics could randomly generate anywhere as an item or as many [[dungeon features]], such as [[stair]]cases.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], mimics were a category of monster which would resemble items or dungeon features, only to attack once the player got close enough. They came in [[mimic (monster)|standard]], [[inept mimic|inept]], and [[ravenous mimic|ravenous]] varieties.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], mimics could disguise themselves as [[door]]s, [[statue]]s, [[fountain]]s, or [[escape hatch|hatches]]."}

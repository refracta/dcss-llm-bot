{"title":"List of jellies","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_jellies","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n'''Jellies''' are amorphous creatures that serve [[Jiyva]], the [[god]] of slime. They mindlessly seek out and consume anything digestible in their quest to reproduce endlessly. Players should be careful around them, as their melee attacks are often [[acid]]ic, greatly reducing your AC and weapon damage (though some jellies pack different capabilities). They can be found in great numbers in [[the Slime Pits]], and they occasionally appear in other branches as well. \n\nAll jellies are immune to [[net]]s, [[web]]s, and [[constriction]].\n\nFollowers of Jiyva have nothing to fear from any kind of jelly, but worshipping Jiyva allows local jellies to consume items off the floor for the glory of the slime god.\n\n==Jelly Types==\n{{monsterlink|Endoplasm}}- Animate dungeon crud, endoplasms are only dangerous to the very inexperienced. They occasionally [[freeze]] their surroundings.\n\n{{monsterlink|Jelly}}- A simple blob of acidic goo. Kill it from a distance to avoid corrosion.\n\n{{monsterlink|Slime creature}}- While individually unassuming, multiple slime creatures can pile onto each other to create enormous, devastatingly powerful mountains of slime.\n\n{{monsterlink|Quicksilver ooze}}- Exceptionally fast oozes that can [[antimagic|disrupt spells]] with their attacks and disrupt spellcasters by [[engulf|smothering them]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Azure jelly}}- These swift-moving blobs have [[freezing]]-branded attacks in place of acid, dealing massive melee damage to characters unprepared for [[cold]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Acid blob}}- One of the most dreaded denizens of the Slime Pits, these blobs are swift, powerful, and can spit acid to melt distant foes.\n\n{{monsterlink|Rockslime}}- Highly durable slimes shrouded in a layer of stone; their attacks [[trample|stagger opponents backwards]] with the force of an avalanche.\n\n{{monsterlink|Formless jellyfish}}- Dangerous melee creatures with [[constrict]]ing tentacles and a [[paralysis|paralysing]] sting.\n\n===Unique Jellies===\n{{monsterlink|Dissolution}}- A gelatinous (and hungry) priest of Jiyva, capable of swamping you in swarms of hostile [[list of eyeballs|eyeballs]].\n\n{{monsterlink|The Royal Jelly}}- The undisputed ruler of all that lacks form, the Royal Jelly guards the slimy [[rune of Zot]] in the lowest depths of the Slime Pits.\n\n==Retired jellies==\n{{monsterlink|Death ooze}}- Mounds of rotting flesh inexplicably brought to undeath, death oozes inflicted [[rot]] instead of corrosion. Removed in [[0.27]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Brown ooze}}- These pests behaved much like regular jellies, engaging in melee to corrode your gear and eating items off the floor, but they hit much harder. Removed in [[0.15]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Pulsating lump}}- The twisted results of unholy [[Necromancy]], these wretched, slow-moving piles of flesh deformed anything they could reach with their [[mutation]]-inducing touch. Removed in [[0.15]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Giant amoeba}}- The most boring jelly of all, giant amoebas were big, beefy, and vaguely edible, but otherwise unexciting. Removed in [[0.14]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], jellies were not immune to [[net]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], all jellies were [[unbreathing]].\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

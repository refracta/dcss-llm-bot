{"title":"Joseph","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Joseph","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Joseph, a Mercenary''' is a [[unique]] [[human (monster)|human]] armed with a [[quarterstaff]] and [[sling]], both of which are often [[brand]]ed.\n\nAs an enemy with the [[:Category:Archer flag|archer flag]], Joseph does up to 8 extra damage with ranged weapons.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:7-10\n*[[The Lair]]:1\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Unlike [[list of centaurs|centaurs]], Joseph is a threat in both melee and ranged combat, though his sling is usually stronger. His weapons can do significant damage quickly, even to characters in decent armour. Try to face him without a lot of enemy support, and take him out quickly.\n**As with many ranged attackers, ducking around a corner is a good way to lure him into melee range.\n*He has no special resistances. [[Curare]] darts, [[Mephitic Cloud]], [[wand]]s, [[throwing net]]s, and going [[invisible]] can all help take him out.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], monsters did not have infinite ammo, so you could run him out of [[sling bullet]]s. Also, monster weapon penalties were removed, so Joseph became stronger overall.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

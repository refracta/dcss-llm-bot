{"title":"Ensorcelled Hibernation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ensorcelled_Hibernation","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Ensorcelled Hibernation''' is a level 2 [[Hexes]]/[[Ice Magic|Ice]] spell which puts a monster to sleep, allowing you to flee or [[stab]] them more easily.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen Ensorcelled Hibernation is cast and passes a [[willpower]] check, the targeted monster goes to [[sleep]]. Like other sleeping monsters, they may awaken when: you spend time in their [[LOS]] (depending on [[stealth]]), they hear [[noise]], or when injured by any attack. The sleep has no set duration, so a monster outside your LOS can sleep indefinitely so long as it isn't disturbed. However, they are guaranteed to sleep for at least one turn (i.e, you'll get a minimum of 1 action with the monster asleep).\n\nEnsorcelled Hibernation can't affect [[cold resistance|cold-resistant]] creatures, and it also won't work on the [[undead]], [[nonliving]], [[plant]]s, or [[berserk]] creatures. Monsters that awaken from this spell cannot be placed in hibernation again for up to 20 turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|mon-ench.cc|2337}}</ref> \n\n==Strategy==\nA decent spell for XL 2 or so [[Enchanter]]s. Sleep allows for a single, powerful stab on an opponent. However, your opponent, if it survives, will be awake and immune to this spell for some time. And, due to its low power cap, Ensorcelled Hibernation has trouble hexing mid-game / late-game opponents.\n\nIt's often best to cast Ensorcelled Hibernation when you're in melee range of an opponent. This prevents the enemy from waking up before you get a chance to stab them. \"\n\n===Compared to Confusing Touch===\n[[Confusing Touch]] tends to perform better as a general-use [[Hexes]] spell, since it lets you get multiple hex \"attempts\" to cast. For example, if you have a 20% success rate, Confusing Touch usually costs 3 MP, while Ensorcelled costs an average of 10 MP.\n\nIn turn, Ensorcelled Hibernation has an advantage against enemies with low/no willpower. It takes a turn to \"ready\" Confusing Touch before you start confusion attempts. Ensorcelled can work on the turn it is cast, which can save turns at high success rates. Also, confusing attacks can miss, wasting turns. Thus, Ensorcelled can see some use in the early game.\n\nIn any case, Enchanters should learn Confusing Touch, at least for situations where an enemy survives a sleep stab.\n\n==Monster Version==\nMonsters normally have access to the [[Sleep]] spell, which has the same effect but has no cooldown and works even with rC+. [[Player ghost]]s still have the proper version of this spell, though.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

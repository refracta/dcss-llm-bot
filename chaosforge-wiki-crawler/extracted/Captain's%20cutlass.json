He finally met his destiny when a kraken swallowed his ship, and the cutlass was thought to be lost with him.}}\n[[File:Captain's_cutlass.png]] ''''' the +7 captain's cutlass'''''\n\n+7 [[rapier]]\n\n[[Speed brand]]<br>\nDisarm\n\n==Mechanics==\nIf the captain's cutlass did at least <code>2 + 1d([[HD]])</code> damage, it has a <code>0.5 - (<0.5 * [[HD]]> / <4 * damage + 1d20 - 1>)</code> chance to disarm monsters of their weapon.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-func.h|1219}}</ref> This deals <code>17 + 1d18</code> extra damage in the process. HD is the [[hit dice]] of the monster. Only players can disarm.\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''captain's cutlass'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|768}}</ref> is an excellent rapier. For Short Blades specialists, it's around the level of a [[quick blade]], good at both general combat and for [[stabbing]]. The cutlass is stronger against enemies that wield weapons, but is still decent against those who don't.\n\nLike all Short Blades, it benefits greatly from any [[slaying]] bonuses you can give it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.20]], the captain's cutlass would behead hydras.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], the captain's cutlass didn't cause bonus damage when disarming. \n*In [[0.16]], the captain's cutlass got its enchantment bonus reduced to +5, but it gained a chance of disarming your opponent each attack.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the captain's cutlass had an enchantment bonus of +5, +10.\n*Prior to [[0.10]] this weapon carried a slaying bonus as a property (its base type was a [[sabre]]); in later versions this was incorporated into its base damage, and in [[0.14]], into its enchantment.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Short blades]]"}

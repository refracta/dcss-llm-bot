{"title":"Necromancer (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Necromancer_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info|necromancer}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Necromancers''' are evil casters of [[Necromancy]] and [[Conjurations]], often found surrounded by [[derived undead]] minions. They usually appear in [[the Crypt]] and [[Vaults]], the deeper portion of [[the Dungeon]], or in one particular [[Ice Cave]] ending along with an army of [[simulacrum (monster)|simulacra]].\n\n{{monster spells|necromancer}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Think of their [[Agony]] spell as somewhat like a single-target [[torment]]. Unlike torment, it requires line of effect and high [[willpower]] can negate it entirely; apart from that, you can take the sting out of it with [[negative energy resistance]], while a [[potion of lignification]] will render you entirely immune.\n*Watch out for the Bolt of Draining, which can pass through undead monsters harmlessly.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], they could have one of two possible spell sets:\n**[[Bolt of Cold]] (3d18), [[Agony Range]], [[Bind Souls]], and [[Invisibility]]\n**[[Bolt of Fire]] (3d18), [[Agony Range]], [[Bind Souls]], and [[Invisibility]]\n*In [[0.19]], necromancers gained [[Bind Souls]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], they were able to cast [[Animate Dead]], [[Inner Flame]], and [[Simulacrum]].\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

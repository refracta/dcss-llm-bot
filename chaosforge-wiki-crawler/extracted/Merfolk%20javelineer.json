{"title":"Merfolk javelineer","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Merfolk_javelineer","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | merfolk}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Merfolk javelineers''' are powerful [[List of merfolk|merfolk]] who inhabit [[the Shoals]]. They hurl [[javelin]]s with great force.\n\nAs an enemy with the [[:Category:Archer flag|archer flag]], javelineers deal up to 17 extra damage with ranged weapons, including javelins.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Javelineers carry small stacks of javelins, so characters looking for good [[throwing]] weapons should stop by the Shoals.\n*These monsters deal a lot of damage, so stay away if you have low [[EV]]. [[Repel Missiles#Player sources|RMsl]] is excellent here, if you can get it. They're not quite as bad as [[deep elf master archer]]s, but they tend to appear in greater numbers and with more friends.\n*Javelineers occasionally carry [[silver]] javelins; [[Transmuter]]s, [[Demonspawn]], and the heavily mutated should expect even heavier damage output than usual.\n*Unlike most ranged combatants, merfolk javelineers won't stop chucking javelins at you if you close into melee range. If you have a way to deal damage from a distance, do so to avoid having to charge through a rain of javelins.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], merfolk javlineers were nerfed (base damage 17->12, EV 14->12, HP 78->73). Also, they now carry much fewer javelins.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], merfolk javelineers could be found in [[the Depths]]. In addition, monsters were limited by ammo - e.g you could eventually run them out of javelins. Also, all monsters had hidden weapon penalties (they attacked slower).\n*In [[0.24]], the buff to javelins indirectly buffed javelineers; [[shields]], other than the small [[warlock's mirror]], no longer block them.\n\n[[Category:Merfolk]]"}

They are similar to [[stairs]] in that they allow the player to travel from one floor to another, but different in that they are all one-way. Using one will take you to a specific spot on the floor above or below. If you keep track of where an escape hatch goes, it can be useful for travelling quickly, but be careful; there is no going back, and your destination may be hazardous.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you take escape hatches whenever you see them, it may provide you with a shorter route to certain destinations (like [[shop]]s or a [[stash]]). Autotravel will take them into account, meaning you don't have to remember the most efficient route to where you're going.\n*Generally, avoid taking an escape hatch to a floor when there's a chance it'll spit you out someplace hazardous with no way to get back safely. Good examples of this are floors you haven't explored yet or floors with dangerous [[vault]]s, including (but not limited to) the various branch endings. Nothing ruins your day more than losing a promising end-game character because you took an escape hatch down to [[Zot:5]] and landed in the middle of the Orb chamber.\n**Note that escape hatches '''can''' drop you inside a [[transporter]] vault, so be careful.\n\n==History==\n*In earlier versions of ''Crawl'', escape hatches could prove lethal when used in the [[Orcish Mines]] or the [[Slime Pits]]. Players would find themselves suddenly trapped in small chambers with no escape routes unless they brought in their own source of [[teleportation]] or [[dig]]ging.\n*In very early versions of DCSS, escape hatches were referred to as ''rock staircases'', as distinguished from the normal stone staircases.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

Unlike [[shields]], they provide no defensive value, but come with one of several unique egos:\n\n*[[Energy]] - Provides two sources of passive [[channeling]]\n*[[Guile]] - Reduces [[willpower]] of both the wielder and their targets\n*[[Light]] - Surrounds the wielder with a 3-tile [[halo]]\n*[[Mayhem]] - May send enemies into a [[frenzy]]\n*[[Wrath]] - Has a 20% of inducing [[berserk]] rage when the wielder attacks\n\nOrbs will always spawn with one of the egos listed above. [[Randart]] orbs will always spawn with one of these egos.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], orbs could not appear as [[randart]]s. Also, three [[unrand]] orbs were introduced in this version (all formely staff unrands).\n*Equippable orbs were added in [[0.28]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Regular''' || [[File:Orb.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artefact''' || [[File:Orb randart1.png]] [[File:Orb randart2.png]] [[File:Orb randart3.png]] [[File:Orb randart4.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]] Orbs\n|-\n| '''[[Sphere of Battle]]''' || [[File:Sphere of battle.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Orb of Dispater]]''' || [[File:Orb of Dispater.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[crystal ball of Wucad Mu]]''' || [[File:Crystal ball of wucad mu.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Charlatan's Orb]]''' || [[File:Urand charlatan's orb.png]]\n|}\n\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Orbs]]"}

It is a two handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''quarterstaff''' is one of the best weapons available in the early game, due to its excellent accuracy, damage, and speed. However, quarterstaves require both hands, which means sacrificing the [[shield]] slot.\n\n==Strategy==\nQuarterstaves deal high damage for their base delay, but the [[Staves]] skill is rather limited. The only other staves are [[lajatang]]s (which are considerably rarer) and [[magical staves]] (which require training Staves, a corresponding spell school, ''and'' Evocations to use effectively). You could be stuck without a lajatang for long periods of time, forcing you to use a quarterstaff or swap to another weapon type.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Quarterstaff.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Quarterstaff2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Quarterstaff 3.png]]\n|}\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Staves]]"}

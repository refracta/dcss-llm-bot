{"title":"Soldier ant","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Soldier_ant","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful info==\nA '''soldier ant''' is a hardier version of the [[worker ant]], with the same strengths and vulnerabilities, except that the soldier ant is tougher and of average speed.\n\n==Tips and tricks==\n*Poison works exceptionally well against them. [[Venom]]ous weapons and [[Poison Magic]] will kill them in short order, and [[Mephitic Cloud]] will turn them against each other.\n*Their magic resistance is low, so you can confuse and paralyse them without too much trouble.\n*As long as you have [[poison resistance]], facing them shouldn't be too much trouble, though they can still manage to mangle lightly armored spellcasters who let them get into close quarters.\n\n==History==\n* Soldier ants were removed in [[0.27]]."}

Transforms the user into a slow, stone statue. The caster's melee damage, both unarmed and with weapons, is substantially increased. The caster's stone body is immune to poison and miasma, and gains resistance to electricity and negative energy. Shapeshifting skill increases armour granted. While transformed, any equipped body armour, gloves and boots are melded.}}\n[[File:granite talisman.png]] A '''granite talisman''' is a [[talisman]] that changes you into '''Statue Form''', granting you the durability (and speed) of a statue.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen e'''V'''oked, a granite talisman turns you into Statue Form, which lasts until you end the form. Entering or exiting a form takes 5 turns.\n\nStatue Form has the following effects:\n\n'''Combat Bonuses'''\n* '''HP Bonus:''' 130% HP\n* '''Innate AC:''' Linearly scales from the following points, rounding down:\n** Below minimum: 7 AC (0 skill) - 27 AC (16 skill)\n** Above minimum: 27 AC (16 skill) - 38 AC (25 skill) ; +1 AC per 0.81 level\n* '''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' 12 base damage.\n* All melee damage, including from [[weapon]]s, is increased by 50% (after [[AC]] is applied).\n\n'''Resistances'''\n* Poison immunity\n* rElec, rN+\n* rTorment (50% damage from torment, stacks with rN)\n* '''[[Non-living]]:''' [[Unbreathing]], lacks [[blood]], immune to [[sleep]] and [[petrification]]\n* Vulnerable to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] and [[Shatter]].\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n* '''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' [[Body armour]], [[gloves]], [[boots]].\n* '''All''' actions slowed by +50%, as if you were [[slow]]ed. This stacks with the slow status.\n* Species [[movement delay]] set to 1.0. It is then slowed by 50% (to 1.5 with no other factors).\n* If you are an [[amphibious]] species, you can stand in [[deep water]], but you get all the normal penalties from both shallow and deep water (statues can't swim).\n\nStatue Form has a minimum [[Shapeshifting]] skill of 16, below which you get an [[Talisman#Skill|HP penalty]], and the AC bonus scales down. It has a maximum skill of 25, where skill has no further impact.\n\n[[Gargoyle]]s cannot use this item, as they are already made out of stone.\n\n[[Roxanne]] always carries the talisman.\n\n==Strategy==\nBeing permanently [[slow]]ed is always dangerous, but Statue Form is ''very'' durable. Unlike many forms, you get to keep a [[shield]]. And unlike heavy [[body armour]], you'll have your full, unencumbered [[EV]]. With high HP, AC, EV, and decent SH, Statue Form offers more defense than any other form. Overall, it is a fairly strong form for Unarmed Combat users. It also has some nice resistances; [[torment]] resistance in particular is valuable in [[extended]].\n\nStatue Form only boosts Unarmed Combat. Other characters can use it for its defenses or resistances, but will find it less useful.\n*This form does not explicitly penalize spells... but all actions, including spellcasting, are slowed by 50%. Thus, direct damage spells become less effective. A Conjurations-focused caster can still appreciate Statue Form for its defenses, but bear in mind the slowness. Of course, spells are not ''useless'', as support magic can be very helpful.\n*Statue Form boosts melee weapon damage by 50%, but it also slows melee by 50% - there's no net increase to damage.\n*Like spells, [[Ranged Weapons]] are slowed with no damage boost.\n\nIn a 3-rune game, these characters should generally focus on [[Fighting]] and other defensive skills before using Statue Form. In [[extended]], however, the torment resistance can give this form more merit.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*[[Translocations]] spells are great to use in this form. [[Lesser Beckoning]] and [[Vhi's Electric Charge]] help a slow-moving melee fighter approach enemies. [[Manifold Assault]] lets you swing your fists at full-screen range.\n*Can be good for (15 rune) low turncount [[speedrun]]s. Since you act at 1.5 delay, you'll regenerate 1.5 [[decaAut]] per move, while only taking 1 \"[[turn]]\".\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

This form was previously implemented as a level 6 [[Earth Magic]]/[[Transmutations]] spell, [[Statue Form (spell)|Statue Form]]. There are no direct changes between versions, but exiting a form now takes 5 turns, which is a notable nerf for this form in particular.\n\n{{Forms}}\n\n[[Category: Transformation]]"}

{"title":"Cursed","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cursed","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{flavour|It has a curse placed upon it.}}\n\n'''Cursed''' items are impossible to unequip until the curse is broken, which destroys the item. Followers of [[Ashenzari]] are given the ability to curse their gear, granting them [[piety]] and [[skill]] bonuses. Ashenzari also turns cursed items into [[artefact]]s, rending them immune to further enchantment -- see [[Ashenzari#Curses|Ashenzari's]] page for more details.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], curses were not exclusive to [[Ashenzari]]. Any piece of equipment could potentially be cursed, items that generated with negative enchantments were likely to be cursed, and certain detrimental items were ''always'' cursed. Some [[artefact]]s could also curse themselves when equipped. Curses could be removed by reading a [[scroll of remove curse]] or getting your [[god]] to bless an item; uncursing did not destroy items, and Ashenzari did not make cursed items artefacts.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], weapons of [[holy wrath]] could never be cursed under any circumstances.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], [[miscast effects]] from the [[Charms]] and [[Hexes]] schools of magic could sometimes curse your items.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the [[Curse card]] could curse one or more items in your inventory.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], [[scrolls of enchant armour]] and [[scroll of enchant weapon|enchant weapon]] would also remove the item's curse.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], regular [[mummy (monster)|mummies]] and [[Menkaure]] had [[death curse]]s that could curse your equipment.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], curse scrolls would randomly generate throughout the dungeon. Also, cursed [[gloves]] and [[cloak]]s would prevent you from changing your [[ring]]s and [[body armour]], respectively.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], the player character was unable to butcher [[corpse]]s with cursed blunt weapons.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], you could read a [[scroll of detect curse]] to examine your inventory for cursed items, just like the obsolete spell.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], (and the removal of the [[Divinations]] school of magic), the [[Detect Curse]] spell allowed you to determine the cursed or uncursed status of all items in your [[inventory]] without any personal risk. This update also removed the [[Remove Curse]] spell, which uncursed any equipped items.\n\n[[Category:Items]]"}

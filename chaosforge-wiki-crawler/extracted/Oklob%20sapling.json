{"title":"Oklob sapling","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Oklob_sapling","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Oklob saplings''' are immature [[oklob plant]]s, not quite as durable as an adult, but still capable of dealing just as much [[acid]] damage. Although easier to kill, they are worth much less [[XP]]. They can be created by [[Fedhas]]' Overgrowth, and found in a few [[vault]]s.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*See [[oklob plant]] for strategy.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Spit Acid dealt 3d7 base damage, but had an extra 4d5 \"acid splash\" on top of it.\n*They could be summoned in [[Zot Defense]], before it was removed in [[0.16]]."}

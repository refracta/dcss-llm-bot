For players, energy resistance reduces the damage and draining dealt by this spell by 50% (rN+), 75% (rN++), or 100% (rN+++). Draining can be quite irritating, since it lowers your max HP (until you gain sufficient XP).\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n{{Spell\n|name=Bolt of Draining\n|level=5\n|school1={{Conjurations}}\n|school2={{Necromancy}}\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Death]]\n</div>\n|castingnoise=2\n|spellnoise=0\n}}\n{{AttackSpell\n|name=Bolt of Draining\n|formula = 4d(3.75+Power*3/20)\n|maxdmg = 4d33 [[negative energy]]\n|maxsp = 200\n|range = 6\n|target = Bolt\n|tohit = 8+Power/20\n|special = [[Draining]]\n|hit_type = normal\n|hit_adder = 8\n|hit_num = 1\n|hit_denom = 20\n|dam_calculator = calcdice\n|dam_numdice = 4\n|dam_adder = 15\n|dam_num = 3\n|dam_denom = 5}}\n*Prior to [[0.26]], [[drain]]ing reduced skill XP instead of max HP.

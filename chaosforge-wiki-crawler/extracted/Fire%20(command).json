{"title":"Fire (command)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fire_(command)","type":"raw","data":"{{version027}}\n\nThe '''fire''' command, invoked by pressing '''[[f]]''', fires the [[Quiver (command)|quivered]] ranged weapon, evocable, invocation, ability, or spell at a square that you select (usually one with a [[monster]]). After pressing '''f''' and selecting a target to aim at, you can then fire by pressing:\n*'''f''' (again) or '''Enter''' (to fire past the target, potentially hitting whatever's behind it if the first target is missed) or\n*'''.''' (to fire directly at the target's tile, guaranteeing that the projectile will not travel past the tile you're aiming at even if it misses all targets). \n\nNon-targeted abilities will instead show the range of the ability (if applicable) and ask for confirmation to fire.\n\nNote that [[throwing]] weapons need merely to be quivered, but [[arrow]]s, [[bolt]]s, and [[sling bullet]]s require you to have an equipped [[bow]], [[crossbow]], or [[sling]] (respectively) before you can fire them.\n\n[[Category:Commands]]"}

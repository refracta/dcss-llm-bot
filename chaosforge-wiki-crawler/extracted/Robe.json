It offers little protection against physical harm, but does not hinder evasion or spellcasting.\n\n----\n\n\"CLEOPATRA: Give me my robe; put on my crown; I have<br>Immortal longings in me\"\n\n-William Shakespeare, _Anthony & Cleopatra_, V, ii, ca. 1605.}}\n\n'''Robes''' are the lightest and least protective body armour in the game. Many classes, including most spellcasters, start with one. They are one of the [[animal skin|few]] [[troll leather armour|body]] [[dragon scales|armours]] that [[Spriggan]]s, [[Oni]], and [[Troll]]s can wear.\n\n==Egos==\n*[[Fire resistance]]\n*[[Cold resistance]]\n*[[Willpower]]\n*[[Resistance (ego)|Resistance]]\n\nAlso, [[randart]] robes can generate with the [[Archmagi]] ego.\n\n==Desirability==\nA robe is passible for any character whose primary means of defense is going to be their [[EV]]. But for many such characters, superior alternatives exist. [[Steam dragon scales]] are just as light, but provides better armour. [[Leather armour]], [[troll leather armour]], and other light dragon scales all provide greater AC for a relatively small encumbrance. However, there are a number of reasons you might wear a robe:\n*Robes appear much earlier than most alternatives; many [[background]]s start with them. \n**Species that can't fit into standard kinds of armour will likely be stuck with a robe for a while.\n**A +1 robe is better than a +0 leather armour.\n*Robes can spawn with good [[ego]]s. A robe of resistance is a very convenient way to gain resistances, particularly for slot-restricted races who otherwise have trouble getting them.\n<br>\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Robe1.png]] or [[File:Robe2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Robe_ego1.png]] or [[File:Robe_ego2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Robe_art1.png]] or [[File:Robe_art2.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]] Robes\n|-\n| '''[[Robe of Augmentation]]''' || [[File:Robe of augmentation.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Robe of Clouds]]''' || [[File:Robe of clouds.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Robe of Night]]''' || [[File:Robe of night.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Robe of Folly]]''' || [[File:Robe of folly.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Robe of Misfortune]]''' || [[File:Robe of misfortune.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Robe of Vines]]''' || [[File:Robe of vines.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], non-artefact robes could spawn with Archmagi.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], randart robes could not spawn with Archmagi.\n\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

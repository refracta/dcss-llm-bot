{"title":"List of humans","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_humans","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\nThe benchmark species against which others are compared, '''humans''' play a major, though somewhat inconspicuous role in the far-flung realms of ''Dungeon Crawl''. Aside from a somewhat increased presence as specialized guardians of [[the Vaults]], humans tend to be scattered widely across the [[Dungeon]] and its [[branch]]es, arriving most often as unique, individually-named foes rather than as generic types of monster - they are arguably the one species best represented in this way.\n\nThe following is a list of humans appearing as monsters in all their various incarnations across ''Dungeon Crawl'':\n\n==Generic humans==\n{{LightGrey|p}} [[File:Human (monster).png]] '''[[Human (monster)|Human]]''' - Occasionally found tending [[sheep]], warming by fires, and generally eking out a meager existence in the Dungeon.\n\n=====Generic human variants=====\n:[[File:Deformed human.png]] - All manner of '''deformed''' and '''sickly humans''' (and other species) can be found in [[Cigotuvi's Fleshworks]].\n\n==Human types==\n{{Magenta|p}} [[File:Wizard (monster).png]] '''[[Wizard (monster)|Wizard]]''' - These eccentric magic-users possess an eclectic spell-set replete with dangerous conjurations and enchantments.\n\n{{White|p}} [[File:Necromancer (monster).png]] '''[[Necromancer (monster)|Necromancer]]''' - Akin to the wizard, but with a focus on death magic.

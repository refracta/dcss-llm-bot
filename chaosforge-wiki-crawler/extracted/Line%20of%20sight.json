Usually, you can only attack or be attacked by monsters inside your LOS.\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe default LOS radius used by most species is out to 7 spaces, or a 15x15 square.\n\nThe following picture shows tiles within the default field of view with their grid distance.\n\n<pre>\n777777777777777\n766666666666667\n765555555555567\n765444444444567\n765433333334567\n765432222234567\n765432111234567\n7654321@1234567\n765432111234567\n765432222234567\n765433333334567\n765444444444567\n765555555555567\n766666666666667\n777777777777777\n</pre>\n\nThere are a few ways to increase or reduce your line of sight:\n* A [[scarf]] of shadows reduces LOS by 1.\n* The [[Robe of Night]] reduces LOS by 25%, with your LOS rounded down.\n* [[Kobold]]s start with rank 3 of [[Nightstalker]], reducing LOS by 3 tiles to 4 spaces (9x9 square).\n* [[Barachim]] have an innate mutation that increases their default LOS by 1, to a total of 8 spaces (17x17 square).\n\nLine of sight is similar to, but distinct from, \"line of effect\" (i.e. the area of the Dungeon you may interact with). Most of the time, they are interchangeable, but some situations may result in places you can see but not affect (such as tiles behind transparent [[wall]]s) or can affect but cannot see (such as [[Fireball]]'s explosions hitting foes around corners).\n\n==Strategy==\nIf you can't see them, they can't see you. With very few exceptions, '''enemies that can't see you can't attack you.'''\n\nThere are several ways to break your line of sight with an enemy:\n\n*Teleporting/blinking out of range\n*Closing [[door]]s\n*Turning a corner\n*Reading a [[scroll of fog]]\n*Going up/down [[stairs]] or [[shaft]]s\n*[[Zin|Imprison]]ing them, or [[Tomb card|yourself]]\n*Running away faster than they can chase you.\n\nBecause LOS is square, exploring in a diagonal direction will reveal more tiles than exploring in a cardinal one (all else equal). If you want to find an [[Abyss]] exit or uncover the most tiles for [[Human]] regeneration, move diagonally.\n\n===Attacking Outside LOS===\nLike monsters, most of your attacks cannot harm targets outside your LOS. For example, [[ranged weapon]]s only shoot up to your LOS, your [[summon]]s cannot attack if either them or their target are out of sight, and any [[cloud]]s you create vanish when leaving sight. There are a few exceptions; an incomplete list is displayed below:\n*Many types of \"explosion\" attacks: [[Damnation]], [[Fireball]], [[Fire Storm]], [[Iceblast]], [[Inner Flame]], [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] (cannot hit on the other side of a wall), [[tin of tremorstones]].\n*Certain types of [[allied]]/[[neutral]] monsters: [[Beogh]] orcs, [[charm]]ed monsters, [[Gozag|bribed]] monsters, [[frenzied]] monsters, [[Fedhas]] non-summoned non-stationary plants, humans from [[Kirke]]'s band.\n*Passive effects: [[poison]] and [[Sticky Flame]].\n\nNote that there is no way to attack an enemy from a different floor without entering it.\n\n===Being Attacked Outside LOS===\nWhen no targets are in their line of sight, monsters can still cast the following spells:\n*[[Dig]]\n*[[Major Healing]]\n*[[Minor Healing]]\n\nIn addition, monsters can target your [[allies]] even if the monster itself is outside the player's line of sight. If a monster uses an explosion, area-of-effect, cloud, or other sort of 'lasting' attack, it can end up hitting you.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.17]], line of sight was circular, with a radius of about 8. You could see slightly less tiles overall, and saw much less in diagonal directions. Characters could reach their target in 5 squares (instead of 8) at certain angles.\n:Ranges were also circular; up to 2 tiles of range were lost when shooting diagonally. For example, [[Bolt of Fire]] could shoot 7 tiles in a cardinal direction, 5 in a diagonal one, and 6 in-between. Base ranges across the board were 1 higher than they are in current versions.\n*Prior to [[0.7]], abilities and spells had rectangular ranges instead of circular ranges.\n\n===Changing LOS===\n*In [[0.26]], the LOS-reducing [[shadows]] ego was added, the [[Darkness]] spell was removed, and [[Nightstalker]] was changed from a potential [[Demonspawn mutations|Demonspawn mutation]] to a [[Kobold]] innate ability.\n*In [[0.20]], [[Barachim]] and their unique +LOS mutation were added.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the [[Shadow card]] existed and could be used to further reduce the player's LOS.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], the [[lantern of shadows]] existed and could be used to further reduce the player's LOS.\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

When released, the elementals are drawn magnetically to the center of nearby monsters, where they literally explode with rage at their rest being disturbed. Tremorstones usually land slightly off-target, and the user is always at risk of being hit. However, armour is extremely effective at repelling the lightweight fragments of rock from a tremorstone's explosion, so a well-armoured wielder has little to fear. Evocations skill increases the number of the elementals' explosions.}}\n\nA '''tin of tremorstones''' is an [[evocable]] item that generates several explosions of shrapnel. These are aimed in the general direction of nearby enemies, but there is always a risk of getting caught in the explosions yourself. The explosions are greatly reduced by [[AC]].\n\nThis item is [[alternate items|mutually exclusive]] with the [[condenser vane]]. Like with other miscellaneous evocables, only 1 tin of tremorstones (or condenser vane) will spawn in a given game.\n\n==Useful Info==\nEach charge of a tin of tremorstones will create <code>1 + 2 * log2(1 + [[Evocations]]/6)</code> explosions<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|evoke.cc|693}}<br>Stepdown function can be found at {{source ref|0.30.0|stepdown.cc|14}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|evoke.cc|726}}</ref> - at 27 Evocations, you'll get 5-6 explosions. Explosions are 5x5, and each explosion deals <code>6d6</code> damage, independent of your Evocations skill.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|zap-data.h|1683}}</ref> Explosions are reduced thrice by [[AC]] rather than once, and multiple explosions check AC multiple times. They have a [[to-hit]] of 40.\n\nEach explosion will ''find'' the cell that is 1. within 3 tiles from you and 2. is in the \"center of mass\" of monsters.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|evoke.cc|593}}<br>Specifically, it calculates sum(dist_from_monsters), where the diagonals are equally as far as orthogonal directions, and picks a square within 3 tiles with the smallest value. Thus, the center may not be as you'd expect, and there are often multiple valid tiles to be the \"center\".</ref> The explosion will be centered ''1 tile away'' from that cell, meaning the tin can fire 2-4 tiles away from you. If there are no visible targets, then the explosion will explode at a random tile. Since explosions are 5x5, a tin is unable to hit a monster that's 7 or more tiles away. However, explosions can hit monsters outside [[line of sight]].\n\nA tin of tremorstones holds up to two charges, which are gradually replenished as you gain [[experience]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"text-align: center\" border=1\n|-\n!Min. explosions !!

Heavily armoured players won't have to worry much about self damage, though this item will do little against enemies with high AC. Good targets include:\n**High EV, low AC monsters, especially those who come in packs. Examples include [[list of arachnids|spiders]], [[list of deep elves|deep elves]], and [[meliai]]. Explosions have high - but not perfect - accuracy, so using tremorstones is likely to tear these packs into shreds.\n**Frail, but annoying monsters. At moderate Evocations (6-12 levels), 1 charge is likely to take out [[boggart]]s, [[moths of wrath]], and [[floating eye]]s, etc.\n**Low AC monsters in general. Can be used to kill [[hydra]]s if it's aimed right. [[List of ogres|Ogre packs]] are another nice target.\n*Take advantage of the targeting. Explosions are always 5x5, centered within 2-4 tiles from you, and target the center of a crowd of enemies. So if 1. the enemy is within 2-4 tiles and 2. inside a big group of monsters, it is almost certain that the monster gets hit by each explosion.\n**Note that, if there are 2 or more groups of monsters in LOS, the tremorstones might not hit anything.\n*A [[scroll of immolation]] combos well. Immolation creates [[flame cloud]]s, increasing the tremorstones' damage output. And the resulting explosions will definitely hurt. As usual, don't let the explosions kill you.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"left\" widths=\"600px\" heights=\"600px\" mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Tremorstones demo.png|left|Explosions are aimed at a tile that's 1. 3 tiles away, and 2. closest to \"center of monster mass\".<br>Red square: Center of mass.<br>Orange square: Area that explosions will ''always'' hit, for a given center.\nFile:Tremorstones sniping.png|left|Explosions can hit enemies from outside your [[line of sight]].<br>Just make sure that you see at least one enemy.<br><small>(3rd picture taken with [[wizard mode]] to see through walls.)\n</gallery>\n'''N.B.''' there may be multiple possible centers of mass - see below for details.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], tins of tremorstones did not [[alternate items|alternate]] with the condenser vane. Also, if there were visible tiles within 3 spaces, but none of those tiles would hit a monster (e.g. after reading a [[scroll of fog]]), the item would fail and waste a charge.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], tins of tremorstones came with three charges instead of two.\n*Tins of tremorstones were introduced in [[0.25]]. They were introduced to replace the cone-targeted [[wand of scattershot]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Evocables}}"}

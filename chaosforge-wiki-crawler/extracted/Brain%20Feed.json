Such a loss is only temporary, and can be recovered by gaining experience.}}\n\n'''Brain Feed''' is a [[smite]]-targeted monster-only spell that has a 33% chance to inflict 1d3 points of temporary [[intelligence]] damage on your character. Although this is normally just a nuisance, [[berserker]]s and other character builds with very low intelligence are at risk of [[stat zero]], and mages that are using spells they can just barely cast reliably may find themselves [[miscast]]ing at inopportune moments.\n\nHaving a way to increase your intelligence (such as a backup [[ring of intelligence]] or an [[artefact]] with the +Int property) will greatly reduce the danger of Brain Feed. Followers of [[Cheibriados]] gain enough extra intelligence to render all but the most egregious losses moot, and followers of [[Elyvilon]] may simply use the [[Purification]] ability to reverse any damage once the monster is dealt with.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

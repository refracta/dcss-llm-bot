{"title":"Portal","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Portal","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n''This page is about the dungeon feature. For the obsolete card or spell, see [[Portal card]] or [[Portal (spell)]] respectively.''\n\nA '''portal''' is a (generally) temporary gateway to a special level. Each such level has multiple possibilities for its exact layout and inhabitants, but always follows a specific theme. You will almost certainly encounter some of these in every game, but it is extremely rare to ever find all of them in a single run-through. In the console version of ''Crawl'', portals are represented by the {{White|∩}} glyph.\n\n==Useful Info==\nPortals are either timed and announced, or silent and permanent. The majority of portal levels are announced.\n\nRegardless if a portal is announced or silent, you may only enter a portal once; exiting it will close the portal for good. If you have a full inventory, it is recommended to leave excess items outside, so you don't have to leave stuff permanently behind. Except for [[Ziggurat]]s, portals will always have an exit very near to the entrance, so it is usually safe to enter a portal and then decide whether you can take it on.\n\n=== Timed portals ===\n\nAnnounced portals are timed, and give a warning when you first enter their floor. They will eventually close if you do not get to them fast enough.  They continue to count down even if you are on a different level. Every 500 auts (reduced to 250 auts when there are less than 900 auts remaining), the portal gives a \"sound\", indicating roughly how far the portal is (ignoring walls)<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|dat/dlua/lm_tmsg.lua|47}}</ref> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Adjective || Distance (tiles)\n|-\n| – || 0–6\n|-\n| Very nearby || 7–13\n|-\n| Nearby || 14–20\n|-\n| Distant || 21–27\n|-\n| Very distant || 28+\n|-\n|}\n\nand also how much time it has left, according to the table below. Each portal starts with 6000–8000 [[aut]]s on its clock, except for Gauntlets which have a shorter timer of 4000–6000, and Bazaars, whose timer increases with depth. The final message is guaranteed to play and gives a resting on the portal entrance a last chance to enter. When an announced portal times out somewhere out of sight, you get the message \"The walls and floor vibrate strangely for a moment!\"\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan = 2 | Portal !! rowspan=2 | Timer description !! colspan = 6 | Time remaining (auts)\n|-\n! 5001+ !! 4001–5000 !! 2501–4000 !! 1501–2500 !! 101–1500 !!

Also, you could enter the portal of a [[Malign Gateway]], assuming the tentacle wasn't already there. Entering it would [[blink]] you and deal minor damage.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], there were only three levels of portal distance sounds.\n*[[Labyrinth]]s were replaced by the Gauntlet in [[0.23]].\n*Desolation of Salt was added in [[0.19]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], a shorter timer would be started upon first seeing the timed portal.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], many timed portals were not announced.\n*[[The Spider's Nest]] was upgraded from a portal level to a full-fledged dungeon branch in [[0.11]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Portals|*]]"}

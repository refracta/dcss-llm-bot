{"title":"Damnation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Damnation","type":"raw","data":"{{version027}}\n''This article is about the damage type. For the artefact crossbow by this name, see [[Damnation (unrand)]]. For the [[demonspawn mutation]] see [[Hurl Damnation (mutation)]].''\n\n'''Damnation''' is an extremely dangerous damage type that is virtually irresistible. It is always dealt in 3×3-tile blasts that never miss and is one of the main threats in [[Pandemonium]] and the [[Hell]] branches.\n\n==Monster spells==\n===Hurl Damnation===\n{{flavour|Blasts a targeted enemy with damnation. These unholy forces harm the victim and anyone adjacent, and are not affected by any means of protection, such as armour or resistances. However, certain creatures, usually those able to invoke damnation themselves, are entirely unscathed by damnation.}}\n\nThis spell has a range of 7, requires a line of sight to the target, and creates an unavoidable 3×3 burst. Damage in each tile is 3d20 damnation.\n{{monsters with spell|Hurl Damnation}}\n\n===Call Down Damnation===\n{{flavour|Blasts a targeted enemy with damnation, with no direct line of fire required. These unholy forces harm the victim and anyone adjacent, and are not affected by any means of protection, such as armour or resistances. However, certain creatures, usually those able to invoke damnation themselves, are entirely unscathed by damnation.}}\n\nThis version uses [[smite-targeting]] to direct a 3×3 burst of damnation against targets in LOS. Damage is 3d15.\n{{monsters with spell|Call Down Damnation}}\n\n==Damnation Sources for the Player==\nThere are few methods available for players to gain access to Hurl Damnation. They are all found in the late game, and usually require a heavy cost to use. (Call Down Damnation cannot be used by players by any means.)\n*[[File:Staff of dispater.png]] Evoking the [[Staff of Dispater]] will reliably cast Hurl Damnation (<code>[[Spell power|Power]] = [[Evocations]] * 8</code>, max damage 3d42), but at a cost of 14 HP and 4 MP.\n*[[File:Urand damnation.png]] Bolts fired with [[Damnation (unrand)|the arbalest \"Damnation\"]] cause damnation damage.\n*The [[Hurl_Damnation_(mutation)|Hurl Damnation]] [[Demonspawn mutation]] allows you to cast Hurl Damnation at rank 3 (damage based on [[XL]], max 3d42 at level 27) but at a cost of 15% of your max HP per use.\n\nAll player-launched sources of damnation require a line of sight and create an unavoidable 3×3 burst.\n\n==Damnation Resistance==\nSome monsters (typically [[demon]]s) possess [[:Category:Damnation resistance|damnation resistance]], rendering them immune to damage from damnation. Players cannot acquire damnation immunity; the only possible way to reduce damnation damage is the [[Deep dwarf#Damage Reduction|damage-shaving]] ability of [[deep dwarves]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.18]], damnation was known as hellfire and counted as [[fire]] damage in addition to being irresistible. The Hellfire Burst spell was renamed to Call Down Damnation, and Hellfire is now Hurl Damnation.\n\n==See Also==\n[[:Category:Damnation resistance|List of damnation-resistant monsters]]"}

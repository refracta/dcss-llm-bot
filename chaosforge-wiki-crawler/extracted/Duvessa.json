{"title":"Duvessa","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Duvessa","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For a list of all elves, see [[list of deep elves]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Duvessa, Sister of [[Dowan]]''' is one of a pair of twin [[elf]] [[unique]]s that hunt through the [[Dungeon]] as a team, always encountered together. On her own, Duvessa is a moderately strong melee fighter, and Dowan can even [[haste]] his sister. Killing one sibling will buff the other.\n\nWhen Dowan is killed, Duvessa gains permanent [[berserk]] the moment she sees you.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:4-7\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Neither Duvessa nor Dowan will follow you up or down [[stairs]], unless their sibling is adjacent to you too (in which case they both will) or their sibling is dead.\n*A berserk Duvessa hits very hard and very fast, but only hurts in melee range and has no ranged attacks. Dowan can pelt you with strong magic, but has less durability.\n*Consider wearing them both down before killing either of them. The survivor's HP will still be fairly low even after finding hidden power.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Duvessa's berserk would eventually wear off; you could go upstairs and wait it out. Unlike Dowan, Duvessa didn't gain any permanent benefit (she only went berserk once), so it was often best to kill the brother first.\n\n[[category:Elf]]"}

They are naturally [[invisible]] and permanently [[confused]], spending most of their time moving randomly. Every so often, however, they'll fire off a bolt of lightning, dealing [[electricity]] damage to anything that happens to be in its way. Due to their invisibility, a random lightning bolt out of a seemingly clear space is the first clue you'll have that they're around. They are normally only found in [[the Swamp]], the [[Cloud Mages' Chambers]], or certain [[vault]]s, but may be summoned by drawing the [[Foxfire card]].\n\n<!--spl-bot-begin-->\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Lightning Bolt]] (3d16)\n|slot2=[[Lightning Bolt]] (3d16)\n|slot3=[[Melee spell|Melee]]\n|slot4=[[Lightning Bolt]] (3d16)\n|slot5=''none''\n|slot6=''none''\n}}\n{{clear}}\n<!--spl-bot-end-->\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*rElec takes almost all of the risk out of dealing with them.\n\n==History==\nVapours were removed in [[0.15]].\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

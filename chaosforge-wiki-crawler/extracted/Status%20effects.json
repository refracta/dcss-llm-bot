{"title":"Status effects","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Status_effects","type":"raw","data":"{{version|028}}\n'''Status effects''' are temporary enhancements and ailments that both you and the inhabitants of [[the Dungeon]] can benefit or suffer from. Unlike [[mutation]]s, status effects will run their course after enough time has passed or after you escape whatever's inflicting the effect. Many status effects can be cured or prevented in a variety of ways; see their individual pages for details. There are also in-game descriptions of statuses available (hit '''?''', then '''/''', then '''t''' for sTatus, then type in the indicator text you see).\n\nMost status effects will display a coloured (often abbreviated) word in your character information for as long as they last. Status effects that have a limited duration will often turn a darker colour as the effect nears its end, whereas other status effects use a darker colour to indicate increasing severity of the effect.\n\n==Beneficial Status Effects==\n===Agile===\n{{LightBlue|Agil}}\n\n[[Demonspawn]] with [[Powered by Pain]] may give you agility, which boosts [[dexterity]], [[stealth]], and [[evasion]].\n\n===Alive===\n{{Green|Alive}}\n\nAlive [[Vampire]]s have fast [[Regeneration rate]], can use [[Transformation]]s, and can go [[berserk]].\n\n===Augmentation===\n{{Blue|Aug}} {{LightBlue|Aug}} {{White|Aug}}\n\n[[Demonspawn]] with the Augmentation [[demonspawn mutation]] gain [[slaying]] and [[spell power]] bonuses as their HP rises. The brighter the colour of the effect, the larger the bonus.\n\n===Berserk===\n{{LightBlue|Berserk}}\n\nYou have gone [[berserk]], gaining a huge boost to [[HP]], [[Might|melee damage]], and [[Haste|speed]]. Just watch out for the crash afterward.\n\n===Black Mark===\nCreatures with the [[black mark]] status apply [[draining]], [[slow]]ness, or [[antimagic]] to creatures they hit in melee. The player version from the [[demonspawn]] [[Black Mark (mutation)|mutation]] only activates on 20% of hits.\n\n===Bloodless===\n{{LightRed|Bloodless}}\n\nBloodless [[Vampire]]s have less maximum health and don't regenerate when monsters are visible. Instead they get a [[Stealth]] boost, [[vampiric]] bite, the full set of [[undead]] resistances, and an ability to turn into a bat.\n\n===Brilliant===\n{{LightBlue|Brill}}\n\nQuaffing a [[potion of brilliance]] will give you a bonus to [[spell power]] and halve the MP cost of spells.\n\n===Charging===\n{{LightBlue|Charge-|}}\n\nYou're casting [[Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling]]; press '''.''' to keep it coming. The - cycles between (-, /, |, \\) in a counterclockwise motion, though where you start with is random.\n\n===Confusing Touch===\n{{LightBlue|Touch}}\n\nCasting [[Confusing Touch]] will imbue your hands with strange energy, causing your melee attacks to [[confusion|confuse]] the enemy.\n\n===Death Channel===\n{{LightMagenta|DChan}}\n\nAny living creature you kill while under the effect of [[Death Channel]] will rise as a [[spectral thing]] to serve you.\n\n===Death's Door===\n{{White|DDoor}}\n\nCasting [[Death's Door]] will render you temporarily invulnerable, but reduces your [[HP]] to almost nothing and leaves you unable to cast again for a short period.\n\n===Disjunction===\n{{LightBlue|Disjoin}}\n\nCasting [[Disjunction]] causes all enemies around you to [[blink]] away, with a success rate that rises as they approach you.\n\n===Divine Protection===\n{{White|Prot}}\n\n[[Elyvilon]]'s Divine Protection ability will render you invulnerable to any attack that would otherwise kill you, though at a significant cost to [[piety]] each time it triggers.\n\n===Divine Shield===\n[[The Shining One]] is protecting you from attacks, boosting your [[Shield (stat)|blocking defense]] for a brief time.\n\n===Finesse===\n{{LightBlue|Finesse}}\n\n[[Okawaru]]'s Finesse ability doubles the speed of all of your physical attacks.\n\n===Flight===\n{{LightBlue|Fly}}\n\nYou're airborne! You can travel over impassable terrain, take less damage from [[Shatter]], and take more damage from [[Airstrike]].\n\n{{Blue|Fly}}\n\nYour flight is nearly over. Get to solid ground, or drink another [[potion of flight]] to keep going.\n\n{{LightRed|Fly}}\n\nYour flight should have ended, but that would've dropped you in some sort of deep liquid and killed you. The strain of staying airborne will keep [[draining]] you until you reach land, so do that pronto!\n\n{{White|Fly}}\n\nYour flight is limitless! End it whenever you want.\n\n===Haste===\n{{LightBlue|Fast}}\n\nAll actions performed by a [[haste]]d creature take 66% as long as normal to complete.\n\n===Heavenly Storm===\n{{White|Storm (X)}}\n\nUsing [[Wu Jian]]'s Heavenly Storm ability gives you a huge [[slaying]] bonus (indicated by the number represented by X) and constantly generates opaque [[cloud]]s around you. Using your martial attacks increases your slaying bonus, but doing anything else decreases the bonus until it reaches 0, at which point the storm expires.\n\n===Heroism===\n{{LightBlue|Hero}}\n\n[[Okawaru]]'s Heroism ability gives you a +5 bonus to all non-magical skills.\n\n===Invisibility===\n{{LightBlue|Invis}}\n\n[[Invisible]] characters are given bonuses in combat when fighting monsters that can't [[see invisible]]. Invisible monsters are difficult to detect and gain similar bonuses when attacking you.\n\n{{LightMagenta|Invis}}\n\nYou turned invisible using a piece of magical equipment. This equipment is reusable, though inflicts [[drain]] in the process.\n\n{{DarkGrey|Invis}}\n\nYou're technically still invisible, but monsters can still see you because you're [[glowing]] or standing in [[shallow water]] or [[cloud]]s.\n\n===Leda's Liquefaction===\n{{LightBlue|Liquid}}\n\nCasting [[Leda's Liquefaction]] will convert the ground all around you into a soupy mess. This reduces the movement rate and melee attack success rate of anything stuck in it (including you!)\n\n===Might===\n{{LightBlue|Might}}\n\nQuaffing a [[potion of might]] will give you a 1d10 bonus to melee damage.\n\n===Olgreb's Toxic Radiance===\n{{LightMagenta|Toxic}}\n\nCasting [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] [[poison]]s everything in your [[LOS]] each turn for a few turns.\n\n===Ozocubu's Armour===\nCasting [[Ozocubu's Armour]] will cover you in a sheet of protective ice, boosting [[AC]]. It breaks if you move, though.\n\n===Powered by Death===\n{{LightMagenta|Regen (X)}}\n\n[[Demonspawn]] with the Powered by Death [[demonspawn mutation]] will recover [[HP]] faster after killing monsters. The number (marked by the 'X') indicates how much faster you heal.\n\n===Quad Damage===\n{{LightBlue|Quad}}\n\nUsing a [[quad damage]] will multiply your damage output by 4. Only found in [[Dungeon Sprint]].\n\n===Recall===\n{{White|Recall}}\n\nUsing a [[Recall]] ability will cause allied units to [[teleport]] to your location over time.\n\n===Repel Missiles===\n{{LightBlue|RMsl}}\n\nCreatures that [[repel missiles]] are harder to hit with ranged attacks. Players don't see the temporary status effect anymore, but monsters can still have it.\n\n{{White|RMsl}}\n\nThis effect is permanent, usually due to wearing a [[scarf]] of repulsion or following [[Qazlal]].\n\n===Resistance===\n{{LightBlue|Resist}}\n\nQuaffing a [[potion of resistance]] will grant you resistance to [[fire]], [[cold]], [[electricity]], [[poison]], and [[acid]] for a short time.\n\n===Ring of Flames===\n{{LightBlue|RoF}}\n\nWearing the [[salamander hide armour]] will surround you with [[fire]] [[cloud]]s, boost your fire resistance, and enhance the [[spell power]] of your [[Fire Magic]], but renders you very vulnerable to [[cold]].\n\n===Searing Ray===\n{{White|Ray}} {{White|Ray+}} {{White|Ray++}}\n\nYou're casting [[Searing Ray]] and still have more turns of laser to dish out. Press '''.''' to keep it coming.\n\n====Flame Wave====\n{{White|Wave}} {{White|Wave+}} {{White|Wave++}}\n[[Flame Wave]] uses the same casting mechanic as Searing Ray.\n\n===Serpent's Lash===\n{{White|Lash (X)}}\n\nUsing [[Wu Jian]]'s Serpent's Lash ability gives you two turns of free movement (the X represents how many turns you have left). Your martial attacks are much stronger during this period, but you become [[exhausted]] after the ability ends.\n\n===Silence===\nWhile you are emitting a [[silence]] [[aura]], most creatures (including you) caught in its effect will be unable to cast spells, read [[scroll]]s, or use divine abilities. Certain abilities can't be silenced, and [[demon]]s ignore the effects of silence.\n\n===Slimify===\n{{LightGreen|Slime}}\n\n[[Jiyva]]'s Slimify ability will make your next melee attack that hits turn your target into a [[list of jellies|jelly]].\n\n===Swiftness===\n{{LightBlue|Swift}} \n\nThe [[Swiftness]] spell increases your movement speed for a while, but then makes you [[#Sluggish|sluggish]] for a while.\n\n{{Blue|Swift}}\n\nYour increased speed is nearly over and you'll start moving slowly soon.\n\n{{DarkGrey|Swift}}\n\nYou are knee deep in water and slow down to normal wading speed.\n\n===Teleport===\n{{LightBlue|Tele}}\n\nYou are going to [[teleport]] in the next few turns. Generate another teleport before this one goes off to negate it. Or wear an artefact that negates all teleporting.\n\n===Transmutations===\nThere are a number of useful alternative forms you can assume, many of which are from [[Transmutations]] spells:\n\n{{LightGreen|App}}\n\n[[Beastly Appendage]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Blade}}\n\n[[Blade Hands]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Spider}}\n\n[[Spider Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Ice}}\n\n[[Ice Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Statue}}\n\n[[Statue Form]]\n\n{{LightBlue|Storm}}\n\n[[Storm Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Dragon}}\n\n[[Dragon Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Lich}}\n\n[[Necromutation]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Bat}}\n\n[[Bat Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Tree}}\n\n[[Tree Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Shadow}}\n\n[[Shadow Form]]\n\n===Vitalisation===\n{{White|Vit}}\n\n[[Zin]] is filling you with divine health, boosting your [[stat]]s and protecting you from [[stat]] damage and many negative status effects.\n\n===Polar Vortex===\n{{White|Vortex}}\n\nCasting [[Polar Vortex]] will create a raging storm around you, granting you [[flight]] and brutalizing everything within its reach, damaging them and tossing them around.\n\n==Detrimental Status Effects==\n===Antimagic===\nAs monsters are struck by [[antimagic]] weapons, they become more likely to fail to cast their spells. Players simply lose MP.\n\n===Bad Forms===\nGetting hit by an enemy's [[Polymorph]] spell will temporarily force you into one of several less-than-ideal forms:\n\n{{LightGreen|Pig}}\n\n[[Pig Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Fungus}}\n\n[[Fungus Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Porc}}\n\n[[Porcupine Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Wisp}}\n\n[[Wisp Form]]\n\n===Blind===\n[[Blind]] monsters will treat your character as though it were [[invisible]]. This negates any [[see invisible]] it may have.\n\n===Charm===\n[[Charm]]ed monsters will ally with you and fight on your side... for a while.\n\n===Confusion===\n{{Red|Conf}}\n\n[[Confusion|Confused]] creatures can't choose which direction to move or attack in and many actions are disabled.\n\n===Constriction===\n{{Yellow|Constr}}\n\nBeing [[constricted]] means that an enemy is crushing you each turn, dealing damage, reducing [[evasion]] and preventing you from moving. Kill it or break free by attempting to move away!\n\n===Cooldowns===\nSeveral abilities can't be used right after you've used them; most of these will wear off given enough time.\n\n{{Yellow|-Berserk}}\n\nYou're too tired to go [[berserk]] right now.\n\n{{Yellow|-Blink}}\n\nYou are still too unstable to [[blink]].\n\n{{Yellow|Breath}}\n\nYou can't use any [[draconian breath attacks]] or [[Spit Poison|naga poison spit]] for a while.\n\n{{Yellow|DDoor}}\n\nYou're too tired to cast [[Death's Door]] right now. Be extra careful -- your HP is probably still extremely low!\n\n{{Yellow|Exh}}\n\nYou are too tired to use any of [[Ru]]'s abilities or [[Wu Jian]]'s Serpent's Lash right now.\n\n{{Yellow|-Hop}}\n\nYou're too tired to [[Barachi|Hop]] again at the moment; spend some time without moving to recover.\n\n{{Yellow|-Recite}}\n\nYou can't use [[Zin]]'s Recite ability now.\n\n{{Yellow|-Vortex}}\n\nYou can't start another [[Polar Vortex]] right now.\n\n===Corona===\n{{Yellow|Corona}}\n\nThe [[Corona]] spell will render its target much easier to hit, reducing [[evasion]] and negating [[invisibility]].\n\n===Corrosion===\n{{Red|Corr -X}}\n\n[[Corrosion]] is a temporary status effect which gives a stackable -4 to [[slaying]] and [[AC]] (the number represented by X indicates how much these have been reduced) for as long as it lasts. Corrosion will be repaired after enough turns have passed. Corroded monsters simply get a temporary -8 to their AC.\n\n===Dazed===\nMonsters may become [[dazed]] after you recite the word of [[Zin]] at them, causing them to waste their turns as they recover their senses.\n\n===Doom Howl===\n{{Red|Howl}}\n\nA [[doom hound]]'s [[Doom Howl|howl]] has called nightmarish creatures to hunt you. Dangerous enemies will spawn near you every few turns until the howl fades.\n\n===Drain===\n{{LightGrey|Drain}} {{Yellow|Drain}} {{LightRed|Drain}} {{Red|Drain}}\n\n[[Negative energy]] has [[draining|withered]] you, reducing your maximum [[HP]], with darker colours indicating worse effects. Gaining XP gradually restores your health. Monsters who get drained have their [[HD]] lowered instead, reducing their strength and [[willpower]].\n\n===Engulf===\n{{Red|Engulf}}\n\nYou're being engulfed by a [[water elemental]] or [[quicksilver elemental]] and can't breathe. You'll take ongoing [[asphyxiation]] damage and are functionally [[silence]]d until you pull free.\n\n{{DarkGrey|Engulf}}\n\nYou're being engulfed, but you [[unbreathing|don't need to breathe]], so it has no effect.\n\n===Fast+Slow===\n{{Magenta|Fast+Slow}}\n\nYou are both magically [[slow]]ed and [[haste]]ned, and thus act at normal speed.\n\n===Fear===\n{{Red|Fear}}\n\nCharacters suffering from [[fear]] are unable to move toward the source of their terror (they can still attack it, but may flinch away if attacking in melee) and are unable to go [[berserk]]. Monsters suffering from fear will flee from you until they hit a dead end, until you attack them, or until enough time passes.\n\n===Fire Vulnerable===\n{{Red|rF-}}\n\nYou're down one rank of [[fire resistance]]. Watch out for sources of fire damage!\n\n===Flayed===\n{{Red|Flay}}\n\nYou're suffering from the illusory wounds of a [[flayed ghost]]. You'll still die if you hit 0 HP, but you can kill the ghost or escape from its [[line of sight]] for a while to get your HP back.\n<div id=\"frozen\"></div>\n\n===Frozen===\n{{Red|Frozen}}\n\n[[Frozen]] characters are partially encased in ice, increasing their [[movement delay]] by 4 [[actions|auts]] for the duration of the effect.\n\n===Held===\n{{Yellow|Held}}\n\nSimilar to constriction, being [[held]] prevents creatures from moving but doesn't do any damage. Attempt to move or [[blink]] to break free.\n\n{{Red|Held}}\n\nCreatures stuck in a [[web]] or a [[throwing net]] can't move or attack and are vulnerable to stabbing. They may still cast spells.\n\n===Horrified===\n{{Yellow|Horr-X}} {{Red|Horr-X}}\n\nFollowers of [[Ru]] who have sacrificed their courage gain penalties to accuracy, damage, and spellpower when in the presence of dangerous foes.\n\n===Inner Flame===\nCasting [[Inner Flame]] on an enemy will cause it to explode violently upon death.\n\n===Lava===\n{{Red|Lava}}\n\nYou're flying over [[lava]]. Try not to fall in.\n\n===Leda's Liquefaction===\n{{Brown|SlowM}}\n\nCreatures stuck in the liquid ground from [[Leda's Liquefaction]] move slowly and have difficulty attacking in melee.\n\n===Magic Contamination===\n{{DarkGrey|Contam}} {{LightGrey|Contam}} {{Yellow|Contam}} {{LightRed|Contam}} {{Red|Contam}}\n\nUsing certain beneficial status effects, miscasting spells, standing in [[cloud|mutagenic fog]], or stepping in [[Zot trap]]s can induce [[magic contamination]]. While a low (dark or light grey) dose of this is harmless, higher amounts make you [[glow]] and can inflict dangerous [[miscast effect]]s and [[bad mutations]] on you. See the [[magic contamination]] page for more details.\n\n===Mark===\n{{LightMagenta|Mark}}\n\nAll conscious monsters on the floor know your location and have an easier time getting to you until the [[Sentinel's Mark|mark]] wears off. This can be very dangerous on unexplored floors or floors with powerful bosses. You can get this effect from [[alarm trap]]s and [[vault sentinel]]s.\n\n===Mesmerised===\n{{Red|Mesm}}\n\nWhen [[mesmerise]]d, you will be unable to move away from the source of your mesmerisation, until you've killed it, lost sight of it, or broken the effect some other way.\n\n===No Potions===\n{{Red|-Potion}}\n\nYou cannot drink potions for the duration. It is gained from the [[Ru]] sacrifice, being in [[Cocytus]], a [[Throw Klown Pie|pie]] from a [[Killer Klown]], or casting [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]].\n\n===No Scrolls===\n{{Red|-Scroll}}\n\nYou cannot use scrolls for several turns. This status mostly comes from a [[mutation]], after taking heavy damage or being hurt while at low HP. The smoke of [[Gehenna]] also inflicts -Scroll.\n\n===Orb===\n{{LightMagenta|Orb}}\n\nYou're in the [[Realm of Zot]], or perhaps even carrying the [[Orb of Zot]] itself. Your [[teleport]]s are delayed, and [[Passage of Golubria]] will function wildly.\n\n===Paralysis===\n{{Red|Para}}\n\nAnything suffering from [[paralysis]] will be unable to act for several turns, loses almost all ability to [[Evasion|dodge]] attacks, and is vulnerable to [[stab]]bing.\n\n===Petrifying/Petrified===\n{{LightRed|Petr}} {{Red|Stone}}\n\n[[Petrification]] is a two-stage status effect. While petrifying, the victim is [[slow]]ed. Once fully petrified, the target is rendered incapable of acting or [[Evasion|dodging]] attacks, gains large bonuses to [[AC]] and [[GDR]], stops [[fly]]ing, and becomes vulnerable to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] and [[stabbing]] for several turns.\n\n===Poison===\n{{Yellow|Pois}} {{LightRed|Pois}} {{Red|Pois}}\n\n[[Poison]] causes you to take damage as time progresses. The darker the colour, the more rapidly you'll take damage and the more you'll take overall.\n\n{{DarkGrey|Pois}}\n\nCharacters who enter [[Necromutation|Lich Form]], [[Statue Form]], or [[vampire]]s who become [[#Starving|bloodless]] while poisoned will delay the progress of the poison until the transformation ends.\n\n===Sapped Magic===\n{{Red|Sap}}\n\nYou've had your magic disrupted by a [[warmonger]]; each time you try casting a spell, there's a chance your spell failure rate will increase.\n\n{{Yellow|-Wiz}} {{LightRed|-Wiz}} {{Red|-Wiz}}\n\nYour spells have grown harder to cast.\n\n===Sickness===\n{{Yellow|Sick}} {{LightRed|Sick}} {{Red|Sick}}\n\nSickness causes you to stop regenerating [[HP]].\n\n===Silence===\n{{LightMagenta|Sil}}\n\nBeing under an enemy's [[silence]] [[aura]] renders you unable to cast spells, read [[scrolls]], or use divine abilities.\n\n===Sleep===\n[[Sleep]]ing creatures are unable to act, are almost incapable of [[Evasion|dodging]] attacks, and are vulnerable to [[stab]]bing. However, they will eventually wake up on their own, and may wake up early if they hear loud [[noise]]s or get injured. Having high [[stealth]] makes you less likely to wake up sleeping monsters.\n\n===Slow===\n{{Red|Slow}}\n\nSlow creatures take 150% as long as normal to perform actions.\n\n===Sluggish===\n{{Red|-Swift}}\n\nYour [[Swiftness]] wore off, and now you have to spend several turns moving slower than normal.\n\n===Stat Zero===\n{{Red|Collapse}} {{Red|Clumsy}} {{Red|Brainless}}\n\nAt least one of your [[stats]] has hit [[stat zero|zero]] or less. This immediately causes 2-5 turns of [[paralysis]] and inflicts you with an array of debilitating effects dependent on the stat involved. Try to get it above zero as soon as possible!\n\n===Sticky Flame===\n{{Red|Fire}}\n\nCasting [[Sticky Flame]] will cover the target in napalm, causing them to take [[fire]] damage each turn and making them [[glow]]. Standing in [[shallow water]] can put the flames out.\n\n===Still Winds===\n{{Brown|-Clouds}}\n\nA [[servant of whispers]] has cast [[Still Winds|a spell]] that prevents [[cloud]]s from forming for the duration.\n\n===Teleport Prevention===\n{{Red|-Tele}}\n\nCertain monsters can cast [[Dimension Anchor]], which will prevent you from [[blink]]ing or [[teleport]]ing for a few turns. Rare [[artefact]] weapons also give this effect. This can also occur from high level [[Translocation]] miscasts.\n\n===Umbra===\n[[Profane servitor]]s, followers of [[Dithmenos]], and the [[ring of Shadows]] emit an [[Aura#Umbra|umbra]] which increases stealth and reduces the accuracy of all attacks except from demons, undead, and followers of Dithmenos or [[Yredelemnul]].\n\n===Vulnerable===\n{{Red|Will/2}}\n\nReading a [[scroll of vulnerability]] will reduce the [[willpower]] of everything in your [[line of sight]] (including you) by half. [[Phantasmal warrior]]s can attack to make their targets vulnerable.\n\n===Water===\n{{LightBlue|Water}} {{Blue|Water}}\n\nYou're either standing in, or flying over [[shallow water]] or [[deep water]].\n\n===Weak===\n{{Red|Weak}}\n\nPhysical weakness reduces the damage of your melee attacks by 25% (or 33% for monsters).\n\n==History==\n*[[Yred]]'s pain mirror was removed in [[0.28]].\n*In [[0.27]], [[Ashenzari]]'s active scry was removed, a new cast status for [[Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling]] was added, and [[Tornado]] / -Tornado was replaced with [[Polar Vortex]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], various [[Charms]] spells would give statuses; [[Darkness]], [[Deflect Missiles]] (DMsl), [[Regeneration]], and [[Shroud of Golubria]]. The [[food]] system also had several different hunger states on the status bar.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], casting [[Delayed Fireball]] gave you the Delayed Fireball status.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], there was a Telepathy status, granted by the [[Dowsing card]], and a Stealthy status, bestowed by a high-level [[Shadow card]]. Followers of [[Jiyva]] could gain the Pray status to stop their jellies from consuming items.\n*In [[0.18]], a s(T)atus effect lookup has been added to ?/. Prior to 0.18, there were also [[Stoneskin]], [[Condensation Shield]], and [[Phase Shift]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the [[teleport control]] status existed, conferred through either a [[Control Teleport|spell]] or a [[ring of teleport control|ring]]. There were also areas which would prevent controlled teleports. In addition, there was a Sure Blade status, granted by the [[Sure Blade]] spell, and [[Bleeding]], an HP-sapping status inflicted by attacking with [[claws]].\n*[[Corrosion]] was added in [[0.15]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], there was a Rot status, which inflicted an ongoing reduction to maximum HP.\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

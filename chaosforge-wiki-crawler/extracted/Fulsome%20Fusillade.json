{"title":"Fulsome Fusillade","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fulsome_Fusillade","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Fulsome Fusillade''' is a level 8 [[Conjurations]]/[[Alchemy]] spell that gives you the {{white|Fusillade}} status, which causes beakers of random reagents to rain on nearby targets for each of the next 5 turns. Each turn, this causes 3x3 explosions of either [[fire]], [[cold]], [[electricity]], or poison-physical (70% poison, 30% physical) aimed on top of 3 random enemies. If any of those explosions overlap, the area of overlap is instead hit by a volatile alchemical reaction that deals a larger amount of non-elemental damage and has a chance to apply a random debuff.\n\nPossible debuffs:\n*[[malmutate]]\n*[[slow]]\n*[[weakness]]\n*[[confusion]]\n*[[ensnare]]\n*[[petrify]]\n\nThe spell additionally drains 2 MP each turn except the first, and if you don't have enough MP left, the status ends.\n\n==Useful Info==\nThis spell will never hit you, although it will hit and anger your allies, so care should be taken using this spell around allies. \n\n==Strategy==\n\n==History==\n*Added in [[0.32]] as the first Alchemy spell above level 6."}

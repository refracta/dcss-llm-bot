While taking other actions (including climbing stairs) the amulet conveys no benefits.}}\n\nWearing an '''amulet of the acrobat''' grants a tremendous +15 [[evasion]], but only on turns in which you make no actions other than moving or waiting:\n*Going up/down [[stairs]] doesn't count towards the +15 EV bonus.\n*Counterattacks ([[Minotaur]] headbutts, [[riposte]]) negate the bonus.\n*[[Wu Jian]]'s martial attacks negate the bonus.\n*Maintaining a [[channeling spell]] (e.g. [[Searing Ray]]) does ''not'' negate the bonus.\n\n[[Tengu]] do not benefit from this amulet, as they already have the Acrobat intrinsic.\n\n==Strategy==\nGaining +15 EV is certainly a powerful effect, but a bit disappointing, since it does not activate when attacking or using items. Still, it has a number of uses:\n*It helps you reposition during fights. Acrobat provides a defense against attacks, including [[centaur (monster)|centaur]] shots, [[attacks of opportunity]], etc., while moving. Particularly handy for followers of [[Cheibriados]].\n*It has a synergy with damage over time effects. Channeling spells work, as mentioned above, but [[poison]], [[Frozen Ramparts]], and delayed effects like [[Petrify]] also benefit.\n*It helps you escape. While you're waiting for a [[teleport]] to kick in, you'll benefit from extra defense. It can also be good for 'ninja'-ing runes.\n\nYou may prefer another amulet for more consistent benefits. But, at the very least, having acrobat is strictly better than no amulet.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*The amulet will display the EV boost in {{LightBlue|Blue}} the turn after doing a valid action; but it instantly fades if you do a different one.\n*Keep in mind that there are plenty of threats that ignore EV entirely, such as spells like [[Fireball]] or [[Airstrike]], harmful [[cloud]]s, and dangerous [[Hexes]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], in order to function, the amulet had to attune itself to the wearer at full health.\n*The amulet of the acrobat was added in [[0.22]].\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

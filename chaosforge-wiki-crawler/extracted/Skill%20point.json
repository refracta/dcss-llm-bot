The ratio of skill points to XP changes with the total XP (or, analogously, the total skill points) that your character has ever gained.  At the beginning of the game, the ratio will be roughly 1:10, but it will gradually decrease until it hits a cap of 265:10, which will almost always be reached by XL27. This effect is particularly notable when quaffing [[potion of experience|potions of experience]] - they give considerably more skill levels early on.\n\nFor a given set of skills, the total XP required remains the same, independent of order. If you decide to go for L15 Fighting and L27 Axes: \n*Training both skills to L15 first, \n*Training Axes to L27 first, \n*Or training Fighting to L15 first,\n\nhave the same raw XP cost. While the first skill might require less XP, keep in mind that there's also ''just less XP available'' earlier on - or the reason why XP scaling exists.\n\n==Skill costs==\nThe table below shows how many total '''skill points''' must be allocated to a skill for it to reach each skill level, from 0. The percentage column shows the amount of experience required to reach a given skill level from 0 as a percentage of the amount of experience required to reach level 27.<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|skills.cc|2312}}</ref> If you press '''m''' to go to the skill menu, you can look at relative costs for each of your skills. These are given in multiplies of the \"baseline cost\", which is the cost of taking a skill from level 0 to level 1 with a +0 aptitude.<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|skills.cc|185}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

An aptitude of '''n''' means you'll need 2^(-n/4) times as much XP to advance as a character with an aptitude of zero for that skill would.  The resulting multipliers are in the chart below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Aptitude\n|| +11 || +10 || +9 || +8 || +7 || +6 || +5 || +4 || +3 || +2 || +1 || +0 || -1 || -2 || -3 || -4 || -5\n|-\n!

The old learndb entry for skill points was \"Only galehar <nowiki>[a developer]</nowiki> should know or care what these are.\"  It may not have been the most illuminating, but it is correct in its message: skill points are something the player has no control over, and cannot use to their advantage.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], higher levels of skills cost more skill points.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

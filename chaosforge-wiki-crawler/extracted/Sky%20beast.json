{"title":"Sky beast","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sky_beast","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Sky beasts''' are unusual flying creatures that appear in the Dungeon, usually around D:6. They deal additional electric damage in melee, and occasionally turn invisible.\n\nSky beasts have an innate ability that allows them to turn [[invisible]], taking no time in the process.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-abil.cc|957}}</ref> Every turn, it has a 1/8 chance to switch between being invisible and visible. When becoming visible, rain [[cloud]]s are created around it. Rain clouds, in turn, create short-lived puddles of [[water]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Try not to fight a sky beast when it is invisible (unless you have [[see invisible]]). An enemy you can't see is ''much'' harder to hit. If a sky beast turns invisible and isn't adjacent to you, consider retreating - it'll flicker back into view eventually. You do not want to retreat when it is in melee range due to [[attacks of opportunity]], though.\n*[[Poison]] can be an effective option. [[Poisonous Vapours]] never misses, so it's strong regardless of visibility. Just about any character can throw [[poisoned]] [[dart]]s at a visible sky beast, then walk away once it turns invisible.\n*It's easy to guess an invisible sky beast's location. As melee enemies, sky beasts will move directly towards you and attack.\n**[[Cloud]]s can reveal invisible creatures (though won't make them easier to hit). If you lost track of a sky beast, a [[scroll of fog]] or [[Mephitic Cloud]] is likely to reveal its location.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.21]], sky beasts had mutagenic [[food|meat]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], sky beasts would [[flee]] once heavily injured. Coupled with their tendency to turn invisible, this made finishing them off very annoying.\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

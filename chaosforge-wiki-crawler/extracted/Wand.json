III. 1837.}}\n\nA '''wand''' is a magical device that contains several charges of a specific spell or effect. \n\n==Useful Info==\nWands can be zapped with the '''[[V]]''' key (that is, e'''V'''oking it) to release a magical effect, costing one charge. When out of charges, the wand is destroyed. If you pick up multiple wands of the same type, they merge: their charges combine into one inventory slot.\n\nFor players, a wand's [[spell power]] equals <code>15 + 3.5 * [[Evocations]]</code><ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|evoke.cc|177}}</ref>, though this is still limited by the spell power caps for the spell cast. \n\nMonsters may start with wands, or pick up them from the ground. For monsters zapping wands, their power is <code>30 + [[hit dice]]</code>. Monsters do not consume charges when they use wands.\n\n==List of wands==\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:1px solid #000000;\"\n! Image !! Wand !! Description !!

Monsters could use wands of digging. Also, [[wand of light|wands of light]], [[wand of quicksilver|quicksilver]], and [[wand of roots|roots]] were not considered high-level wands.\n*In [[0.29]], the [[item set]] mechanic was introduced; wands of the same \"type\" are now mutually exclusive from each other. Also, monsters in general now deal less damage with \"high tier\" wands.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the overall quantity of wand charges were much higher (charges were not halved past D:8). [[Eleionoma]]e and [[fenstrider witch]]es (native to [[the Swamp]]) did not drop wands, though.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], monsters couldn't use wands of iceblast, clouds, or scattershot.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], wands couldn't be used in many [[transformation]]s.\n*In [[0.21]], wands were 'goldified'. Prior to this version:\n**They did not merge on pickup, so you could have separate wand items of the same type.\n**Wands had an unknown number of charges on pickup. This could be discovered by identifying the wand or by zapping the wand (dependent on Evocations skill). Zapping unID'd wands would waste charges. \n**Once all their charges were used, wands would remain inert in your inventory. [[Scrolls of recharging]] would recharge about half the wand's capacity.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], wands were not automatically identified when picked up. However, zapping a wand with an unknown number of charges did not waste any charges.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], wands weighed 10.0 [[aum]] each.\n\n===Added Wands===\n*[[0.29]] - [[Wand of light]], [[wand of quicksilver]], [[wand of roots]] (added with the [[item set]]s mechanic)\n*[[0.20]] - [[Wand of clouds]], [[wand of scattershot]] (replacing [[rod]]s)\n*[[0.18]] - [[Wand of acid]], [[wand of iceblast]]\n\n===Removed Wands===\n*[[0.27]] - [[Wand of random effects]] (replaced by [[pieces from Xom's chessboard]]\n*[[0.26]] - [[Wand of clouds]] (replaced by [[condenser vane]]s)\n*[[0.25]] - [[Wand of scattershot]] (replaced by the [[tin of tremorstones]])\n*[[0.21]] - [[Wand of confusion]], [[wand of lightning]].\n*[[0.20]] - [[Wand of heal wounds]], [[wand of hasting]], [[wand of teleportation]]\n*[[0.18]] - [[Wand of cold]], [[Wand of draining|draining]], [[Wand of fire|fire]], [[Wand of fireball|fireball]], [[Wand of frost|frost]], [[Wand of invisibility|invisibility]], and [[Wand of magic darts|magic darts]]. (Wands of fire, cold and draining were considered high-tier wands.)\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{wands}}\n[[Category:Wand|*]]"}

This wand is 50% irresistible; it deals 50% cold and 50% physical damage. For example, a monster immune to cold will take half damage from this wand.\n\nPlayers deal <code>3d(7.66 + 3.5 * [[Evocations]]/5)</code> damage with this wand.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|zap-data.h|1456}}<br>Specifically, you'll deal <code>3d(14/3 + pow/5)</code> damage, for pow = <code>15 + 3.5 * Evocations</code> ({{source ref|0.31.0|evoke.cc|189}}). If you have the [[MP-Powered Wands]] mutation, then your \"pow\" gains a +33% boost.</ref>\n\nMonsters deal <code>3d(6 + (30 + [[HD]])/12)</code> damage with this wand.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|zap-data.h|1458}}</ref>\n\nThis wand is [[alternate items|mutually exclusive]] with the [[wand of roots]]. [[Artificer]]s will always begin with 5 charges of iceblast, regardless of which wand is actually generated in the Dungeon.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Wands of iceblast fill a unique slot in any [[Evocations]] specialist's arsenal, as enemies can't [[ev]]ade the attack or ignore it entirely with [[willpower]]. They can be used to finish off a deadly monster, or to kill high EV enemies like [[boggart]]s and [[list of spriggans|spriggans]]. Just be aware that they lack power without much Evocations training.\n*Firing a wand of iceblast point-blank at your foe guarantees you'll be caught in the blast. Use it ''before'' engaging in melee, or angle your shot diagonally behind your foe if possible.\n*Monsters aren't willing to blast themselves. Against an [[Ijyb]] with iceblast, being adjacent will prevent the wand from being used. (Monsters aren't smart enough to aim diagonally behind.)\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], iceblast's damage was 60% irresistible.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], monsters couldn't use this wand.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], wands of iceblast could hold at most 15 charges.\n*Wands of iceblast were added in [[0.18]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{wands}}"}

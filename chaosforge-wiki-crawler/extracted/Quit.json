{"title":"Quit","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Quit","type":"raw","data":"[[Quit]] is the command to end the current game, by pressing '''Ctrl-q''' or '''*-q'''. This has the same effect as [[death|dying]] - you will not be able to resume play with that character! To merely end the current session and resume later, you must [[s]]ave the game instead.\n\nQuitting will display the usual inventory and score screens, and the reason for game ending will be recorded as 'quit the game' in the high score table.\n\nTo prevent accidental quits, the player will be prompted to type in 'yes' to quit the game.\n\n[[Category:Commands]]"}

{"title":"Miscast effect","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Miscast_effect","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\nA [[miscast effect]] occurs when a player fails to cast a spell successfully. These can range in severity from completely harmless to inflicting heavy damage and [[magic contamination]], depending on the school of magic, the spell level, and the degree of failure. Players wishing to protect themselves from miscasts should focus on increasing the [[spell success]] rate, as this reduces both the frequency and intensity of miscasts. Additionally, miscasts from some schools of magic produce elemental damage that can be resisted.\n\nThe in game spell failure rate color indicates the maximum potential damage relative to your current max [[HP]]. These are calculated as if the damage is irresistible, even for those schools whose miscast effects are resistible or not directly damaging.\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n! Color !!

If the spell has multiple schools, one of them is chosen at random. The intensity of the effect is rolled based on the spell level and the [[Spell_Success#The_final_step|raw spell failure chance]] (an internal value from 1 to 99, ''not'' the failure rate shown on the spell list).\n\n{{crawlquote|'''Intensity''': (Spell Level)d(Spell Level + Raw Failure Rate) / 9}}\n\nFor damaging effects, this is the amount of damage done. For status effects (slow and -Move), this is the duration in turns. Other effects as listed:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" \n! School!!

The new -Move status, which you get after casting [[Momentum Strike]], no longer prevents blinking or teleporting, it only stops you from moving.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Hexes miscast effects would [[potion of cancellation|debuff]] the user before applying Slow.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], miscast effects were applied to [[Hell]]'s mystical force.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], miscast Translocations inflicted [[Dimension Anchor]] instead of -Move.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the miscast effect system was significantly more complicated, with three different types of effects per school, depending on the severity of the miscast. Many other mechanics, such as [[divine retribution]], were dependent on miscasts.\n*In [[0.16]], many magic miscast effects received a significant overhaul.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Hell's mystical force could paralyze the player.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], [[Zot trap]]s inflicted a random severity 3 miscast, instead of having a hardcoded list of effects.\n\n[[Category:Magic]] [[Category:Spells]]"}

At its creation, enchantments were woven into it, and as such it cannot accept further enchantment.}}\nA '''scarf''' is a somewhat uncommon magical piece of [[armour]] that occupies the [[cloak]] slot. Unlike cloaks, they do not provide any [[AC]] and cannot benefit from [[scrolls of enchant armour]].\n\nScarves will always spawn with an [[ego]], and can attain unique egos not found on regular cloaks.\n\n==Egos==\nScarves can appear with the following [[ego]]s: \n*[[Repulsion]] - reduces the chance of missile attacks hitting the wearer.\n*[[Resistance (ego)|Resistance]] - provides '''rF+''' and '''rC+'''.\n*[[Invisibility (ego)|Invisibility]] - can be evoked to become invisible in exchange for HP [[drain]].\n*[[Harm]] - increases damage dealt by 30% and damage received by 20%.\n*[[Shadows]] - reduces [[LOS]] by 1 tile.\n\n[[Randart]] scarves will always spawn with these egos, too.\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile providing no AC on their own, scarves can appear with unique and useful enchantments that may provide situational benefits. If your character has fairly high [[AC]] already, it may be worth the sacrifice to provide multiple resistances or a means of repelling missiles.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], scarves couldn't appear as [[randart]]s.\n*In [[0.26]], the [[shadows]] ego was added.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], scarves could have the [[Cloud immunity]] and [[Spirit shield]] egos instead of [[Invisibility (ego)|Invisibility]] and [[Harm]].\n*Prior to [[0.21]], scarves could appear as randarts. Randart scarves in 0.20 often spawned with cloak egos (instead of scarf-exclusive egos), essentially making them the same as a cloak.\n*Scarves were added in [[0.20]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Scarf1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Scarf2a.png]] [[File:Scarf2b.png]] [[File:Scarf2c.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artefact''' || [[File:Scarf3.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Cloaks]]"}

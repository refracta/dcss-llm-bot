{"title":"Hell hound","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hell_hound","type":"raw","data":"{{version024}}\n{{list of | canines}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Hell hounds''' are fast and dangerous [[demonic]] canines, flaming beasts that arrive in packs and breathe [[fire]] (3d10). Fortunately they are almost unheard of outside of [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], and the [[Hell]]s, and by the time you get there, they're nearly harmless. However, if you see them outside of those places and they're not guarding the entrance of the [[Lair]], a [[Lair#Lair:6 vaults|Lair:6 vault]], or some [[Volcano]] layout, that's almost always a sign that [[Azrael]] is near.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nFire resistance helps. As with many fire-themed monsters, hitting them with [[cold]] damage works particularly well."}

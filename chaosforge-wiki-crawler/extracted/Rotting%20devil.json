Fortunately, they are not very durable. They can be found in [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], and the [[Hell]]s (primarily [[Tartarus]]).\n\nInterestingly, other than their [[MR]] and [[holiness]], they are identical to [[necrophage]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Remember that they are NOT, in fact, [[undead]]. [[Dispel Undead]] and [[Control Undead]] have no effect on them.\n*Avoid their rotting potential by killing them at range with spells.\n\n==History==\nRotting devils were removed in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

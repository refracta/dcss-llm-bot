They have almost no structural strength, but the wicked thorns they bear make their removal difficult. Such brambles are sparse enough that almost any missile can pass through unhindered.}}\n\n'''Wall of Brambles''' is a monster-only spell which populates a large area either behind or in front of you with [[briar patch]]es. This doesn't immediately injure you, but it does cut off your ability to move toward the caster or to escape by foot. It is possible to cut through the briar patches, but doing so in melee [[spiny|inflicts significant amounts of damage]]; ranged attacks, however, are completely unimpeded by these obstacles.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\nWall of Brambles was added in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

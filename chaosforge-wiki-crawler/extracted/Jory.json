{"title":"Jory","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Jory","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Jory the Bloodstained Count''' is a [[unique]] [[vampire (monster)|vampire]] capable of mesmerizing you like a [[siren]] or staking you with [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] for massive damage. When he dies, he leaves an unusually large spray of blood instead of a [[corpse]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Depths]]:3-4\n*[[The Vaults]]:2-5\n*[[The Crypt]]\n*A particular vault in [[Tartarus]]\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Depending on his weapon, Jory can hit harder than a [[stone giant]] in melee, and getting mesmerized will make escape significantly more difficult, but neither of these are as great a concern as Lehudib's Crystal Spear. High [[EV]] and [[SH]] will greatly reduce the chance of him landing this spell, even more so if you've got [[Repel Missiles#Player sources|Repel Missiles]] active. Considering that he's fairly durable, preparing yourself to deal with the possibility of multiple LCS's is a good idea.\n*High [[willpower]] will give you a good chance of resisting his attempts to mesmerize you. [[Clarity]] will grant immunity.\n*Jory is vulnerable to [[silence]]. If you're a competent physical fighter, you can read a [[scroll of silence]] and then smash him in melee. A weapon of [[holy wrath]] will make this even easier.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.13]], he would only spawn in one extremely rare [[vault]] where his entourage of [[silent spectre]]s would render his spells useless.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], he had significantly less HP.\n*Jory was added in [[0.8]]."}

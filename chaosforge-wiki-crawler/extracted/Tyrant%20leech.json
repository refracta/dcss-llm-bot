{"title":"Tyrant leech","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tyrant_leech","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | worms}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Tyrant leeches''' are slow worms that have an unwholesome [[vampiric]] bite, healing themselves when they damage you. They are considered [[evil]], but are not [[undead]]. They are generally only found in [[the Swamp]] or guarding its entrance.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*For characters with ranged attacks, the easiest strategy is to simply [[kite]] them at range - they move on land slowly. Otherwise, they hit fairly hard and can heal themselves on a bite.\n*If you are unable to bleed, Tyrant leeches can't heal themselves. [[Djinn]], [[Gargoyle]]s, [[Mummies]], bloodless [[Vampires]], and players in [[Statue Form|Statue]]/[[Storm Form|Storm]]/[[Death Form]] don't have blood. In a pinch, [[Tree Form]] also doesn't have blood.\n*Each level of [[life protection]] gives you a 33% chance of negating the healing effect of vampiric attacks. rN+++ makes it completely ineffective.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], these monsters were known as '''giant leeches'''.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], giant leeches were much weaker."}

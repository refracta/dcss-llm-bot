Unless you worship [[Okawaru]], your ammunition supply is limited by what you find on the ground and take from enemy archers. [[Centaur (monster)|Centaurs]], [[faun]]s, [[naga sharpshooter]]s, and [[deep elf archer]]s all leave stacks of arrows after you defeat them.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n|| Arrow \n|-\n|| [[File:Arrow1.png]] \n|}\n\n==History==\n*Arrows were removed with all launcher ammo in [[0.29]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], arrows could generate with a variety of [[brand]]s.\n\n{{weapons}}"}

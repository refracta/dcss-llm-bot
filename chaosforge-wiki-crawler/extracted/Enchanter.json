The Enchanter begins with a lightly enchanted dagger, a robe, a potion of invisibility, and a selection of hexes.}}\n\n'''Enchanters''' are mages who have specialised in the subtle art of [[Hexes]]. Although not as directly damaging as [[Conjurations]] or the elements, high-level Hexes offer a wide array of very handy effects.\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Deep Elf]], [[Felid]], [[Kobold]], [[Spriggan]], [[Naga]], and [[Vampire]] are the recommended species if you pick an Enchanter Background.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+1 [[dagger]]\n*+0 [[robe]]\n*2 [[Potions of invisibility]]\n\n'''Available Spells:'''\n*[[Ensorcelled Hibernation]]\n*[[Confusing Touch]]\n*[[Tukima's Dance]]\n*[[Dazzling Flash]]\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Short Blades]]: 1\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Stealth]]: 3\n*[[Spellcasting]]: 2\n*[[Hexes]]: 3\n\nChoosing Enchanter adds 7 to your starting [[Intelligence]] and 5 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nEnchanters are one of the few magic starts not to get an XL 1 spell, but have 2 potions of invisibility to make up for it. They soon get access to debilitating hexes - [[Ensorcelled Hibernation]] and [[Confusing Touch]] - becoming effective [[stab]]bers in the process.\n\nWhile there are some devastating Hexes spells available to late-game characters, be prepared to branch out at least a little. Many enemies have high [[willpower]], which can cause serious problems over time. An [[orb]] of [[guile]] or [[scroll of vulnerability]] can help you affect enemies with high willpower, though such items will also reduce your own willpower.\n\n===Spell Info===\nEnsorcelled Hibernation is your classic sleep n' stab spell. Succeed against your opponent's willpower, and they'll be vulnerable to a single extremely deadly [[stab]] attack, preferably from your dagger. Monsters who've already been entranced can't be put to sleep for some time, nor can monsters resistant to cold. You may want to get a few levels into Ice Magic  (1-3, perhaps) to boost this spell's power.\n\nConfusing Touch is your answer to that, with the highest duration of the starting spells. It has the MP advantage too - you get multiple swings, each swing having a chance to confuse, for only 3 MP. Against enemies with low success chance (<30% or so), Confusing Touch is more MP-efficient.\n\nDazzling Flash is another debilitation spell. Because it checks [[HD]] (not willpower), pesky monsters resistant to your other hexes can be hit by the flash. To monsters not immune to blinding, dazzle is effectively a localized [[invisible]]. The blindless only lasts a few turns... but a few turns can be all the time you need to set up something else (or run away). In addition, it has a wide area-of-effect - all your other spells are single target.\n\nWhile not as flashy as an Enchanter's other spells, [[Tukima's Dance]] allows you to take advantage of otherwise tough, weapon-wielding enemies like [[ogre (monster)|ogres]] and [[orc warlord]]s. For many monsters, their weapon comprises over half their damage output. Now it's a [[summon]]ed monster on your side. Tukima's will also work on ranged weapons; a [[centaur (monster)|centaur]] can't shoot you without its bow.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], most backgrounds were buffed; Enchanters gained a second [[potion of invisibility]].\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Enchanters had the [[Corona]] spell, but did not start with a potion of invisibility.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Enchanters started with the [[Book of Maledictions]], which had the same spells as Enchanters do now.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Enchanters started with some [[dart]]s and 1 level of [[Throwing]], but only 2 levels of [[Stealth]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Enchanters started with only 1 level of Spellcasting.\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

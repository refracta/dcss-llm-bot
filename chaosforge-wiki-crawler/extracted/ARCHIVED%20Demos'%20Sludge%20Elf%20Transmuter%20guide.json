{"title":"ARCHIVED Demos' Sludge Elf Transmuter guide","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/ARCHIVED_Demos%27_Sludge_Elf_Transmuter_guide","type":"raw","data":"{{version}}\n\n{{Advice}}\n\n'''Transmuters''' are basically mad alchemists who entered the dungeon to perform magical experiments. Their starting spells are research-oriented, so early game survival is quite tricky for them. [[Sludge Elf|Sludge elves]] have the best aptitudes for being a Transmuter, so they're the best species to play as one.\n\n==Skills==\nPrimary Skills:\n*[[Fighting]]\n*[[Unarmed Combat]]\n*[[Dodging]]\n*[[Invocations]] or [[Evocations]] - depending on which god you worship\n*[[Spellcasting]]\n*[[Transmutation]]\n*[[Necromancy]]\n\nAlways keep the above skills activated.\n\n==Fighting==\nTransmuters play like magical monks, so you'll be fighting unarmed a lot. Unarmed attacks are very fast, but start off fairly weak. This means you should probably forgo heavy armor, since it'll cripple your [[attack speed]] and lower your damage. A lightly armored transmuter will hit harder and faster than a transmuter wearing plate mail.\n\nIn [[0.6]], the [[AC nerf]] makes wearing heavy armor even less desirable. [[Shield]]s are terrible for unarmed combat, as it will slow your attack speed and it eliminates your strongest auxiliary attack. In the early-game, pummel your enemies to death and use your potions when you might be in trouble. If an enemy can cause serious damage at close range, then summon some snakes to help you.\n\nOnce you find a way to go [[berserk]] at any time, ditch your arrows and start using Ice form against tough enemies. After awhile you should learn Blade Hands, as it's very powerful. If you want to go for all 15 runes, then you should learn [[Necromutation]] and maybe [[Shatter]].\n\n==Spells==\nThis is a list of good spells to use.\n\nTransmutations:\n*[[Fulsome Distillation]] - You should immediately learn this spell and start distilling corpses.\n*[[Evaporate]] - Learn this spell as soon as you reach LV2. It's the swiss army knife of toxic clouds.\n*[[Sticks to Snakes]] - This should be the third spell you learn, as it'll save you from some nasty early game enemies. Poisoned arrows work best and with enough arrows you can even kill a [[hydra]].\n*[[Spider Form]] - Learn it as soon as you can, as it's great for poison stacking and for escaping.\n*[[Ice Form]] - Makes [[the Lair]] trivial, due to its innate rPois, water walking and its slowing effect on cold-blooded creatures.\n*[[Alistair's Intoxication]] - It's a great spell if you have [[clarity]].\n*[[Blade Hands]] - Tremendously powerful. It gets a +5 boost from Chei's stat bonuses.\n*[[Ignite Poison]] - Useful in [[the Hive]] and [[the Snake Pits]]. You'll probably want to forget it after you clear those two places.\n*[[Dragon Form]] - Turns you into a gigantic, fire-breathing dragon! It's as cool as it sounds. This form is incredibly powerful and probably has the highest damage output in the game. When fully maxed-out this form deals over 80 damage per hit ([[berserk]] increases it to over 100)! The downsides? Your [[AC]] and [[EV]] take a major hit and you're vulnerable to cold attacks (rC-).\n*[[Statue Form]] - Huge HP boost, huge unarmed damage and it gives rPois, rElec and rN+. Downside? It makes you slow. Use it with Haste.\n*[[Shatter]] - Awesome spell. Does damage comparable to crystal spear to all non-flying, non-amorphous monsters near you. It also breaks walls and potions on the ground. Do not use it while in statue form.\n*[[Necromutation]] - Very powerful. It's worth learning if you are going for a 15-rune victory.\n*[[Dig]] - It's used mainly for training earth magic.\n\nOther spells:\n*[[Blink]] - Great for maintaining distance from enemies.\n*[[Summon Butterflies]] - Summons over a dozen meat shields to cover your escape.\n*[[Apportation]] - Useful for grabbing stuff from afar.\n*[[Repel Missiles]] - Protection from ranged attacks is always nice. Switch to [[Deflect Missiles]] later on.\n*[[Control Teleport]] - An invaluable spell. Keep it until you find the ring.\n*[[Silence]] - Nice for beating up frail spell casters.\n*[[Flight (spell)|Flight]] - Superior to [[Levitation]], combo with [[Swiftness]].\n*[[Haste]] - There's a reason why it's the most popular spell in the game.\n*[[Insulation]] - If you're unlucky and didn't find any rElec gear.\n*[[Dispel Undead]] - Great against ghosts, liches, etc.\n*[[Abjuration]] - Get rid of hostle summons.\n*[[Sublimation of Blood]] - Fast MP channeling.\n*[[Borgnjor's Revivification]] - Full HP heal. Use it in emergencies.\n*[[Controlled Blink]] - Best escape spell.\n\nThe following spells are either terrible or useless and should be avoided: [[Cigotuvi's Degeneration]], [[Condensation Shield]], [[Maxwell's Silver Hammer]], [[Passwall]]*, and [[Stoneskin]] (unless you're using [[Statue Form]], in which case it's great, as it's a 10 point boost to your [[AC]] for 2[[MP]])\n*Passwall can be a useful escape tool if you can get into a corridor with 1-thickness walls.\n\n==Items==\nPotions are great, but don't be a pack-rat and carry over 40 of them in your inventory! Create a [[stash]] and leave most of your potions there, since you will only need 10 of each at most. If you find a [[Ring of teleport control]], wear it and keep it on permanently. Any +5 or above [[Ring of slaying]] is also worth keeping on.\n\nA [[ring of regeneration]] is very useful if you're a lich, since you can't [[quaff]] healing potions or use healing spells. You may want to wear an [[Amulet of rage]], until you find a nice artifact amulet or can cast [[Haste]].\n\n==Stats==\nYou should increase [[intelligence]] to around 30 and focus on [[dexterity]] afterward. Increase your [[strength]] to 10 for better carrying capacity and to avoid [[stat death]].\n\n==Gods==\nThese are the best gods for a transmuter.\n*[[Sif Muna]] - Sif gives free spell books and channeling.\n*[[Okawaru]] - Oka gives armor gifts and the ability to use Heroism (major UC damage boost!) and Finesse.  However, your [[Sticks to Snakes]] spell could cause you to lose piety.\n*[[Kikubaaqudgha]] - Kiku gives you the [[Necronomicon]] much faster than Sif does, and at full piety makes the Tomb a joke.\n*[[Cheibriados]] - Chei gives huge stat boosts increasing with piety. But you have to be able to handle the slow movement speed. \n*[[Nemelex Xobeh]] - Nemelex is a great god for all characters. Decks give you a lot of flexibility.\n\n==Strategy==\n===Early Game===\nMemorize [[Fulsome Distillation]] immediately and both [[Evaporate]] and [[Sticks to Snakes]] at LV2. Look for an edged weapon to use as your butchering tool. Memorize [[Spider Form]] when it becomes available.\n\nGet to the temple and worship one of the gods listed above. Continue exploring the dungeon until you find the entrances to [[the Lair]].\n\n===Early Branches===\nCreate a stash in the Lair and memorize [[Ice Form]]. Then, find the rune branches and clear the Lair. Memorize [[Blade Hands]] when it becomes available. Clear the [[Orcish Mines]] and find the entrance to the [[Elven Halls]].\n\nClear [[the Hive]] if you need food.\n\n===Middle Dungeon===\nContinue to explore the main dungeon. You'll find the entrances to the Vaults and Hell  before too long. When you begin to feel uncomfortable with how dangerous the dungeon monsters are, it's time to backtrack and clear the branches below.\n\n===Middle Branches===\nClear [[the Swamp]] first, if it generated in your game. If not, then clear [[the Snake Pit]] first. If [[the Shoals]] generated in your game, then clear floors 1-4. Afterward, head over to the Elven Halls and clear floors 1-6, if you have high [[magic resistance]] or [[Silence]].\n\n[[The Vaults]] (floors 1-7) are next. You can take some time to explore the [[Hall of Blades]], if you can cast [[Airstrike]] or [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]]. You can then explore [[the Crypt]] if you have a few levels of life protection and [[Dispel Undead]].\n\n===Branch Ends===\nYou should now be ready to the take the bottom floor of the Elven Halls and the Vaults (and the Shoals if it's in your game). If you have [[Alistair's Intoxication]], then Elf:7 will be easy. Make sure you have rN+ ([[Shadow dragon]]s) and rElec ([[Titan]]s, [[storm dragon]]s) before trying to clear Vault:8. Shoals:5 should be doable if you can fly or swim. Very few enemies there can survive against a raging ice beast.\n\nYou should also go into the [[Vestibule of Hell]], lure [[Geryon]] out (doesn't work in 0.8), kill him in the main dungeon and evoke his silver horn in Hell. After that, you should stash away the horn and bring it out of the dungeon together with runes and the Orb during your ascension.\n\n===Rest of the Dungeon===\nAfter that, finish exploring the main dungeon. Once you've cleared the main dungeon, take 3 runes and unlock the portal to [[the Realm of Zot]].\n\n===The Realm of Zot===\nYou should be able to clear the first four levels: they are similar to the Elven Halls and feature lots of narrow corridors inhabited by [[draconian]]s instead of elves. Remember to put on an [[amulet of resist corrosion]] to deal with yellow draconians and a source of rElec for black draconians and electric golems.\n\n===End-Game Branches===\nAfter that, you may opt to do a few optional branches.\n\nThe [[Slime Pits]] are the easiest, but only enter if you have an amulet of resist mutation (or the mutation resistance mutation), an amulet of resist corrosion, and mostly corrosion-proof gear (or a disposable armor set). To easily kill [[the royal jelly]], just dig a tunnel and fight it in the tight corridor where its ability to spawn jellies is limited.\n\n[[The Tomb]] is filled with mummies. You should have [[Necromutation]] by this point. Wear an amulet of stasis and clear out the tomb slowly. You can make things a lot easier by casting [[Shatter]] on the north-east or north-west corner of Tomb:1, which may break down the walls, allowing you to bypass most of Tomb 2.\n\n[[Hell]] shouldn't be too difficult if you cleared the Tomb. Before [[0.6]], you could just magic map each floor and teleport to the nearest staircase. Now you'll have to buff your speed and run to the bottom, which is always the 7th floor.\n\n*Dis:7 - Probably 2nd easiest Hell, lots of iron demons. [[Dispater]] likes to summon aid, so you may want to lure him into a corridor to kill him.\n*Tar:7 - It's filled with undead monsters. [[Ereshkigal]] will dodge half your attacks, so you may want to summon some help to gang up on her. Watch out in lichform: Though you won't get tormented, you will get dispelled!\n*Geh:7 - The hardest Hell. Max fire resistance is recommended. [[Asmodeus]] is pretty difficult, so you may want to lure him away from the rune and grab it.\n*Coc:7 - Frosty Hell. Max cold resistance is recommended. [[Antaeus]] is surprisingly easy. He's weak against fire and can be poisoned. If you worship Nemelex, then this will be the 2nd easiest Hell.\n\nPrepare for [[Pandemonium]]. Make sure you bring a distortion weapon and all other equipment/resistances described in that article. After all this, or in case you stumble upon a portal to one while roaming Pandemonium, you can raid one or more [[Ziggurat]]s.\n\nNote that this can be extremely dangerous and the loot will be useless since you can already kill everything in the game anyway. If you haven't found a portal to a Ziggurat yet, you may be able to create one using a legendary deck of dungeons.\n\nFailing that, just wander around Pandemonium until you find one. Finishing a Ziggurat is extremely hard: the later levels may be full of multiple Pan lords who haste themselves and summon tormenting and smiting demons. If you're using [[Shatter]] you'll want to learn [[Death's Door]] and [[Controlled Blink]].\n\nOnce you have done all that, use your distortion weapon to banish yourself to [[the Abyss]]. If you want the abyssal rune and haven't found it yet in a past trip, wander around until you find it. Then search for a portal back to the dungeon.\n\n===Zot:5===\nAt this point, if you don't have or can cure teleportitis, or you plan to randomly teleport in the Orb chamber, you can clear it now. Read [[Zot:5]] for more details on the level itself and the strategies for clearing it. \n\n===Ascension===\nTake all of your runes and your most valuable artifacts (to improve your total [[score]]) to D:1. It's very easy, just teleport to the nearest staircase with teleport control. Once you reach D:1, take the Orb, the runes, the horn, and the artifacts and go upstairs.

{"title":"Blizzard demon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Blizzard_demon","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Blizzard demons''' are cold- and air-themed [[tier-2 demon]]s. Although less dangerous than [[hellion]]s or [[cacodemon]]s, they can still deal significant [[cold]] and [[electricity]] damage to characters without the proper resistances. They can be found in the [[Ice cave]], [[the Abyss]], and [[Pandemonium]] (particularly in [[Lom Lobon]]'s domain).\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Blizzard demons aren't too terrifying on their own - by the time they start appearing naturally, you'll likely have the proper resistances and high enough [[AC]] to mitigate the damage output of their spells. Even so, allowing them to hang out around in the background while you deal with other opponents is dangerous; repeated [[Airstrike]]s can rack up heavy damage over time. Try to keep them out of your line of sight if you can't deal with them immediately, particularly if you're at risk of getting [[torment]]ed as well.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], blizzard demons could be found in [[Cocytus]].\n*Blizzard demons were added in [[0.10]], replacing [[Blue Death]]s."}

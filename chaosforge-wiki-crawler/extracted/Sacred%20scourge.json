It is a favoured weapon of the Shining One's servants.}}\n\n{{crawlquote|This weapon falls into the [[Maces & Flails]] category. It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Sacred scourges''' are a blessed weapon, slightly stronger than the [[demon whip]] it was formed from. Like [[eudemon blade]]s and [[trishula]]s, it always has the [[holy wrath]] brand.\n\nYou can create a sacred scourge through [[the Shining One]]'s 6* ability, or find them on [[angel]]s and [[daeva]]s. You can turn a sacred scourge back into a demon whip by using [[Kikubaaqudgha]]'s or [[Lugonu]]'s final ability to replace its brand with [[pain (brand)|pain]] or [[distortion]], though this is rarely a good trade.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe strongest one-handed mace, at least in raw stats. The forced holy wrath brand makes it strong against evil opponents, though a [[brand]]ed demon whip (or [[eveningstar]]) is better against non-evil opponents.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

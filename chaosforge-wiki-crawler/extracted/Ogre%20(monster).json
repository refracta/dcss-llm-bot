{"title":"Ogre (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ogre_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''This article is about the monster. For the player [[species]], see [[ogre]].''<br>\n{{list of|ogres}}\n{{monster info|ogre}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nOgres are dangerous early monsters which often appear alone beginning on D:3, and in packs with [[two-headed ogre]]s and [[ogre mage]]s later on. They usually wield [[giant club]]s or [[giant spiked club]]s, but some may carry [[great mace]]s or [[dire flail]]s instead.\n\nLow level characters should be warned that ogres, combined with their weapons, deal enormous damage per hit (potentially up to 37 HP), easily able to one-shot weaker characters. However, they have no resistances, and give a fair amount of experience.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Apart from being very strong, ogres have no special abilities.\n*Ogres have poor [[AC]], [[EV]], and [[willpower]], so all sorts of ranged attacks can kill one.\n**[[Poisoned]] [[dart]]s - get a few poison stacks, then before it gets to melee range, start [[kiting]]. Getting an ogre to \"extremely poisoned\" (3 poison drops in Tiles) is likely to kill, sometimes you won't need that much poison.\n**Most [[wand]]s let you blast or disable the ogre. If you're moderately lucky, spamming a [[wand of flame]] from 7 tiles of range can get the kill.\n**[[Curare]] slows the ogre, allowing you to kite or escape it.\n*Unless you are a [[Naga]] or [[Barachi]], remember that you can just walk away from them, retreat upstairs and choose a different stair to avoid them. They cannot do anything to you if you're not next to them.\n*Ogres swing slowly. Every time it gets an [[attack of opportunity]], it'll lose 0.5 turns, so a normal speed species can escape from melee after 1-2 attacks. This won't help if you'd die from 1-2 attacks, though.\n*If you see a lot of normal ogres on D:10 to D:14, it's likely that [[Lodul]] is around.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], ogres dealt 17 base damage, but only took 1.3 turns to swing. When considering their [[giant club]]s, ogres dealt more damage/turn.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], ogres did not have innately slow attacks. Instead, all monsters attacked slower with weapons, so their giant clubs slowed them down."}

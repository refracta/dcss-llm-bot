The caster can only maintain one singularity at a time.}}\n\n'''Singularity''' is a level 9 [[Translocations]] spell which creates a friendly singularity on an empty tile. This singularity will pull in enemies and damage them in a radius of 3-5 depending on spell power, and lasts for up to 9 turns at max spell power.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe singularity is immune to all damage and immobile, making it excellent for blocking off corridors while you escape. The fact that it will severely damage anything chasing you is also handy.\n\nSince it deals high physical damage, it is excellent vs monsters that resist elements, and still reasonably strong vs enemies with high AC.\n\nThe warping effect will move monsters around in its AoE, possibly dropping them into lava or water similar to [[tornado]] when the spell ends. However, most monsters will be dead before the spell ends.\n\n==History==\n*Singularity was removed in [[0.17]].\n*This spell was added in [[0.16]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

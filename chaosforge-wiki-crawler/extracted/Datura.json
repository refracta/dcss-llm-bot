{"title":"Datura","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Datura","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|It is tipped with a substance that sends those it hits into a mindless rage, attacking friend and foe alike.}}\n\n'''Datura''' is a [[brand]] found only on [[dart]]s. Targets struck by a datura dart are sent into a [[frenzy]], turning neutral, [[haste]]d and [[might]]ed, while attacking nearby creatures regardless of whether they are allies. These darts have no effect on [[undead]] or [[nonliving]] monsters.\n\nUnlike most brands, datura's effectiveness is determined by the player's skill in [[Throwing]] and [[Stealth]], and resisted by the target's [[hit dice]]:\n*For monsters with [[HD]] < 15, there is an initial fixed 3% chance of success;\n*Otherwise, the chance is <code>100 - 100 * (HD - 2) / (4 + pow)</code>, where <code>pow = (Throwing + Stealth) * 2 / 3</code><ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|throw.cc|254}}</ref>.\n\n==Strategy==\nFrenzy is effective when applied to a monster in the middle of a pack, which will often result in some of the pack tearing each other apart for a time while leaving you an opening to thin their numbers, use other ranged attacks, or make an escape.\n\nDatura is most universally effective in the beginning of the game where few monsters have the HD to resist it; you can easily turn something like an [[orc warrior]] against its compatriots and might be able to affect an [[ogre]] or [[ice beast]]. Unless you're investing in Throwing and/or Stealth, however, datura will likely stop working on monsters once you get to about the [[Lair]].\n\nWhen used against the player, only the normal berserk effect is applied. This may or may not be a good thing. You may even target yourself in an attempt to use the darts as a source of berserk, but note that you need to surpass your own defences in order to succeed.\n\n==Trivia==\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datura Datura] refers to a genus of poisonous plants.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], [[holy]] and [[demonic]] monsters wouldn't go haste/berserk.\n*Datura was introduced in [[0.24]], replacing the old [[frenzy]] brand found on [[needle]]s.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{brands}}"}

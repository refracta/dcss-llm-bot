After recent reworking of [[Book of Conjurations]] they are more beginner-friendly while providing great diversity in branching possibilities and strong extended endgame potential. This guide assumes you are worshiping [[Vehumet]] and branching into fire magic from mid-game on. It is partly based on [[ARCHIVED Mr. K's Deep Elf Fire Elementalist guide|Mr. K's Deep Elf Fire Elementalist guide]].\n\n==Strategy==\n===Equipment===\nYou won't require anything too fancy, although nice early randarts will help. [[See invisible]] should preferably be always kept on, other slots a mixture of resistances, spell enhancers and convenience items like [[amulet of the gourmand]]. Use nothing heavier than [[robe]]s/[[animal skin]]s. Don't ignore [[scrolls of immolation]]: this free mass [[Inner Flame]] source will make short work of the sturdiest Lair packs and Vaults:5 welcoming party. Just be careful not to get fried yourself.\n\n===Early game===\n\nAlways rest to fill up MP and HP. You will want to cast [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere]] reliably as early as possible. Until then, try to avoid early threats like [[Sigmund]], [[Grinder]], player ghosts, centaurs, killer bees, strong orc warbands. Get your [[Strength]] to 7-8, then put everything in [[Intelligence]]. At first, turn off all skill training except Conjurations, then add Charms after learning the Battlesphere. When you reach 15% failure rate you should start always having the sphere up, and may wish to add the following lines to your init file:\n\n runrest_stop_message += Your battlesphere wavers and loses cohesion.\n runrest_stop_message += You feel your bond with your battlesphere wane.\n\nNow begin training Spellcasting, Dodging, Fighting to 6-7, focusing Conjurations. Learn the first [[Fire Magic|fire school]] spell you find and start focusing Fire Magic. When you find a [[buckler]] put a level in Shields. Evocations are optional, you can get a few levels if you find [[ring of flight]], [[staff of energy]] or some good [[rod]]s. Turn off Charms around 11.\n\nOther spells in the Book of Conjurations:\n*[[Magic Dart]]: The best friend of the Battlesphere due to its minimal cost and maximum range. This obscenely deadly combo will annihilate pretty much everything from afar throughout early branches.\n*[[Searing Ray]]: Essential early on, try to line enemies up for maximum efficiency.\n*[[Dazzling Spray]]: Interesting multi-target option if you're willing to fiddle with targeting.\n*[[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]]: Can be useful until Vehumet begins gifting you powerful spells or you find convenient early spellbooks, later outclassed both in single-target and AOE damage.\n*[[Fulminant Prism]]: Situational, may help against early [[statue]]s or [[Oklob plant]]s.\nYou will find Vehumet's altar in the [[temple]] or early Dungeon floors and begin worshiping. He doesn't require Invocations training, will restore your MP on kills, increase spell range, success rate and offer knowledge of 15 damage-dealing spells across all levels. Before his ultimate gift be mindful of your available [[Spell memorisation|spell levels]], it can be very frustrating to miss the opportunity to learn something good if you're unlucky with [[scrolls of amnesia]].\n\n===Mid game===\n\nIf you haven't found a book containing fire school spells yet learn the first one Vehumet offers and begin focusing Fire Magic. Other goodies to look out for:\n*[[Mephitic Cloud]]: Will make early branches even more of a breeze.\n*[[Throw Icicle]]: Even with no Ice Magic training it will eventually attain maximum power, where it boasts respectful 3d20 combination of cold and physical damage. Useful for taking out fire-resistant, cold-vulnerable or just random weaker pests.\n*[[Fireball]]: Mid-game AOE immolation.\n*[[Force Lance]]: Good for keeping nasty things away from you.\n*[[Bolt of Fire]]: Default remover of middle-level threats. Line 'em up.\n*[[Iron Shot]]: Poor man's Lehudib's Crystal Spear.\n*[[Delayed Fireball]]: No such thing as excessive fireballs.\n*[[Orb of Destruction]]: Hard to use effectively, but can also double as [[Disintegration]] source.\nSince you've been training Fire Magic the final gift will almost certainly contain [[Fire Storm]], the crown jewel of Conjurations, and, if you're lucky, the [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]], which again is possible to boost to high power without Earth Magic training. If you can find it, [[Ring of Flames]] awesomely complements Fire Storm.\n\nYou will also want to augment your spell set with some utility magic from the usual suspects list: [[Apportation]], [[Summon Butterflies]]/[[Summon Small Mammal|Small Mammal]] (also lets you start training Summonings), [[Blink]], [[Cure Poison]], [[Swiftness]], [[Shroud of Golubria]], [[Repel Missiles|Repel]]/[[Deflect Missiles]], [[Sublimation of Blood]], [[Regeneration]] (these two work great in conjunction), [[Abjuration]], [[Flight (spell)|Flight]], [[Control Teleport]], [[Haste]], etc. If you find [[Necronomicon]] or plan to switch to [[Kikubaaqudgha]] for the Tomb you may consider investing in Necromancy/Transmutations, although it's not essential.\n\n===Late game===\n\nWhen you become able to cast Fire Storm reliably the Battlesphere has earned its retirement. Instead, from now on, you should always, wherever possible, command instant access to [[teleport control|(semi)-controlled blinks]]. Eventually you will max out Conjurations, Fire Magic and Spellcasting, and can resume Fighting training.\n\nProgression generally follows the [[Walkthrough]]. With appropriate resistances, healthy caution and a bit of luck you will be able to take on everything the game has to offer, including entire [[Ziggurat]]s, the hardest challenges being the [[Tomb]] and [[Cerebov]]. For clearing the Tomb you may wish to either switch to Kiku (incurring Vehumet's wrath) or learn high level [[Summonings]] (which will still leave you having to soak plenty of punishment in congested areas).\n\n[[Category:Character guides]]"}

{"title":"Martyr's Knell","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Martyr%27s_Knell","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{stub}}\n{{spell info}}\n'''Martyr's Knell''' is a level 4 [[Summonings]]/[[Necromancy]] spell which summons a martyed shade, who will protect your allies.\n\n==Useful Info==\nSummons a single [[martyred shade]]. Matyred shades do not attack, but have [[Injury Bond]]: half of all damage done to its allies (except the player) will redirect to itself. If the martyred shade dies, it turns into a [[flayed ghost]], who will immediately cast [[Flay]] on transformation.\n\nSpell power increases the summon's [[hit dice]], which increases its HP. The shade's HD is equal to <code>6 + pow/11</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|spl-summoning.cc|1531}}</ref>\n\nDuration of the summon is around 18 turns. It is not affected by spell power. If the shade dies, the resulting flayed ghost has its duration renewed to ~18 turns.\n\nThere is a summon limit of 1 martyred shade; casting the spell again will cause the old summon to very quickly time out. Flayed ghosts don't count towards this limit.\n\n==Strategy==\n*?\n\n==History==\n*Martyr's Knell was introduced in [[0.31]], replacing [[Summon Guardian Golem]].\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

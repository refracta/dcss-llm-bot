{"title":"Ring of attention","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ring_of_attention","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{item\n |itemtype = Jewellery\n |name = Ring of attention\n |cost = ?\n}}\n\n{{flavour|A ring that makes the player less stealthy.}}\n\nThe '''ring of attention''' was a [[ring]] which has no effect except to penalize your [[stealth]] by -50, making it harder to go unnoticed by monsters in your [[line of sight]]. They are always generated [[curse]]d.\n\n==Desirability==\nExtremely minor. A ring of attention will make enemies more likely to remember you, assuming you aren't already at zero stealth. If wearing no other rings, and don't mind being unstealthily, the ring of attention provides marginal benefit.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], rings of attention were removed.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], rings of attention were known as rings of loudness.\n*Rings of loudness were added in [[0.15]].\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

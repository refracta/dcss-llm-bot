{"title":"Ratskin cloak","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ratskin_cloak","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|A cloak stitched from the hides of hundreds of hell rats by an enchantress with far too much time on her hands. Many more rats remain somehow concealed within it, and may scurry out to assist the wearer.}}\n\n[[File:New ratskin cloak.png]] '''''the +2 ratskin cloak'''''\n\n+2 [[cloak]]\n\nMay summon rats when the wearer is hurt<br>\n-1 STR<br>\n-1 INT<br>\n+1 DEX<br>\nrPois<br>\nrN+\n\n==Mechanics==\nEach time you take damage, you may summon a rat, randomly chosen between a [[river rat]] and [[hell rat]]. The odds of summoning are equal to the proportion of your maximum health that was lost, capped at 50%. If you worship a [[good god]], only river rats are spawned.\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''ratskin cloak'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|1047}}</ref> is a decent cloak, but not an amazing one. A +2 cloak of rPois and rN+ is better than most non-artefact cloaks; the minor stat boosts/penalties can largely be ignored. The rats help: hell rats can be surprisingly deadly in the early game, and even river rats can help you escape.\n\nThis artefact is more likely to spawn in the early game, where it is more likely to be useful.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the ratskin cloak was considered an [[evil]] item and could summon rats your god disapproved of.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the summoning effect was an evokable ability, and the cloak was not considered an evil artefact.\n*The ability to summon rats was added in [[0.20]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], this cloak had a +1 enchantment.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Cloaks]]"}

{"title":"Shadow wraith","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shadow_wraith","type":"raw","data":"{{version|024}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Shadow wraiths''' are incorporeal [[undead]] foes which inflict the [[slow]] [[status effect]] with their melee attacks, much like [[wraith]]s. Unlike wraiths, however, they are innately [[invisible]] and deal more damage with their attacks. Even so, they are only moderately dangerous on their own, only posing a real threat when they slow you while facing more substantial enemies or suddenly block your passage. They can be found in the lower portions of [[the Dungeon]], [[the Crypt]], and the [[Hell]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nShadow wraiths are a very good reason to have [[see invisible]] active while exploring areas they generate in. Wasting turns in combat with an invisible foe when you intended to run away from something else can be extremely hazardous.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.16]], one rank of [[negative energy resistance]] was enough to protect you from their slowing effect.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], shadow wraiths would drain your experience with their melee attacks. This change accompanied the 0.13 overhaul to draining effects."}

{"title":"Merfolk siren","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Merfolk_siren","type":"raw","data":"{{version027}}\n{{list of | merfolk}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Sirens''' are amphibious creatures with the head and upper body of a female humanoid, and the tail of a fish that can turn into a pair of legs on land. Their singing will [[mesmerise]] you, preventing you from moving away. Sirens are commonly found in [[the Shoals]] or guarding the entrance to it.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*High [[willpower]] will let you ignore a siren's song. The effect can also be broken early by killing or confusing the siren, using a [[scroll of silence]], or using a [[scroll of fog]] to reduce your [[LOS]] so the siren can't see you anymore.\n*[[Blink]]s and [[teleport]]s can also break mesmerisation if you manage to leave LOS.\n*Fortunately, sirens still try to close into melee with you. Unless you're in extreme danger, all you really have to do is wait for them to get close enough for you to hit them (though they often have [[polearms]], allowing them to poke at you from a distance).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.16]], they were called [[mermaid]]s. The monsters previously known as sirens were renamed to [[merfolk avatar]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], [[merfolk]] players were immune to the effects of siren song.\n\n[[Category:Merfolk]]"}

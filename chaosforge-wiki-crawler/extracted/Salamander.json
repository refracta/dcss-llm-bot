{"title":"Salamander","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Salamander","type":"raw","data":"{{version|030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Salamanders''' are aggressive fiery relatives of the [[list of nagas|naga]], capable of comfortably travelling through [[lava]], usually carrying [[flaming]] melee weapons or [[bow]]s. Unsurprisingly, they are fully immune to [[fire]] damage, but are vulnerable to [[cold]]. You can find them in the [[Snake Pit]] and [[the Depths]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Fire resistance cuts away most of their damage-dealing capabilities.\n*In spite of the name, the [[salamander hide armour]] cannot be crafted from a salamander's corpse.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.14]], salamanders could not leave the pools of lava they spawned in."}

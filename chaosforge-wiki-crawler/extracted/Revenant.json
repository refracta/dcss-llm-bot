{"title":"Revenant","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Revenant","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Revenants''' are skeletal [[undead]] beings which wield ghostly fire, creating [[cloud]]s which occasionally spawn short-lived [[spectral thing]]s and launching potent [[Ghostly Fireball]]s. Both of these attacks deal pure [[negative energy]] damage, and do no harm to the undead. On top of all that, Revenants can mangle undead players with [[Dispel Undead Range]] and attempt to escape when near death by [[blink]]ing to safety. Revenants can be found in [[the Crypt]] and Crypt-themed [[Ziggurat]] floors.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Negative energy]] resistance will soften the impact of their spells and minimize the amount of [[draining]] you'll sustain from their summons. If you have it available, pile it on.\n*Undead characters can be torn apart with frightening speed if you give a revenant a clear line of effect. Kill them fast, or summon allies to hide behind.\n*It's worth noting that the spectral things will push their way past revenants, allowing them to tank hits on the revenant's behalf while the latter can continue to hurl fireballs from behind. Consequently, it is often best to fight them outside of corridors, so as to avoid getting pinned down by a tide of ghosts with no hope of reaching their creator.\n*[[Bolt spells]] or [[smite]]-targeted spells will make it much easier to take down a revenant in spite of its allies (though [[cold]], [[negative energy]], and [[poison]] spells won't make a dent against them). Even better, their skeletal nature means you can hit them with [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] no matter how many summoned allies they have blocking you.\n\n==History==\nRevenants were added in [[0.13]]."}

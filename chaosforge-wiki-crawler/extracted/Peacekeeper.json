{"title":"Peacekeeper","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Peacekeeper","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Peacekeepers''' are fast, resilient [[list of constructs|constructs]] capable of hurling barbs like a [[manticore]], pinning the player in place. They may also boost the damage output of their [[saltling]] allies. They can be found in [[Vaults]] and the [[Desolation of Salt]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Like everything in the Desolation, peacekeepers are much, much more dangerous when coupled with allies. Their barbs are annoying enough on their own, but become deadly when they hold you in place for a pack of might-enhanced saltlings to beat on. If you spot one, try to lure away its construct allies before engaging it.\n*Unlike saltlings, peacekeepers ''will'' make noise when they spot you. Keep that in mind if you're trying to stealthily attract the attention of a few enemies at a time.\n\n==History==\n*Peacekeepers were added into the Vaults in [[0.27]].\n*Peacekeepers were added in [[0.19]]."}

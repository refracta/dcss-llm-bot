{"title":"Walking tome","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Walking_tome","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{flavour|A spellbook that has gone too long without being read. It overflows with magic, forming thick armour from its binding, legs from its pages, and periodically erupting in flurries of free-floating, self-casting spells.}}\n\n'''Walking tomes''' are self-animated arcane constructs most notable for being able to [[Conjure Living Spells]]. Much like [[Foxfire]]s, living spells will seek out nearby targets and attempt to ram into them, destroying themselves to inflict a magical effect. Fortunately, living spells are fragile and can be instantly dispersed with any sort of attack.\n\nWalking tomes may be found in the [[Depths]] and [[Tukima's Studio]].\n\n==Walking tome types==\n{{monsterlink|Walking crystal tome}} - Among the deadlier tomes, these books cast the highly-damaging [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Walking divine tome}} - Their living [[Smiting]] spells don't deal much damage individually, but bypass nearly all forms of defense and come in greater numbers.\n\n{{monsterlink|Walking earthen tome}} - Living [[Petrify]] spells might not do any damage, but will leave their victims helpless to avoid these tomes' surprisingly hefty physical strikes.\n\n{{monsterlink|Walking frostbound tome}} - These tomes create mayhem with flurries of living [[Iceblast]] spells.\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

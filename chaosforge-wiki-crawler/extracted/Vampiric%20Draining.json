This spell can only be cast effectively on [[natural]] or [[:Category:Plant_holiness|plant]] monsters; casting it on constructs or monsters with [[life protection]] will do nothing. In addition, temporary [[summon]]s are immune.\n\n[[Necromancer]]s begin with this spell in their libraries, and [[Kikubaaqudgha]] can gift it at 1* piety.\n==Strategy==\n*[[Ghoul]]s and bloodless [[Vampire]]s can use this spell in order to heal (when they are unable to).\n*Bear in mind that the spell can only be cast in melee range; strong monsters can often injure you for more than you are healed. Don't let this dissuade you for using this spell offensively, however.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the spell couldn't drain HP from [[plants]]. Also, it had a spellpower cap of 200.\n*In [[0.27]], the damage formula was changed from <code>2d5 + 1d(power/7)</code> to <code>2d(6 + power/14)</code>.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the spell's damage was limited by the healing the player could receive. So the spell was useless when the player was at full health. Also, the player couldn't heal more than half the difference between their max HP and their current HP.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], it was possible to drain temporary monsters created via [[Sticks to Snakes]] or the [[Ratskin cloak]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], attempting to drain an undead or demonic creature would injure the caster for <code>2d39/2 + 9</code> HP. It was possible to die by casting Vampiric Draining on a tile with an invisible demon on it.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], there was a bug which prevented you from healing to full health."}

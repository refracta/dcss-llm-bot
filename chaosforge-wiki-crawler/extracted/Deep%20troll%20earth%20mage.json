{"title":"Deep troll earth mage","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Deep_troll_earth_mage","type":"raw","data":"{{version021}}\n{{list of|trolls}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Deep troll earth mages''' are a type of [[deep troll]] that has somehow gotten a passing understanding of [[Earth Magic]]. They are every bit as dangerous in melee as their uneducated brethren, and can blast you with shrapnel at range or [[dig]] out tunnels to pursue you if you try to run and hide. They can be found in [[the Depths]] and [[the Vaults]], always in the company of several other deep trolls and often a [[deep troll shaman]] or two.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The damage of their LRD is greatly reduced by your [[AC]], so well-armoured characters have less to fear from them. That being said, an exploding rock [[wall]] is a lot less threatening than an exploding metal or green crystal wall. While it may be tempting to stand out in the open to avoid these attacks entirely, that leaves you ripe for surrounding by the other members of its deep troll band. Your best bet may be to get into melee range with one quickly, as they will not blast you if there's a chance they'll accidentally injure their allies.\n*Fleeing from deep troll packs that have an earth mage is a frustrating experience. Any rock walls you're attempting to hide behind can be dug away in an instant. Only rely on stone walls or harder.\n\n==History==\nDeep troll earth mages were added in [[0.12]].\n\n[[Category:Troll]]"}

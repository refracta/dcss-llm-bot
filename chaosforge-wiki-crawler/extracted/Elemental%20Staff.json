{"title":"Elemental Staff","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Elemental_Staff","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|A powerful staff which used to belong to the leader of the Guild of Five Elements. It is imbued with protective and offensive enhancements from all the elemental schools of magic.}}\n\n[[File:New elemental staff.png]] '''''the +3 Elemental Staff'''''<br>\n\n+3 [[staff]]<br>\n+3 [[AC]]<br>\n[[Fire resistance|rF+]]<br>\n[[Cold resistance|rC+]]<br>\n[[Electricity resistance|rElec]]<br>\nActs as an [[enhancer staff]] for [[Fire Magic|Fire]], [[Ice Magic|Ice]], [[Air Magic|Air]], and [[Earth Magic]]<br>\nInflicts <code>10 + 1d14</code> [[fire]], [[cold]], [[electricity]], or physical (crushing) damage each time it triggers.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-func.h|903}}</ref> Chance to trigger = <code>1 - (1 - [[Evocations]]/27)^2</code>.\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''Elemental Staff'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|617}}</ref> offers a good array of defensive bonuses, giving the wielder significantly more freedom when it comes to armour and jewellery slots. It also acts as 4 different [[enhancer staves]], so casters relying on any of the four elements will find significant use out of this staff. Spells that are of multiple elements (like [[Plasma Beam]]) get multiple power boosts.\n\nThis staff is also decent as a melee weapon. With 10 Evocations, you'll have a 60% chance to proc a 10-24 damage attack, as opposed to [[electrocution]]'s 25% chance for 7-20. With a modest skill investment in [[Staves]] (12 for min speed), it's a suitable weapon for a good chunk of the game, though not having control over the element you evoke is unfortunate.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the Elemental Staff provided rF++, rC++, and AC+5.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the Elemental Staff also provided +80 [[willpower]].\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the Elemental Staff did not act as a [[spell enhancer]] for all elemental schools.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the Elemental Staff was a +3, +1 [[quarterstaff]] making it a marginally better source of physical damage. However, it lacked any elemental brand effects, offered no rElec, made [[noise]] while wielded, and significantly increased your [[hunger]]. It also provided only +60 MR.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Staves]]\n[[Category:Magical staves]]"}

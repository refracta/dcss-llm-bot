For the obsolete spell, see [[Cigotuvi's Embrace (spell)]].''\n{{flavour|A suit of armour borne of rotten flesh and bone and gristle, held intact by the will of a long-dead sorcerer. The dreadful energies within it call to the bodies of the recently dead, protecting the wearer with a cocoon of carrion. This protection only lasts a short time, however - the ward against decay holds true within, but not without.}}\n[[File:Cigotuvi's embrace urand.png]] '''''the +4 Cigotuvi's embrace'''''\n\n+4 [[leather armour]]\n\n[[Miasma]] immunity<br>\n[[Drain]]s wearer when removed<br>\n[[Negative energy resistance|rN+]]<br>\nAbsorbs [[corpse]]s to temporarily increase AC<br>\n[[Evil]]\n\n===Mechanics===\nAny [[corpse]]s or [[skeleton]] items in your [[line of sight]] are destroyed to increase the [[enchant]]ment of Cigotuvi's embrace. This is subject to diminishing returns - it takes more corpses to increase the enchantment further. The enchantment will gradually decrease over time. The higher the bonus, the faster it decays.\n\nThe enchantment goes to +10 with one corpse harvested, which takes about 90 turns to fully slough off. Four corpses give you +18 and take ~180 turns to fully go away, sixteen corpses give +34 and take ~320 turns to fully rot away, etc.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-func.h|1511}}</ref> Regardless of [[size]] or [[HD]], each and every corpse gives the same amount of AC.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-func.h|1464}}</ref>\n\nIf corpses are destroyed, Cigotuvi's embrace won't work. [[Yredelemnul]] and Necromancy spells ([[Animate Dead]], [[Simulacrum]], etc.) take priority, turning the corpse into undead first. [[Gozag]] converts corpses into gold, preventing them from being used. Note that [[Death Channel]] does not destroy corpses, and can be used with this armour.\n\nFollowers of [[Beogh]] will not desecrate orc corpses with this armour.\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Cigotuvi's embrace'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|1582}}</ref> is a lightweight option that can provide extremely high amounts of AC, assuming you can create corpses. Can be very useful in a prolonged group fight. The reliance on corpses is not perfect, however:\n\n*It does nothing if you haven't killed anything yet. It won't help much if you are [[shaft]]ed, for instance.\n*Resting will reset the AC bonus. An [[amulet of regeneration]] is useful; the less time you rest, the more likely you are to benefit from the AC.\n*[[Demon]]s, most types of [[undead]] monsters, and [[nonliving]] monsters do not drop corpses. Cigotuvi's embrace is of limited use where these monsters are common (like [[Zot]]:5, [[Pandemonium]], [[Hell]], or [[Tomb]]).\n*Certain specific methods of killing ([[wand of mindburst]], [[Inner Flame]], [[Orb of Destruction]]) destroy corpses, which prevents this armour from working.\n\nThis armour is best suited for [[EV]]-based fighters (melee and ranged). Casters will often need to regenerate MP, so they'll benefit less from the extra AC. Heavy brutes will likely prefer the consistent AC of a heavier set of armour.\n\nCigotuvi's embrace still allows for [[death drop]]s, so you won't miss out on [[dragon scales]] whenever you kill a dragon.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Cigotuvi's embrace will no longer absorb skeletons.}}\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Cigotuvi's embrace would apply before you could use Necromancy spells like [[Animate Dead]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Cigotuvi's embrace had [[rot]] immunity instead of miasma immunity.\n*The unrand version of Cigotuvi's embrace was added in [[0.25]] as a reference to the old [[Cigotuvi's Embrace (spell)|spell]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

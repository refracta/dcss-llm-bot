This spell has a 50% chance to knock the caster back one tile (in the direction opposite of the attack). This knockback doesn't damage you if you collide into a wall, monster, etc.\n\n==Strategy==\nBombard is a useful damage spell; monsters can resist Fire and Ice, but no monster has a dedicated resistance against physical damage. Even [[Air Magic]] specialists have been known to pick this spell up to deal with elementally resistant monsters. [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] deals more damage, but is a higher spell level (harder to train) and does not cause knockback.\n\nThe knockback is a mixed blessing. If you happen to want to move backwards, Bombard can let you move and attack in the same turn. Also, since it pushes you away from the target, it helps. However, if you are not careful, the knockback can have unintended consequences. For example, you can push yourself off a [[staircase]], or send yourself out of a chokepoint. Thankfully, you are warned if you'd be moved onto a [[trap]].\n\nThis spell combos well with [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]], another Earth Magic spell. The zombie hands are great on their own, but also hold enemies in place to be hit by Bombard.\n\n==Monster Version==\nMost monsters cast [[Iron Shot]], which does not knock the caster back. A few monsters cast Bombard, though:\n\nThe following monsters cast Bombard:\n*{{monsterlink|Frederick}}\n<!-- {{monsters with spell}} ; replace when monsters are updated-->\n==History==\n*Bombard was introduced in [[0.31]], replacing [[Iron Shot]] for players. Bombard deals slightly less damage and has the chance to knockback, but is otherwise identical."}

A.D.<br>\ntrans. Richard Mott Gummere, 1917.}}\n\n{{crawlquote|This weapon falls into the '[[Long Blades]]' category. It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Eudemon blades''' are a blessed weapon, slightly stronger than the [[demon blade]] it was formed from. Like the [[sacred scourge]] and [[trishula]], it always has the [[holy wrath]] brand.\n\nYou can create a eudemon blade through [[the Shining One]]'s 6* ability, or find them on [[angel]]s and [[daeva]]s. You can turn a eudemon blade back into a demon blade by using [[Kikubaaqudgha]]'s or [[Lugonu]]'s final ability to replace its brand with [[pain (brand)|pain]] or [[distortion]], though this is rarely a good trade.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

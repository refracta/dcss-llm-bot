{"title":"Death curse","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Death_curse","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n\n'''Death curses''' fall on any creature who kills a [[guardian mummy]], [[mummy priest]], [[royal mummy]], or [[Khufu]]. This does not apply to killing mummies that have been summoned in any way; only \"naturally\" occurring mummies have death curses.\n\nThe severity of the curse depends on the [[HD]] of the mummy. Followers of [[Kikubaaqudgha]] with enough [[piety]] are resistant to these curses - half of all curses are negated, and the severity of the remainder are halved.\n\nNo death curse is applied if a mummy is banished to the [[Abyss]], slimified by [[Jiyva]], kills itself while [[confused]], falls down a [[shaft]], or is killed by [[confusion|confused]] or a [[frenzy|frenzied]] enemy. However, allowing an allied creature to kill a mummy still results in you suffering the death curse.\n\nDeath curses can also be caused by Kikubaaqudgha's wrath (in which case the severity is the player's XL) and the [[Scythe of Curses]] (in which case the severity is the melee damage of that strike).\n\n==Curse Selection==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" cellpadding=\"10\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |\n! colspan=5 | Curse Effects\n! rowspan=2 | Severity\n|-\n!

Otherwise, 5 to <code>5 + 2 Ã— [severity]</code> points of irresistible damage.\n\n{{Flavour|\"Pain shoots through your body!\"<br>\"[The killer] convulses with pain!\"<br>\"You feel weird for a moment.\"<br>\"[The killer] has an odd expression for a moment.\"}}\n\n==Slowing==\nThe killer is [[slow]]ed for [severity] turns.\n\n{{Flavour|\"You feel horribly lethargic.\"<br>\"[The killer] looks incredibly listless.\"}}\n\n==Draining==\nThe killer suffers [[draining]] proportional to the [severity]. [[Negative energy resistance]] will reduce this by 50% at rN+, 75% at rN++, and 100% at rN+++.\n\nIf the killer is the player, there is a [severity] in 27 chance of suffering 1 to <code>1 + [severity]/3</code> points of temporary stat loss instead.\n\n{{Flavour|\"You are engulfed in negative energy!\"<br>\"[The killer] is engulfed in negative energy!\"}}\n\n==Torment==\nThe killer's current HP is halved. Any form of [[torment]] resistance can apply to this.  Unlike most sources of torment, this is not a full-LOS effect.\n\n{{Flavour|\"Your body is wracked with pain!\"<br>\"You feel a surge of unholy energy.\"<br>\"[The killer] convulses!\"<br>\"Something just walked over your grave. No, really!\"<br>\"[The killer] seems frightened for a moment.\"}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], death curses were based on necromancy miscast effects, and could cause rotting and summon hostile demons and shadows.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], normal mummies and Menkaure had a death curse that could [[curse]] your equipment.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], allowing an allied or enslaved creature to kill a mummy would force them to suffer the death curse.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], item curses could affect [[potion]]s, turning them into [[potion of degeneration|potions of degeneration]].\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]\n[[Category:Featured_Article]]\n[[Category:Threats]]"}

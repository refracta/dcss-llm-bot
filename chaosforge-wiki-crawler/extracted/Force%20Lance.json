{"title":"Force Lance","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Force_Lance","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For the [[unrand]] polearm, see [[Force Lance (unrand)]].''\n{{Flavour|Fires a shaft of concussive force. If the impact deals damage, it may knock the target back.}}\n\n'''Force Lance''' is a monster-only spell which deals damage and knocks the target back. The chance to knock back depends on the caster's [[HD]] and target [[size]]. If the target is a monster, it is briefly stunned (4-9 [[aut]]s). The maximum distance is <code>2 + 6 * [[HD]]/25</code> tiles.\n\nIf it would knock a creature into impassable terrain ([[wall]]s, [[deep water]], [[lava]], through a monster), movement is stopped and the target takes impact damage instead. It cannot move stationary monsters like [[statue]]s or [[oklob plant]]s.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==Strategy==\nForce Lance can push you off [[stairs]], so be careful when [[stair dancing]]. In other cases, the knock back is usually a minor nuisance, though it can mess with your positioning. It can be particularly bad for melee characters, who have to spend turns moving towards the enemy.\n\n==History==\n{{Spell\n|name=Force Lance\n|level=4\n|school1={{Translocations}}\n|school2={{Conjurations}}\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of the Warp]]</div>\n|castingnoise=5\n|spellnoise=5\n}}\n{{AttackSpell\n|name=Force Lance\n|formula = 2d(6+Power/6)\n|maxdmg = 2d(22.66) ~ 23.66\n|maxsp = 100\n|range = 4\n|target = Beam\n|tohit = 10+Power/7\n|special = Knockback\n|hit_type = normal\n|hit_adder = 10\n|hit_num = 1\n|hit_denom = 7\n|dam_calculator = dicedef\n|dam_numdice = 2\n|dam_adder = 12\n|dam_num = 2\n|dam_denom = 6}}\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Force Lance was a level 4 [[Translocations]]/[[Conjurations]] spell available to players.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Force Lance was a level 4 pure [[Conjurations]] spell, was less accurate, and did not knock enemies back as effectively.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Force Lance was a level 5 spell.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Force Lance was a level 2 spell in the [[book of Conjurations]] with less range and damage.\n*Force Lance was added in [[0.12]]."}

{"title":"Mummy (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mummy_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version024}}\n''This page is about the various mummy [[monster]]s. For the player race, see [[mummy]]. For other monstrous mummies, see [[list of mummies]].''\n{{monster info|mummy}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Mummies''' are the preserved corpses of the dead, raised by [[Necromancy]] for various reasons. They have a decent attack which low-level characters should watch out for, but they move slowly and have meager durability. They can be found in the [[Ossuary]], [[the Tomb]], and certain undead-themed vaults.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Mummies are vulnerable to [[fire]] and [[holy wrath]] weapons.\n*Mummies are slow enough that you can walk them upstairs and outrun them, leaving them on a cleared level.\n\n===Variant Mummy===\nOccasionally, you will find an [[Ossuary]] with a '''bog mummy'''. This monster is capable of casting [[Throw Frost]] (3d15) and [[Slow]], but otherwise is similar to regular mummies.\n\n{{flavour|An undead figure preserved by the brackish waters of a bog. It has begun to decay heavily, and looks fragile.}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.17]], basic mummies had a [[death curse]] that could randomly curse one item in the player's inventory when killed.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], allowing allied or enslaved creatures to kill mummies would spare you from the death curse.\n\n[[Category:Mummy]]"}

{"title":"Thorn hunter","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Thorn_hunter","type":"raw","data":"{{version|025}}\n{{list of | plants}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Thorn hunters''' are swift-moving plants able to fire volleys of sharp thorns at their targets and raise [[briar patch]] barricades to keep you out of melee or cut off your retreat. Dangerous enough on their own, they often prove deadly when coupled with other threats. They can be found in [[the Swamp]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Fire]] damage is particularly effective against them. Ranged weapons firing flame ammunition are perfectly suited for negating any advantage their briars provide.\n*The briar patches will disintegrate on their own shortly after the thorn hunter dies. Don't bother tearing them down unless you have to.\n\n==History==\nThorn hunters were added in [[0.14]]."}

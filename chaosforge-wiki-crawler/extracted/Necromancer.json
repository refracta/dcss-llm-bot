For the monster, see [[Necromancer (monster)]].'' \n{{flavour|The Necromancer is a magician who specialises in the less pleasant side of magic. Necromantic spells are a varied bunch, but many involve some degree of risk or harm to the caster.}}\n'''Necromancers''' are magicians who specialise in the less pleasant side of magic - that involving death and the [[undead]]. \n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Hill Orc]], [[Djinni]], [[Demonspawn]], [[Deep Elf]], [[Vampire]], and [[Mummy]] are the recommended species if you pick a Necromancer Background.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[robe]]\n*[[Potion of magic]]\n\n'''Available Spells:'''\n*[[Necrotise]]\n*[[Vampiric Draining]]\n*[[Animate Dead]]\n*[[Curse of Agony]]\n\nNecromancers start with [[Necrotise]] memorised.\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Stealth]]: 2\n*[[Spellcasting]]: 2\n*[[Necromancy]]: 4\n\nChoosing Necromancer adds 7 to your starting [[Intelligence]] and 5 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nNecromancers have the fairly useful ability to create allies with [[Necrotise]], and later [[Animate Dead]]. They have a few conventionally offensive spells, but they aren't the main focus.\n\n===Spell Details===\n[[Necrotise]] is a passable offensive spell; one that checks for [[willpower]] rather than [[evasion]]. The skeletons it creates are rather ineffectual, but can assist in disengaging from battles by swapping with them. [[Vampiric Draining]] is most known for its ability to steal [[HP]]. The damage is respectable on its own, at least when you first get the spell.\n\n[[Animate Dead]] is the Necromancer’s first real snowballing spell, letting them gather up a swarm of allies to assist them in the next encounter they may face. While the damage of most early game zombified monsters is unimpressive, having an [[out of depth]] [[wyvern]] or [[hydra]] at your side can even the odds quite a bit. Recasting Animate Dead will crumble all existing zombies.\n\nWhile the aformentioned spells work well enough for dealing damage, there always persists some need to \"get the ball rolling\" to actually start rising the undead, even as Necromancy's offensive spells dwindle. Therefore, Necromancers are encouraged to develop other means of killing. Most often, this will be a simple weapon skill, but low-level ally-sparing damage spells like [[Frozen Ramparts]] or [[Scorch]] are also excellent.\n\n[[Curse of Agony]] greatly softens targets by [[torment|halving their HP]], though it requires a willpower check to succeed, as well as a melee attack to apply. It's one of the few level 5 spells left in a starting kit, so it’s a heavy commitment for potentially not a huge reward. Necromancers who found the tools to hone in on their craft (such as [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]] or [[Anguish]]) don't need to rely on [[Curse of Agony]], but those who find themselves engaging in melee combat often may appreciate a way to soften very high HP monsters.\n\n===Tips and Tricks===\n*[[Pain brand]]ed weapons rely on necromancy to deal damage; Necromancers will find them quite attractive.\n*Necromancers are somewhat restricted in religious choice, as all three [[good gods|good-aligned gods]] (and [[Trog]]) punish the use of Necromancy. Luckily, none of the three major \"magic\" gods ([[Sif Muna]], [[Vehumet]], and [[Kikubaaqudgha]]) are among them.\n**Kiku is an extremely obvious choice for Necromancers. Kiku relies on Necromancy skill, with Ne having a head start in said school. In turn, the god provides on-demand fodder to use necromantic magic on (countering one of the biggest weaknesses of Necromancy), along with a variety of higher level spells. However, both the god and background provide a few redundant spells. Kiku isn't necessary for Necromancers, and picking Necromancer isn't necessary for Kiku, but they have great synergy.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Necromancers will start with a [[dagger]] and replace [[Necrotise]] with [[Soul Splinter]]. They will also start with [[Grave Claw]].}}\n*In [[0.29]], most backgrounds were buffed; all Mage backgrounds gained a [[potion of magic]]. [[Pain]] and [[Animate Skeleton]] were removed and merged into [[Necrotise]], and [[Animate Dead]] was reworked to no longer demand corpses and to generate infinite duration allies.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Necromancers started with the [[Book of Necromancy]]; Necromancers received no change to their spell lists.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Necromancers started with [[Regeneration]]. In addition, the removal of [[food]] made [[Animate Dead]] less punishing to cast. However, both necromancy spells now create much shorter lived zombies.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], [[Agony]] was able to target enemies from afar.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], the [[Book of Necromancy]] had [[Control Undead]]. 0.21 also introduced [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]], which was nerfed and removed from the Necromancer start in the following update. The removal of both spells gave Necromancers no way to deal with incorporeal undead using starting spells alone.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Necromancers started with only 1 level of Spellcasting.\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

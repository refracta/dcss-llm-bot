{"title":"Curse toe","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Curse_toe","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nOne of ''Crawl'''s sillier monsters, '''curse toes''' are hovering severed toes with extremely dangerous abilities. They can [[torment]] you, and summon [[wandering mushroom|mushroom]] or [[deathcap]]s around you to block your escape. They also have good defenses, and create clouds of [[miasma]] when travelling. Thankfully, curse toes move slowly. They can be encountered in [[the Realm of Zot]], certain unpleasant [[Crypt]] and [[Tartarus]] [[vault]]s, and Tartarus-themed [[Ziggurat]] floors.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*A weapon of [[holy wrath]] or [[Dispel Undead]] makes fighting them a little easier. You can limit the impact of their torments and their summons' drain life with [[Negative_energy#Negative_Energy_Resistance|rN]] or [[Statue Form]], and negate them entirely by being undead or in [[lichform]].\n**A [[potion of lignification]] will make you immune to torment. Just beware of anything else that could be lurking near.\n**Curse toes are unaffected by [[silence]].\n*Most elemental damage is all but useless against their resistances. [[Ice Magic]] is only partially resisted, however, so area-of-effect [[cold]] damage spells such as [[Freezing Cloud]] and [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]] will at least be somewhat effective.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.13]], curse toes could only summon wandering mushrooms with their Summon Mushroom spell, but knew [[Summon Undead]] as well."}

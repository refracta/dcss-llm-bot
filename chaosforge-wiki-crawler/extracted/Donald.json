{"title":"Donald","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Donald","type":"raw","data":"{{version027}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Donald the Adventurer''' is a [[unique]] adventurer whose dialogue varies based on your current religion and the [[branch]] you find him in. He is stronger than an [[orc knight]], capable of swimming through [[deep water]], and generates with a [[kite shield]] (often of [[reflection]], making him unusually dangerous to ranged weapon users and casters who rely on blockable spells). He also has [[Might]] and [[Haste]]; once his buff spells are active, he's near-impossible to outrun and capable of dealing huge amounts of damage very quickly.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Swamp]]\n*[[The Snake Pits]]\n*[[The Shoals]]\n*The [[Spider's Nest]]\n*[[The Slime Pits]]\n*The [[Orcish Mines]]:2\n*The [[Elven Halls]]\n*The [[Vaults]]:1-4\n*[[The Crypt]]:1-2\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If his shield has reflection, it makes ranged combat significantly more dangerous and restricts your spell set (nothing ruins your day more than a reflected [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]]). Bear in mind that [[bolt spells]] are unblockable, as are area-of-effect spells like [[Freezing Cloud]], [[Fireball]], [[Fulminant Prism]], etc.\n*One of the simplest ways of getting past Donald's shield is to [[confusion|confuse]] him, which drops his SH score to 0. He has as much magic resistance as a [[death yak]], making [[Hexes]] difficult to apply without using a [[scroll of vulnerability]], but his middling [[hit dice]] and lack of poison resistance mean he's still susceptible to [[Mephitic Cloud]].\n*Trapping him in a [[throwing net]] also negates his blocking ability, but nets are blockable projectiles and might get bounced back into your face. If he appears in the [[Spider's Nest]], [[web]]s work just as well if you can lure him into one.\n\n==Trivia==\n*When confused, Donald may make quacking noises, which is probably a reference to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Duck Donald Duck].\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.19]], Donald and [[Wiglaf]] were combined. As a result, Donald gained Wiglaf's [[Haste]] and [[Might#Monster Version|Might]] spells. Additionally, Donald was cut from [[Labyrinth]]s.\n*Donald received a significant upgrade in [[0.6]].\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

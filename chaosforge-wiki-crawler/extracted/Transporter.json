{"title":"Transporter","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Transporter","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|A one-way portal to another place on this level. When using a transporter, adjacent allies and monsters will travel with you to the other side.}}\n{{flavour|The destination site of a transporter. As the portal is one-way, you cannot use this location to return through the transporter.}}\n\nA '''transporter''' teleports you and adjacent creatures to its corresponding '''landing site''' -- much like an [[escape hatch]], except you remain on the same floor. Typically, these transporters lead to special [[vault]]s filled with additional challenges and treasure such as [[player ghost|ghost vaults]]. They are also used in navigating the [[Gauntlet]] and the [[Roulette of Golubria]].\n\nUse the '''<''' or '''>''' key to enter a transporter. Autotravel ('''G''') will only use transporters you have already entered.\n\n==Strategy==\nTransporter vaults are often quite terrifying for the stage where you encounter them. In short, if a vault looks like it might kill you, it probably will - so discretion (and coming back later) is the better part of valor here. Nevertheless, there are a few ways how you can soften up the transporter vaults:\n\n* If there are enemies inside that leave damaging clouds, [[Fire elemental]]s for example, you can walk around the glass walls to drag these monsters around. With a bit of luck, another monster ends up in their fiery wake... wait a few turns till the cloud dissipates, repeat as necessary.\n* Your allies will follow you in and out of a transporter vault, as long as they stand right next to you when you step through the transporter. This includes allies which don't follow you across floors: [[skeleton]]s, [[zombie]]s, etc.\n\nContrary to most other 'challenge' vaults, many (if not all) transporter vaults can be [[teleport]]ed into (via [[scroll of teleportation|scroll]], [[teleport trap|trap]], or otherwise).\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.21]], Transporters were updated to display corresponding [[transporter landing site]]s.\n*Transporters were introduced in [[0.20]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

Additionally, attacks that take 50% of your health at once or that leave you with less than 20% of your health will always summon a demonic guardian.\n\nAfter receiving a guardian you will not receive another one for another (1+mutlevel) to (20+mutlevel) turns. The guardians always spawn friendly and won't be angered even if you attack them. Also, you can shoot [[ranged weapon]]s and cast spells through your guardians without harming them. Even explosions like [[Fire Storm]] won't hurt demonic allies. \n\nThe strength of the demonic guardian is based on both the mutation level and your experience level:\n\n   Tier = mutlevel + ((XL - 9) / 9) \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n|Tier||Demons\n|-\n|1||{{monsterlink|quasit}}, {{monsterlink|white imp}}, {{monsterlink|ufetubus}}, {{monsterlink|iron imp}}, or {{monsterlink|shadow imp}}\n|-\n|2||{{monsterlink|orange demon}}, {{monsterlink|ice devil}}, {{monsterlink|rust devil}}, or {{monsterlink|hellwing}}\n|-\n|3||{{monsterlink|soul eater}}, {{monsterlink|smoke demon}}, {{monsterlink|sixfirhy}}, or {{monsterlink|sun demon}}\n|-\n|4||{{monsterlink|balrug}}, {{monsterlink|reaper}}, {{monsterlink|lorocyproca}}, {{monsterlink|cacodemon}}, or {{monsterlink|hell beast}}\n|-\n|5||{{monsterlink|Executioner}}, {{monsterlink|Hell sentinel}}, or {{monsterlink|Brimstone fiend}}\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], [[Okawaru]] did not suppress this mutation, as it did not forbid all allies.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], guardians were summoned based on current [[tension]] rather than after being damaged. Also, the player couldn't shoot projectiles and cast spells through them.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], this mutation was suppressed while worshiping Okawaru, as allowing an ally to die caused you to lose piety.\n\n</noinclude>\n\n[[Category:Mutations]]\n[[Category:Good Mutations]]\n[[Category:Demonspawn Mutations]]"}

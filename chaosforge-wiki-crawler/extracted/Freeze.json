{"title":"Freeze","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Freeze","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}{{spell info}}\n{{AttackSpell\n|name=Freeze\n|formula = 1d(3+(3*Power)/10) [[cold]]\n|maxdmg = 1d10\n|maxsp =25\n|range = 1\n|target = Beam\n|tohit = Never misses\n|special = Ignores [[AC]]}}\n\n'''Freeze''' is a level 1 [[Ice Magic]] spell which deals unavoidable cold damage (1d11 at max [[spell power]]) to an adjacent target, and may [[slow]] [[Cold_blooded|cold-blooded]] enemies. It also ignores [[AC]], but enemies with [[cold resistance]] will take significantly less damage.\n\n[[Ice Elementalist]]s begin with this spell memorized.\n\n==Strategy==\nFreeze has comparatively high damage, and ignores both AC and EV, which makes it useful for longer than most level 1 spells. It is an excellent spell for taking out [[out-of-depth]] cold-blooded monsters, such as [[adder]]s and [[bullfrog]]s. Its also useful against highly evasive enemies (such as [[killer bee]]s) or early monsters that can turn [[invisible]] (such as [[orc wizard]]s or [[sky beast]]s). But like all level 1 spells, its damage eventually becomes too low to consider for primary use.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*While Freeze can slow tougher enemies like a [[hydra]], a well-planned [[Frozen Ramparts]] can do so from a greater distance, and monsters are only slowed 50% of the time. Don't rely on this.\n*Players may gain a [[Passive Freeze|passive version]] of this spell as a [[mutation]], which counters all melee attacks with this spell for free.\n\n==Monster Version==\nThe monster version of Freeze works similar to the player version. However, it does not share the player version's low power cap -- [[player ghost]]s that know Freeze will be able to inflict heavy, defense-ignoring cold damage at close range.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Freeze dealt <code>1d(3+Power/3)</code> damage.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Freeze delayed enemies without cold resistance for 0-6 auts."}

Their [[Irradiate]] spell, similar to the player, inflicts heavy [[magical contamination]] and damage to any foe that enters melee range.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While radroaches are fairly bulky, softening it up with any sort of ranged attack is always preferable. They are weak to [[silver]], and [[curare]] can let you [[kite]] them for a bit.\n*Radroaches are generally unwilling to Irradiate its own allies. It'll blast through trivial enemies like regular [[worm]]s, but even a single [[redback]] adjacent ''to the radroach'' will heavily discourage the spell from being used.\n*A [[potion of cancellation]] will remove contamination.\n\n==History==\n*Radroaches were added in [[0.28]]"}

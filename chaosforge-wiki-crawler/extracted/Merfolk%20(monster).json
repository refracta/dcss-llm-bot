{"title":"Merfolk (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Merfolk_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For the player race, see [[Merfolk]]. For a list of merfolk monsters, see [[List of merfolk]]''\n{{monster info|merfolk}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Merfolk''' are the nimble, aquatic humanoids who defend [[the Shoals]] from interlopers. They can carry [[boomerang]]s, [[throwing net]]s, and often come with [[trident]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Regular merfolk are among the easiest opponents in the Shoals. However, a squad of merfolk can still hurt a lot, and any monster with a throwing net is inherently dangerous.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], merfolk were more likely to spawn with nets.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], monsters had hidden weapon penalties (they attacked slower).\n*Prior to [[0.13]], you could find '''merfolk berserkers''' in a particular [[vault]]. These extra-beefy merfolk could call upon [[Trog]] for various powers ([[Berserker Rage]], [[Trog's Hand]], [[Brothers in Arms]]), and carried a powerful polearm as well as several [[potions of berserk rage]].\n\n[[Category:Merfolk]]"}

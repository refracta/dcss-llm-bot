{"title":"Blood","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Blood","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''For the obsolete item, see [[potion of blood]].''\n\n'''Blood''' is a liquid present within most [[natural]] creatures. \n\n==What has blood==\nMost player [[species]] have blood. The player species who don't are: [[undead]] species ([[Ghoul]], [[Mummy]], bloodless [[Vampire]]), [[Gargoyle]], and [[Djinni]]. Players may turn into a plant, nonliving, or undead [[transformation]] ([[Tree Form]], [[Statue Form]], [[Storm Form]], [[Death Form]]...), which removes blood while it lasts.\n\n[[Draconian]]s and players in [[Serpent Form]] are cold-blooded.\n\nMost monsters that are [[natural]], and that are not [[list of insects|insects]], [[list of arachnids|arachnids]], [[list of jellies|jellies]], or [[list of eyeballs|eyeballs]], have blood. Some non-natural monsters, such as [[list of vampires|vampires]], will also have blood. If a monster has either the \"warm-blooded\" or \"cold-blooded\" tag, it has blood.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhile blood seems cosmetic, creating blood splatters all over the Dungeon floor, it is used for a few mechanics within the game:\n\n*The spell [[Sublimation of Blood]] can only be cast if you are in a form with blood.\n*Vampiric attack flavours (e.g. attacks from [[vampire (monster)|vampires]]; ''not'' including the [[vampiric]] weapon brand) only work on a target with blood.\n*[[Skyshark]]s check for blood with their [[Attack flavour#Bloodzerk|Bloodzerk]] attack flavour. If a Bloodzerk deals damage to a target with blood, the skyshark will gain [[might]] for a short period. If the skyshark damages a valid target with bloodzerk again, it will go [[berserk]].\n*The player [[demonspawn mutation]], [[Ignite Blood]] will create flame [[cloud]]s whenever blood would splatter.\n\n===Blood temperature===\nCreatures with blood can either be '''cold-blooded''' or '''warm-blooded''':\n\n*Cold-blooded creatures have a 50% chance of being [[slow]]ed when they are damaged by any of the following cold sources: [[Freezing]]-[[brand]]ed melee and ranged attacks, [[Freeze]], [[Frozen Ramparts]], [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]], and [[Freezing Cloud|freezing vapour]].\n:In addition, cold-blooded monsters are slowed twice as long by [[Metabolic Englaciation]].\n\n*Warm-blooded creatures have no specific vulnerabilities (other than having blood in the first place).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.24]], [[Vampire]]s would drink [[potions of blood]] in place of regular [[food]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], creatures with blood were vulnerable to the bleeding status.\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]] [[Category:Blood temperature]]"}

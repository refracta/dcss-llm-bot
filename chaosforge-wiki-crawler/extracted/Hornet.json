{"title":"Hornet","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hornet","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Hornets''' are a dangerous flying insect. In addition to [[poison]], their stings will [[slow]] (always) and [[paralyse]] (1/6 chance) you for 1-3 turns. Poison resistance only has a 66% chance to prevent the slow and paralysis; you need poison immunity to be safe.\n\nThey are often found in [[the Dungeon]], and can spawn via [[vault]] placement in [[Spider's Nest]]. They can also be created when a [[shambling mangrove]] or [[spriggan rider]] is damaged sufficiently.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Paralysis is always an ''extremely'' dangerous effect. If you are paralysed for 3 turns, hornets can attack you up to 5 times in a row, which can easily kill you (5 * 18 = 80, not including poison itself). If you aren't immune to poison, you should take extreme caution with hornets. This isn't even mentioning the slow, which is a dangerous effect on its own.\n*Hornets are poison vulnerable, so most poison effects work well. [[Curare]] darts deal significant damage and slow the hornet to average speed. [[Poisonous Vapours]] or [[Mephitic Cloud]] are reliable ways to kill/disable a hornet, respectively. A [[scroll of poison]] will prevent a hornet from charging at you, allowing you to hit it with ranged attacks.\n*[[Wand]]s and other [[evocable]]s are also effective. Their [[willpower]] isn't great, so [[wand of paralysis|paraysis]] and [[wand of polymorph|polymorph]] can help deal with them. They aren't especially durable, so [[iceblast]] and other attack wands might kill it.\n*A [[potion of lignification]] will give you poison resistance and high AC. It'll make death to a lone hornet extremely unlikely. Just watch out for other monsters in the vicinity.\n*Never fight them in an area that allows you to be surrounded. Paralysis is bad enough when you only have to worry about one hornet.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.19]], hornets replaced [[wasp]]s and became more common. Also, they were slightly nerfed.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], this monster was known as ''red wasp''.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], their paralysis effect could stack. They were near-certain death to anyone stung without the proper defenses."}

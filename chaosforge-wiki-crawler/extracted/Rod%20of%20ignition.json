{"title":"Rod of ignition","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Rod_of_ignition","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{item\n |itemtype = Rod\n |name = rod of ignition\n |cost = \n |weight = 13\n}}\n{{flavour|This rod allows its wielder to launch a fiery bolt of explosive energy.}}\n\nEvoking a '''rod of ignition''' casts the [[Explosive Bolt]] spell, firing an incendiary bolt through any enemies along its path. Anything struck by this effect explodes as though struck by a [[Fireball]] spell, dealing heavy unavoidable [[fire]] damage to itself and everything adjacent to it. Cast into a crowd, you can catch each enemy in multiple explosions, dealing tremendous damage to a much wider area of enemies than a standard [[Bolt spell]] could. Each use costs the rod 6 MP.\n\nBear in mind that, unlike Fireball, this spell does not have perfect accuracy; the bolt must first strike a target before the unavoidable burst occurs. Also, be careful when using this in melee range, as you will get caught in the ensuing blast, and realize that generating multiple explosions in a single spell will generate immense amounts of [[noise]].\n\n==History==\nThe rod of ignition was removed along with all other [[rods]] in [[0.20]].\n\nRods of ignition were added in [[0.14]], replacing the [[rod of fiery destruction]]."}

Although harmless to [[good]]-aligned characters, their unique spell set grows more powerful based on how heavily [[mutation|mutated]] or [[evil]] you are. Curiously enough, their purifying spells are so strong that they can strip the [[mutation]]s from their targets, though this usually targets beneficial mutations. They can be found in [[holy]]-themed [[Ziggurat]] floors and [[Zin]]-themed [[vault]]s in [[Pandemonium]].\n\n<!--spl-bot-begin-->\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Holy Light]] (3d40)\n|slot2=[[Holy Light]] (3d40)\n|slot3=''none''\n|slot4=''none''\n|slot5=[[Silver Blast]] (3d43)\n|slot6=[[Silver Blast]] (3d43)\n}}\n{{clear}}\n<!--spl-bot-end-->\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Followers of good gods can fully resist almost all of their damage output (unless they're heavily mutated, in which case the Silver Blasts will do some damage). If you happen to have a few malmutations, a hostile silver star may be able to \"cure\" you of them if you let it blast you for a while.\n*Followers of evil gods should treat them as slower, deadlier versions of the dreaded [[orb of fire]], and should combat them in much the same way (i.e. kill them and do it ''fast'').\n*They're particularly resistant to [[electricity]] and [[poison]], less so to [[fire]] and [[cold]].\n\n==History==\nSilver stars were removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

Although immune to [[Hexes]] and resistant to most elemental attacks, they have little physical defense and burn easily. They are rarely encountered in [[the Dungeon]], usually in specific [[vault]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Even without fire damage, their elemental resistances aren't perfect. Elementalists may require a few extra castings to take them down, but they aren't too threatening even then.\n\n==History==\nWood golems were removed in [[0.12]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

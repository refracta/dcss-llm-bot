It has a chance of failure, based on your [[Evocations]] skill.\n\nRegardless of whether you fail or succeed, your max HP is temporarily [[drain]]ed (~8% max HP). Successfully evoking invisibility will cause minor [[magical contamination]].\n\n==Sources==\nThe invisibility ego can be found on:\n*[[Scarves]]\n*The [[unrand]] [[ring of Shadows]]\n*Randomly generated [[artefact]]s\n\n==Desirability==\nBeing invisible is a strong effect. Against enemies that can't see invisible, it greatly reduces chance of being hit, and allows you to [[stab]]. A scarf of invisibility gives all those benefits without needing to use a rare [[potion of invisibility|potion]].\n\nHowever, the drain prevents you from spamming the ability. Plus, the [[Evocations]] skill required to reliably go invisible is high. As the drain happens even if you fail, you generally don't want to try until you have enough skill. By then, most 'tough' enemies will be able to see invisible. This ego can still be useful (many weaker enemies don't have SInv), but you may want a more consistent ego instead.\n\nEven in the late game, there are many enemies that can't see invisible. Notable examples include [[caustic shrike]]s, [[death cob]]s, [[list of draconians|draconians]], [[tormentor]]s, and [[hellion]]s.\n\nSuccess rate rises with [[Evocations]] skill:\n{{#invoke:Failure rate table|table|Evocations|60|2}}\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|fail rate's dependency on Evocations will be reduced by 1/3. Also, the drain cost will be reduced by 1/3.}}\n*Prior to [[0.28]], turning invisible caused more [[magic contamination]] initially and applied some contamination over time.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], evoking invisibility caused [[comestible|hunger]] instead of [[drain]]ing you.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], invisibility generated on [[cloak]]s instead of scarves.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], removing an invisibility-ego item while invisible did not cost the player extra magical contamination.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], this ego would let the player turn visible again once invisible, as a way to reduce contamination.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], this ego could be found on [[ring]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], this was called the Darkness ego.\n\n[[Category:Cloaks]]\n[[Category:Egos]]"}

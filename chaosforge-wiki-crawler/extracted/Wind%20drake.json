{"title":"Wind drake","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wind_drake","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For a list of all lesser dragons, see [[list of dragons#Lesser Dragons|list of dragons]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Wind drakes''' are one of the weaker [[list of dragons#Lesser Dragons|lesser dragons]], but they are still capable of irritating and injuring adventurers. Their [[Air Magic]] can pummel you with [[smite-targeted]] wind damage or push you around the battlefield, and they have a naturally-occurring [[Repel Missiles]] effect at all times. They can be encountered in the [[Shoals]], some of [[The Lair]] endings, and can be summoned by enemies with the [[Summon Drakes]] spell.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*You should treat Airstrike like a stronger [[Smiting]]. It checks [[AC]], but deals ''much'' more damage in an open area. Not great when Shoals is filled with open areas.\n**Specifically: for every empty tile adjacent to you, Airstrike deals more damage. Surrounding yourself with [[summon]]s, or standing adjacent to a wall, will decrease the amount of empty spaces available.\n*Wind drakes make [[stairs]] much less reliable, since Wind Blast can knock you back, interrupting the stair. If a wind drake is in view, don't attempt to [[stair dance]], and don't expect stairs to be a reliable way of escape.\n*Repel Missiles will greatly reduce the accuracy of ranged attacks, so it can be difficult for [[Ranged Weapons]] or certain spells to hit.\n**For any character, using a [[wand of flame]] over water can be a decent option. It creates [[steam]], which can kill the drake after a couple puffs of flame. For [[Fire Magic]] specialists, a [[Fireball]] or so is much more effective.\n**Attacks that never miss, such as your own [[Airstrike]], obviously ignore RMsl.\n**Wind drakes have low [[willpower]] for this stage of the game, so status [[wand]]s can all work well.\n**[[Yara's Violent Unravelling]] or a [[wand of quicksilver]] (if it hits) will dispel the status, forcing monsters to activate it again.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the open space bonus for Airstrike was much weaker.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Airstrike dealt extra damage to [[flying]] targets.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], wind drakes had a permanent [[Deflect Missiles]] effect instead of [[Repel Missiles]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], they had [[:Category:Wind_resistance|wind resistance]] and were immune to [[Airstrike]] and [[Tornado]].\n*Wind drakes were added in [[0.14]]."}

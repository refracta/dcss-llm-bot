{"title":"Fire dragon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fire_dragon","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n{{list of | dragons}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Fire dragons''' are powerful, flying monsters with potent [[fire]] breath, near-immunity to fire, and vulnerability to [[cold]]. They are by no means the deadliest of the dragons in the game, but they can make short work of careless mid-level characters. They may be found in certain vaults in the [[Lair]], but are more common in [[the Vaults]], [[the Depths]], and [[the Realm of Zot]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Killing a fire dragon may drop intact [[fire dragon scales]], one of the most useful armours for spellcasting characters.\n*If you have any sources of fire resistance, wear them now, as a fire dragon's breath can prove devastating, especially to characters with fire vulnerability. [[Mummies]] without a source of fire resistance should probably stay very far away from any fire dragons they find.\n*[[Transmuter]]s may wish to choose their form carefully around fire dragons: they resist poison, negating much of the damage that [[Spider Form]] can provide (though the form's high evasion might help you dodge the fire breath), and while [[Ice Form]] can deal heavy damage, users without a [[ring of fire resistance]] are left very vulnerable to the fire breath.\n\n==History==\n*Before [[0.19]], they dropped [[fire dragon hide]]s that could be [[Scroll of enchant armour|enchanted]] into [[fire dragon armour]]. \n*In [[0.14]], they were renamed from dragons to fire dragons to avoid confusion."}

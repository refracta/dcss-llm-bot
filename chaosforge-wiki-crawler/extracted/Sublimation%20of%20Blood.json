{"title":"Sublimation of Blood","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sublimation_of_Blood","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Sublimation of Blood''' is a level 2 [[Necromancy]] spell which converts your own [[HP]] into [[MP]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen cast, it returns <code>1 + X</code> MP, where X is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial negative binomial] random variable with parameters <code>r = 1</code> and <code>p = 1 - 6 / power</code>. The average amount of recovered MP per casting is <code>power / 6</code>. Each MP recovered costs you 1 to 4 HP with average <code>1 + 18 / power</code> HP.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|spl-other.cc|27}}</ref>\n\nThe damage caused by this spell can never kill you, and never reduces more than 90% of your current HP at a time.\n\nSublimation of Blood can't be learned or cast by the [[undead]], the [[nonliving]] ([[Gargoyle]], [[Djinni]], [[Statue Form]]), or when standing in [[Death's Door]]. Bloodless [[Vampire]]s are unable to use this spell until turning alive again.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Sublimation of Blood has good synergy with [[Makhleb]]'s healing from kills. Be sure to use other sources of increasing your [[regeneration rate]] to regain the lost health quicker.\n*If you're in the heat of battle and intend to use this spell as an emergency MP source, don't let your MP reach 0; you need at least 2 MP to perform the first, hopefully successful, Sublimation spell.\n*If you have a source of increased HP [[regeneration]], a moderate power Sublimination of Blood will allow you to rest for less [[turn]]s. This can be very tedious.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Sublimation of Blood could be used to turn [[Chunk#Chunks_of_flesh|chunks]] and [[potion of blood|potions of blood]] into [[MP]]. Also, [[Fedhas]] deprecated its use.\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

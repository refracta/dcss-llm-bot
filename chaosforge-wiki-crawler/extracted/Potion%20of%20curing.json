{"title":"Potion of curing","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Potion_of_curing","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{item\n |itemtype = Potion\n |name = Potion of curing\n |cost = 20\n |weight = 4.0\n}}\n\n{{flavour|A potion which restores a small amount of health, and cures poison and confusion.}}\n\nQuaffing a '''potion of curing''' restores <code>4 + 1d7</code> HP (5-11 HP, 8 HP on average) and cures [[poison]] and [[confusion]].\n\n{{crawlquote|You feel better.}}\n\n==Strategy==\nThese are best used for curing confusion. It's also good against poison, which can stack quickly. A single potion heals all poison, no matter how severe it is. If you need pure HP restoration, a [[potion of heal wounds]] is stronger. In lieu of other escape options, curing can help - just don't be surprised if a monster outdamages the healing.\n\nDo note that these potions ''only'' cure poison and confusion. The vast majority of [[status effect]]s are unaffected. If you're dealing with effects such as [[Petrify|petrification]], [[slow]]ness, or an [[Bad Form|unwanted transformation]], you'll want a [[potion of cancellation]] instead.\n\nPotions of curing are the most common potion in the game. If you get lethally poisoned by an [[adder]], but don't have curing identified, try quaffing the biggest stacks of potions first.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], this potion could cure [[sickness]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], this potion could cure HP [[rot]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], potions of curing could only heal rot when at or near full health.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], this item was known as a potion of healing.\n\n{{potions}}"}

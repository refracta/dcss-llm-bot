It was the mage Iskenderun's favourite playtoy.}}\n\n[[File:Sphere of battle.png]] '''''the sphere of Battle'''''\n\n[[Orb]]\n\n[[Spell enhancer|Enhances]] the power of the wielder's [[destructive spells]]<br>\nWeakens your non-destructive magic<br>\nAutomatically creates a [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere|battlesphere]] when monsters are in sight; the battlesphere's power depends on your [[Conjurations]] skill.<br>\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''sphere of Battle'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|1568}}</ref> is useful for blaster casters, adding a [[spell enhancer]] and a level 5 spell's worth of damage. However, the loss of a regular [[shield]] (or different type of orb) can be very painful.\n\nCharacters that do not plan to use destructive magic have no use for the sphere of Battle. [[Djinn]] can make use of this orb's spell boost, but as they cannot train the Conjurations skill, the battlesphere's performance will be weaker. Also, the spell Iskenderun's Battlesphere becomes redundant, as you can only have one battlesphere at a time.\n\n==History==\n*This item was introduced in [[0.30]], replacing the [[staff of Battle]]. \n:Previously, you could hit enemies with the staff to fire the battlesphere. It only boosted the [[Conjuration]] school and the battlesphere only triggered on Conjurations spells (or staff melee attacks). It did not weaken your non-destructive spells. Also, the battlesphere's power was calculated as if you had cast [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere]], instead of purely using Conjurations skill.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Orbs]]"}

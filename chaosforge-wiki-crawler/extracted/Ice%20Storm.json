Like Fire Storm, it inflicts incredible damage, up to 7d32 damage at max spellpower, and it even pierces [[cold]] resistance better than Fire Storm pierces [[fire]] resistance (60% irresistible vs. 45%). However, Ice Storm does not create any [[fire vortex|vortexes]] and uses beam-targeting instead of [[smite]] targeting. This means that it is generally considered inferior to Fire Storm, though still very powerful.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.14]], Ice Storm was replaced with [[Glaciate]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

You probably don't want to drink the results. The type of the potion produced corresponds roughly to the effects of eating said corpse.}}\n\n[[Fulsome Distillation]] extracts essences from a corpse into a potion. The potions produced are mostly used as ammunition for [[Evaporate]].  The potions produced will be identified if necessary.\n\n<div style=\"border:none; margin:0px; padding:0px;\">\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n! Corpse\n!

Corpses which are both contaminated and poisonous will give potions of poison regardless of size.\n\nThe spell will fail if you are [[Levitate|levitating]] over a corpse without [[Control Flight|controlled flight]] (\"You can't reach the corpse!\").\n\n'''Warning!'''  Casting this spell on an orc corpse is considered desecration, which may cause problems if you are a [[Beogh|Beoghite]]!\n\n==Tips and Tricks==\n* You will rapidly accumulate far more potions than you can carry.  Stash most of them, carrying 3-5 of each type you want.  Note that almost nothing will pick up these \"bad\" potions, so you can usually just leave them around the level.  ([[Jelly|Jellies]] notwithstanding!)\n* Note that [[swamp drake]]s and [[swamp dragon]]s just give ordinary poison.  So do [[green rat]]s or [[kobold]]s, and those come in swarms.\n* [[Necrophage]]s and [[vampire mosquito]]s both give the powerful [[potion of decay]].\n* [[Spriggan]]s might consider distilling [[potion of water|potions of water]] for nutrition.\n* If you like mutation roulette, [[sky beast]]s, [[ugly thing]]s, and [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]]s can give you all the [[potion of mutation|potions of mutation]] you want.\n* The corpses that yield confusion potions are common early, but thin out rapidly later.  One response is to learn [[Mephitic Cloud]] as well.  Despite the apparent redundancy, this will relieve you of carrying a big stack of potions for your most popular cloud.\n\n==Warning==\nThink thrice before worshipping Fedhas: Bottling up a corpse will place you under penance...\n\n==History==\nThis spell was removed in [[0.12]].  In earlier versions, potions produced also depended on spell power and whether or not the corpse was rotten: rotten corpses produced 'better' potions (e.g. decay instead of confusion), while all potions had a chance to be downgraded at low spell power.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

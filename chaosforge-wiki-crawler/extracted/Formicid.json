{"title":"Formicid","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Formicid","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{for monster}}\n{{flavour|The Formicids are a species of humanoid ants. Just like their tiny insect ancestors, the Formicids are well adept at earth work, both on the physical and magical sides. Their abilities have been used to tunnel immense underground communities and structures, many of which are tens of thousands of years old.\n\nPerhaps unfortunately, their strong ties to earth have left them completely impervious to being teleported or hasted; Formicids are tied to the earth with a complete sense of stasis. While this is a seemingly bad property for a dungeon adventurer, stasis has the beneficial effect of preventing many types of nasty hexes and maledictions.\n\nWith the ability to lift ten times their own weight, the Formicids have strength rivaling that of Oni. This, along with the fact that they have four arms, allows Formicid warriors to equip both a shield and a two-handed weapon at the same time.\n\nFormicids make good earth mages and alchemists, but are quite capable at both melee and ranged combat too. They are naturally bad at air magic and conjurations.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*'''[[Antennae]] 3:''' Formicids can sense monsters within 7 tiles (even through walls) and can also [[see invisible]].\n**Formicids cannot wear any form of headgear.\n*'''[[Four Strong Arms]]:''' Formicids have four arms. They can wield all two-handed weapons with one hand-pair (the equivalent of one hand for other species), and are even able to wield [[giant club]]s and [[giant spiked club]]s, though with two hand-pairs. However, they are too small to use [[large rock]]s and still have only 2 ring slots.\n*'''Mandibles:''' Formicids can dig through walls as an innate ability. First, they have to extend their mandibles, and then move into a [[rock wall]] or [[iron grate]] to start making the tunnel. Digging takes your normal [[movement delay]] per square, inflicts slight temp. [[drain|HP drain]] (~2% max HP per tile), and makes some noise.\n**Formicids can create a [[shaft]] under themselves as an innate ability, allowing them to escape downwards. Unlike digging, this ability is silent. Note that you cannot use it on the last level of a [[branch]], nor in [[the Abyss]], [[Hell]], [[Pandemonium]], or [[Ziggurat]]s.\n*'''[[Stasis]]:''' Formicids have permanent stasis, rendering them unable to gain certain space and time altering effects. They are immune to [[blink]], [[teleport]], speed altering effects ([[Haste]], [[Berserk]], [[Slow]], [[Swiftness]]), and [[paralysis]]. \n**They are not immune to [[petrification]]. Also, blink-like effects that are not \"blinks\" ([[Passage of Golubria]], [[Dithmenos]]' Shadow Step, [[Hepliaklqana]]'s Transference...) and [[Okawaru]]'s Finesse work as normal. However, [[Vhi's Electric Charge]] and [[Storm Form]]'s Blinkbolt don't work.\n*Formicids cannot be randomly [[shaft]]ed by [[malevolent force]].\n\nFormicids have a base [[Strength]] of 12, [[Intelligence]] of 7 and [[Dexterity]] of 9 (before Background modifiers).\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Warriors:''' [[Fighter]], [[Hunter]]\n*'''Warrior-mages:''' [[Hexslinger]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Earth Elementalist]], [[Alchemist]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[strength]] or [[intelligence]] every 4th level.\n*Average [[HP]].\n*+4 [[willpower]] per level.\n\n==Starting Skills and Equipment==\nFormicids receive the skills and equipment listed for their background, with 2 special cases:\n*Formicids do not receive any headgear.\n*As they are able to wield them with a shield, Formicid [[Fighter]]s may start with a [[quarterstaff]].\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Hard}}\n\nFormicids are blessed and cursed with some of the most dramatic species mutations in ''Crawl'', resulting in a very unique play experience.\n\nThey are strong in all sorts of combat, since Formicids can use two-handed weapons with a shield. Melee brawlers can deal stupendous damage with that [[executioner's axe]], without sacrificing much on defense. They can dig corridors and [[kill hole]]s, making crowds easy to deal with. They are also great users of [[Ranged Weapons]], since most are two-handed. Formicid aptitudes are good overall, with great aptitudes in Armour, Shields, and certain types of magic (Hexes, Earth, Alchemy).\n\nUnfortunately, Formicids are unable to use 3 of the best emergency items in the game: [[scrolls of blinking|blinking]], [[scroll of teleportation|teleportation]], and [[potion of haste|haste]]. A normal character can fight for a while, then teleport away if it gets too hairy. A Formicid must play more cautiously. On the flip side, Formicids are immune to some of the nastiest effects in ''Crawl'', including [[shaft]]s, teleport [[malevolent force]] effects, and [[paralysis]]. Immunity to [[slow]] and [[dispersal trap]]s is also great to have.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Formicid}}\n\n==Strategy==\nAs a Formicid, your options are limited, so it's important to carefully consider the resources you ''do'' have. As usual, you should use your abilities well before you're at the brink of death. Don't forget that simply walking away, before an impossible fight begins, is sometimes the best option you've got.\n\n'''Digging''' - [[Dig]]ging allows you to create corridors and/or [[kill hole]]s, at the cost of some HP [[drain]]. These can be used to fight a group of enemies one at a time. You may want to create zig-zagging tunnels (to break [[line of sight]]) in advance, near a pack of enemies. Use your antennae and high Stealth aptitude to avoid fights and lure opponents to these chokepoints. \n\n'''Shafting''' - Shafting is a guaranteed escape from any fight, though it takes a few turns to activate. It can also bring you into a whole new can of worms. It's much easier to survive a dangerous, unexplored floor when you're relatively unscathed.\n\nIf the floors below you are clear, then shafting is a perfect escape tool. E.g. you can clear the floors below a [[ghost vault]], and shaft if you need to escape the ghost.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*While Formicids can't blink normally, [[Passage of Golubria]], [[Gell's Gavotte]], and [[Uskayaw]]'s Grand Finale are not blocked by stasis.\n*Don't overlook your Formicid's excellent Earth and Alchemy aptitudes: [[Passwall]] in combination with your innate digging ability is a panic button that only takes a few turns -- and it'll leave a wall between you and your enemies, too. Be sure to leave enough time for the spell to complete (two turns at minimum). \n*Once you're ready for the [[orb run]], you can dig your way through the rest of the dungeon. Try to take the most advantageous shortcuts. You can also choose to leave a few blind corner tunnels to give yourself a chance to rest or [[Passwall]] around any dangerous monsters that bar your way.\n*Spells that disable enemies ([[Slow]], [[Petrify]], [[Cause Fear]], and other [[Hexes]]) are excellent for letting you just outrun enemies you can't handle.\n*When pursued by an enemy you can't outrun or hex, luring it over a [[teleport trap]] or [[shaft]] is a great way to lose it if they're available. Be careful not to enter temporary teleport traps yourself -- you won't teleport, but you'll still destroy the trap.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], Formicids had -1 [[Translocations]] aptitude.\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Formicids were not immune to [[malevolent force]]'s shaft effect.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Formicids couldn't shaft in [[the Tomb]]. Also, they were less encumbered by [[shield]]s (as if they were a [[Size#Large|large]] species).\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Formicids had 6 DEX, a Shields aptitude of +2, and couldn't wield [[giant club]]s and [[giant spiked club]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], digging through walls was slower (+2 [[aut]]s), but did not inflict HP [[drain]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], digging used up [[hunger]].\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Formicids could cast [[Swiftness]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Formicids were able to dig even when transformed, had -2 [[Throwing]] aptitude, and could not use [[Okawaru]]'s Finesse.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Formicids could throw [[large rock]]s.\n*Formicids were added in [[0.14]].\n*During much of their development, Formicids were known as '''\"dwants\"''' (or '''dwarf-ants'''). They had less HP but leveled even faster than humans. In addition, they were particularly vulnerable to [[poison]].\n\n==References==\n[https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=8298 Tavern discussion]\n\n{{species}}"}

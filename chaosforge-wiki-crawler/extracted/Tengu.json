{"title":"Tengu","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tengu","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''This page is about the player [[species]]. For the monster, see [[Tengu (monster)]]. For a list of all monstrous tengu, see [[List of tengu]].''\n{{flavour|The Tengu are an ancient and feared species of bird-people with a legendary propensity for violence. Basically humanoid with bird-like heads and clawed feet, the Tengu can wear all types of armour except helmets and boots. Their magical nature helps them evade attacks while in motion, and despite their lack of wings, more experienced Tengu can magically fly.\n\nThey are experts at all forms of fighting, including the magical arts of combat (conjurations, summonings and, to a lesser extent, necromancy). They are good at air and fire elemental magic, but poor at ice and earth magic. Tengu do not appreciate any form of servitude, and so are poor at using invocations. Their light avian bodies cannot sustain a great deal of injury.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*'''[[Beak]]''' and '''[[Talons|Talons 3]]''': Tengu have beaks and talons, which give them two [[auxiliary attack]]s in melee combat.\n**Tengu cannot wear [[boots]] or [[helmet]]s, but can wear [[hat]]s.\n*'''[[Acrobat]]ic''': While moving or [[wait]]ing (not including [[stair]] travel), Tengu gain +15 EV, as with an [[amulet of the acrobat]]. Does not stack with the amulet.\n**Note that when recasting [[channeling spell]]s (like [[Searing Ray]] and [[Flame Wave]]), you still get the Acrobat bonus\n\nTengu have a base [[Strength]] of 8, [[Intelligence]] of 8 and [[Dexterity]] of 9 (before Background modifiers). They have +1 to base [[magic points]].\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Zealots:''' [[Berserker]]\n*'''Warrior-mages:''' [[Reaver]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Hedge Wizard]], [[Conjurer]], [[Summoner]], [[Fire Elementalist]], [[Air Elementalist]], [[Venom Mage]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 to a random [[stat]] every 4th level.\n*20% less [[HP]] than average.\n*+3 [[willpower]] per level.\n*At XL 7, gain permanent [[flight]] and +4 EV ('''Agile Flight''').\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Moderate}}\n\nTengu are a versatile, but frail species. Their aptitudes are good across the board, with impeccably good skill in Conjurations and Air Magic. And with 2 [[auxiliary attack]]s, melee is also reasonable. However, Tengu are among the most fragile species in the game: they have low HP and can't wear helmets or boots.\n\nNote that, despite being described as \"agile\" and \"light\", Tengu do not get any special bonus from the [[Dodging]] skill. It is true that [[Acrobat]]ic and Evasive Flight grant [[EV]], however, these bonuses are unaffected by skill or [[armour encumbrance]]. Therefore, wearing heavy armour is not out of the question.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Tengu}}\n\n==Strategy==\n\nCaster Tengu have the best reasons to choose [[Vehumet]] over [[Sif Muna]], as they have a strong aptitude for [[Conjurations]], and Vehumet's entirely passive suite of abilities means they don't have to rely on their poor [[Invocations]] aptitude.\n\n==Trivia==\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengu Tengu] are a type of legendary creature in Japanese folk religion traditionally depicted with both human and avian characteristics.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Tengu did not have have Acrobat and didn't get +4 EV at XL 7. Instead, Tengu gained +20% EV and moved faster (-0.1 [[movement delay]]) when flying at all, and gained permanent flight at XL 5.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Tengu flight was an [[ability]]; you could turn it on or off.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], Tengu gained temporary flight (about 40 turns) at XL 5, and only got permanent flight at XL 14.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the [[evasion]] bonus for flying Tengu was capped at +9 EV.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Tengu gained permanent flight at XL 15. \n*Prior to [[0.12]], Tengu received the speed bonus while flying only with less than 70% of their unencumbered burden (though flight itself granted a considerable bonus to carrying capacity, a property also removed in 0.12). They also gained experience somewhat more slowly.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], Tengu lost the ability to fly when not in their natural form.\n*The species was renamed from Kenku to Tengu in [[0.10]], to avoid the direct association with the race from ''Dungeons & Dragons''.\n\n{{species}}"}

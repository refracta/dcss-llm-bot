{"title":"Ogre-mage","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ogre-mage","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{for monster}}\n'''Ogre-mages''' were a separate [[race]] of [[ogre]]s who are unique among the beefier species in their ability to use magic, especially [[enchantment]]s. Although slighter than their common ogre relatives they nevertheless have great [[strength]] and can survive a lot of punishment. They advanced in level very slowly, needing half again as much experience as [[human]]s.\n\nAs compared to the standard ogres of the time, ogre-mages were generally more competent: they were the equal to or better than their cousins in everything other than [[Shields]] and [[Armour]].  On the downside, they required more experience to advance in level, had fewer hit points, and could not eat raw meat unless hungry (which pre-0.5 ogres could).\n\n==Preferred Classes==\nOgre-mages prefer to become [[Wizard]]s, [[Conjurer]]s, [[Necromancer]]s, [[Fire Elementalist]]s, [[Ice Elementalist]]s, [[Air Elementalist]]s, [[Earth Elementalist]]s, and [[Venom Mage]]s.\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[HP]] every level.\n*Average [[MP]].\n*+1 [[strength]] or [[intelligence]] every 5th level.\n\n{{Old_Apts\n|arm = 170\n|ddg = 130\n|sth = 100\n|stb = 130\n|shd = 150\n|t&d = 150\n|inv = 75\n|evo = 75\n|exp = 150\n|fgt = 100\n|sbl = 110\n|lbl = 100\n|axs = 100\n|m&f = 100\n|pla = 100\n|stv = 100\n|u_c = 100\n|thr = 150\n|slg = 150\n|bws = 150\n|crb = 150\n|drt = 150\n|spc = 91\n|coj = 100\n|enc = 80\n|sum = 100\n|nec = 100\n|trl = 100\n|trm = 100\n|div = 100\n|fir = 100\n|ice = 100\n|air = 100\n|ear = 100\n|poi = 100\n}}\n\n==History==\n\nIn 0.5, they were merged with standard [[ogre]]s.  Ogres' fighting aptitudes were generally buffed, and this was when they acquired their unusual property of being very competent at basic spellcasting but very bad at all specific schools of magic.  Pre-0.5 ogres were especially terrible at specific schools of magic, with the notable exception of [[Earth Magic]], where they had a 120 aptitude (-1 in the modern system).\n\n[[Category:Obsolete species]]"}

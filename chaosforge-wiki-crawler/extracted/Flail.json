It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''flail''' is a common, moderately powerful one-handed weapon, a step up from a [[mace]]. Although it's a little less powerful than a [[morningstar]], it's faster and more accurate, making it a fair choice for the early game.  Still, upgrading it as soon as possible is advisable.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Flail1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Flail2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Flail3.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.12]], flails had only 9 base damage.\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

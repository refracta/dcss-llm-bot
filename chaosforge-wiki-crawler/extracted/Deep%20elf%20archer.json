{"title":"Deep elf archer","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Deep_elf_archer","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | deep elves}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful info==\n'''Deep elf archers''' are skilled ranged fighters who can also cast a few [[Hexes]]. They can be found in the [[Elven Halls]]. They also occasionally appear elsewhere.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*As they have [[Repel Missiles]], fighting them in a ranged duel is less effective than usual (but not impossible). Ways to lower their [[EV]], such as [[BVC]] or a [[wand of roots]], are effective if you try to do so.\n*Their hexes aren't as dangerous as the likes of [[orc sorcerer]]s or [[deep elf high priest]]s, but if you don't have good [[willpower]], you should keep them in mind.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|deep elf archers will have [[Blink Range]] instead of [[Blink Away]].}}\n*Deep elf archers were introduced in [[0.18]].\n\n[[category:Elf]]"}

{"title":"Running","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Running","type":"raw","data":"{{Version031}}\n{{flavour|It allows its wearer to run at a great speed.}}\n\n'''Running''' is an [[ego]] found only on the [[lightning scales]] [[unrandart]] that reduces your [[movement delay]] by 10%, rounded up. This speeds up movement by 0.1 for [[Armataur]]s or 0.2 for [[Naga]]s. This stacks with other speed enhancers, such as [[Swiftness]] and [[potion of haste|haste]], and has the advantage of requiring no maintenance to keep active. It was widely considered to be the best boots ego available when it was available for other species.\n\n[[Cheibriados]] disapproves of this ego; attempting to use this ego anyway as a Cheibriadite will quickly sap your piety.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], this ego could be found on boots.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], this ego reduced movement delay by two [[aut]]s. 0.13 also added the option to match your movement speed to that of your slowest ally.\n\n[[Category:Movement]]\n[[Category:Egos]]"}

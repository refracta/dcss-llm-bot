The heavier your armour, the stronger it will be.\n\n==Useful Info==\nSummons an animated armour, which has stats dependent on the base [[AC]] of your body armour:\n*HP: Base 40\n*AC: <code>2 * AC</code>\n*Attack: Hits twice for <code> AC + (AC * AC / 2)</code> damage.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|mon-util.cc|2100}}</ref>\n*Extremely slow movement speed.\n*Infinite [[willpower]]\n*Immunity to [[poison]] and [[negative energy]]\n*Is mindless and [[fly]]ing.\n\nOther means of increasing [[AC]] (whether from the armour's [[enchantment]], [[mutation]]s, or being a [[Gargoyle]]) do not directly affect the spirit's stats.\n\nThere is a summon cap of 1 animated armour; casting the spell again will cause the old summon to very quickly time out.\n\n[[Draconian]]s, [[Felid]]s, and [[Octopode]]s cannot use this spell, as they cannot wear body armour. Neither can players in an armour-melding [[Transformation|form]], though swapping forms or taking off your armour will not dispel the summon.\n\n==Strategy==\nThis spell is meant primarily for melee-caster hybrids, giving you an extra ally in melee. Even when created using the heaviest armour, the summon is relatively frail and will not win too many battles alone. High-stat characters, such as [[Demigod]]s, [[Ogre]]s, and worshippers of [[Cheibriados]], are the most likely to wear, and cast in, a suitable piece of armour.\n\nThe armour's strength scales heavily with its base AC; while a [[robe]] may hit twice for up to 4 damage, the relatively light [[fire dragon scales]] deals up to 40 damage per hit. A [[crystal plate armour]] can deal up to 112 damage ''twice'' - but the huge effort required to cast ''any'' spell in crystal plate could have been used on something more effective than creating a single slow ally. Meanwhile, [[quicksilver dragon scales]] synergize well: they have a high base AC, but very low encumbrance.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|animated armours will gain resists innate to their base type.}}\n*Prior to [[0.29]], animated armours did not [[fly]].\n*Animate Armour was added in [[0.27]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

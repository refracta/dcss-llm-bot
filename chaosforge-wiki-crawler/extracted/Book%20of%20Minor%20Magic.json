{"title":"Book of Minor Magic","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Book_of_Minor_Magic","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{spellbook info}}\n\nThe '''Book of Minor Magic''' is the starting book of the [[Hedge Wizard]] background.\n\n==Spells==\n{{spellbook|Book of Minor Magic}}\n\n==Strategy==\nThis is a great starting book for beginners, as Mephitic Cloud and Call Iimp can easily get you through the early game. Blink can get you out of nasty situations pretty quickly, and Conjure Flame can help keep most enemies at bay. However, once you encounter the Lair, the spells this book provides aren't strong enough anymore and you'll need help of other spells or items to survive there.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.20]], [[Repel Missiles]] was removed.\n*It was added in [[0.8]] as a replacement for three different Wizard starting books: [[Book of Minor Magic (flame)|flame]], [[Book of Minor Magic (frost)|frost]], and [[Book of Minor Magic (summ)|summoning]].\n\n[[Category:Starting Books|{{#invoke:String|sort_key}}]]"}

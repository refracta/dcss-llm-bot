They were similar to [[brimstone fiend]]s, but slower, more durable, more dangerous in melee, and slightly less likely to use their powers. They could be found in [[Pandemonium]], [[the Abyss]], and the [[Hell]]s (particularly [[the Iron City of Dis]]).\n\nSpells: [[Hellfire]], [[Symbol of Torment]]\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nAll fiends are dangerous, and the pit fiend was no exception. However, it was the least deadly fiend, owing to its fairly slow speed and unbranded melee attacks. Players unprepared to deal with these (e.g. many players in the Abyss, where these fiends were occasionally seen) should just run away, provided the pit fiend was already at or near the edge of their LOS. Those wishing to kill them should keep in mind that unlike the brimstone fiend, it lacked a common elemental vulnerability. [[Earth Magic]] [[Conjurations]] and holy weapons were most effective.\n\n==History==\nPit fiends were replaced with [[hell sentinel]]s in [[0.11]]\n\n[[Category:Demon]]\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

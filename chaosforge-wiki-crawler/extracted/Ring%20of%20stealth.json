{"title":"Ring of stealth","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ring_of_stealth","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{item\n |itemtype=Jewellery\n |name=Ring of stealth\n |cost=?\n}}\n{{flavour|A ring that allows its wearer to move quietly, making them more stealthy.}}\n\nWearing a '''ring of stealth''' improves your [[stealth]] by +50, reducing the odds of a sleeping or unaware opponent in your [[line of sight]] noticing you.\n\n==Desirability==\nLimited. [[Stealth]]-based characters who rely on [[stab]]bing attacks would obviously benefit from one of these, as it makes it easier to enter melee range undetected. Other characters can also appreciate the effect; lightly armoured casters might not focus on [[dexterity]] and stealth much, but with this ring they might still be able to avoid waking up a sleeping, deadly [[unique]] discovered at the edge of their field of vision. Heavily armoured characters likely won't receive any benefit at all (heavy armour stealth penalties will negate most or all of the [[ring]]'s bonus), and should almost certainly use something else.\n\nIn all cases, once your opponents are awake, a ring of stealth accomplishes nothing. Swapping it out for a ring of [[slaying]] or something else with an actual combat benefit is advised. Since many players find [[jewellery]] swapping annoying, it's uncommon for rings of stealth to see much use at all once alternatives have been found.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], rings of stealth were removed.\n*The ring of stealth was added in [[0.15]].\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

It will not affect weapons otherwise subject to special enchantments.}}\n\n'''Fire Brand''' is a level 2 [[Charms]]/[[Fire Magic]] spell which temporarily adds the [[flaming]] [[brand]] to any unbranded, non-[[artefact]] weapon you currently wield. When cast on a melee weapon, this increases your damage output significantly, especially against targets with vulnerability to [[fire]], such as [[ice beast]]s. It also makes slashing weapons extremely effective vs. [[hydra]]s. When cast on a ranged weapon, it will deal no additional damage, but will deal 100% fire damage, making the weapon significantly better against vulnerable foes but much worse against fire resistant ones. Unwielding the weapon will end the spell early.\n\n==History==\nFire Brand was removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

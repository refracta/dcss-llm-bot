{"title":"Mercenary card","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mercenary_card","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|The card depicts bloodied hands accepting a bag of gold.}}\nDrawing the '''Mercenary card''' will immediately generate a [[durably summoned]] mercenary which will offer you its services for a fee. The fee is roughly equal to the monster's [[XP]] value, plus or minus 15 percent. A hired mercenary will be friendly, but if the player cannot or chooses not to purchase the ally, it will be hostile.\n\nAs a durably summoned monster, a mercenary gives no experience, cannot be abjured, never times out, and will not leave a corpse or any equipment behind upon death. However, they increase in strength as they deal the killing blow against enemies, and can grow into a more powerful creature after it gains enough experience. This is the list of possible mercenaries in ascending order of power:\n\n*{{monsterlink|Big kobold}}\n*{{LightRed|m}} [[File:Merfolk_(monster).png]] '''[[Merfolk (monster)|Merfolk]]''' -> grows into [[File:Merfolk impaler.png]] '''[[Merfolk impaler]]'''\n*{{Green|N}} [[File:Naga_(monster).png]] '''[[Naga (monster)|Naga]]''' -> grows into either [[File:Naga warrior.png]] '''[[Naga warrior]]''' or [[File:Naga mage.png]] '''[[Naga mage]]''' and then into [[File:Greater naga.png]] '''[[Greater naga]]'''\n*{{LightBlue|H}} [[File:tengu (monster).png]] '''[[Tengu (monster)|Tengu]]''' -> grows into either a [[File:Tengu conjurer.png]] '''[[Tengu conjurer]]''' or [[File:Tengu warrior.png]] '''[[Tengu warrior]]''' and then into [[File:Tengu reaver.png]] '''[[Tengu reaver]]'''\n*{{monsterlink|Deep elf conjurer}} -> grows into [[File:Deep elf annihilator.png]] '''[[Deep elf annihilator]]'''\n*{{monsterlink|Orc knight}} -> grows into [[File:Orc warlord.png]] '''[[Orc warlord]]'''\n*{{Brown|6}} [[File:demonspawn (monster).png]] A random base '''[[List of demonspawn|demonspawn]]'''\n*{{monsterlink|Ogre mage}}\n*{{LightRed|H}} [[File:Minotaur (monster).png]] '''[[Minotaur (monster)|Minotaur]]'''\n*{{Brown|d}} [[File:Draconian_(monster).png]] '''[[Draconian_(monster)|Draconian]]''' -> grows into a random coloured '''[[List_of_draconians|Draconian]]'''\n*{{monsterlink|Deep elf blademaster}}\n\nHigh card power increases the chances of getting a stronger mercenary.\n\nThis card could be found in the following decks over the past versions, before its removal in [[0.19]]:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.11]]\n![[0.12]]\n![[0.13]]\n![[0.14]]\n![[0.15]]\n![[0.16]]\n![[0.17]]\n![[0.18]]\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n|----\n|}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*You can match your speed to your slowest ally by pressing '''CTRL + e'''.

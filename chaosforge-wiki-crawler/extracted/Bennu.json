{"title":"Bennu","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bennu","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Bennu''' are curiously contradictory creatures, masters of both life and death. Their attacks inflict [[holy]] damage. Upon death, bennus resurrect and emit a large burst of negative energy, damaging the living. They can only resurrect once. They are very rare, appearing only in [[the Tomb of the Ancients]] and [[ziggurat]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*For the living, bennu are one of the less dangerous Tomb creatures; they are simple melee threats that aren't especially strong. But against [[undead]] or [[Demonspawn|demonic]] players, they can hit hard and fast with [[holy]]-branded attacks. If you're vulnerable to holy and lack great defenses, mind the damage.\n*Bennu are immune to [[fire]] and resistant to [[Shatter]], so many AOE spells that obliterate mummies won't work against them.\n\n==Trivia==\nThe bennu is a reference to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennu Bennu], an Egyptian deity of the sun, creation, and rebirth. The unholy aspects ascribed to it in ''DCSS'' have likely only been added to make it better fit in the undead-filled Tomb of the Ancients.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], bennu had fast regeneration.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], they were [[:Category:Water_vulnerability|vulnerable to water]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], their [[ghostly flame]] explosions could heal any nearby undead, including the player. Also, bennu had a [[draining]] melee attack.\n*Bennu were added in [[0.16]]. For a brief time during their development, they also possessed [[sticky flame]] attacks."}

However, it has a high [[MP]] cost, very short range, can be blocked or evaded, and relatively low MP efficiency. When fighting a group of monsters, save it for taking out dangerous foes ([[orbs of fire]], [[Pandemonium lord]]s, [[fiend]]s, [[hell sentinel]]s, etc.) quickly, then switch to a lesser spell for the rest.\n\nLCS might be powerful, but you may want to use Iron Shot instead. Iron Shot takes less XP to use, and is usually sufficient to clear a 3-rune game. Also, it has a 1 tile greater range. LCS is useful if you want to kill enemies faster, and/or if you have spare XP and spell levels to burn. In addition, you might want LCS if you are also using [[Spellforged Servitor]], so that the servitor can have the stronger spell.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n* [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]] combos well with Lehudib's Crystal Spear -- pinning enemies in place reduces their [[ev]]asion, allowing you to set up a lethal one-two punch.\n\n==Monster Version==\nCertain fearsome monsters can also cast Lehudib's Crystal Spear, often with the ability to one- or two-shot unprepared or fragile adventurers. Even the weakest casters can inflict up to 69 damage with it, while the most powerful ([[ancient lich]]es) can deal up to 144. It is entirely possible for a monster to cast this multiple times in a row, so make these enemies a very high priority in combat.\n\nThe monster version of this spell functions identically to the player version, except with a much more variable damage output:\n\n monster_spell_damge = 3d(16 + power / 10)\n   where power = 12 * monster_hit_dice\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nThe following enemy \"casts\" crystal spear via [[Conjure Living Spells]]:\n*{{monsterlink|Walking crystal tome}} (2x 3d34)\n\n==History==\n* Prior to [[0.27]], this spell could only be found in the [[Book of Annihilations]].\n* Prior to [[0.14]], there was also an [[unrand]] [[spear]] known as [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear (unrand)|Lehudib's Crystal Spear]]. This was removed when spears were removed as viable [[throwing]] weapons."}

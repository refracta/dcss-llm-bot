{"title":"Deep elf death mage","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Deep_elf_death_mage","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | deep elves}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n[[Deep elf death mage]]s are [[necromancer]]s who shoot [[draining]] blasts of [[negative energy]] at you. [[Lost soul]]s summoned by them can sacrifice themselves to heal nearby undead creatures, or assume the shape of a nearby killed living creature. They can be found most commonly on the last floor of the [[Elven Halls]], but they can also appear on the earlier floors, in [[the Crypt]], and in [[the Vaults]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Maxed [[life protection]] takes away their ability to injure you outside of melee, as does [[silence]].\n*The lost souls deep elf death mages summon can prolong difficult battles tremendously, if you accidentally finish off a dangerous opponent while they're around. If possible, take out death mages alone, or at least not in the company of any other powerful foes.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], deep elf death mages only had 15 [[HD]], and cast Call Lost Souls less often. Also, they would only summon one lost soul at a time.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], they could cast [[Twisted Resurrection]].\n\n[[category:Elf]]"}

{"title":"Poison Magic","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Poison_Magic","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n''For the current poison-themed school, see [[Alchemy]].''\n\nThe '''Poison Magic''' school concerns itself primarily with the [[poison]]ing of monsters, allowing skilled practitioners to deal massive amounts of damage to most [[natural]] monsters.\n\nAlthough Poison Magic is very effective in many of the earlier portions of the game, you will inevitably come across a wide variety of monsters that are almost completely immune to its powers. Combined with the lack of particularly high-level poison spells, practitioners are advised to eventually branch out into some other school of magic.\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n==Spells==\n*[[Sting]]\n*[[Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot]]\n*[[Poisonous Vapours]]\n*[[Mephitic Cloud]]\n*[[Ignite Poison]]\n*[[Spider Form]]\n*[[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]]\n*[[Alistair's Intoxication]]\n*[[Eringya's Noxious Bog]]\n<!--To-do: make this a table, like Charms-->\n==See Also==\n*[[Venom Mage]]\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], the Poison Magic was removed.

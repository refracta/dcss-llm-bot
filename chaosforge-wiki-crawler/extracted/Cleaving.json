{"title":"Cleaving","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cleaving","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n\nThe '''cleaving''' effect, found mostly on [[Axes]], allows you to strike every adjacent opponent at the same time. Cleaving occurs each time you make a melee attack with an axe, [[lochaber axe]], while in [[Storm Form]], or during [[Xom]]'s '''Cleave''' status. While axes aren't the most ideal weapon for taking out powerful single targets, they outperform all other weapons when it comes to dealing with swarms of opponents.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhenever you attack a target, you also attack all tiles adjacent to you with a x0.7 penalty to damage:\n\n .....\n .sPs.\n .s@s.\n .sss.\n .....<br><br>@ = You\n P = Primary target (100% damage)\n s = Secondary targets (70% damage, no aux attacks)\n . = Tile unaffected by your attack\n\nIn addition, you only make [[auxiliary attack]]s against the \"primary\" target. Each monster's damage is calculated separately: you can miss some targets while hitting others, or deal more damage to a secondary target simply due to luck.\n\nThis effect ignores friendly units, even when [[confuse]]d. Note that you can still confusedly hit an ally as a primary target. Cleaving completely ignores walls and other [[dungeon features]]; you'll always hit every tile adjacent to you.\n\n===Reach-cleave===\nThe [[unrand]] pole-axe [[lochaber axe]] features a superior form of cleaving, that hits all targets within 2 tiles:\n .......\n .ssPss.\n .sssss.\n .ss@ss.\n .sssss.\n .sssss.\n .......<br><br>\n P = Primary target (100% damage)\n s = Secondary targets (70% damage)\n\nYou may also reave by wielding a [[reaching]] weapon with [[Xom]]'s ''cleave'' effect.\n\n==Strategy==\nEven if you have cleaving, '''it's better to fight 1v1 or in hallways than to let yourself get surrounded'''.\n*When fighting 1 adjacent monster, you'll deal 100% damage, and the monster deals 100% damage.\n*When fighting 2 adjacent monsters, you'll deal 170% damage, but the monsters deal 200% damage.\n\nThe more monsters adjacent, the worse the comparison gets. That being said, sometimes you can't help but be surrounded. For example, you could be swarmed by fast enemies, or encounter a pack with no nearby hallway. When you're ''forced'' to be adjacent to multiple enemies, cleaving is great to have.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*For cleaving to matter, you'll need to be facing multiple opponents. As such, physical tank characters have the best time with it. Don't skimp on defenses (HP, AC, EV). \n**Cleaving combos well with the [[vampiric]] brand, as well as gods that heal on kill ([[Makhleb]] against all non-summoned enemies, [[TSO]] against evil enemies).\n*If a gang of opponents seems too dangerous to deal with all at once, don't be afraid to use stair dancing and corridors to limit yourself to one opponent at a time.\n*While it may seem thematic to [[tab]] through monsters, it's better to manually target. Autofight's attack decision is rarely optimal.\n*Cleaving can help against [[invisible]] monsters. If you don't know a monster's precise location, swing with '''v''' or '''Ctrl + direction'''. This removes the guesswork involved in attacking unseen foes.\n*Unless you worship [[Fedhas]], you'll attack any [[plant]]s or [[fungi]] in your vicinity. Don't expect them to provide cover for long.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.17]], cleaving didn't work under confusion.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], cleaving could not go through walls; it would rotate from the main target in both rotational directions (until the halfway point), checking walls in the way. If there was a wall in the way, you couldn't hit targets past it. Secondary targets also took 75% instead of 70% damage.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], cleaving would not target the tile directly behind your primary target.\n*Cleaving was implemented in [[0.12]], where it accompanied a drop in base damage for the three most powerful axes.\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]\n[[Category:Weapons]]\n[[Category:Axes]]"}

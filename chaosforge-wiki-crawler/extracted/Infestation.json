{"title":"Infestation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Infestation","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Infestation''' is a level 8 [[Necromancy]] spell that applies the '''Infested''' status to monsters in a 5x5 area. A friendly [[death scarab]] erupts out of each victim that dies. \n\nInfestation can be obtained as part of [[Kikubaaqudgha]]'s 6* piety gift.\n\n==Useful Info==\nApplies the Infested status to monsters within a [[smite-targeted]] 5x5 area. You can infest monsters from outside [[line of sight]]. Any infested monster which dies will turn into a [[death scarab]]. Monster [[holiness]] does not matter; [[undead]], [[demonic]], and [[non-living]] monsters can all be infested. Only monsters worth [[XP]], or monsters created by [[Kikubaaqudgha]]'s Unearth Wretches ability, can be infested.\n\nScarabs' strength and duration does not scale with spellpower. Scarabs aren't [[derived undead]], so it does not scale with the host's strength, either. Scarabs last for around 81 turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|fineff.cc|697}}<br><nowiki>*</nowiki> A [[summon#summon duration|summon duration]] of 5 is about 81 turns.</ref>\n\nInfestation takes priority over all other [[Necromancy#Undead Creation|undead-creating]] Necromancy spells. It can work alongside [[Death Channel]], but overrides other effects. It even takes priority over [[Gozag]]'s gold touch and [[Yredelemnul]]'s reaping (scarabs replace gold / zombies, respectively).\n\n==Strategy==\n[[Death scarab]]s are great allies; they are very fast, [[slow]] down enemies, are undead, and deal great damage. They also last for a fairly long time, letting you Infest new monsters you encounter. Compared to other undead-creating spells, Infestation has the advantage of working on undead, demonic, and non-living monsters.\n\nInfest the weaker monsters in a crowd and kill them quickly in order to spawn a bunch of scarabs. Use spells like [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]], [[Haunt]], and [[Anguish]] (when combined with other, existing [[undead]]) to start the horde.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*[[Kiku]]'s Unearth Wretches places necromantic fodder in a 5x5 area, which corresponds perfectly to Infestation's radius. You can use Unearth Wretches twice, then Infestation on top of the player character. This is bound to create a large swarm, capable of tackling the game's most dangerous encounters.\n*Death scarabs cannot [[see invisible]] - a notable weakness considering the prevalence of [[Invisibility]]-casting [[lich]]es in the late game.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], scarabs worked alongside all other undead-creating spells.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], scarabs had a [[duration class]] of 6 (~171 turns).\n*This spell was added in [[0.19]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

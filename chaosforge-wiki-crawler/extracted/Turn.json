{"title":"Turn","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Turn","type":"raw","data":"''Main Article: [[Actions]]''\n\n''[[Dungeon Crawl]]'' is a turn-based game. There are two, largely distinct definitions of a '''turn''':\n\n* The turn counter: Every command, such as moving, attacking, or waiting, takes one turn. This is separate from [[time]]; it doesn't matter how long or short these actions are, they'll increment 1 turn. These are the \"turns\" stated in at the end of the game, and the turns used for [[scoring]]. The [[Stealth]] mechanic also checks for raw turns.\n:Automatic commands, like resting with '''5''' or [[autoexplore]], count towards multiple turns, as they are technically multiple actions done for you. Commands you can interrupt (e.g. putting on equipment like [[armour]] or [[amulet]]s) also count as multiple turns.\n* In most casual contexts, and in some areas of the game, one 'turn' is equal to one [[decaAut]] (10 [[aut]], or arbitrary units of time). This is a relative measure of time: slow actions may take 1.5 'turn' and give you 1.5 'turns' of regeneration, but only count towards 1 turn of the turn counter. Most actions, such as moving or waiting, take 1 decaAut. See the [[decaAut]] page for more details.\n\nCharacter and monster behavior can't be fully explained with the raw turn counter (the first definition). For example: a skilled [[quickblade]] lets you attack at 0.3 decaAut. Swinging three times would be three game-turns, but only 0.9 decaAut. An average speed monster would only act once (if that) in that time, but you still swung 3 times total.\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

Every potion has a specific effect (beneficial or harmful) when [[quaff]]ed. \n\nYou can't drink potions while [[berserk]], in [[Death Form]], if you're a [[Mummy]], or during -Potion (after being damaged with the [[No Unsafe Potions]] mutation).

Potions of curing and potions of heal wounds are the two most common types of potions. Therefore, if you get multiple of the same potion, it is more likely to be one of these two. Note that potions can come in batches of 2 or 3, which are treated as one item for purposes of rarity. This is, of course, nonconclusive - but may be useful to know in a dire situation.\n \nQuaffing a random potion is the most obvious way to figure out its contents, but may be dangerous. You'll want to be somewhere safe with no monsters in sight, in case of a [[potion of ambrosia]], [[potion of lignification]], or [[potion of berserk rage]]. [[Potions of degeneration]] and [[potions of mutation]] are also harmful, with effects that do not wear off by simply passing turns.\n\nSome more notes on potion identification:\n*Many [[background]]s begin play with an identified potion.\n*Certain [[vault]]s may contain pre-identified items.\n*The [[Sewer]] will often contain some [[potions of flight]].\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Scroll]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], monsters could drink potions.\n*In [[0.28]], potion rarities were changed to be more consistent.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], some potions could not be found in a stack of 2-3 identical potions. This could be used to narrow down potion types.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Thirsty [[Vampires]] did not receive full effects from potions.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], potions provided 40 [[satiation]]. You could drink otherwise useless potions to satiate hunger.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], the [[Evaporate]] spell could consume potions to generate [[cloud]]s. You could also identify several unpleasant potions by creating samples of them through [[Fulsome Distillation]].\n\n===Obsolete Potions===\n*[[Potion of flight]] - [[0.31]], renamed to [[potion of enlightenment]]\n*[[Potion of stabbing]] - [[0.26]], replaced by [[potion of attraction]].\n*[[Potion of agility]] - [[0.25]],  replaced by potion of stabbing.\n*[[Potion of blood]] - [[0.24]], with removal of [[Vampire]] hunger.\n*[[Potion of beneficial mutation]] and [[potion of cure mutation]] - [[0.20]], merged with [[potion of mutation]].\n*[[Potion of poison]] - [[0.18]].\n*[[Potion of decay]] - [[0.17]].\n*[[Potion of restore abilities]], [[potion of coagulated blood]], and [[potion of porridge]] - [[0.16]].\n*[[Potion of strong poison]] - [[0.15]].\n*[[Potion of paralysis]] - [[0.15]].\n*[[Potion of slowing]] - [[0.14]], replaced with [[potion of lignification]].\n*[[Potion of gain strength]], [[potion of gain intelligence]], and [[potion of gain dexterity]] - [[0.13]], replaced by potion of beneficial mutation.\n*[[Potion of water]] and [[potion of levitation]] - [[0.12]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Items]]\n[[Category:Potion]]\n\n{{potions}}"}

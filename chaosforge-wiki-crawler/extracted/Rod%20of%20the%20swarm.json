While this allows you to effectively swarm dangerous monsters in the early- and mid-game, it comes at a high [[hunger]] cost and requires too many [[MP]] to cast very often. Even so, it is capable of producing useful allies for taking down monsters that lack poison resistance. [[Wasp]]s and [[hornet]]s in particular can [[slow]] or [[paralyse]] powerful living brutes such as [[stone giant]]s. Although far from useless, this rod is fairly situational, and you likely won't want to spend too many [[scrolls of recharging]] upgrading it.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

When mesmerized by the axe, you lose any current [[confusion]] (suggesting a possible emergency use, if you lack potions of curing).<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-func.h|613}}</ref>\n\nNote that if you meld your weapon via [[transformation]] (e.g. if hit with a [[wand of polymorph]]), all source of mesmerization will be dispelled, even if [[siren]]s or [[merfolk avatar]]s are involved.\n\nThe obsidian axe has a chance of summoning demons on any successful hit; this includes hits on harmless creatures like [[plant]]s or [[bush]]es. A maximum of 3 demons summoned by the axe may be present at once.\n\n==Desirability==\nUsing the '''obsidian axe'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|1173}}</ref> can be more than a little irritating, but its excellent stats may make up for it. \n\nThe mesmerization property of this weapon can potentially be very dangerous. For instance, it can forces you to run headlong into a group of strong melee monsters instead of retreating into a corridor to fight them. For this reason, if you are going to use this weapon, you should always keep some escape option open and ready to use: a surplus of [[scroll of teleportation|scrolls of teleportation]] and the [[Blink]] spell (the scroll is restricted by mesmerization) are highly advisable. Be aware that in the more dangerous areas of the dungeon, this may cause you rapidly burn through scrolls. Many players will prefer a regular broad axe or two-handed axe instead, which come with none of this axe's downsides.\n\nBy the time you head into [[Zot]] and the [[extended game]], drain becomes an unimpressive brand, as most enemies will be immune to it. By this point, you will likely want to switch to another weapon. A +9 broad axe with [[freezing]] will perform similarly to this axe.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|the 4% chance to summon a hostile demon will be removed, so all summoned demons will be friendly.}}\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the obsidian axe was a +14 axe with the [[vorpal]] brand.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the obsidian axe would [[curse]] itself on equip, but did not drain, and could be unwielded when mesmerized (ending the mesmerization, regardless of source).\n*Prior to [[0.19]], it had a +3 Strength bonus.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], this was a +12, +15 weapon.\n*The obsidian axe was added in [[0.8]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Axes]]"}

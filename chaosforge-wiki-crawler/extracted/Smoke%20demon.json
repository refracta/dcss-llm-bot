{"title":"Smoke demon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Smoke_demon","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n[[Smoke demon]]s are [[tier-3 demon]]s with dangerous ranged abilities. They are found in [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], and the [[Hell]]s, and they are often summoned by other monsters through the [[Summon Demon]] spell.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Smoke demons are dangerous nuisances that will peg you with attacks as long as they're in your [[line of sight]]. Their Sticky Flame can deal fire damage when you're within 5 tiles of them, and their Smite deals irresistible, unavoidable damage. You can use the [[cloud]]s of steam created by their Steam Balls to give yourself some cover, fortunately.\n*They have excellent resistance to fire damage and immunity to poison and negative energy, but otherwise their defenses are poor and they only have average HP.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.31|smoke demons will have medium size.}}\n*Prior to [[0.14]], they were a bit slower (speed 9).\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

It is protective in combat, but slightly uncomfortable due to the added weight.}}\n\n'''Ring mail''' is a body [[armour]] one step heavier than [[leather armour]]. \n\n==Desirability==\nRing mail can be a decent armour for hybrid and/or [[EV]]-based characters. It strikes a balance between not interfering with EV/spells too much, and providing some protection. Casters with low strength may prefer a lighter armour to decrease spell failure, while a strong melee brute will definitely prefer a heavier one.\n\nUnless you find a particularly good ring mail, you'll want to upgrade to [[swamp dragon scales]], which offers more AC for the same encumbrance. Or [[steam dragon scales]], which offers the same AC but with 0 encumbrance.\n\n==Trivia==\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_mail Ring mail] is an item of armour whose historical existence is somewhat doubtful. It seems more likely that it is a Victorian misinterpretation of contemporary depictions of chain mail or scale mail, or that the rings were merely items of decoration.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[Image:Ring mail1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[Image:Ring mail2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artefact''' || [[Image:Ring mail3.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n<!--- This is here to force the category line to not run into the sidebar. -->\n<br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

But the runner may be snared, the swimmer may be hooked, and the flyer may be shot by the arrow. But there is the dragon. I cannot tell how he mounts on the wind through the clouds, and rises to heaven. Today I have seen Lao-tsze, and can only compare him to the dragon.’”<br>\n-Life of Confucius<br><br>\n\n“This Dragon had Two furious Wings<br>\nEach one upon each Shoulder;<br>\nWith a Sting in his Tail as long as a Flail,<br>\nWhich made him bolder and bolder.<br>\nHe had long Claws, and in his Jaws<br>\nFour and forty Teeth of Iron;<br>\nWith a Hide as tough, as any Buff,<br>\nWhich did him round environ.”<br><br>\n\n-“An Excellent Ballad of a most dreadful Combat, fought between Moore of Moore-Hall, and the Dragon of Wantley”, retold by Ambrose Philips, _A Collection of Old Ballads.

They have low [[HP]], [[AC]], and [[EV]], making them easy prey for most attacks. However, they can breathe [[Sticky Flame]] at you, dealing significant [[fire]] damage over several turns.\n\nKilling it may drop [[mottled dragon scales]], one of the better light armours in the game.\n\n==Spells==\n\n{{Spellcaster1\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Sticky Flame Range]] (3d4)\n|flags1={{Natural slot flag}},<br>{{Breath slot flag}}\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Its Sticky Flame breath has a maximum range of 5 tiles. If you're a fast character, you can [[kite]] them fairly easily. Otherwise, try to take them out before they get into range.\n*[[Fire resistance]] will reduce its damage. [[Mottled dragon armour]] will make the flame not \"stick\".\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.20]], mottled dragons were replaced by [[acid dragon]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], this dragon dropped a [[mottled dragon hide]] that could be made into [[mottled dragon armour]] with a [[scroll of enchant armour]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], this monster was greatly feared for its ability to [[item destruction|destroy your scrolls]]."}

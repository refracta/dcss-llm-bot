They found out too late that such a complete perversion was uncontrollable; the foul flame they produced destabilised or destroyed everything it was infused into, except for several demonic test subjects and one stolen holy weapon. A lesser, and more stable, version of the dark energy proved more workable, and became Yredelemnul's umbra.\n\nThis is that weapon: an eveningstar with its light long fled, despite its name, and a shadow that repulses those its light used to comfort...}}\n[[File:Brilliance.png]] '''''the +1 eveningstar Brilliance'''''\n\n+1 [[eveningstar]]\n\nFoul Flame [[brand]] (does an additional 75% damage to holy beings, 25% to unholy beings, and 50% to all others, post-[[AC]])<br>\n3 tile [[umbra]]<br>\n[[Evil]]\n\n==Desirability==\nDespite its low enchantment and lack of many properties, '''Brilliance'''<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|art-data.txt|409}}</ref> is one of the best options for one-handed [[maces & flails]]. For most creatures, including ones that are [[natural]] and [[non-living]], the damage bonus is equivalent to using a weapon of [[speed]], and is less impacted by the target's AC. For [[undead]] and [[demonic]] creatures, this bonus is roughly equivalent to a weapon of [[flaming]] or [[freezing]], but does not check any resistances. For holy creatures, this would be like using a weapon of [[holy wrath]] against them, if they were vulnerable to it, though this damage is less relevant due to very few holy creatures appearing in any given game.\n\nCombine the good base weapon type with an incredible damage bonus, and you have a weapon that is competitive for all of a 3-rune game. For extended, where most monsters are unholy, a +9 eveningstar or [[demon whip]] of flaming/freezing/holy wrath may be a better option, but Brilliance is still a great general option for dealing damage.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.32]], Brilliance was restored with a new brand and flavour.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Brilliance was a +1 eveningstar of [[holy wrath]], that gave +5 [[AC]], +5 [[INT]], rN+, Stealth- and a 3 tile [[halo]]. The halo effect was moved onto [[Eos]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], this was a [[mace]] known as the [[mace of Brilliance]]. It had See invisible but only a -20 stealth penalty (pre-halo).\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

It whips the air around it up into a furious storm as it ripples and swirls.}}\n[[File:Robe_of_clouds.png]] '''''the +3 robe of Clouds'''''\n\n+3 [[robe]]\n\nrElec<br>\n[[Cloud immunity]]<br>\nMay create thunder clouds on enemies within radius 2 (1/7 chance each turn)<br>\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''robe of Clouds'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|1149}}</ref> is most useful for [[EV]]-based characters who haven't found another source of electricity resistance yet. The cloud immunity can also be useful in [[Swamp]], [[Volcano]] / [[Ice cave]], and a few cloud-generating [[vault]]s. Otherwise, it generally isn't worth using the body slot for.\n\nThe thunder clouds are nice to have; the clouds themselves are stronger than [[Freezing Cloud]]. You can [[kite]] 10 speed enemies until a thunder cloud appears, where you can engage in melee, keeping them inside the cloud.\n\nThe cloud mage of the [[Cloud Mages' Chambers]] is guaranteed to be wearing the robe of Clouds, if it hasn't already appeared elsewhere.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the thundercloud effect was an evocable ability.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], thunderclouds were ''very'' [[noise|loud]] (louder than [[Qazlal]]).\n*Prior to [[0.23]], this unrandart allowed to evoke flying and randomly generated clouds of thin mist and rain, which occasionally turned dry tiles into [[shallow water]] and shallow water into [[deep water]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

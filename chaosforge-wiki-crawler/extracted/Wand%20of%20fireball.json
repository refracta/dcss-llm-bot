It has perfect accuracy, but creates a lot of [[noise]] and can injure you if you fire it at a tile adjacent to you. Its [[spell power]] is based upon your [[Evocations]] skill.\n\nIt can hold at most 15 charges.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nCharacters without access to [[Fire Magic]] can use wands of fireball to burn down trees.\n\n==History==\nWands of fireball were removed in [[0.18]].\n\nPrior to [[0.17]], it could hold at most 9 charges."}

{"title":"Wield","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wield","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n\n'''Wielding''' is the action of holding an [[item]] in the hand, performed with the '''w''' key.\n\nWhile an item is wielded, it will be used by your character to perform [[melee combat]], so the main use of wielding is to ready [[weapon]]s. [[Ranged weapon]]s also require wielding before they can be used.\n\nWielding is also required for some [[Evocable_items#Artefact_staves|artefact staves]] before their powers can be [[Evocation|evoked]].\n\nThe game will warn the player if they attempt to perform melee combat with an unsuitable weapon, as this is a common mistake.\n\n==Wielding nothing==\nThe player may choose to wield nothing and go empty handed, by pressing '''-''' (the minus key) when prompted for an item. Characters who intend to use [[Unarmed Combat]] will usually wield nothing.\n\n==Switching between weapons==\nPressing ' (the apostrophe key) will attempt to wield and switch between the contents of the special inventory slots \"a\" and \"b\". The player may set their favorite weapons to these two slots by pressing the '''=''' key, then selecting '''i'''tems.\n\nNote that you will not wield an item in one of those slots if it is unsuitable for wielding (i.e. wands, armour, etc.); instead, you will simply wield nothing. This is useful for Unarmed Combat specialists, who can keep a non-weapon item in one of their \"a\" or \"b\" slots to have a way to easily switch back to their fists.\n\n==Wielding failure==\nWielding will fail if:\n*the item the player is trying to wield is too large for them\n*the player is already wielding a [[cursed]] weapon\n*the player tries to wield the item they are already wielding\n*the item requires two hands to wield and the player is wearing a shield\n\n==Exceptions to wielding==\nThere are several items that do not require wielding to use. [[Wand]]s can be [[zap]]ped and [[throwing]] weapons can be thrown directly from the inventory, and other evocable items function this way as well. Note that some of these items require thumbs to use, so characters without thumbs (i.e. [[Felid]]s and those in certain form changes) still won't be able to use them.\n\n==Wielding cursed weapons==\nA [[cursed]] weapon will stick to your hand when wielded, making it impossible to unwield or [[drop]].\n\n==Wielding distortion weapons==\nUnwielding [[distortion]]-branded weapons can inflict [[magical contamination]], [[teleport]] you next to a random monster on the level, or even [[banish]] into the [[Abyss]]. For this reason, low-level players should exercise caution in wielding known and possible distortion weapons. Risk-averse players can [[identify]] suspect weapons before wielding. An identified distortion weapon will always ask for a confirmation before wielding.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.24]], [[vampiric]] weapons required the player to be [[Comestibles_and_satiation#Satiation|Full]] or above to equip them.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], the player had to wield [[stone]]s or [[large rock]]s to boost [[Sandblast]]'s damage. Also, the player couldn't (un)wield things while [[berserk]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], casting [[Sticks to Snakes]] required wielding [[javelin]]s or [[arrow]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], wielding a cursed, blunt weapon prevented butchering.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], the player was required to wield a sharp weapon for [[butchering]].\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

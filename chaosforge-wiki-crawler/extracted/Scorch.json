The spell is unevadable, and enemies that are damaged will lose one rank of [[fire resistance]] for several turns (becoming vulnerable to fire if they had no resistance to begin with).\n\n[[Cinder Acolyte]]s and [[Fire Elementalist]]s start with this spell in their library.\n\n==Strategy==\nAs it targets random creatures within range, Scorch often functions best in one-on-one fights. It deals good damage, and unlike [[Foxfire]], can be used in hallways without penalty. Note that it makes significant noise and will draw attention from nearby monsters.\n\nScorch reduces your target's fire resistance, so stacking it with itself or other Fire spells (like [[Foxfire]] or [[Flame Wave]]) can help you pile on the damage.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Like many other [[Fire Magic]] spells, Scorch will create [[steam]] [[clouds]] when used on targets in water. This combos particularly well with its fire resistance reduction, as fire vulnerability also affects damage from steam.\n*Scorch must deal damage to reduce fire resistance. It has no effect on enemies that are completely immune to fire, and may struggle to affect enemies with high [[AC]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], this spell did more damage, with a damage formula of <code>2d(5 + power/10)</code>.\n*This spell was added in [[0.28]]."}

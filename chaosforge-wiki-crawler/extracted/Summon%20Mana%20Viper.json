{"title":"Summon Mana Viper","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summon_Mana_Viper","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Summon Mana Viper''' is a level 5 [[Hexes]]/[[Summonings|Summoning]] spell which summons a [[mana viper]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nA single [[mana viper]] is summoned. These monsters' bites inflict [[antimagic]], reducing the chance that monsters cast wizardly or magical spells.\n\nHigher [[spell power]] increases the [[hit dice]] of the creature. The mana viper's HD equals <code>7 + <power> / 12</code>, rounded in a weighted manner.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|spl-summoning.cc|580}}</ref> This increases HP, accuracy, and the strength of the antimagic bite.\n\nDuration of the summon is around 18 turns; it does not depend on the spell power.\n\nThere is a summon cap of 1; casting the spell again will cause the old summon to very quickly time out.\n\n==Strategy==\nMana vipers are fast and moderately durable, but are most notable for their [[antimagic]] bite. The antimagic status gives a % chance for monsters to fail their spells. The more antimagic a monster has, the greater the failure rate. Antimagic is very effective against spellcasters and [[demon]]s.\n\nTheoretically, mana vipers can be used against endgame threats like [[ancient lich]]es, [[orbs of fire]], and [[fiend]]s. But vipers aren't the strongest creatures, and you can only summon one at a time. So it's likely that the viper just dies (or gets [[abjured]]). This spell ''can'' work against them, but don't rely on it.\n\nAgainst non-magical targets, mana vipers are alright. Better than a [[Call Canine Familiar|canine]] or [[ice beast]], but not amazingly so. If you want a raw combat summon, [[cactus giant]]s are a much better bet.\n\n==Monster Version==\nCreates multiple mana vipers based on the spell power, their hit dice is not adjusted from the base monster. Duration is the same as the player version.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], mana vipers' [[HD]] was 1 lower.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], mana vipers' [[HP]] did not scale with spellpower, resulting in less HP overall. Also, their [[HD]] was 1 lower.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], this spell had a summon cap of two.\n*Summon Mana Viper was added in [[0.14]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

{"title":"Black draconian","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Black_draconian","type":"raw","data":"{{version021}}\n{{list of | draconians}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Black draconians''' are the [[electricity]]-themed members of the [[list of draconians|draconian]] family. Their lightning breath attacks deal more damage than any other draconian breath attack, especially if they manage to [[multizap]] you (though they may also do heavy damage to anything else nearby). They can be found primarily in [[the Realm of Zot]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Electricity resistance will greatly reduce the damage of their breath attacks. [[Freezing]] and [[dragon slaying]]-[[brand]]ed weapons help make combat against them much easier.\n*Black draconians can [[fly]], so casters with [[Airstrike]] can kill them fairly easily. If there's a more immediate threat present, however, deal with that first."}

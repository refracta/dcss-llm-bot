{"title":"Salamander tyrant","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Salamander_tyrant","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For a list of salamanders, see the [[List of nagas#Salamander Types|List of salamanders]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful info==\n'''Salamander tyrants''' are extremely dangerous foes guarding the [[Snake Pit]] against intruders. Their [[Eruption]] is a strong, [[smite-targeted]] attack which ignores [[EV]] and creates [[lava]] (blocking the player's retreat if they can't [[fly]]). [[Pyroclastic Surge]] can only be used if the player is on or adjacent to a lava tile. Also, they can [[weak]]en you (-25% melee damage) without using up their turn.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Try to avoid being near [[lava]]. When you're on/adjacent to lava, tyrants get a 2nd chance to cast a high-damage fire spell.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-spell.h|1092}}<br>Monsters have a X/200 chance to cast a spell (if it would do anything) - that's 50/200 (25%) for Pyroclastic Surge, and 20/200 (10%) for Eruption. So, when near lava, tyrants are 3.5x as likely to cast either of the two spells. Eruption can still be used if you're surrounded by lava, and being unable to cast Pyroclastic Surge doesn't make the other spells more likely.</ref>\n**Unfortunately, Eruption can create lava around you. Since it has a chance to create lava for each ''empty'', adjacent tile, standing in a hallway reduces the chance of lava being created. However, unless you are [[flying]], being in hallway increases your chance of getting trapped.\n*Having [[fire resistance]] will reduce their damage output significantly. Eruption ignores 50% of your fire resistance, though Pyroclastic Surge is affected normally by fire resistance.\n*Low-HP, high EV characters will find this enemy particularly lethal - but like most natural spellcasters, they are affected by [[Silence]] and [[waterlog]].\n\n==History==\n*Salamander tyrants were added in [[0.27]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

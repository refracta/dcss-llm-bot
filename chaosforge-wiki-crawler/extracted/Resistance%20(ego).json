{"title":"Resistance (ego)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Resistance_(ego)","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|It protects its wearer from the effects of both cold and heat.}}\n\n'''Resistance''' is a rare [[ego]] which grants you one rank in both [[fire]] and [[cold]] [[resistance]]. It is only found on [[robe]]s, [[scarves]], and [[shields]] of all sizes. \n\n[[Artefact]]s will display the resistance ego as {rC+ rF+} (plus, they can have other resistances too). The [[unrand]] [[shield of Resistance]] provides a superior version of this ego.\n\n==Strategy==\nResistance is an amazing ego; 2 useful resistances with no drawback. Unless you already cover both resistances, it is one of the best defensive egos available, and remains competitive even if you have both rC+ and rF+. The need for both rC and rF rises once you get to [[the Vaults]] and [[Depths]], but elemental threats exist well before then.\n\n*Shields of any [[ego]] are fairly rare, and resistance is one of the best egos for a shield. While a [[tower shield]] of resistance isn't the most practical for magic users, a feasible shield of resistance is a convincing reason to start using shields (if you haven't already).\n*Robes of resistance are more dubious. Obviously, heavier melee brute won't like them, and even casters have stronger (higher [[AC]]) options in the body armour slot. Species with heavy equipment restrictions (such as [[Spriggan]]s) appreciate their ability to fit while padding out their resistances. \n:Once available, a set of [[gold dragon scales]] effectively has a superior form of resistance, but is befitting for extremely heavy armour characters.\n*A scarf of resistance is quite good. You'll miss out on the 3-4 extra AC from having an enchanted [[cloak]], but the ego can easily make up for that. Depending on your other equipment, though, you may find a scarf of [[repulsion]] or a cloak more useful.\n\n[[Category:Egos]]"}

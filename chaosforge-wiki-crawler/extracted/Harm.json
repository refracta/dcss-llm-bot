{"title":"Harm","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Harm","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|It increases damage dealt and taken.}}\n'''Harm''' is an ego that can appear on [[scarves]] and [[artefact]]s. It amplifies the damage dealt by the player by 30%, but also amplifies the damage received by 20%. This effect applies to all forms of damage, including [[torment]]. The damage is increased after [[AC]] and resistances are applied.  Note that if a monster wears an item of Harm, it gets the benefit.\n\nUp to 2 sources of Harm can stack. With 2 sources, you'll deal 45% extra damage, but take 30% more damage.\n==Sources==\n* [[Scarves]]\n* [[Leech]]\n* [[Robe of Misfortune]]\n* [[Randart]] armor\n\n==Strategy==\nHarm is an extreme double-edged sword. It does let you deal more damage than you take... but that assumes you're dealing damage. When the going gets rough, you'll often want to reposition, use items, try to [[teleport]], or otherwise escape. When doing these actions, Harm is purely a negative. Additionally, when fighting multiple enemies, Harm can be bad: you may hit one enemy, but multiple enemies will hit you. \n\nIt also introduces a ''player''-side risk. Since you'll take more damage, Harm demands you start thinking earlier. You may need to start using items at 75% instead of 60% HP. If you mindlessly [[tab]] without taking this into account, you can end up in danger real fast. You might kill thousands of monsters, but it only takes one [[shaft|particularly]] [[teleport trap|bad]] situation in order to kill you - or, at least, force item usage. \n\nWith all that being said, the damage boost can not be denied. If your character is weak or middling, i.e., they have trouble with standard monsters, Harm can be valuable. For example, Harm can let a caster take out [[cane toad]]s before the toad gets into melee. For characters that are already strong, Harm introduces more risks than its worth. \n\nHarm is 'best' for blaster casters, as it increases damage per [[MP]]. It can also be useful to ranged fighters. It isn't recommended for melee characters: time spent approaching ranged enemies is time getting hit. Also, [[Summoning]]s and [[Hexes]] spells do not directly benefit from Harm, so users of these schools should stray away.\n\nAlthough Harm doesn't affect your summons' damage, it ''does'' increase damage done by conjured entities. This includes [[ball lightning]]s, [[battlesphere]]s, and [[fulminant prism]]s. Harm has no effect on your [[Dithmenos|shadow mimic]], though.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Harm couldn't stack.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Harm appeared on [[amulets of harm]], which would [[drain]] the wearer upon removal."}

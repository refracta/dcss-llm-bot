The vines will reach out and grab interlopers, dragging them towards any nearby trees.}}\n\n'''Awaken Vines''' is a monster-only spell which causes monstrous [[snaplasher vine]]s to burst forth from a nearby [[tree]] tile, quickly seeking opponents out. Vines can cause [[constriction]], and drag opponents into reach of an [[Awaken Forest|awakened forest]].

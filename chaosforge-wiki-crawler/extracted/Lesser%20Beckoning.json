{"title":"Lesser Beckoning","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lesser_Beckoning","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Lesser Beckoning''' pulls a single target adjacent to the caster. It won't move victims into ineligible terrain (such as [[lava]]), but can\nmove them past such terrain, and can move monsters into [[trap]]s or [[cloud]]s. It requires line of fire for enemies to be affected, and its range increases from 3 to 5 with [[spell power]].\n\n[[Warper]]s start with this spell available.\n\n==Strategy==\nLesser Beckoning is mostly useful for slow characters, such as [[Naga]]s, players in [[Statue Form]], or worshippers of [[Cheibriados]], for pulling enemies to you so that you can hit them in melee. \n\nAt higher power levels, it is useful for all sorts of characters. It can pull enemies in, such as an annoying [[centaur (monster)|centaur]] or [[list of deep elves|deep elf]]. This helps you kill them before taking loads of ranged attacks.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Lesser Beckoning was a level 3 spell. It had a power cap of 100 and minimum range of only 2.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the spell had a power cap of 200. The maximum range was reduced from 7 to 5.\n*Added in [[0.19]]."}

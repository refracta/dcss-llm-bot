They start with a good weapon of their choice, light armour, headgear and some throwing weapons and nets.}}\n\n'''Gladiators''' are combatants who fight other gladiators (i.e. monsters) in direct combat. \n\nIn comparison to [[Fighter]]s, Gladiators begin with lighter armour, some [[Dodging]] skill, and a few [[Throwing]] implements. Fighters start with heavier armour, a buckler, and the skill to use them.\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Hill Orc]], [[Troll]], [[Merfolk]], [[Gargoyle]], [[Gnoll]], and [[Vine Stalker]] are the recommended races if you pick a Gladiator Background.\n\n==Racial Restrictions==\n[[Felid]]s are forbidden from becoming Gladiators. A Felid [[Fighter]] or [[Monk]] would end up with the same equipment.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[weapon of choice]] ([[rapier]], [[flail]], [[war axe]], [[trident]], [[long sword]], [[quarterstaff]], or [[unarmed]])\n*+0 [[leather armour]]\n*+0 [[helmet]]\n*3 [[throwing net]]s\n*1 [[javelin]]\n**[[Size#Large|Large]] species get a [[large rock]], [[Size#Small|Small]] species get a [[boomerang]].\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nAdjusted for your species' aptitudes:\n*[[Fighting]]: 2\n*Chosen Weapon's Skill: 3\n*[[Throwing]]: 2\n*[[Dodging]]: 3\n\nChoosing Gladiator adds 6 to your starting [[Strength]] and [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nThose [[throwing net]]s are handy for making your enemies helpless, from D:1 all the way to Zot:5, but they may be destroyed before you can attack the enemy. Throw nets when you are close to your target, to give it less time to struggle.\n\nUse your javelin (or equivalent) to soften up stronger enemies like [[adder]]s before they approach you. With only 1 javelin, you will run out quickly, so don't train Throwing just because you picked this background.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], most backgrounds were buffed; Gladiators received a single throwing implement (which was removed from [[Hunter]]).\n*[[0.16]] allowed gladiators to choose [[Unarmed Combat]] as a starting weapon skill. \n*Prior to [[0.14]], most gladiator starting weapons were of a lower tier: [[short sword]] instead of cutlass, [[mace]] instead of flail, [[hand axe]] instead of war axe, and [[falchion]] instead of long sword. Also, [[size|small and little]] characters would receive [[stone]]s in place of throwing nets. They also started with 20 gold.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], gladiators started with a buckler.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], gladiators could not select a quarterstaff as their starting weapon.\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

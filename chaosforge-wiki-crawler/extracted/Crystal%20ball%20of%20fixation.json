{"title":"Crystal ball of fixation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Crystal_ball_of_fixation","type":"raw","data":"{{Obsolete}}\n\n{{flavour|A dangerous item which hypnotizes anyone so unwise as to gaze into it, leaving them helpless for a significant length of time.}}\n\nA '''crystal ball of fixation''' is an evocable item which, when used \"successfully\", leaves you [[paralyze]]d and [[slow]] for 100 turns. This makes you easy prey for any wandering monsters that find you. On a failure, you suffer a [[Divinations]] [[miscast effect]], such as losing all [[MP]], taking [[intelligence]] damage, or being [[confused]] for 10-20 turns. This item serves no purpose except to make players cautious about testing unidentified crystal balls.\n\n==History==\nThese were removed in [[0.8]].  Before that, they were a source of numerous amusing deaths.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete]]"}

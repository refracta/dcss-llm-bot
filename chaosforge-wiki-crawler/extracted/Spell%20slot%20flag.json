{"title":"Spell slot flag","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spell_slot_flag","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\nOne or multiple '''spell slot flags''' are attached to every monster [[spell]] or ability (which are coded as spells). Many of the monsters you'll encounter in ''DCSS'' can cast, but they have access to these spells in different ways. The spell slot flag determines what methods can disable a spell, as well as a few other features.\n\n==Natural flag==\nThis spell is a natural process, such as a [[list of dragons|dragon]]'s breath or an [[electric eel]]'s electricity, and not really a spell. It cannot be affected by [[Antimagic]], [[Sap Magic]], or [[Silence]].\n\n==Vocal flag==\nMuch like Natural \"spells\", this is a natural ability and not truly magical in nature, but it requires spoken words to perform, like a [[vault sentinel]]'s [[Warning Cry]]. It is unaffected by [[antimagic]] and [[Sap Magic]], but cannot be cast while [[silence]]d.\n\n==Wizard flag==\nThis spell requires spoken words to cast, and is not something innately available to the caster. Most non-demonic casters, such as [[list of deep elves|deep elves]], use the wizard flag. It can be affected by the [[antimagic]] brand and the [[Sap Magic]] enchantment and cannot be cast while [[silence]]d. [[Trog]] appreciates killing monsters with Wizard spells.\n\nSummons created by these spells won't necessarily have the same god as the summoner.\n\n==Magical flag==\nThis spell is an innate magical ability of a creature. It requires no spoken words, but is still magical in nature. It can be affected by the [[antimagic]] brand, but not by [[Silence]] or [[Sap Magic]].\n\n==Priest flag==\nThese are similar to Wizard flagged spells, but the magical force comes from a higher power, not the caster. For example, a [[spriggan berserker]] calls on [[Trog]] for its abilities. This spell cannot be cast while [[silence]]d, but [[Antimagic]] and [[Sap Magic]] have no impact on it.\n\n==Emergency flag==\nThis spell slot will be used only when a monster is clearly losing a fight (when its health is very low in comparison to the player's).\n\n==Noisy flag==\nThis spell creates [[noise]] when cast, even if the spell does not normally make noise.\n\n==Breath flag==\nCasting this spell leaves the caster [[breath]]less for 1-5 turns, during which they cannot cast any other breath flag spell.\n\n==Instant flag==\nThis spell doesn't use the caster's turn -- the caster may move or act normally after casting the spell.\n\n==History==\n*[[0.28]] renamed the No Silent flag to the Vocal flag.\n*[[0.18]] merged the Demonic flag with the Magical flag.\n*These flags were added in [[0.16]], greatly clarifying the interaction between monster spells, holiness, and effects which interfere with magic.\n\n[[Category:Spells]]\n[[Category:Magic]]"}

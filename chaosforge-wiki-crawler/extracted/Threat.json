{"title":"Threat","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Threat","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\nThe '''threat''' level of a monster is a rough indicator of how difficult/dangerous a monster is. This information is accessible through the monster list at the right side of the screen, or in the monster's descriptions. When [[Ashenzari]] detects a monster, you'll see their threat level (but not the type of monster). Threat is also used for a few other mechanics throughout the game (such as [[tension]]).\n\nThe game defines four tiers of threat:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n! Threat level !! Monster's name !! Description\n|-\n| Trivial || {{DarkGrey|Dark grey}} || Minor\n|-\n| Easy || {{LightGrey|Light grey}} || Low\n|-\n| Tough || {{Yellow|Yellow}} || High\n|-\n| Nasty || {{LightRed|Light red}} || Lethal\n|}\n\n==Formula==\nThreat is based off two factors: a monster's XP value, and the player's current [[experience]] points.\n\n Tension = Monster's XP points / ( 1 + sqrt(Player's XP points / 30))\n\n If Tension is less than 1, Threat = Trivial\n Else if Tension is less than 6, Threat = Easy\n Else if Tension is less than 33, Threat = Tough\n Else, Threat = Nasty\n\nThis means that for any species with an experience [[aptitude]] of 0, a monster that gives 5582 XP or more will always be labeled nasty.\n\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], the threat descriptors were as follows:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n! Threat level !! Monster's name !! Description\n|-\n| Trivial || {{DarkGrey|Dark grey}} || \"It looks harmless.\"\n|-\n| Easy || {{LightGrey|Light grey}} || \"It looks easy.\"\n|-\n| Tough || {{Yellow|Yellow}} || \"It looks dangerous.\"\n|-\n| Nasty || {{LightRed|Light red}} || \"It looks extremely dangerous.\"\n|}\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

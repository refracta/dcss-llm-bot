{"title":"Fannar","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fannar","type":"raw","data":"{{version024}}\n''For a list of all elves, see [[list of deep elves]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Fannar the Cold-Hearted''' is a [[unique]] [[cold]]-themed [[list of deep elves|elf]], equipped with a [[staff]] of [[freezing]] and [[ring of ice]] (67%) or [[staff of cold]] (33%), as well as a [[robe]] of [[ego|cold resistance]]. They prefer to stay out of melee combat, summoning [[ice beast]]s to distract you while blasting you with [[Ice Magic]].\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]: 10-12\n*The [[Orcish Mines]]: 1-2\n*[[The Lair]]:1-3\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The difficulty of this fight is determined almost entirely by how much cold resistance you have. If you've got none (or even vulnerability!), you'll probably want to avoid fighting Fannar.\n*Reading a [[scroll of silence]] will disable Fannar's most dangerous abilities, allowing you to engage them in melee in relative safety.\n*The summoned ice beasts are distractions -- don't waste time killing them off if you don't have to. They'll all vanish as soon as Fannar falls.\n\n==History==\n*Fannar was male before [[0.24]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Fannar knew [[Condensation Shield]], before that spell was removed.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Fannar knew Ozocubu's Armour in his 3rd spell slot, and was less willing to use his ice beasts as shields. \n*Fannar was added in [[0.11]], and was the first monster to explicitly generate with [[jewellery]].\n\n[[Category:Elf]]"}

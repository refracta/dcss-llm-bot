Very few monster resist acid, and the [[corrosion]] effect significantly increases your damage output (-8 [[AC]], doesn't stack). As a sling, it's one-handed, unlike most [[Ranged Weapons]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Punk's base type was a [[fustibalus]] instead of a modified sling. It had -1 accuracy as a result.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Punk had a [[freezing]] brand.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Punk was a +9, +12 [[sling]] instead of a greatsling (greatslings were later renamed into fustibali).\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Slings]]"}

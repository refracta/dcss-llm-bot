{"title":"Door vault","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Door_vault","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n\nThe '''door vault''' is a particularly infamous and deadly series of [[vault]]s. They can appear in the [[Dungeon]] (D:13-15), in [[the Depths]], [[the Vaults]], the [[Elven Halls]], [[Hell]], the [[Crypt]], or the [[Realm of Zot]], and can appear multiple times. A door vault consists of a 10x10 square that is primarily made up of layers of [[door]]s, the outermost layer of which are runed doors. The innermost 16 squares contain many nasty out-of-depth monsters or just some [[butterfly|butterflies]].\n\nEach door vault has about 8 good items of loot. Note that door vaults placed in Hell branches have several [[escape hatch]]es instead of loot.\n\n==Appearance==\n XXXXXXXXXX\n XXXXXXXXXX\n XXXXXXXXXX\n XXX1111XXX\n XXX1221XXX\n XXX1221XXX\n XXX1111XXX\n XXXXXXXXXX\n XXXXXXXXXX\n XXXXXXXXXX\n\nAll door vault variants look the same from the outside and can appear in the same branches. Followers of [[Ashenzari]] can scry through doors to see what's inside.\n\n==Variants==\n===door_vault===\nThe monster set includes difficult branch-specific monsters together with end-level branch spawns. For Vaults and the main dungeon, this means standard out-of-depth monsters: the crowd you'd usually see around Depths:5, including [[shadow dragon]]s and [[titan]]s. The other branches have more specific monster sets:\n\n*Elf: What you'd normally see in the final vault of the Elven Halls: [[dancing weapon]]s, [[deep elf blademaster]]s, [[deep elf annihilator|annihilators]], [[deep elf sorcerer|sorcerers]], [[deep elf demonologist|demonologists]], [[deep elf master archer|master archers]], [[deep elf high priest|high priests]], and some regular monsters from Elf:3.\n*Crypt: [[Reaper]]s, [[ancient champion]]s, [[flayed ghost]]s, [[revenant]]s, [[eidolon]]s, [[ancient lich]]es, [[reaper]]s, [[curse skull]]s, and [[vampire knight]]s. Somewhat diluted by normal Crypt:3 monsters, but still, expect nastiness.\n*Hell: Varies by branch. In each case there is a small chance of a square containing a normal monster for the last floor the branch.\n**Tartarus: [[Tzitzimimeh]], [[doom hound]]s, [[bone dragon]]s, [[tormentor]]s, [[death drake]]s, [[shadow demon]]s, and [[ancient lich]]es.\n**Cocytus: [[Ice fiend]]s, [[titan]]s, [[blizzard demon]]s, [[ancient lich]]es, [[tormentor]]s, and occasional [[shard shrike]]s.\n**Gehenna: [[Brimstone fiend]]s, [[tormentor]]s, [[hellion]]s, [[balrug]]s, [[hell sentinel]]s, and [[ancient lich]]es.\n**Dis: Any [[fiend]], [[hell sentinel]]s, [[tormentor]]s, [[hellion]]s, [[shadow demon]]s, [[iron giant]]s.\n*Zot: Expect to see many non-base [[draconian (monster)|draconian]]s, in addition to [[orbs of fire]], [[curse toe]]s, [[Killer Klown]]s, [[electric golem]]s, and [[ancient lich]]es.\n\n===not_door_vault_due===\nThe monster set includes [[hell hog]]s and [[hell hound]]s for the [[Dungeon]], a chaotic theme for [[Elven Halls]] and [[Zot]] ([[very ugly thing]]s, [[apocalypse crab]]s, [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]]s, and [[Killer Klown]]s in Zot), and a mix of [[hell knight]]s, [[hellion]]s and [[balrug]]s for other branches. At least one [[hellephant]] is always present, and additional ones are added, scaling with the depth of placement, up to four guaranteed hellephants in [[Gehenna]] and [[Dis]].\n\n===not_door_vault_mu===\nThis variant places only [[butterfly|butterflies]]. Free loot!\n\n===gammafunk_ghost_door_vault===\nThis vault places up to 10 [[player ghost]]s and some dangerous branch-specific monsters, similar to '''door_vault'''. The loot is usually better than in the other variants. This variation doesn't appear in Hell branches.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.25]], a player ghost door vault variant was added. All four door vaults can appear on the same floors, including D:13-14 and the Vaults. The \"elephant\" door vault variant was reworked to replace [[elephant]]s and [[dire elephant]]s with hell-, demon-, or chaos-themed monsters. Also, the door vaults place some loot now.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], the outermost doors of a door vault were hidden rather than runed. This meant that wandering monsters could and would happily open the vault for you, releasing the contents for you to encounter as you explored the floor.\n*This vault has been taking out players for many versions now. In older versions, though, it was somewhat kinder when it appeared outside of the Vaults or the main Dungeon, tending to contain monsters that were simply appropriate to the branch end. However, the game itself did not provide any warning as to the vault's nature, and preventing autoexplore from opening it would require manually excluding all of the outermost still-closed doors.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

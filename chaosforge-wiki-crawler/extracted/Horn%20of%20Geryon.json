It has the power to call forth demonic beasts. With high Evocations skill, it will call greater numbers of beasts, with lower chances of those beasts being hostile.\n\n----\n\n‘So Joshua called together the priests and said, “Take up the Ark of the Lord's Covenant, and assign seven priests to walk in front of it, each carrying a ram's horn.’\n\n‘When the people heard the sound of the rams’ horns, they shouted as loud as they could. Suddenly, the walls of Jericho collapsed, and the Israelites charged straight into the town and captured it. They completely destroyed everything in it with their swords—men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep, goats, and donkeys.’<br>\n-Joshua 6:6,20-21, New Living Translation}}\n\nThe '''horn of Geryon''' is a unique evocable [[artefact]] which summons [[hell beast]]s, which may come hostile. It can only be found by slaying [[Geryon]] in [[the Vestibule of Hell]]. \n\n==Useful Info==\nThe horn of Geryon creates a loud [[noise]] (noise 15) and summons a few [[hell beast]]s. You can't use the horn while [[silence]]d, but you can use it while [[engulf]]ed. The horn is considered [[evil]], so the [[good god]]s despise its use.\n\nThe horn is guaranteed to summon a hell beast. There are 3 checks: <code>10 * Evocations + 1d90 > 131</code>, <code>10 * Evocations + 1d90 > 181</code>, <code>10 * Evocations + 1d90 > 231</code>, for each of these checks passed, another hell beast is summoned (in addition to the guaranteed one).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|evoke.cc|81}}</ref>\n\nHell beasts always have a chance to spawn hostile. For each summon, if <code>1d(10 * Evocations) > 8</code>, it is friendly (97% at max Evocations).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|evoke.cc|94}}</ref> Like most types of summons, if you attack an already friendly hell beast, it will vanish instead of going hostile. Duration of the summons is around 27 turns, it does not depend on Evocations skill.\n\nOnce used, the horn will become inert until you've earned enough experience to restore it.\n\n==Strategy==\nIf you can confidently complete the Vestibule of Hell, have good Evocations skill, and aren't forbidden from using it, the horn of Geryon is worth having. Hell beasts are a nice ally to have: they have moderately high damage, are fast, and the horn can summon up to four at once.\n\nSince hell beasts [[trample]], and as the horn can summon hostile hell beasts, you may not want to use the horn when relying on [[stairs]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], using the horn made no noise.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the horn served a very different purpose. Until it was used while standing inside the Vestibule of Hell, the four portals to [[Gehenna]], [[Cocytus]], [[Dis]], and [[Tartarus]] were sealed shut. As such, Geryon was essentially the only monster necessary to kill in order to get a perfect 15-rune [[ascension]]. Using the horn anywhere else simply summoned a hostile hell beast to attack you (worth no XP).\n*Prior to [[0.9]], items brought outside the Dungeon contributed towards [[score]]. The horn, worth 5000 [[gold]], was one of the more valuable items to bring out.\n:Also, before the changes to experience and skills in 0.9, this item was commonly used in order to \"[[victory dance]]\" [[Fighting]], [[Dodging]], and weapon skills.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Evocables}}\n[[Category:Unrands]]"}

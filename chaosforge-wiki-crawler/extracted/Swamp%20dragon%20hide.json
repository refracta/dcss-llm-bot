It confers resistance to poison on its wearer, and it may be turned into proper armour by magical means.}}\n\n'''Swamp dragon hide''' is a body [[armour]] produced by butchering a [[swamp dragon]] [[corpse]]. It's even worse than [[leather armour]] on its own, although it does grant [[poison resistance]]. You can turn this into a much more useful suit of [[swamp dragon armour]] by using a [[scroll of enchant armour]] on it.\n\n==History==\nSwamp dragon hides were removed in [[0.19]]\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Hide''' || [[File:Swamp dragon hide.png]]\n|-\n| '''Armour''' || [[File:Swamp dragon armour.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

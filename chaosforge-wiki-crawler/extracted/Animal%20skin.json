For other characters, there's usually better options available. A +2 animal skill is better than a +0 robe, at least.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[Image:Animal skin1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[Image:Animal skin2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[Image:Animal skin3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]] Animal Skin\n|-\n| '''The [[Skin of Zhor]]''' || [[Image:Skin of zhor.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.12]], several monsters ([[sheep]], [[yak]], [[death yak]]) could leave these when [[food|butchered]].\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

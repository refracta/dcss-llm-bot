Natural abilities and divine invocations are not affected.}}\n\nThe '''antimagic''' effect and weapon [[brand]] interferes with the [[spellcasting]] of anything it affects.\n\n==Effect==\n\n===Against monsters===\nAntimagic is a status that interferes with casting. When using a \"Magical\" or \"Wizard\" [[spell slot flag|ability]], monsters have a <code>duration/(4 + duration)</code> (in [[decaAut]]) chance to fail, wasting their turn.<ref>{{source ref|0.29.1|mon-cast.cc|4130}}</ref> Even [[silence]]-proof enemies like [[demon]]s and [[orbs of fire]] can be affected by antimagic, but \"Priestly\" (e.g. [[spriggan berserker]]) or \"Natural\" (e.g. [[dragon]] breath) abilities aren't affected.\n\nWeapons of antimagic inflict <code>damage√ó8/([[HD]]+1)</code> turns of the antimagic status.<ref>{{source ref|0.29.1|attack.cc|1543}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.29.1|beam.cc|5881}}</ref>\n\n===Against players===\nAntimagic directly reduces your current MP. Every time a monster attacks you with an antimagic branded weapon, it drains a random amount of MP up to the damage dealt, but weighted toward half that amount.<ref>{{source ref|0.29.1|beam.cc|3579}}</ref> Player [[Djinn]] are immune to this effect, as they don't have proper MP.\n\n===Wielding===\nPlayers that wield a weapon of antimagic will have their maximum MP reduced by 2/3. A character who has already exhausted their MP pool is free to switch to it mid-combat, though this will lower your MP regeneration (as it is based off max MP).\n\n==Sources==\nAntimagic is a fairly rare status and brand. The brand is unable to be obtained via a [[scroll of brand weapon]]. \n\n*The antimagic brand is [[Trog]]'s special brand, so gifted weapons may have it. \n*The [[Enfeeble]] spell will always inflict the antimagic status, regardless of resistance or EV.\n*[[Vine Stalker]]s possess a unique antimagic [[auxiliary attack|bite attack]].\n*[[Black Mark]] may inflict antimagic if it would have an effect on the target.\n*[[Ru]]'s Apocalypse may cause antimagic (25%) on any target it would have an effect on.\n\n'''Monster-only spells'''\n*[[Drain Magic]] and [[Draining Gaze]] directly inflict antimagic, using [[spell power]] to determine MP drain.\n*[[Sap Magic]] inflicts antimagic when used against other monsters (players hit by Sap Magic gain an analogous, but distinct effect).\n\n==Strategy==\nThough it deals no extra damage, antimagic weapons are extremely useful against magical opponents. A well-enchanted weapon in the hands of a capable fighter will be able to cause most of an enemy's spells to fail, which amounts to semi-[[paralysis]]. As such, antimagic weapons can reduce the threat posed by powerful end-game opponents such as the lords of [[Hell]] or [[orbs of fire]] dramatically; you just have to get into melee range with the enemy first.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{brands}}\n[[Category:Brands]]\n[[Category:Magic]]\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

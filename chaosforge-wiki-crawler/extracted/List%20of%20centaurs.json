It ruptured the ribcage, and stuck quivering in the bone. The centaur pulled out the shaft minus its head (he tried with difficulty to reach that also) but the head was caught in his lung. The pain itself strengthened his will: wounded, he reared up at his enemy and beat the hero down with his hooves. Peleus received the resounding blows on helmet and shield, and defending his upper arms, and controlling the weapon he held out, with one blow through the arm he pierced the bi-formed breast.”<br>\n-Ovid, _Metamorphoses_, XII, 330. 8 AD.}}\n\n'''Centaurs''' (and their cousins the '''satyrs''' and '''yaktaurs''') are humanoid hybrids, men from the waist up with the bodies of beasts below. They are all dangerous marksmen, capable of peppering your character with (occasionally [[brand]]ed) [[arrow]]s, [[sling bullet]]s, or [[bolt]]s from any distance.\n\n==Centaurs==\n{{Brown|c}} [[File:Centaur (monster).png]] '''[[Centaur (monster)|Centaur]]''' - Deadly archers responsible for many untimely deaths.\n\n{{monsterlink|Centaur warrior}} - An elite marksman that can devastate unprepared heroes. Often travels with a herd of centaur allies.\n\n===[[Unique]] Centaur===\n{{monsterlink|Nessos}} - A cruel, armoured centaur who [[haste]]s himself before firing [[venom]]ous, [[flaming]] arrows at his quarry.\n\n==Satyrs== \n{{monsterlink|Faun}} - These playful goatmen antagonize their enemies with [[Hexes]] and pepper them with [[arrow]]s and [[sling bullet]]s.\n\n{{monsterlink|Satyr}} - Satyrs are deadlier with a bow and more vexing with their magic than the fauns they lead into combat, inspiring them with various wartunes on their pipes.\n\n==Yaktaurs==\n{{monsterlink|Yaktaur}} - Close relatives of the centaur that favor [[crossbow]]s. What they lack in speed they make up for with deadly aim and numbers.\n\n{{monsterlink|Yaktaur captain}} - An unmatched expert with a crossbow, these snipers lead bands of lesser yaktaurs on hunts throughout the depths of the Dungeon.\n\n==Retired Satyr==\n{{LightMagenta|c}} [[File:Pan (monster).png]] '''[[Pan (monster)|Pan]]''' - A unique satyr who would have disabled players while his lesser brethren felled them with a hail of missiles.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.14]], fauns and satyrs were added. Pan was briefly considered for inclusion during this time.\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

No foe, the smith promised, could defeat a guard wielding such a weapon!\n\nIt was stolen a few months later, along with the rest of the queen's treasury; the guard, it transpired, had been caught napping. Still, it would serve more than adequately in hands of a waking user.}}\n[[File:Glaive_of_the_guard.png]] '''''the +5 glaive of the Guard'''''\n\n+5 [[glaive]]<br>\n[[Electrocution]] brand<br>\n[[Spectral_(brand)|Spectral]] brand<br>\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''glaive of the Guard'''<ref>{{source ref|0.29.1|art-data.txt|511}}</ref> combines two great brands, electrocution and spectral, into one weapon. Assuming the spectral brand has room to activate, this unrand is about as strong as a +9 [[bardiche]] of [[flaming]]/[[freezing]], but takes less skill to reach mindelay. However, it comes with the [[Spectral (brand)#Strategy|usual risks]] of the spectral brand.\n\nNote that the spectral weapon itself does not get electrocution.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], the glaive of the Guard also gave +5 AC.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the glaive of the Guard had a +8 enchantment. \n*Prior to [[0.26]], the glaive of the Guard did not have the [[spectral]] brand, but provided [[see invisible]] and an [[berserk|evocable rage]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the glaive of the Guard had a +5, +8 enchantment level.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Polearms]]"}

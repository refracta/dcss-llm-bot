In specific, curare poisons as normal, inflicts slow, and deals 2d6 extra damage.\n\nHowever, Snakebite's base damage is fairly low. Curare does nothing against poison resistant enemies, making Snakebite little more than a +8 whip. Even against vulnerable enemies, you may prefer a [[brand]]ed [[demon whip]] or [[eveningstar]] by the late-game.\n\nA rare vault in the early [[Lair]] is guaranteed to contain Snakebite; it consists of a long, winding corridor filled with [[adder|adders]], [[water moccasin|water moccasins]], and [[black mamba|black mambas]], with Snakebite sitting at the very end.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Snakebite merely poisoned opponents instead of inflicting [[curare]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Snakebite had an enchantment of +5.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Snakebite had an enchantment of +5, +10.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''war axe''' is a step up from the [[hand axe]] in terms of power. Like all axes, this weapon allows the player to [[cleave]].\n\n==Strategy==\nAxes deal less damage than comparable weapons, but allow the ability to cleave. As a starting weapon, war axes are a great option for strong species like [[Hill Orc]] or [[Minotaur]]. If you care about your ability to fight single targets, you might want a different weapon.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:War axe1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:War axe2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:War axe3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]\n|-\n| '''[[Woodcutter's axe]]''' || [[File:Woodcutter's axe.png]]\n|}\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Axes]]"}

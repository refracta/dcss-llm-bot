{"title":"Ice dragon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ice_dragon","type":"raw","data":"{{version|027}}\n{{list of | dragons}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe '''ice dragon''' is a moderately powerful [[dragon]] capable of breathing deadly bolts of [[cold]] (3d24), which can knock you back if you are flying. Not surprisingly, they are highly resistant to cold damage, but vulnerable to [[fire]]. They appear commonly in the lower floors of the [[Dungeon]], the [[Depths]], and [[the Realm of Zot]], but can show up dangerously [[out of depth]] in [[vault]]s as early as [[the Lair]] or certain versions of the [[Ice cave]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you find one early on, escaping is a good idea. Without at least rC+ for its breath and decent AC for its melee attacks, they can do immense damage to low- or mid-level characters.\n*[[Fire Magic]] and [[flaming]] weapons will deal extra damage to ice dragons.\n*Killing an ice dragon may provide [[ice dragon scales]], a medium-weight set of armour that provides excellent cold resistance at the cost of fire vulnerability."}

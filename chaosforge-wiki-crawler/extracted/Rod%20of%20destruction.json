This functions like most other bolt spells, piercing through enemies until it runs out of range, but deals one of the following random elemental damage types:\n*[[Fire]]\n*[[Cold]]\n*[[Poison]]\n*[[Negative energy]]\n*[[Quicksilver Bolt|Quicksilver]] (irresistible, strips away magical effects)\n*[[Corrosive Bolt]]\n*[[Electricity]]\n\nLike all [[rod]]s, its effectiveness rises with your [[Evocations]] skill. Due to the chance of it firing negative energy bolts, the [[good god]]s ([[The Shining One]], [[Zin]], and [[Elyvilon]]) all oppose its use, and due to the chance of it firing fire bolts, [[Dithmenos]] also disapproves.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.18]], the rod of destruction was removed.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], this rod could fire [[Crystal Bolt]]s.\n*In [[0.16]], [[Corrosive Bolt]] was added to the list of possible bolts.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], there was a rod of destruction with the following spells: [[Lightning Bolt]], [[Fireball]], and [[Iron Shot]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], there were three varieties of this rod, each with three different spells.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], there was a rod of destruction with the following spells: [[Bolt of Inaccuracy]], [[Bolt of Magma]], and [[Bolt of Cold]]."}

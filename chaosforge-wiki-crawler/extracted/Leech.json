It fills its wielder with the rage and suffering of those souls, and gorges itself further on drained life force every time it strikes, leaving behind a mess of blood and gore.}}\n[[File:Demon_blade_leech.png]] '''''the +8 demon blade \"Leech\"'''''<br>\n\n+8 [[demon blade]]\n\n[[Vampiric]] brand, activated on every hit<br>\n[[Harm]]<br>\n[[Drain]]s wielder on unequip<br>\nrN+<br>\nCreates sprays of blood when striking opponents that bleed\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Leech''',<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|425}}</ref> as a +8 vampiric demon blade, is already a nice thing to have. The vampiric effect activates 100% of the time, which makes this artefact even better. However, the Harm property is a mixed bag. It makes you deal more damage, which increases health steal, but it also makes you take more damage. When you aren't attacking - approaching a ranged enemy, retreating, using an item, etc. - Harm is purely a negative. Being surrounded is even worse than usual: you can only attack one enemy, but multiple enemies can attack you.\n\n[[Undead]], [[demon]]ic, and [[nonliving]] foes are unaffected by vampirism. In places where these monsters are common, like [[Zot]] and [[extended]], you may want to use a different weapon. Even with the HP drain, swapping is worth it.\n\nLeech has a few synergies:\n* [[Demonspawn]] with the [[Ignite Blood]] mutation will appreciate how Leech constantly sprays burning blood everywhere.\n* Your [[spell]]s also benefit from the Harm property. For 'pure' casters, [[magical staves]] are likely better - staves can provide a similar damage increase without any downside. Hybrid characters may appreciate this weapon, though.\n* [[Manifold Assault]] lets you hit multiple enemies from a distance, increasing the value of lifesteal, and partially mitigating Harm's downsides.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Leech had both evocable and random [[berserk|rage]] instead of Harm and *Drain.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Leech had -3 AC and EV instead of its berserking properties.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Leech's AC and EV costs were only -2, and it had -2 Strength, Intelligence, and Dexterity.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Leech's stat, AC and EV costs were only -1.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Leech's vampiric effect was only activated on 60% of all attacks, like all other [[vampiric]] weapons.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Long blades]]"}

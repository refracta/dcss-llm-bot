{"title":"Angel","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Angel","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{list of | holy monsters}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Angels''' are the servants of [[the Shining One]], often equipped with [[blessed blade|blessed]] weapons of [[holy wrath]] and capable of healing themselves.\n\nThey are thankfully very rare, appearing only in [[the Abyss]], holy [[Pandemonium]] and [[Ziggurat]] floors, or certain rare [[vault]]s in which the angel is harmlessly tucked away.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Undead characters should keep their distance: either kill them from afar or run away.\n*Angels often carry [[sacred scourge]]s or [[eudemon blade]]s. If you're not undead or demonspawn, it may be worth killing them in order to steal these, as they are among the best weapons in the game. Just be sure to have an escape plan for when things go pear-shaped.\n*It's easy to avoid angels while wandering the Abyss. Just turn around when you see their 5-tile halo effect hit the edge of your [[LOS]].\n*Keep in mind that they aren't resistant to [[cold]], [[acid]], or [[fire]] damage.\n\n===Variant Angels===\nCertain [[Zin]] altar vaults contain '''Zin angels'''. These are always behind transparent walls, so unless you let them out, the worst they can do is yell at you for being impious.\n\n{{flavour|A divine agent of Zin. It is a towering winged figure with an aura of brilliant white light. Its face is marked by a scowl, as if its zeal against any real or perceived vice overshadows its goodness.}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], angels could [[see invisible]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], [[TSO]] could punish the player for killing angels and other [[list of holy monsters|holy beings]]. Also, hostile angels could turn neutral if the player worshipped a [[good]] [[god]] and was sufficiently [[piety|pious]].\n*Prior to [[0.7]], the cleansing flame you suffer when killing angels was significantly more powerful."}

Locked away in a temple for many years, its bearer is shielded by decades of accumulated prayer.}}\n[[File:Shield_of_the_Gong.png]] '''''the +18 shield of the gong'''''\n\n+18 [[kite shield]]\n\n-5 EV<br>\nrCorr<br>\nrN+<br>\n+40 Will<br>\nMakes very loud [[noise]] (intensity 40) whenever you block\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''shield of the gong'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|1062}}</ref> is an incredibly loud, and therefore dangerous, artefact. While a +18 kite shield ''is'' good at blocking melee and ranged attacks, keep in mind that shields do nothing against [[penetration|piercing]] attacks like [[bolt spell]]s and [[javelin]]s. More importantly, every time you block, you make an intensity 40 noise; using it will attract everything nearby to your position. For reference, it's as loud as an [[alarm trap]], and much louder than both [[Qazlal]]'s storm shield (~20 noise) and regular shouting (12 noise).\n\nThat being said, there ''are'' characters who would like to use this. Qazlal worshippers attract lots of monsters to them, anyway, and a \"little\" more noise can't hurt. In a similar vein, blasters with spells like [[Fire Storm]] already wake the entire dungeon up. It has potential use for careful [[necromancer]]s, as spells like [[Death Channel]] can be great at managing crowds. There are characters which are just plain weak - if the player is very very careful, they can use the shield to overcome enemies they otherwise wouldn't. [[Stair dancing]] is heavily recommended.\n\nYou can also use it as a swapout. \n*Clear the whole level, then use this shield to take out a [[ghost vault]]. \n*Use it to lure enemies away from [[vault]]s at a distance. Examples include the [[Elf]]:3 and [[Zot:5]] end vaults.\n*Loud noises won't mean much in a [[Ziggurat]]. Note that a character doing [[megazig]]s will likely prefer either a highly enchanted [[randart]] [[tower shield]] or an [[orb]] of [[mayhem]] instead.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the shield provided [[electricity resistance]] instead of [[corrosion resistance]]. The [[Storm Queen's shield]] provides rElec in its place.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], its enchantment was +27.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], its enchantment was only +6, and it did not reduce the wearer's EV. This change essentially combined the original shield of the gong with the now-retired shield \"[[Bullseye]].\"\n*Prior to [[0.13]], the shield of the gong also provided a [[spirit shield]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Shields]]"}

Poison levels over 5 are very nasty, and this potion can put you anywhere from yellow poison status to pink and even to red (where it can do 100+ damage before fully running its course). This potion is so toxic that it can even partially ignore poison resistance, affecting you as though you'd just quaffed a [[potion of poison]].\n\n \"That liquid tasted extremely nasty...\"\n\n==History==\nPotions of strong poison were removed in [[0.15]].\n\nPrior to [[0.13]], this potion did nothing to characters with poison resistance.\n\nPrior to [[0.12]], this potion could be thrown with [[Evaporate]] to create clouds of poison gas."}

{"title":"Erolcha","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Erolcha","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of|ogres}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Erolcha the Cunning''' is a [[unique]] [[ogre mage]], notorious for sending players with low [[willpower]] to [[the Abyss]].\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:9-13\n*The [[Orcish Mines]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you see Erolcha, buff up your [[willpower]] -- characters who first meet Erolcha are unlikely to be prepared to survive in the Abyss.\n*You can block her line of fire with summons or other monsters; she might still be able to hit you with a Fireball, but that's often better than being sent to the Abyss.\n*Erolcha has only modest [[HP]] and poor defenses. Hit her hard and she'll fall quickly, but be aware that she can have decent melee damage output if she's carrying a [[giant spiked club]].\n*Despite her description as an \"especially cunning ogre-mage\", she actually has less [[HD]] than actual [[ogre mage]]s, and deals less damage. She appears considerably earlier than normal ogre mages, though.\n**She actually has the same spell set as [[wizard (monster)|wizards]] (though slightly weaker, due to having less HD).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Erolcha did not attack slowly, but dealt 20 base damage in melee. Since she usually carries a giant club, she dealt more damage/turn in melee.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Erolcha could have one of several spell sets:\n** [[Stone Arrow]] (3d12), [[Lightning Bolt]] (3d14), [[Banishment]], [[Invisibility]]\n** [[Force Lance]] (3d10), [[Fireball]] (3d14), [[Paralyse]], [[Blink]]\n** [[Bolt of Cold]] (3d14), [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] (3d23), [[Slow]], [[Haste]]\n:Also, since monsters had weapon penalties, her melee was less threatening. With a giant club, Erolcha attacked at the same speed as in current versions, but with 20 base damage (not 30).\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Erolcha could have [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] instead of [[Force Lance]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Erolcha could cast [[Bolt of Fire]], [[Confuse]], [[Magic Dart]], [[Throw Flame]], [[Sting]], and [[Venom Bolt]]. Also, she had five spell sets instead of three.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Erolcha could cast [[Teleport Self]] and [[Teleport Other]].\n*In an ancient version of Crawl, Erolcha was male."}

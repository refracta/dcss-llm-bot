It shrouds its wearer in darkness, reducing the range of vision. According to legend, it was the gift of Ratri the Goddess of the Night to one of her followers.}}\n[[File:Robe_of_night.png]] '''''the +5 robe of Night'''''\n\n+5 [[robe]]\n\n+40 [[will]]<br>\n[[See Invisible]]<br>\n[[Line of sight]] radius reduced by 25% (final LOS rounded down)<br>\n\n==Desirability==\nFor most species, the '''robe of Night'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|987}}</ref> reduces line of sight by 2 tiles (only 1 tile for [[Kobold]]s). This is clearly useful for [[stab]]bers, as reduced LOS makes it easier to approach [[sleep]]ing enemies.\n\nThose who would wear a robe anyways may also want this item, as it has good enchantment and a nice willpower bonus. Whether the LOS reduction helps or hurts depends on the character: a [[ranged weapon]] user will find it less useful than a caster relying on low-range spells like [[Stone Arrow]]. In any case, you may prefer an armour with elemental resistances and/or higher AC.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.20]], the robe of Night had a +4 enchantment.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the robe of Night granted the ability to turn [[invisible]] and had a +50 [[stealth]] bonus.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], the robe of Night did not grant a passive Darkness effect.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

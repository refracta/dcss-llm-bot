{"title":"Orb spider","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Orb_spider","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Orb spiders''' are obnoxious and dangerous [[list of arachnids|arachnids]] that tend to avoid direct combat with you, lingering at the edge of your [[line of sight]] and hurling [[Orbs of Destruction]] at you whenever you stop pursuing them. Their tendency to appear in areas filled with [[web]] [[trap]]s only makes them more of a threat. They can be found in the [[Spider's Nest]], particularly on the lower floors.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Orb spiders can deal a good amount of damage, but they are quite fragile. Use ranged attacks to kill them fast.\n**[[Poison]] [[dart]]s are very effective, even with 0 Throwing skill. As these spiders are weak to poison, applying only a few darts will inflict a lethal amount of poison.\n*With decent footwork or perhaps a quick [[Blink]], you can dodge their [[Orbs of Destruction]]. Once you've managed that, the orb will take several turns to circle back around for another pass, which may take it into another spider, a wall, or even the orb spider that cast it.\n*[[Summon]]s can be a great way to block their orbs.\n*Orb Spiders have a relatively low amount of hit dice, making them a good target for a [[wand of polymorph]] if you don't have a good ranged weapon.\n*If you have trouble chasing down orb spiders, use [[curare]]-tipped [[dart]]s to slow them down.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], orb spiders only had 7 [[HD]] and their bites did 5 damage.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], orb spider corpses gave inedible [[chunk]]s.\n*Orb spiders were introduced in [[0.11]].\n\n[[Category:Arachnid]]"}

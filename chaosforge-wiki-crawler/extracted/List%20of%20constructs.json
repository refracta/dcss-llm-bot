{"title":"List of constructs","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_constructs","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n'''Constructs''' are monsters which, although technically [[nonliving]], are animated through magical means. Like all nonliving monsters, they are immune to [[poison]], [[asphyxiation]], and [[negative energy]]. Golems tend to have many elemental resistances, though many are vulnerable to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] and [[Shatter]].\n\nAlthough similar in some ways to [[statue]]s, constructs are set apart by their ability to move.\n\n==Golems==\n'''Golems''' are big, hulking, mindless constructs that are generally rather slow but pack quite a punch. Some of the more powerful ones have high AC, and they all come with complete immunity to anything subject to [[willpower]] and varying levels of resistance to elemental magic.\n\n*{{monsterlink|Blazeheart golem}}- A construct [[Summon Blazeheart Golem|summoned]] into existence. It damages itself each time it attacks, and once killed, it will soon [[blazeheart core|explode]]. If not adjacent to the player, it will power down and do nothing.\n*{{monsterlink|Ushabti}}- Servants built to assist [[list of mummies|mummies]] in their afterlives. They guard their masters' [[Tomb]] by spewing clouds of [[miasma]].\n*{{monsterlink|Saltling}}- Small, zippy golems made from the only material available in the [[Desolation of Salt]]. They're fragile, but there's a lot of them...\n*{{monsterlink|Peacekeeper}}- Swift, [[manticore]]-like enforcers that roam the Desolation of Salt and support their allies in hunting down intruders.\n*{{monsterlink|Toenail golem}}- Bizarre creations that are rarely seen, even for golems. They're fairly easy to take down.\n*{{LightMagenta|8}} [[File:Spellforged servitor (monster).png]] '''[[Spellforged servitor (monster)|Spellforged servitor]]''' - Experienced mages may [[Spellforged Servitor|summon]] a construct that can cast their most [[Conjurations|destructive spell]].\n*{{monsterlink|Iron golem}}- Made of solid iron, these golems are slow, but very strong and extremely durable.\n*{{monsterlink|Crystal guardian}}- Crystalline sentinels who pelt intruders with ricocheting bolts of [[fire]] and [[cold]].\n*{{monsterlink|Electric golem}}- The most powerful golem, these roam the [[Realm of Zot]] and annihilate the unprepared with [[Lightning Bolt|bolts of lightning]] and electrical attacks. They are also much faster than other golems, immune to Lee's Rapid Deconstruction, and [[blink]] constantly.\n\n===Variant Golems===\n{{Red|8}} [[File:Flesh golem.png]] '''[[Cigotuvi's Fleshworks#Miniboss: Flesh Golem|Flesh golem]]''' - An earlier work of the master flesh-mage Cigotuvi that diligently guards his [[Cigotuvi's Fleshworks|laboratory]]. Though made of flesh, it is as powerful as an [[iron golem]].\n\n==Gargoyles==\n{{flavour|“Their innumerable sculptures of demons and dragons assumed a lugubrious aspect. The restless light of the flame made them move to the eye. There were griffins which had the air of laughing, gargoyles which one fancied one heard yelping, salamanders which puffed at the fire, tarasques which sneezed in the smoke. And among the monsters thus roused from their sleep of stone by this flame, by this noise, there was one who walked about, and who was seen, from time to time, to pass across the glowing face of the pile, like a bat in front of a candle.”<br>\n-Victor Hugo, _The Hunchback of Notre-Dame_, 10, ch. IV. 1831.<br>\ntrans. Isabel F. Hapgood}}\n'''Gargoyles''' are similar to golems in construction, but possess an actual intelligence. This allows them to wield weapons and behave less mechanically, but also renders them susceptible to [[Hexes]]. Not only are they capable with [[Maces & Flails]], but they can also hurl portions of themselves at opponents.\n\n*{{LightGrey|9}} [[File:Gargoyle (monster).png]] '''[[Gargoyle (monster)|Gargoyle]]''' - Predatory statuary that swoop through [[the Dungeon]] in search of victims to pelt with [[Stone Arrow]]s.\n*{{monsterlink|Molten gargoyle}}- A hateful grotesque composed entirely of molten stone, giving its attacks a [[fire|fiery]] nature.\n*{{monsterlink|War gargoyle}}- Swift-flying metal warriors which swarm their foes and rain down [[Metal Splinters|deadly shrapnel]].\n\n==Other Constructs==\n*{{monsterlink|Battlesphere}}- [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere|Conjured]] attack drones that fire unblockable barrages of energy to supplement their creator's [[Conjurations]].\n*{{monsterlink|Dancing weapon}}- Weapons [[Tukima's Dance|enchanted]] to attack under their own power. Larger ones hit harder, but move more slowly.\n\n==Retired Constructs==\n*{{monsterlink|Wood golem}}- The weakest variety of golem. Unlike its stronger brethren, it burned easily.\n*{{monsterlink|Clay golem}}- A basic golem. Big, but slow and easy to smash.\n*{{monsterlink|Stone golem}}- A significant step up from the clay golem in power and durability.\n*{{monsterlink|Crystal golem}}- A durable golem made of solid crystal. Variants that can fire bolts of [[Bolt of Cold|cold]] and [[Bolt of Fire|fire]] appeared in certain vaults.\n*{{monsterlink|Metal gargoyle}}- A slower, sturdier gargoyle, most often found roosting in the [[hell]]ish [[The Iron City of Dis|fortress]] of [[Dispater]].\n*{{monsterlink|Guardian golem}}- A [[Summon Guardian Golem|summoned]] golem that protects its allies, and explodes when killed.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], guardian golems were replaced by blazeheart golems.\n*The Desolation of Salt and its resident golems were added in [[0.19]].\n*Ushabtiu were added in [[0.16]].\n*[[0.14]] removed clay and stone golems and added guardian golems and spellforged servitors. Crystal golems were replaced with crystal guardians, and metal gargoyles were replaced with war gargoyles.\n*Wood golems were removed in [[0.12]].\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

After <code>1d2</code> turns, an [[eldritch tentacle]] emerges.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-summoning.cc|1186}}</ref> The gateway spawns in a random location in [[LOS]] that's 1. on floor or shallow water and 2. not adjacent to any walls. The tentacle can extend up to 4 tiles from the gateway.\n\nHigher [[spell power]] makes the tentacle remain friendly longer. The tentacle stays friendly for <code>(1d<power> + 5d(<power> + 1)) / 6 - 1d4</code> turns,<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|timed-effects.cc|900}}</ref> or until the gateway is closed and tentacle severed. There is a small chance that a tentacle will grow enraged (hostile to the player) after a portion of its duration has been expired.\n\nThe portal itself closes after a while, severing the tentacle. A severed tentacle is neutral, and may harm adjacent creatures (including the player) while it thrashes and eventually dies.\n\nThere can only be one such portal open at a time. This means that if you cast the spell, enemies who know the spell will be unable to cast it until yours closes (and vice versa). Similarly, if there's a portal opened by a [[Zot trap]], you are unable to cast this spell.\n\nEldritch tentacles are not [[summon]]s. They cannot be [[abjuration|abjured]] or affected by [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]], and will not disappear if you leave the floor. Like summons, tentacles can only attack enemies while they are inside your [[line of sight]].\n\n==Strategy==\nEldritch tentacles are durable, powerful, fast, and capable of hitting the average monster for up to 70 HP of [[chaos|chaotic]] damage per attack, inflicting all manner of extra effects. Enemies may be [[haste]]d or [[berserk]]ed, but the tentacle will often manage, anyway.\n\nTentacles come with just about every resistance in the book. This makes Malign Gateway a way to take out [[orbs of fire]]; an OOF can't do anything to a tentacle.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Although extremely powerful, the tentacle is not summoned instantaneously. Up to 2 turns will pass before the tentacle emerges from the portal, so plan accordingly.\n*The portal can open in any suitable location in your [[line of sight]]. Try casting the spell in such places where the portal can only appear between you and your enemies.\n*The spell requires an open area to cast. An attempt to cast in a narrow corridor will fail, but it won't waste a turn.\n*It is recommended to not actively remain close to the end of the tentacle as this spellâ€™s duration ticks, as an enraged tentacle is extremely dangerous, inflicting multiple high damage chaos-branded attacks every turn.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], the effects of the [[chaos]] brand were changed, thus changing the effectiveness of the eldritch tentacle.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], casting Malign Gateway wasn't very loud (casting [[noise]] of 6).\n*Prior to [[0.28]], you could enter into the [[portal]] of an empty Malign Gateway to [[blink]] and take minor damage.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the tentacle could attack outside of the player's [[line of sight]]. Also, it arrived later after the gateway was opened: it required 2-4 turns instead of 1-2 turns.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], casting this spell had a 20% chance of causing 1d3 points of temporary [[Intelligence]] damage.\n*Malign Gateway was added in [[0.8]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

{"title":"Potion of beneficial mutation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Potion_of_beneficial_mutation","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n{{item\n |itemtype=Potion\n |name=Potion of beneficial mutation\n}}\n\n{{flavour|A potion which gives you a supposedly good mutation.}}\n\n[[Quaff]]ing a '''potion of beneficial mutation''' immediately gives you a single [[mutation]] from the list of [[good mutations]]. This can include a boost to one of your stats, free [[resistance]]s, and many more things that are (usually) helpful. Beware that some good mutations come with negative aspects, that piles of good mutations may make curing [[bad mutations]] much more difficult, and that each mutation you add on renders you slightly more vulnerable to [[silver]] damage.\n\nNote that [[ghoul]]s cannot mutate and [[rot]] instead, reducing maximum [[HP]] and possibly taking a temporary hit to [[stats]] as well.\n\n'''Having the [[Good_mutations#Mutation_Resistance|Mutation Resistance mutation]] causes this potion to fail at least 67% of the time''' (100% at Rank 3).  Additionally, this potion's effect may fail due to sources of [[mutation resistance]] that are not from equipment (such as being a [[halfling]]) or physiological conflicts (attempting to give [[naga]]s talons or [[tengu]] fangs, for example). Followers of [[Zin]] lose 10 [[piety]] if they knowingly drink this potion, even if Zin (or another source) blocks the mutation.\n\n==History==\n*Potions of cure mutation and [[potions of beneficial mutation]] were merged into [[potions of mutation]] in [[0.20]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Zin followers would only lose piety if they gained a mutation.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], [[Vampire]]s below satiated got rotted by the potion.\n*Added in [[0.13]], replacing the [[potions of gain strength]], [[potion of gain dexterity|dexterity]], and [[potion of gain intelligence|intelligence]].\n\n{{potions}}"}

The resultant steam is then transmuted into a large cloud, the type of which varies from potion to potion. Of course, the volatile potion must be thrown immediately for the spell to work.}}\n\nThe [[Evaporate]] spell allows the caster to throw a magically heated potion that explodes into a cloud of up to 3x3 squares. The exact effect produced depends entirely on the kind of potion used (see list below). As many of the \"bad\" potions you can find produce powerful effects, this spell works very well alongside [[Fulsome Distillation]].\n\n{| border=1\n ! Potion !! Cloud (Odds) !!

The duration of the cloud increases with [[spell power]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nEvaporate is the cheap swiss army knife of toxic clouds. It's usually used by [[transmuter]]s in conjunction with the [[Fulsome Distillation]] spell, which provides ideal \"ammo\". \n\nThe spell will duplicate the far more difficult [[Mephitic Cloud]] or [[Poisonous Cloud]], or produce dreaded [[Miasma]] in the same quantities (Miasma's poison/slow combination can take out Orc Knights with a single use)! Even clouds of steam can soften or kill snakes and hobgoblins or fleeing enemies, and later it can cut off LOS to dangerous ranged attackers or [[orc priest]]s. A deadly one-two punch is to lead off with a mephitic cloud to confuse opponents, and as the clouds dissipate, replace them with poison or miasma for the victims to mill in and out of. And occasional clouds of flame or stranger stuff is nothing to sneer at.\n\nMutagenic fog is probably best avoided; it provides bad mutations for you and ''repeated'' [[polymorph]]s for monsters.\n\n==History==\n*Evaporate was removed in [[0.12]].\n*Prior to [[0.10]], Evaporate would always produce a 3x3 cloud. It was changed to produce smaller clouds in later versions of the game.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], you could not [[blink]] into dangerous [[cloud]]s, making Evaporate an excellent way to help steer where an uncontrolled blink would place you.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

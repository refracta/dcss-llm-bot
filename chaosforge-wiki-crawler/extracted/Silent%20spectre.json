{"title":"Silent spectre","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Silent_spectre","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Silent spectres''' are weak, insubstantial [[undead]] that permanently radiate a 12-tile [[aura]] of [[Silence]]. This prevents use of [[spell]]s, [[god]] abilities, and [[scroll]]s. They can be found in [[Tartarus]], rarely inside [[the Abyss]], in Tartarus-themed [[Ziggurat]] floors, and in various themed [[vault]]s.\n\nSilent spectres cannot use stairs.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Silent spectres aren't a threat by themselves, but they make other monsters a lot more threatening. Most [[demon]]s are unaffected by silence, and are free to [[torment]] or cast other spells. Even if you aren't a caster, you'll lose access to many emergency tools, which makes everything more dangerous.\n*Remember that silence doesn't prevent use of weapons, [[evocable]]s, [[potion]]s, or natural [[abilities]]. \n*Their presence is never a surprise - their aura extends well past your [[LOS]]. At the same time, this makes it nearly impossible to kill using spells. You'll need a 'lasting' effect (e.g. [[Summoning]] spells) or some other means of dealing damage to kill a spectre.\n**If you're a caster heading into [[extended]], [[Throwing]] and/or [[Evocations]] can be good investments. Penetrating attacks ([[javelin]]s, [[lightning rod]]) or AOE attacks ([[tin of tremorstones]]) are great at sniping spectres through other enemies. \n*The silence can be used to your advantage - proper spellcasters, including all [[lich]]es, ''are'' affected by silence.\n*For [[Mega-Zig]] characters, Tartarus floors are one of the most deadly floors, almost entirely due to silent spectres. By the 10th Zig, you'll often be silenced on entry, putting you on a time limit before [[Necromutation]] runs out. It's important to buff yourself before entering each floor. Depending on the situation, you can use javelins, evocables, enter [[Tree Form]], or unwield [[distortion]] to try and not die.\n\n==History==\n*Silent spectres were introduced in [[0.8]]."}

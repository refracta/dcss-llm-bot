The added penetration allows it to shine in corridors, where only 1 enemy may hit you, but you get to hit multiple enemies for full damage. It also lets you snipe backline enemies without using [[Dimensional Bullseye]]. While a longbow or [[triple crossbow]] of a different brand may be stronger against rElec enemies, the penetration can make this bow worth using as a swapout.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.24]], the storm bow gained the penetration brand.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], the storm bow would occasionally create rain [[cloud]]s around the wielder, which could turn normal terrain into shallow [[water]] and shallow water into deep water for up to 100 turns.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Bows]]"}

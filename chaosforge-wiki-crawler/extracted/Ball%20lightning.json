{"title":"Ball lightning","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ball_lightning","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ball lightning''' is a weather phenomenon normally unheard of in subterranean [[Dungeon]]s. It is attracted to the enemies of its conjurer and explodes on contact, dealing heavy [[electricity]] damage to everything within a 2-3 tile radius. They are almost exclusively created by [[Conjure Ball Lightning]], though a few [[vault]]s have ball lightnings in them.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Electricity resistance renders it a whole lot less terrifying.\n*Although it's nearly impossible to outrun, you can safely detonate ball lightning from a distance by inflicting at least 1 point of damage. It is immune to all forms of elemental damage, but practically any character can throw a [[stone]] or cast [[Magic Dart]].\n*Ball lightning is [[Conjurations|conjured]] into existence, not [[summon]]ed. Effects like [[Abjuration]] and [[Okawaru]]'s ally prevention won't affect it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], \"friendly\" ball lightnings would home onto you if there were no valid targets.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], it had resistance to [[Tornado]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], all ball lightnings dealt 3d20 damage, instead of being dependent on [[spell power]].\n*In [[0.25]], ball lightning AI was changed to work like [[Foxfire]]. Previously, ball lightnings would home onto nearby targets it didn't see, so it was easier to hit things from outside [[LOS]]. It could also home onto [[plant]]s and other harmless \"enemies\".\n*Prior to [[0.22]], it had wind resistance instead of tornado resistance.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], ball lightnings were permanently confused and would move erratically."}

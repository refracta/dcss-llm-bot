But most things that clarity protects against can also be blocked with sufficient [[willpower]] (the [[Confuse]] and [[Sleep]] spells, mesmerise, fear) or rPois ([[Mephitic Cloud]]). Having clarity can help if you don't have these, but since sources of clarity are so rare, it's usually more of a bonus than anything. [[Mummies]] find it particularly valuable, since they can't drink a [[potion of curing]] to end confusion.\n\nClarity is the only way to prevent confusion from [[tarantella]]s, and one of the few ways to prevent sleep from [[dream sheep]].\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], clarity once again blocks all sources of unintentional berserk. Also, the [[autumn katana]] lost clarity.\n*In [[0.27]].1, clarity does not protect against going berserk when using items with the berserkitis intrinsic (such as the [[zealot's sword]] or the [[necklace of Bloodlust]]).\n*Prior to [[0.19]], clarity did not protect against fear and sleep.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], clarity made potions of ambrosia useless. The [[amulet of clarity]] was also removed."}

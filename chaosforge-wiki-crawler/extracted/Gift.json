These gifts tend to reflect the overall theme and character of the gift-giving deity, and are typically only rewarded to pious characters (i.e. those who have acquired a significant amount of [[piety]]) with some exceptions.\n\nAlthough all the various powers and abilities a god provides his or her followers might well be viewed as \"gifts\" as well, ''Dungeon Crawl'' vernacular generally only refers to awarded [[items]] as gifts, although this too comes with exceptions and alternate uses.\n\n''See also [[Gift Timeout]] for more regarding these types of gifts''\n\n==Gods which award gifts==\n*[[Beogh]] does not provide item gifts to the ''player'', but will occasionally give weapons or armor to one of the player's particularly worthy followers. It also gives the player ability to hand out such gifts themselves\n\n*[[Jiyva]] the Shapeless gives [[mutations]], including some that are [[Jiyva mutations|exclusive to its followers]]. It will also unlock the rune vault at the bottom of the [[Slime Pits]] for followers at maximum piety.\n\n*[[Kikubaaqudgha]] grants [[randart]] [[spell book]]s containing [[necromancy]] spells at piety levels 1* and 3*. At maximum piety, it will grant a follower either the [[Necronomicon]] or allow them to permanently brand their weapon with [[pain]] at its [[altar]].\n\n*[[Nemelex Xobeh]] will gift faithful followers many [[deck]]s of cards, as its domain and powers are centered around such. This gifting is notable in that it begins at lower levels of piety and increases as piety is gained.\n\n*At medium piety, [[Okawaru]] begins gifting [[ammo]], and at high piety, it gives [[weapon]]s and [[armour]].\n\n*[[Sif Muna]] will gift very pious followers with many spell books.\n\n*Much like Okawaru, [[Trog]] the Wrathful will gift [[ammo]] and fierce [[weapon]]ry.\n\n*[[Vehumet]] will periodically gift the opportunity to memorize various destructive spells.\n\n*[[Xom]] the Unpredictable, as its title suggests, will occasionally gift items, which vary widely in type, amount, and quality.\n\n*[[Yredelemnul]] does not gift items but will provide followers \"gifts\" of [[undead]] servants\n\n*[[The Shining One]] will grant followers the one-time ability to brand their weapon with [[holy wrath]] at one of its altars.\n\n==Gods which do not provide gifts==\n*[[Ashenzari]]\n*[[Cheibriados]]\n*[[Dithmenos]]\n*[[Elyvilon]]\n*[[Fedhas Madash]]\n*[[Gozag Ym Sagoz]]\n*[[Lugonu]]\n*[[Makhleb]]\n*[[Qazlal Stormbringer]]\n*[[Ru]]\n*[[Zin]]\n\n[[Category:Religion]]"}

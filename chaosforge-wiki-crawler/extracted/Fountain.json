{"title":"Fountain","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fountain","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n'''Fountains''' are a [[Dungeon]] feature often found in many [[vault]]s. They are mostly decorative. \n\nWater-filled fountains act as proper [[water]] tiles for many purposes. They allow [[aquatic]] creatures to swim, extinguish [[sticky flame]], and generate [[Cloud#Steam|steam]] and [[Cloud#Freezing vapour|freezing vapour]] when [[fire]] and [[ice]] spells are cast over them. Fountains won't have any of penalties from [[shallow water]], however.\n\n==List of Fountains==\n[[File:Fountain.png]] Fountain of clear blue water\n{{crawlquote|A decorative fountain, flowing with clear water.}}\n\n[[File:Sparkling fountain.png]] Sparkling fountain\n{{crawlquote|A decorative fountain, flowing with brightly sparkling water.}}\n\n[[File:Blood fountain.png]] Fountain of blood\n{{crawlquote|A decorative fountain, spurting with foul-looking blood.}}\n\n[[File:Dry fountain.png]] Dry fountain\n{{crawlquote|A dried-up fountain that has seen better days.}}\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|water-filled fountains will be treated as regular floor tiles.}}\n*Prior to [[0.15]], [[Mimic|mimics]] could disguise themselves as fountains.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], players could [[quaff]] from fountains for various effects.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], fountains dried by the player would eventually flow again given enough time (1% chance every 20 turns), becoming whatever kind of fountain they were beforehand.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], drinking all the fountains in [[Elven Halls]]:5 would restore [[teleport control]].\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

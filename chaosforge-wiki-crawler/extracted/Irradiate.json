{"title":"Irradiate","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Irradiate","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Irradiate''' is a level 5 [[Conjurations]]/[[Alchemy]] spell that blasts all tiles adjacent to you with pure magical energy.\n\n==Useful Info==\nIrradiate deals <code>3d(11.66 + power/6)</code> damage<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|spl-damage.cc|1797}}</ref> to adjacent targets. Monsters hit by this spell have a 50% chance to receive the [[malmutate]] status (-8 [[AC]] and -25% [[HD]]), unless immune. Damage from this spell is irresistible and unavoidable, but it's still reduced by [[AC]]. \n\nEach casting of Irradiate afflicts the caster with 1250 - 2000 points of [[magical contamination]].\n\n==Strategy==\nIrradiate is irresistible, never misses, deals high damage, and inflicts a strong debuff on enemies. For casters and hybrids who can afford the somewhat awkward spell schooling, this is a good spell to have. Sometimes you'll be forced to fight enemies in melee range, where this spell can really shine.\n\n[[Hexes|Hexers]] have a special synergy with Irradiate. While it isn't a hex, the malmutated status lowers [[HD]], which also lowers [[willpower]]. The AC reduction also helps with using [[Short Blades]] or other quick weapons.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Irradiate can be cast 2-3 times in a row safely, assuming you don't miscast and have no contamination to begin with. Having a light grey {{LightGrey|Contam}} means that the next successful cast could bring you to a dangerous level of glow.\n**If you accidentally cast Irradiate one time too many, quaffing a [[potion of cancellation]] should drop you back into the safe zone. Whether it's worth using up the potion to do so, however, is questionable.\n\n==Monster Version==\nThe monster version of this spell inflicts heavy [[magic contamination]], 2000 - 3000 points,<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|spl-damage.cc|1839}}</ref> on the player instead of direct malmutation. It also has no ill effect on the caster. It is otherwise similar to the player version, including the effect on other monsters.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Irradiate was a level 5 Conjuration/[[Transmutation]] spell. Notably, Transmutations [[miscast]]s would double your magic contamination, so it was more dangerous to miscast.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Irradiate had a 100% chance to malmutate targets.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the spell dealt more damage (<code>3d(13.33 + power/6)</code>), and the caster only recieved 1000 - 1500 points of contamination.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the spell ignored [[AC]] and had an explosion [[noise]], but dealt slightly less damage (<code>6d(5 + power/12)</code>). Contamination in general also decayed slower.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the contamination caused was significantly higher (1500 to 3000 points).\n*Irradiate was added in [[0.16]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

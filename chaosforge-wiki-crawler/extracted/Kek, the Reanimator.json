This page probably contains spoilers.*\n\n# Introduction\n\n*Hi there! Feel free to comment in any way - opinions, good or bad, and questions about the text, gameplay or anything else are welcomed!*\n\n# Diary\n\nThis is (yet one more) Kek, a good character of mine. I played with him for almost (non-consecutive) 5 hours. This may not be a good character to some's standarts, but it is for me and could be for other new players. I'll tell his story below. You can read it if you're a curious [Crawl](/Crawl \"Crawl\") player or if you're just a common nerd - if you like the sound of what you read, do check [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup](/Dungeon_Crawl_Stone_Soup \"Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup\") on Sourceforge, it's the awesomest game there is.\n\nThis Kek got WAY lucky on the start, and you can see on his sheet down below that he found many nice treasures, which was no doubtly compensated by a very tough [dungeon](/Dungeon \"Dungeon\") - I remember a bunch of [orcs](/Orc \"Orc\") almost killing me on the first level! Orcs! On first level! His luck did tend to the sinister - I play with 100% random characters, and the game came up with a [Sludge Elf](/Sludge_Elf \"Sludge Elf\") [Death Knight](/Death_Knight_\\(background\\) \"Death Knight (background)\") for me. No god, a nice selection of spells for the future and a race that's not that hungry made a good combination for starters.\n\nAnd so the journey of a dark art's initiate would begin.\n\nAs I said, this Kek had quite some luck early on in the game (only thing that actually can get me farther in the quest for the [Orb](/Orb \"Orb\"), actually...) and got some nice items soon: +3 [gloves](/Gloves \"Gloves\") of strengh, rings of [wizardry](/Ring_of_wizardry \"Ring of wizardry\") and [sustenance](/Ring_of_sustenance \"Ring of sustenance\") (is there a best combination for a mage?), a [ring of life protection](/Ring_of_life_protection \"Ring of life protection\") (that could be easily put on for dealing with those damnable [undead](/Undead \"Undead\")) and the +2 leather armour of Paranoia (quite a powerful [artifact](/Artifact \"Artifact\") to be found on dungeon level 4!).\n\nThere were some very good [throwable weapons](/Ranged_Weapons#Thrown-Only_Weapons \"Ranged Weapons\") too: a [dagger](/Dagger \"Dagger\") of [draining](/Draining \"Draining\") and a [hand axe](/Hand_axe \"Hand axe\") of [chopping](/Chopping \"Chopping\") and another of [venom](/Venom \"Venom\") - due to their magic, I used them for melee combat too for quite a while, until finding myself a [vampiric](/Vampiric \"Vampiric\") [lajatang](/Lajatang \"Lajatang\")! I don't remember seeing this weapon before, but it just seemed right to use it - besides being fairly powerful on it's own, Kek the Reanimator was already using it's dark powers for sucking life and causing others pain, so why not keep the theme with a vampiric weapon? It was even better for the fact that I could still throw my other powerful magic weapons, so choosing the lajatang wouldn't make my other weapons obsolete.\n\nMany good [books](/Spell_book \"Spell book\") (so many I didn't use them all) also provided for the repertoire of spells: [Vampiric Draining](/Vampiric_Draining \"Vampiric Draining\"), [Regeneration](/Regeneration \"Regeneration\"), [Detect Curse](/Detect_Curse \"Detect Curse\").... Of course, any half-decent dark evil mage can't be seen on [melee](/Melee \"Melee\") all of the time - it just looks too swashbuckly! So a [staff of wizardry](/Staff_of_wizardry \"Staff of wizardry\") would help me keep the pose in-between close quarter fighting - while also taking my novice [mage](/Necromancy \"Necromancy\") apprentice to the heights of the arcane realm, of course! With it, even the first level [pain](/Pain \"Pain\") spell was devastating, which remained my default [ranged attack](/Ranged_attack \"Ranged attack\") thoughout the game.\n\nI'm not a very priest-like player, so I just don't have much patience for gods. I usually just find an entrance to the [Ecumenical Temple](/Ecumenical_Temple \"Ecumenical Temple\") and adore the chaotic [Xom](/Xom \"Xom\"). He's so so, as much a giver as a taker, but at least he does everything without me needing to intervene, which is nice enough as far as it goes for me as a player. But this Kek found an altar of [the Loreminder](/Sif_Muna \"Sif Muna\"), right on the first levels. I read its description and couldn't see why any mage wouldn't want a god like that, so I converted myself. Not that I used the powers very much, but the [evocations](/Evocations \"Evocations\") to replenish [mana](/Magic_points \"Magic points\") and to forget [spells](/Spells \"Spells\") (and regain their memorisation levels) did help once or twice.\n\nBut then I found it - a blueish tile icon on the map grid. I looked at it, draw by the enchantation of a [miscellaneous item](/Evocable_items#Miscellaneous_Items \"Evocable items\"). I picked it up. The \"a [crystal ball](/Crystal_ball \"Crystal ball\")\" message on the screen was alone enough to take my breath away! The curiosity! Kek stared into it, only to know that it would be useless without a monster around. All right, I found a monster (duh!) and stared at it again, and I simply saw the monster. Hm, nothing really impressive here. I still don't think I know exactly how crystal balls work, but it never crossed my mind to [identify](/Identify \"Identify\") it - I simply concluded that it would need to be used with a toughter monster. An illusionist, maybe, for the ball's power to see through the falseness. That's the dumb me writing.\n\nI stepped down into the eleventh level without knowing it would be my last. I found an eight-headed [hydra](/Hydra \"Hydra\") zombie just as I stepped down the stairs. Lucky it was far away. Being [stealthy](/Stealth \"Stealth\"), I went up the stairs again, not ready to fight an enemy with unknown power. I descended again in a different place, only to find a REAL eight-headed hydra chasing me! But did I tremble? Yes I did, and started looking at my full [pack](/Inventory \"Inventory\") to find a good strategy for eliminating the stunning beast (which, by the way, has a really beautiful medievesque rhyme poem in it's description, be sure to check it out). And there it was, on the my pack's bottom: the crystal ball. I picked it up, and I knew it would work this time. If it wouldn't work with a [hydra](/Hydra \"Hydra\"), it would work with nothing else.\n\nAnd against me, it did work. Even with the inventory full of ways for victory or escape, Kek was lured by the gem's beauty and could not take his eyes off it even as the monster's eight heads tore his flesh apart...\n\n# Character sheet\n\n```\n Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup version 0.4.5 (crawl-ref) character file.\n\n9615 Kek the Reanimator (level 11, -6/63 (66) HPs)\n             Began as a Sludge Elf Death Knight on Apr 29, 2009.\n             Was an Elder of Sif Muna.\n             Mangled by an eight-headed hydra (9 damage)\n             ... on Level 13 of the Dungeon on May 4, 2009.\n             The game lasted 04:45:03 (23441 turns).\n\nKek the Reanimator (Sludge Elf Death Knight)    Turns: 23441, Time: 04:45:03\n\nHP  -6/63 (66)   AC  9     Str 16      Exp: 11/13328 (372), need: 5211\nMP  24/24        EV  2     Int 15      God: Sif Muna ****\nGold 286         SH  0     Dex 15      Spells:  7 memorised,  0 levels left\n\nRes.Fire  : . . .

I played with him for almost (non-consecutive) 5 hours. This may not be a good character to some's standarts, but it is for me and could be for other new players. I'll tell his story below. You can read it if you're a curious <a href=\"/Crawl\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crawl\">Crawl</a> player or if you're just a common nerd - if you like the sound of what you read, do check <a href=\"/Dungeon_Crawl_Stone_Soup\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup\">Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</a> on Sourceforge, it's the awesomest game there is.\n</p><p>This Kek got WAY lucky on the start, and you can see on his sheet down below that he found many nice treasures, which was no doubtly compensated by a very tough <a href=\"/Dungeon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dungeon\">dungeon</a> - I remember a bunch of <a href=\"/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orcs</a> almost killing me on the first level! Orcs! On first level! His luck did tend to the sinister - I play with 100% random characters, and the game came up with a <a href=\"/Sludge_Elf\" title=\"Sludge Elf\">Sludge Elf</a> <a href=\"/Death_Knight_(background)\" title=\"Death Knight (background)\">Death Knight</a> for me. No god, a nice selection of spells for the future and a race that's not that hungry made a good combination for starters.\n</p><p>And so the journey of a dark art's initiate would begin.\n</p><p>As I said, this Kek had quite some luck early on in the game (only thing that actually can get me farther in the quest for the <a href=\"/Orb\" title=\"Orb\">Orb</a>, actually...) and got some nice items soon: +3 <a href=\"/Gloves\" title=\"Gloves\">gloves</a> of strengh, rings of <a href=\"/Ring_of_wizardry\" title=\"Ring of wizardry\">wizardry</a> and <a href=\"/Ring_of_sustenance\" title=\"Ring of sustenance\">sustenance</a> (is there a best combination for a mage?), a <a href=\"/Ring_of_life_protection\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ring of life protection\">ring of life protection</a> (that could be easily put on for dealing with those damnable <a href=\"/Undead\" title=\"Undead\">undead</a>) and the +2 leather armour of Paranoia (quite a powerful <a href=\"/Artifact\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Artifact\">artifact</a> to be found on dungeon level 4!).\n</p><p>There were some very good <a href=\"/Ranged_Weapons#Thrown-Only_Weapons\" title=\"Ranged Weapons\">throwable weapons</a> too: a <a href=\"/Dagger\" title=\"Dagger\">dagger</a> of <a href=\"/Draining\" title=\"Draining\">draining</a> and a <a href=\"/Hand_axe\" title=\"Hand axe\">hand axe</a> of <a href=\"/Chopping\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chopping\">chopping</a> and another of <a href=\"/Venom\" title=\"Venom\">venom</a> - due to their magic, I used them for melee combat too for quite a while, until finding myself a <a href=\"/Vampiric\" title=\"Vampiric\">vampiric</a> <a href=\"/Lajatang\" title=\"Lajatang\">lajatang</a>! I don't remember seeing this weapon before, but it just seemed right to use it - besides being fairly powerful on it's own, Kek the Reanimator was already using it's dark powers for sucking life and causing others pain, so why not keep the theme with a vampiric weapon? It was even better for the fact that I could still throw my other powerful magic weapons, so choosing the lajatang wouldn't make my other weapons obsolete.\n</p><p>Many good <a href=\"/Spell_book\" title=\"Spell book\">books</a> (so many I didn't use them all) also provided for the repertoire of spells: <a href=\"/Vampiric_Draining\" title=\"Vampiric Draining\">Vampiric Draining</a>, <a href=\"/Regeneration\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Regeneration\">Regeneration</a>, <a href=\"/Detect_Curse\" title=\"Detect Curse\">Detect Curse</a>.... Of course, any half-decent dark evil mage can't be seen on <a href=\"/Melee\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Melee\">melee</a> all of the time - it just looks too swashbuckly! So a <a href=\"/Staff_of_wizardry\" title=\"Staff of wizardry\">staff of wizardry</a> would help me keep the pose in-between close quarter fighting - while also taking my novice <a href=\"/Necromancy\" title=\"Necromancy\">mage</a> apprentice to the heights of the arcane realm, of course! With it, even the first level <a href=\"/Pain\" title=\"Pain\">pain</a> spell was devastating, which remained my default <a href=\"/Ranged_attack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ranged attack\">ranged attack</a> thoughout the game.\n</p><p>I'm not a very priest-like player, so I just don't have much patience for gods. I usually just find an entrance to the <a href=\"/Ecumenical_Temple\" title=\"Ecumenical Temple\">Ecumenical Temple</a> and adore the chaotic <a href=\"/Xom\" title=\"Xom\">Xom</a>. He's so so, as much a giver as a taker, but at least he does everything without me needing to intervene, which is nice enough as far as it goes for me as a player. But this Kek found an altar of <a href=\"/Sif_Muna\" title=\"Sif Muna\">the Loreminder</a>, right on the first levels. I read its description and couldn't see why any mage wouldn't want a god like that, so I converted myself. Not that I used the powers very much, but the <a href=\"/Evocations\" title=\"Evocations\">evocations</a> to replenish <a href=\"/Magic_points\" title=\"Magic points\">mana</a> and to forget <a href=\"/Spells\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spells\">spells</a> (and regain their memorisation levels) did help once or twice.\n</p><p>But then I found it - a blueish tile icon on the map grid. I looked at it, draw by the enchantation of a <a href=\"/Evocable_items#Miscellaneous_Items\" title=\"Evocable items\">miscellaneous item</a>. I picked it up. The \"a <a href=\"/Crystal_ball\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crystal ball\">crystal ball</a>\" message on the screen was alone enough to take my breath away! The curiosity! Kek stared into it, only to know that it would be useless without a monster around. All right, I found a monster (duh!) and stared at it again, and I simply saw the monster. Hm, nothing really impressive here. I still don't think I know exactly how crystal balls work, but it never crossed my mind to <a href=\"/Identify\" title=\"Identify\">identify</a> it - I simply concluded that it would need to be used with a toughter monster. An illusionist, maybe, for the ball's power to see through the falseness. That's the dumb me writing.\n</p><p>I stepped down into the eleventh level without knowing it would be my last. I found an eight-headed <a href=\"/Hydra\" title=\"Hydra\">hydra</a> zombie just as I stepped down the stairs. Lucky it was far away. Being <a href=\"/Stealth\" title=\"Stealth\">stealthy</a>, I went up the stairs again, not ready to fight an enemy with unknown power. I descended again in a different place, only to find a REAL eight-headed hydra chasing me! But did I tremble? Yes I did, and started looking at my full <a href=\"/Inventory\" title=\"Inventory\">pack</a> to find a good strategy for eliminating the stunning beast (which, by the way, has a really beautiful medievesque rhyme poem in it's description, be sure to check it out). And there it was, on the my pack's bottom: the crystal ball. I picked it up, and I knew it would work this time. If it wouldn't work with a <a href=\"/Hydra\" title=\"Hydra\">hydra</a>, it would work with nothing else.\n</p><p>And against me, it did work. Even with the inventory full of ways for victory or escape, Kek was lured by the gem's beauty and could not take his eyes off it even as the monster's eight heads tore his flesh apart...\n</p>\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Character_sheet\">Character sheet</span></h1>\n<pre>\n Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup version 0.4.5 (crawl-ref) character file.\n\n9615 Kek the Reanimator (level 11, -6/63 (66) HPs)\n             Began as a Sludge Elf Death Knight on Apr 29, 2009.\n             Was an Elder of Sif Muna.\n             Mangled by an eight-headed hydra (9 damage)\n             ... on Level 13 of the Dungeon on May 4, 2009.\n             The game lasted 04:45:03 (23441 turns).\n\nKek the Reanimator (Sludge Elf Death Knight)    Turns: 23441, Time: 04:45:03\n\nHP  -6/63 (66)   AC  9     Str 16      Exp: 11/13328 (372), need: 5211\nMP  24/24        EV  2     Int 15      God: Sif Muna ****\nGold 286         SH  0     Dex 15      Spells:  7 memorised,  0 levels left\n\nRes.Fire &#160;: . . .

Introduction =\n\n''Hi there! Feel free to comment in any way - opinions, good or bad, and questions about the text, gameplay or anything else are welcomed!''\n\n= Diary =\n\nThis is (yet one more) Kek, a good character of mine. I played with him for almost (non-consecutive) 5 hours. This may not be a good character to some's standarts, but it is for me and could be for other new players. I'll tell his story below. You can read it if you're a curious [[Crawl]] player or if you're just a common nerd - if you like the sound of what you read, do check [[Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup]] on Sourceforge, it's the awesomest game there is.\n\nThis Kek got WAY lucky on the start, and you can see on his sheet down below that he found many nice treasures, which was no doubtly compensated by a very tough [[dungeon]] - I remember a bunch of [[Orc|orcs]] almost killing me on the first level! Orcs! On first level! His luck did tend to the sinister - I play with 100% random characters, and the game came up with a [[Sludge Elf]] [[Death Knight (background)|Death Knight]] for me. No god, a nice selection of spells for the future and a race that's not that hungry made a good combination for starters.\n\nAnd so the journey of a dark art's initiate would begin.\n\nAs I said, this Kek had quite some luck early on in the game (only thing that actually can get me farther in the quest for the [[Orb]], actually...) and got some nice items soon: +3 [[Gloves|gloves]] of strengh, rings of [[ring of wizardry|wizardry]] and [[ring of sustenance|sustenance]] (is there a best combination for a mage?), a [[ring of life protection]] (that could be easily put on for dealing with those damnable [[undead]]) and the +2 leather armour of Paranoia (quite a powerful [[artifact]] to be found on dungeon level 4!).\n\nThere were some very good [[Ranged Weapons#Thrown-Only Weapons|throwable weapons]] too: a [[dagger]] of [[draining]] and a [[hand axe]] of [[chopping]] and another of [[venom]] - due to their magic, I used them for melee combat too for quite a while, until finding myself a [[vampiric]] [[lajatang]]! I don't remember seeing this weapon before, but it just seemed right to use it - besides being fairly powerful on it's own, Kek the Reanimator was already using it's dark powers for sucking life and causing others pain, so why not keep the theme with a vampiric weapon? It was even better for the fact that I could still throw my other powerful magic weapons, so choosing the lajatang wouldn't make my other weapons obsolete.\n\nMany good [[Spell book|books]] (so many I didn't use them all) also provided for the repertoire of spells: [[Vampiric Draining]], [[Regeneration]], [[Detect Curse]].... Of course, any half-decent dark evil mage can't be seen on [[melee]] all of the time - it just looks too swashbuckly! So a [[staff of wizardry]] would help me keep the pose in-between close quarter fighting - while also taking my novice [[Necromancy|mage]] apprentice to the heights of the arcane realm, of course! With it, even the first level [[pain]] spell was devastating, which remained my default [[ranged attack]] thoughout the game.\n\nI'm not a very priest-like player, so I just don't have much patience for gods. I usually just find an entrance to the [[Ecumenical Temple]] and adore the chaotic [[Xom]]. He's so so, as much a giver as a taker, but at least he does everything without me needing to intervene, which is nice enough as far as it goes for me as a player. But this Kek found an altar of [[Sif Muna|the Loreminder]], right on the first levels. I read its description and couldn't see why any mage wouldn't want a god like that, so I converted myself. Not that I used the powers very much, but the [[evocations]] to replenish [[Magic points|mana]] and to forget [[spells]] (and regain their memorisation levels) did help once or twice.\n\nBut then I found it - a blueish tile icon on the map grid. I looked at it, draw by the enchantation of a [[Evocable_items#Miscellaneous_Items|miscellaneous item]]. I picked it up. The \"a [[crystal ball]]\" message on the screen was alone enough to take my breath away! The curiosity! Kek stared into it, only to know that it would be useless without a monster around. All right, I found a monster (duh!) and stared at it again, and I simply saw the monster. Hm, nothing really impressive here. I still don't think I know exactly how crystal balls work, but it never crossed my mind to [[identify]] it - I simply concluded that it would need to be used with a toughter monster. An illusionist, maybe, for the ball's power to see through the falseness. That's the dumb me writing.\n\nI stepped down into the eleventh level without knowing it would be my last. I found an eight-headed [[hydra]] zombie just as I stepped down the stairs. Lucky it was far away. Being [[Stealth|stealthy]], I went up the stairs again, not ready to fight an enemy with unknown power. I descended again in a different place, only to find a REAL eight-headed hydra chasing me! But did I tremble? Yes I did, and started looking at my full [[Inventory|pack]] to find a good strategy for eliminating the stunning beast (which, by the way, has a really beautiful medievesque rhyme poem in it's description, be sure to check it out). And there it was, on the my pack's bottom: the crystal ball. I picked it up, and I knew it would work this time. If it wouldn't work with a [[hydra]], it would work with nothing else.\n\nAnd against me, it did work. Even with the inventory full of ways for victory or escape, Kek was lured by the gem's beauty and could not take his eyes off it even as the monster's eight heads tore his flesh apart...\n\n= Character sheet =\n\n<pre>\n Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup version 0.4.5 (crawl-ref) character file.\n\n9615 Kek the Reanimator (level 11, -6/63 (66) HPs)\n             Began as a Sludge Elf Death Knight on Apr 29, 2009.\n             Was an Elder of Sif Muna.\n             Mangled by an eight-headed hydra (9 damage)\n             ... on Level 13 of the Dungeon on May 4, 2009.\n             The game lasted 04:45:03 (23441 turns).\n\nKek the Reanimator (Sludge Elf Death Knight)    Turns: 23441, Time: 04:45:03\n\nHP  -6/63 (66)   AC  9     Str 16      Exp: 11/13328 (372), need: 5211\nMP  24/24        EV  2     Int 15      God: Sif Muna ****\nGold 286         SH  0     Dex 15      Spells:  7 memorised,  0 levels left\n\nRes.Fire  : . . .

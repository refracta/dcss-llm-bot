{"title":"Bone dragon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bone_dragon","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{list of | dragons}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Bone dragons''' are [[undead]] [[list of dragons|draconic]] horrors. They lack a [[breath weapon]], but make up for it with powerful melee capabilities, excellent defense, and plentiful [[HP]]. You can find them in [[the Crypt]], [[the Vaults]], [[the Abyss]], and the [[Hell]]s (primarily [[Tartarus]]), as well as one rune vault in [[the Swamp]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Bone Dragons are vulnerable to [[Dispel Undead]] and  [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]], while powerful non-elemental [[Conjurations]] are also effective. However, it'll still take several shots to kill them.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.12]], bone dragons were slower but had significantly more HP."}

If the wielder is skilled in Evocations and Air Magic, they can shock those struck by it.}}\n\nA '''staff of air''' is a [[magical staff]]. It gives a [[spell enhancer]] to [[Air Magic]] and gives the wielder [[electricity resistance]].\n\nThis staff can also be used in combat, functioning as a +0 [[staff]] that deals additional electricity damage:\n\n{{crawlquote|'''Electricity Damage''': A random amount ranging from 0 to 1.25×(Evocations/2 + Air Magic)<br>'''Chance to Activate on a Hit''': (Evocations + AirMagic/2)×6.66% per hit}}\n\nIn addition, the [[Staves]] and [[Fighting]] skills will increase the damage done by the staff itself.\n\n==Strategy==\nStaves of air are one of the few non-[[artefact]] sources of rElec. It can be wise to keep a staff around to swap in. Even melee characters may want one around, e.g. swapping to the staff when teleporting away from [[Nikola]].\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|the electricity damage in melee will be reduced by half of AC.}}\n*Prior to [[0.19]], staves of air would penalize casting Earth spells.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the staff of air would activate extra melee damage less frequently than other magical staves.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], the chance of a staff of air auto-identifying when wielded depended on the Air Magic skill of the wielder."}

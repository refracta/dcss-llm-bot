{"title":"Wand of roots","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wand_of_roots","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{item\n |itemtype = Wand\n |name = Wand of roots\n |cost = ?\n}}{{flavour|A magical device which fires a magical seed, entangling its target and adjacent foes in quick-growing tree roots. Those entangled will be immobilized and take increasing damage over time until they escape or the roots wither away. The roots will only sprout from solid ground.}}\n\nThe '''wand of roots''' [[constrict]]s foes in a 3x3 radius, similar to the [[Grasping Roots]] monster spell. It does not affect the user or their [[allies]].\n\nFor players:\n*This wand deals <code>2d(3.5 + 3.5 * [[Evocations]]/10)</code> damage (per [[decaAut|1.0 turn]]) initially.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|player-act.cc|933}}</ref> For each successive turn constricted, its damage will increase. Roughly, you'll deal an extra (+20% * turns_passed) damage for the first 5 turns, and a smaller bonus thereafter.\n*Constriction lasts for <code>2.5 + 1d(3.5 * Evocations/10)</code> turns,<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|beam.cc|6178}}</ref> or until the monster escapes. See [[Constriction#Maintaining Constriction|Constriction]] for more details on escaping constriction.\n\nIt is mutually exclusive with the [[wand of iceblast]]. Only one may spawn in a given game. [[Artificer]]s will always start with a wand of iceblast, regardless of which wand is generated in the Dungeon.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The wand has much of the same utility and power as [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]]. It lowers EV, never misses, deals guaranteed physical damage, and prevents targets from moving, which can help you avoid [[attacks of opportunity]]. Unlike BVC, the wand can't pass through multiple enemies. (The blast can hit those behind your target, though.)\n*If you're in melee range of a monster, they generally won't try to escape constriction, allowing you to get more damage from the wand.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|the wand will deal <code>2d(40/7 + [[Evocations]]/2)</code> damage per [[decaAut]], but the damage will not increase over time.}} <!-- TODO: add trunk duration formula in beam.cc line 6372 -->\n*Prior to [[0.31]], the wand dealt <code>2d(4 + 3.5 * [[Evocations]]/10)</code> initially.\n*The wand of roots was added in [[0.29]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{wands}}"}

{"title":"Shambling mangrove","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shambling_mangrove","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Shambling mangroves''' are massive forest guardians: large and powerful, but slow. Along with their brutal melee attacks, they have a smite-targeted [[constriction]] ability. Shambling mangroves can be found in [[the Swamp]].\n\nSome shambling mangroves are generated with a few [[hornet]]s inside them, which will be released automatically once the mangrove is reduced below 50% [[HP]]. These creatures count as normal monsters for experience purposes and are not replenished. These hornets consider the shambling mangrove their band leader; even if you [[kite]] them away, the insects will regroup back to the mangrove. If you worship [[Fedhas]], the hornets will also be neutral towards you.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Grasping Roots will prevent you from moving or going upstairs until you break the constriction. In addition, it gives [[scrolls of blinking]] a chance to fail. This can make bad situations into lethal ones.\n**To avoid the effects of Grasping Roots, you can fly over [[deep water]] or [[lava]]. Just don't have your flight run out.\n*If you lack [[poison]] resistance, killing or disabling the hornets should be a major priority. Even if you have rPois, they still have a 1/18 chance to [[paralyse]] you on hit. With poison immunity, however, they are trivial.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], shambling mangroves (and all plants) had rN+++.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], shambling mangroves' Grasping Roots ability inflicted a special 'grasping roots' status (-EV, +0.3 move delay, prevents [[flight]]) instead of [[constriction]].\n*Prior to the removal of [[wasp]]s in [[0.19]], shambling mangroves could release wasps.\n*Prior to [[raven]] removal in [[0.17]], shambling mangroves could also release ravens.\n*Shambling mangroves were added in [[0.14]]. During the shambling mangrove's development, it was originally known as a '''treant''' and was found in the [[Enchanted Forest]], an experimental [[branch]] that never made it into a stable release."}

It is possible to damage monsters you didn't know about: if you break a wall, and this puts a monster in [[LOS]], you'll damage that monster as well.\n\nLike almost all effects in ''Crawl'', it won't damage targets/things behind transparent walls (unless you break the walls, as mentioned above). Nor does it have any effect on ''conjured'' entities (eg, [[orbs of destruction]], [[ball lightning]]).\n\n===Damage===\nShatter deals <code>Nd(5+power/3)</code> damage, which is reduced by [[AC]]<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-damage.cc|1471}}</ref>. The number of dice (N) is determined by the target. When Shatter hits a monster, the number of dice is as follows, where the '''first applicable condition''' on this list applies; no other conditions further down the list can then apply.\n\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" style=\"width:28em;border-bottom:thin solid black;\"|Target\n!align=\"right\" style=\"width:3em;border-bottom:thin solid black;padding-left:1em;\"|N\n|-\n|Monsters made from metal, stone or crystal\n|align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n|[[Insubstantial]] monsters\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|-\n|[[Petrify]]ing/Petrified (reduced later by petrification reduction)\n|align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n|Monsters made from ice or bone\n|align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n|Slimy monsters\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|-\n|[[Flying]] monsters\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|-\n|All other monsters\n|align=\"right\" | 3\n|}\n\nPlayers have a different, but similar list of conditions ([[#Monster version|See below]] for details).\n\n===Wall destruction===\nThe following [[dungeon features]] may be destroyed, but only if the caster has line of sight:\n*[[Door]]: 100%, whether they are open or closed\n*[[Iron grate]]: 100%\n*[[Statue]] or orcish idol: 50%\n*Rock, slimy, or crystal [[wall]]: 33%\n*Tree: 33%\n*Stone wall: 25%\n*Metal wall: 15%\n\n==Strategy==\nMuch like [[Fire Storm]] and [[Chain Lightning]], Shatter lives up to its level 9 spell status: it deals high damage, to everything on screen, in a short amount of time. Unlike the former spells, Shatter is a single school spell, so it's easier to train.\n\nThere's one problem with Shatter as an ''attack spell'' - it doesn't do much against [[flying]] and [[insubstantial]] foes. In a 3-rune game, Shatter can be a questionable XP investment. A level 9 spell is a lot of XP, and it doesn't hit many of the big threats in [[Zot]] ([[orbs of fire]], [[electric golem]]s, [[list of dragons|dragons]]). Plus, [[crystal spear]] is likely to be more efficient against single targets. \n\nIf the XP cost isn't an issue, such as for worshippers of [[Ashenzari]]/[[Vehumet]], or casters in [[extended]], then Shatter becomes a useful attacking spell. It's a strong AOE that is still able to hit many targets for full damage. In Zot, [[Killer Klown]]s, [[Orb Guardian]]s, most [[list of draconians|draconians]] are hit normally; liches are especially vulnerable. In extended, good targets are certain Pan/Hell lords ([[Cerebov]], [[Ereshkigal]], [[Antaeus]]) and most inhabitants of [[Dis]].\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Shatter is a great utility spell, since it can break walls. See below for details.\n\n===Breaking Walls===\nShatter is one of the few ways to destroy stone and metal walls. Therefore, you can Shatter your way through many vaults, including: [[Slime Pits|Slime]]:5's loot chambers, [[Zot:5]]'s Orb chamber, the entrance of [[Tomb]], and rune vaults in [[extended]]. [[Sif Muna]] worshippers can use Divine Exegesis to break the arenas of a [[Gauntlet]].\n\n*You don't need an amazing success rate. Even when you have a >50% failure rate with 2 [[ring of wizardry|rings of wizardry]], it's reasonable to use Shatter to break walls. If you've trained Earth Magic for spells like [[Iron Shot]], [[Statue Form]], or [[LCS]], it's likely that Shatter is below 100% failure (at least with wizardry boosts). Just wait out the [[magical contamination]] each time you miscast. \n*It makes stealing runes in [[Pan]]/[[Hell]] fairly easy. Go to the edge of the rune's room, use Shatter, then use [[Apportation]] to grab the rune. If that isn't enough, have [[haste]] and/or [[Swiftness]]. You can then [[teleport]] out to escape from the rune's (likely very angry) guardian.\n*Shatter is extremely loud (noise 40, same as an [[alarm trap]] without mark). Using it in, say, Zot:5, will attract a huge group of monsters.\n\n==Monster version==\n[[Player ghost]]s that knew Shatter in life might be able to cast it in death.\n{{crawlquote|'''Power''': 5 + 4.5Ã—HD<br>'''Damage''': Xd(5+Power/3)}}\n\n===Player Dice===\nWhen Shatter hits a player, the number of dice is as follows, where the '''first applicable condition''' on this list applies, and no other conditions further down the list can then apply.\n\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" style=\"width:28em;border-bottom:thin solid black;\"|Target\n!align=\"right\" style=\"width:3em;border-bottom:thin solid black;padding-left:1em;\"|N\n|-\n|[[Insubstantial]] ([[Storm Form]], [[Wisp Form]])\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|-\n|[[Petrify]]ing/Petrified (reduced later by petrification reduction)\n|align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n|[[Gargoyle]]s\n|align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n|[[Statue Form]]\n|align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n|[[Flying]]\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|-\n|All other players\n|align=\"right\" | 3\n|}\n\n[[Gargoyle]]s in particular should avoid opening [[ghost vault]]s that have a ghost with Shatter, and other species should stay out of [[Statue Form]]. Be especially weary of [[Petrify]] - if you don't have the [[willpower]] to resist it, avoid the ghost entirely.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.22]], [[Jorgrun]] could cast Shatter.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], icy monsters took 4 or 5 dice of damage, water elementals took 1 dice, insubstantial creatures took 0, and the order that dice were applied was different. Pandemonium lords could cast this spell, and flight reduced the damage taken by player gargoyles and statues from 6 dice to 1.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the range of Shatter was dependent on your [[Earth Magic]] skill.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Shatter had a high chance of destroying potions not being carried.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], casting Shatter near permarock walls would damage monsters on the other side. After 0.10, monsters are only damaged if the wall is shattered in the process.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

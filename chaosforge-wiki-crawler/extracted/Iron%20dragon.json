{"title":"Iron dragon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Iron_dragon","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{list of | dragons}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Iron dragons''' are every bit as tough as their name implies. They're slow and can't [[fly]], but make up for this by having high [[AC]], [[HP]], [[willpower]], and resistance to [[fire]], [[cold]], and [[poison]]. They deal significant amounts of damage both in melee and at range, and as they take a while to bring down, be prepared to take a beating in the process. These dragons can be found occasionally in [[the Vaults]] and [[the Depths]] and appear very frequently throughout [[the Iron City of Dis]], particularly on its final floor.\n\nUnlike some dragons, iron dragons do not have a set of scales that can be dropped on death.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The only commonly available element they aren't resistant to is [[electricity]]. If you've got significant [[Air Magic]] training or the right items, feel free to zap them.\n*As they're slow, [[kiting]] iron dragons is also an option, but only if you have the room to do so and [[Repel Missiles#Player sources|Repel Missiles]] to help avoid their breath attacks. Dis:7 and Vaults:5 generally aren't too conducive to the practice, unfortunately."}

It is a two handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''halberd''' is a two-handed polearm, the weakest but fastest of the bunch. It's a pretty decent weapon for both damage and speed when you haven't found a [[shield]], but you should upgrade to a one-hander or [[glaive]] once you have trained some more skill.\n\nAs a chopping weapon, it'll cut off [[hydra]] heads. It is also too large for [[kobold]]s and [[spriggan]]s to use at all.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Halberd1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Halberd2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Halberd3.png]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || [[Unrandarts]]\n|-\n| '''[[Finisher]]''' || [[File:Scythe finisher.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Scythe of Curses]]''' || [[File:Scythe of curses.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], [[scythe]]s had their own base type instead of being based off halberds.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], these lacked innate [[reaching]] and had a higher base delay.\n\n[[Category:Polearms]]\n\n{{weapons}}"}

{"title":"Azrael","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Azrael","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Azrael the Boundless Flame''' is a [[unique]] [[efreet]], often accompanied by several [[hell hound]]s and [[fire elemental]]s. Like all efreets, he comes armed with a [[flaming]] [[scimitar]], but he's much happier hitting you with his wide variety of [[Fire Magic]] and [[damnation]] spells instead.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:12-15\n*The [[Orcish Mines]]:2\n*The [[Elven Halls]]:1-2\n*[[The Snake Pit]]:1-3\n*The [[Spider's Nest]]:1-3\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Fire resistance]] defends against most of his spells and melee, but nothing will protect you from [[damnation]].\n*His allies are immune to fire, so he can fire bolts through them. \n**However, the allies are not immune to damnation. Standing next to a hell hound or elemental will prevent him from using either damnation attack.\n*Take note of what Azrael is and isn't vulnerable to:\n**As a [[demon]], Azrael is immune to [[silence]].\n**He can't [[see invisible]], so going invisible will greatly reduce the number of spells that hit you.\n**His [[willpower]] is low for such a strong unique. A [[wand of polymorph]] is likely to create a weak demon; the usual [[Hexes]] and hex [[wand]]s also work well.\n**He is vulnerable to cold, so [[Ice Magic]] or a [[wand of iceblast]] can deal decent damage quickly; this has the added benefit of tearing through his allies in short order.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Azrael was [[:Category:Water_vulnerability|vulnerable to water]]."}

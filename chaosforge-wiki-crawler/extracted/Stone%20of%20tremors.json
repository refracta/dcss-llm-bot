Raising it aloft will send powerful shockwaves through the dungeon as the spirits seek solid form within its rock. Those creatures standing near to walls will be pelted with falling rubble as the rocky surface heaves and crumbles, while others may be swallowed up by cracks in the earth itself.}}\n\nThe '''stone of tremors''' is an item which, when [[evoke]]d, will send a shockwave rippling through the dungeon. These vibrations will cause rubble to fall, damaging any enemies standing next to any rock, stone or permarock [[wall]], and occasionally [[shaft]]ing them. This may also destroy portions of the dungeon's walls, releasing up to three friendly [[earth elemental]]s from the destroyed areas.\n\nUsing this item depletes it, rendering it inert, but it will recharge each time you gain sufficient [[experience]] while it is in your possession. Your [[Earth Magic]] skill has no effect on the item's power or recharge rate. The higher your [[Evocations]] skill, the more damage the tremors will deal and the more likely you are to get multiple earth elementals.\n\n==History==\n* It was removed in [[0.19]].\n* Prior to [[0.14]], all [[Evocable items#elementalevokers|elemental evokers]] recharged simultaneously.\n* Stones of tremors was added in [[0.13]], replacing the [[stone of earth elementals]]."}

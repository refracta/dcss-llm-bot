Creatures within its cone-shaped area of effect take damage, with higher damage being dealt to those close to the caster. Those hit by the blast are encased in ice, slowing their movement, and those killed by the blast may be frozen into solid blocks of ice.

Like [[Fire Storm]], it inflicts incredible damage, and it can pierce [[cold]] [[resistance]] well -- 50% damage is irresistible. Affected creatures will be [[frozen]], causing them to [[movement|move]] 4 [[aut]]s slower. Additionally, monsters killed by this spell may turn into [[blocks of ice]] (which later melt, leaving no corpse).\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n{{spell\n|name=Glaciate\n|level=9\n|school1={{Conjurations}}\n|school2={{Ice Magic}}\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Annihilations]]\n</div>\n|castingnoise=9\n|spellnoise=25\n}}\n{{AttackSpell\n|name=Glaciate\n|formula = 7d((66+3*Power)/(7*max(3,range)))\n|maxdmg = 7d32\n|maxsp = 200\n|range = 6\n|target = Beam\n|special = Area, [[Freezing Cloud|clouds of freezing vapour]], Slows movement}}\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Glaciate was 60% irresistible.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Glaciate was a level 9 Ice Magic / Conjurations spell that players could cast.

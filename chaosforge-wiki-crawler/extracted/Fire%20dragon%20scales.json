It provides great protection from fire, while rendering its wearer more susceptible to cold.}}\n\n'''Fire dragon scales''' are a moderately heavy body armour. They provide 2 ranks of [[fire resistance]] (rF++), but a rank of [[cold]] vulnerability (rC-).\n\nThis item has a 33% chance to generate when you slay a [[fire dragon]].\n\n==Desirability==\nFire dragon scales are a suitable general purpose armour. It offers decent defense, while still allowing spellcasting. The [[fire resistance]] is also helpful, namely against [[orbs of fire]]. However, it's often best to wait until you have at least one source of cold resistance before wearing these; taking 150% damage from cold attacks can be lethal.\n\nNote that [[ice dragon scales]] offer +1 AC (and +1 max [[enchant]]ment) for the same encumbrance rating. However, you may prefer fire dragon scales for its fire resistance.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], this item was known as fire dragon armour. It was obtained from using a [[scroll of enchant armour]] on [[fire dragon hide]] \n*Prior to [[0.10]], this item was known merely as \"dragon armour\". It was renamed to avoid confusion with other dragon armours.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

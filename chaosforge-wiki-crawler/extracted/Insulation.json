As this resistance is one of the harder ones to come by, it may be worth considering.\n\n==Notes==\nThe term \"insulation\" is occasionally used by players as a synonym for electricity resistance from any source, since it is described on artefacts as \"It insulates you from electricty\".\n\n==History==\nInsulation was removed in [[0.12]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

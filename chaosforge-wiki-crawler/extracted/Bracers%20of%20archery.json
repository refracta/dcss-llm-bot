They do not affect spellcasting. There are no unbranded bracers - all are bracers of archery and identified as such on sight.\n\n==Desirability==\nThese are obviously more useful for those who primarily use missile combat, although the melee penalty is small enough that it is generally manageable, particularly if you have other slaying bonuses.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.14]], these were removed. [[Archery]] became an [[ego]], found only on [[gloves]].\n\n[[Category:Gloves]]"}

{"title":"Block of ice","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Block_of_ice","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''For a list of all statues, see [[Statue]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Blocks of ice''' are harmless, fragile statues. You can use [[Sculpt Simulacrum]] to create blocks of ice, which will turn into [[simulacra]] after a few turns. They are also left behind when enemies are slain by [[Glaciate]] (these don't turn into simulacra).\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Much like [[pillars of salt]], these will melt away on their own after a few turns. Don't bother smashing them unless you need to get through.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], players did not have [[Sculpt Simulacrum]], so blocks of ice were always useless.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], players could create them with [[Absolute Zero]] (and Glaciate, prior to its removal from players).\n*Prior to [[0.17]], blocks of ice were not susceptible to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] and [[Shatter]].\n*Blocks of ice were added in [[0.14]]."}

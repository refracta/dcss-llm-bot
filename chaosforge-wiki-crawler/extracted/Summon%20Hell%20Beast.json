{"title":"Summon Hell Beast","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summon_Hell_Beast","type":"raw","data":"{{version017}}\n'''Summon Beast''' is a monster-only spell which summons a hostile [[hell beast]] into existence. Although they aren't very dangerous individually, swarms of them can trample you around the battlefield and deal surprisingly high amounts of damage. These beasts are not worth any [[experience]].\n\nYou can duplicate the effect of Summon Beast by blowing the [[horn of Geryon]], doing so can summon hell beasts which can be allied or hostile depending on your [[Evocations]] skill.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

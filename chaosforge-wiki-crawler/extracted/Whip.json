It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Whips''' are one of the better early game weapons, a direct upgrade to [[club]]s. They have good attack speed, even at low skill, and are easy to find off [[kobold (monster)|kobolds]] and other early humanoids.\n\n==Strategy==\nAt 0 skill, a +0 whip is stronger than a [[short sword]], [[dagger]], or [[club]], but weaker than a [[spear]]. It does not have the stabbing benefits of the former two weapons, but hits harder.\n\nA whip with a \"flat\" [[brand]], namely [[venom]] or [[electrocution]], is a powerful weapon in the early game. A whip of of either brand can kill most enemies up to [[Lair]] with minimal skill investment. Without a good brand, you should upgrade to a [[mace]] or better, at least once you get some Maces & Flails skill.\n\nNote that there is some risk with using whips at 0 skill. Since you attack at 1.1 delay (which is >1.0), monsters have a chance to get an extra turn on you. However, whips are stronger ''on average''. If you need to use a 0 skill weapon in the first place, you'll likely prefer the better performance of a whip. At 2 Maces & Flails skill, whips attack at 1.0 delay, negating this risk entirely.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Bullwhip.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Bullwhip2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Bullwhip3.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Snakebite]]''' || [[File:Whip snakebite.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], whips could possess the [[reaching]] brand.\n*In earlier versions of the game, whips did as little as 4 damage and had 12 base delay, which made them close to worthless.\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

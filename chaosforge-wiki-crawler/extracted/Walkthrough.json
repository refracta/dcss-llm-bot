The first levels are rather simple, but there are a few notable threats.\n\nIf you do decide to take on a threat, isolate it and use any tricks at your disposal -- [ranged weapons](/Ranged_weapon \"Ranged weapon\"), [spells](/Spells \"Spells\"), [wands](/Wand \"Wand\"), [throwing](/Throwing \"Throwing\") weapons, and more. Remember, you're under no obligation to kill the monsters **now**. *You* get more powerful over the course of the game. The uniques and other \"local bullies\" don't. It is perfectly fine to partially skip a dangerous level and come back later if you want to.\n\n### D:1\n\nWhile the first floor is the simplest, it isn't something to be taken lightly. Physically weaker characters (those not of a Warrior start) have to beware of fast monsters, namely [jackals](/Jackal \"Jackal\") and [quokkas](/Quokka \"Quokka\"), as you can't retreat from them. [Gnolls](/Gnoll \"Gnoll\") are also tough enemies. Thankfully, you won't have to fight any [uniques](/Unique \"Unique\") or gnoll packs just yet. Even as a tough brute, you'll want to always limit monster interactions to one at a time.\n\n### D:2\n\nThe threat of fast enemies persists, this time being [adders](/Adder \"Adder\"). Adders are surprisingly difficult; their [poison](/Poison \"Poison\") can catch up to you quickly. If absolutely necessary, drink [potions](/Potion \"Potion\") and hope for a [potion of curing](/Potion_of_curing \"Potion of curing\") or other threat-ending consumable. [Gnolls](/Gnoll \"Gnoll\") and even [orcs](/Orc \"Orc\") can form bands (i.e. large groups). You don't want to be skewered by 3 [spear](/Spear \"Spear\")-wielding gnolls, hitting you from afar, all at once. And you most likely won't want to deal with [orc wizards](/Orc_wizard \"Orc wizard\") or [orc priests](/Orc_priest \"Orc priest\") (detailed below) yet.\n\n### D:3+\n\n- [Orc priests](/Orc_priest \"Orc priest\") are 'in-depth' along with orc bands from D:3 onwards, though [out of depth](/Out_of_depth \"Out of depth\") spawns can reach even into D:2. Low-HP species will be perennially afraid, as priests can [smite](/Smite \"Smite\") for up to 17 damage per turn *as long as they can see you*. Even if you've started with a stronger character, fighting a full orc pack with a priest isn't a good idea.\n\n* [Ogres](/Ogre_\\(monster\\) \"Ogre (monster)\") tend to spawn on D:4. Dealing up to 39 damage per melee hit thanks to their [giant clubs](/Giant_club \"Giant club\"), ogres can easily 1-shot or 2-shot players. Thankfully, they attack slowly.\n\n- [Centaurs](/Centaur \"Centaur\") have a natural depth of D:5. They can outrun you while being able to pelt arrows from range. You'll either need to face them in melee (where they won't fire at you anymore), or otherwise [use an item](/Escaping_from_\\(and_avoiding\\)_trouble \"Escaping from (and avoiding) trouble\") to ease the situation.\n\nOf course, there'll be threats everywhere, but these are some of the early highlights. Depending on your character build, you might find some of these threats unamusing. For example: An ordinary, average HP melee fighter won't find much difficulty with centaurs, if they hide behind walls in order to restrict [line of sight](/Line_of_sight \"Line of sight\"). (Sight is reciprocal; if you can't see them, they can't see you).\n\nHowever, there's a few monsters which are very dangerous to face...\n\n### Uniques\n\n[Unique monsters](/Unique_monster \"Unique monster\") always have a name, and can only spawn once per game. More often than not, they'll stand out from the crowd -- in a way that'll most likely get you killed. A D:2 [Sigmund](/Sigmund \"Sigmund\") receives his title of \"Dreaded\" for good reason! Other extremely scary uniques are [Grinder](/Grinder \"Grinder\") (who can [paralyze](/Paralyze \"Paralyze\") you, meaning you'll take many enemy attacks while you have no [EV](/EV \"EV\")) and [Ijyb](/Ijyb \"Ijyb\") (who always spawns with a [wand](/Wand \"Wand\")). Regardless, if you're unfamiliar, you should check them out with **x** **v** in order to see their abilities.\n\n### Portals\n\nThroughout the game, you will find various [portals](/Portal \"Portal\") to optional levels. Many of the portals are timed, so if you wish to enter them at all, you must do so quickly!\n\nPortal levels have different themes, so always look up whichever portal you've found, and consider whether you're equipped to deal with it. Some of these are obvious; you'll want fire resistance for the [Volcano](/Volcano \"Volcano\"), and cold resistance for the [Ice Cave](/Ice_Cave \"Ice Cave\"). If the portal abuses your weaknesses, skip it! Likewise, if the \"guards\" around the portal are too tough for you, you probably won't survive long in the portal itself.\n\nBefore you venture into these portals, be sure you have enough space in your inventory to bring back any loot you find, as you won't be able to re-enter the portal. Once you're in, take stock of the situation, and explore carefully. Keep track of the exit portals - there's always at least one handy - and leave whenever you feel you're outmatched!\n\nSome of the first portals you might see include:\n\n- The [Sewer](/Sewer \"Sewer\"), filled with lots of water, and mostly weak monsters. Watch out for [poisonous](/Poison \"Poison\") snakes, and whatever lurks at the end of this portal.\n\n* The [Ossuary](/Ossuary \"Ossuary\"), with lots of [zombies](/Zombie \"Zombie\") and [mummies](/Mummy_\\(monster\\) \"Mummy (monster)\"), and occasionally some exotic undead.\n\n- The [Bailey](/Bailey \"Bailey\"), home to militant [orcs](/Orc \"Orc\") and other monsters. Many of them hold [boomerangs](/Boomerang \"Boomerang\") or [crossbows](/Crossbow \"Crossbow\") to abuse specially-crafted terrain.\n\n## The Temple\n\nThe Ecumenical Temple, located somewhere on Dungeon:4-7, contains a plethora of [gods](/God \"God\"). Players who've yet to find a god, that are able to worship a god, will most likely find the temple very useful. For more details, see the [choosing a god](/Choosing_a_god \"Choosing a god\") article.\n\nFrom here on out, threats start blending in. You'll acquire the strength and tools to handle many more situations, and gain more flexibility with avoiding threats altogether. This point might not be *exactly* when you enter the Temple, but getting a god often represents a large power spike. (Note: Most gods start providing perks at 1\\* of piety.)\n\n## Early Branches\n\nWhile exploring the dungeon, you will find the entrances to [the Lair of Beasts](/The_Lair \"The Lair\") on Dungeon:8-11, and the [Orcish Mines](/Orcish_Mines \"Orcish Mines\") on Dungeon:9-12.\n\nMost players will find it easier to clear the Lair first, typically anywhere after clearing D:10 to D:12.\n\n### The Lair\n\nThe [Lair](/Lair \"Lair\") features fast moving enemies with poison, who are difficult to escape from. [Poison resistance](/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\") is definitely recommended. If your character lacks poison resistance, or defenses in general, you might wish to explore a bit more of the Dungeon.\n\n[Hydrae](/Hydra \"Hydra\") are another major threat, able to mercilessly tear apart your character. Even if you can survive up to 8 attacks per turn, make sure not to use an edged weapon ([long blades](/Long_blades \"Long blades\"), [axes](/Axes \"Axes\"), [lajatangs](/Lajatang \"Lajatang\"), or heavy [polearms](/Polearms \"Polearms\")) without [flaming](/Flaming \"Flaming\"), lest you grow even more. Other threats include packs of hard-hitting and hard-to-hit [blink frogs](/Blink_frog \"Blink frog\"), petrifying [catoblepae](/Catoblepae \"Catoblepae\"), and the occasional herd of powerful [elephants](/Elephant \"Elephant\") or [death yaks](/Death_yak \"Death yak\"). Apart from [rime drakes](/Rime_drake \"Rime drake\") or the occasional [unique](/Unique \"Unique\"), monsters dealing elemental damage are rare here.\n\nLike all the other branches you'll encounter, the fifth and final level of Lair is the hardest. Unless there's a [portal](/Portal \"Portal\") there, you won't lose anything by leaving it for later. Feel free to exit that floor if it's too hard, and come back to it when you're stronger.\n\nThe Lair always has three branches containing [runes of Zot](/Runes_of_Zot \"Runes of Zot\"). Two are selected between [the Shoals](/The_Shoals \"The Shoals\") or [the Swamp](/The_Swamp \"The Swamp\") and [Snake Pit](/Snake_Pit \"Snake Pit\") or [Spider's Nest](/Spider%27s_Nest \"Spider's Nest\"), while the third and most dangerous of the three is [the Slime Pits](/The_Slime_Pits \"The Slime Pits\"). These are all much more difficult than Lair, so ignore them until later!\n\n### The Orcish Mines\n\nDespite the fact that its entrance can appear earlier, the [Orcish Mines](/Orcish_Mines \"Orcish Mines\") are often tougher than [the Lair](/The_Lair \"The Lair\"). Various [special types of orc](/List_of_orcs \"List of orcs\"), like [sorcerers](/Orc_sorcerer \"Orc sorcerer\") or [high priests](/Orc_high_priest \"Orc high priest\"), will stand in your way. The scariest brutes are [orc warlords](/Orc_warlord \"Orc warlord\"), [stone giants](/Stone_giant \"Stone giant\"), and [ettins](/Ettin \"Ettin\"); though, thankfully, only the former appears with any regularity throughout Orc.\n\nThe first level is often split into disjointed rooms, so make sure you explore all the staircases on the lower level to avoid missing out on treasure and experience. The second level, in turn, will always contain multiple shops to spend the gold you've inevitably accumulated by this point.\n\nSources of [willpower](/Willpower \"Willpower\") are useful here to prevent [paralysis](/Paralysis \"Paralysis\") or other nasty effects that orcs might inflict on you.\n\nYou'll find the entrance to the [Elven Halls](/Elven_Halls \"Elven Halls\") on the second level, but don't go in yet, as the elves are much tougher than the orcs.\n\n### Later Dungeon\n\nThe dungeon itself (from D:12 onward) is considered the \"3rd option\" at this stage of the game. It's perfectly fine to clear all the way up to D:15 if you wish. However, plenty of threats can dissuade Dungeon divers. [Ugly things](/Ugly_thing \"Ugly thing\") hit hard and move quickly, [skeletal warriors](/Skeletal_warrior \"Skeletal warrior\") are even tougher, and pregenerated entrance [vaults](/Vault \"Vault\") (often, to [the Vaults](/The_Vaults \"The Vaults\")) contain great danger. It is certainly possible to tackle these threats early, though a character who has cleared Lair and/or Orc will struggle a lot less.\n\nAs a soft rule of thumb, you can stay in the Dungeon, until you find a threat that's too much for you to handle. Then, go to either Lair or Orc.\n\nYou'll find the entrances to the Vaults and [the Depths](/The_Depths \"The Depths\") before too long, but you should leave these for later.\n\nOnce you're done with all three branches, it's time to begin acquiring the [runes of Zot](/Runes_of_Zot \"Runes of Zot\").\n\n## S-Branches\n\nThe easiest branches in which you can find [runes](/Rune \"Rune\") are the first two Lair branches, aka S-branches. One of the branches is always either the [Snake Pit](/Snake_Pit \"Snake Pit\") or [Spider's Nest](/Spider%27s_Nest \"Spider's Nest\"), while the other is either [the Swamp](/The_Swamp \"The Swamp\") or [the Shoals](/The_Shoals \"The Shoals\"). They're listed below in rough order of difficulty, from easiest to hardest. You might also refer to the Elven Halls section, if all the branches are too hard for you.\n\nPoison resistance is helpful in Swamp and almost a requirement in Snake Pit and Spider's Nest. If you still haven't found any, you can attempt to slay a [swamp dragon](/Swamp_dragon \"Swamp dragon\") for [its scales](/Swamp_dragon_scales \"Swamp dragon scales\") in Swamp, hope for equipment to show up in Shoals, or (dubiously) explore levels 1-2 of the [Elven Halls](/Elven_Halls \"Elven Halls\").\n\nThe [Slime Pits](/Slime_Pits \"Slime Pits\") can also be found in the Lair, but they should be saved for later.\n\n### Snake Pit\n\nThe [Snake Pit](/Snake_Pit \"Snake Pit\") is populated by hordes of [snakes](/List_of_snakes \"List of snakes\") and [nagas](/List_of_nagas \"List of nagas\"); [Poison](/Poison \"Poison\") damage and [constriction](/Constriction \"Constriction\") are both common, and [mana vipers](/Mana_viper \"Mana viper\") are especially dangerous to spellcasters. Most of the nagas move fairly slow (until [hasted](/Haste \"Haste\")), which combined with the Pit's Dungeon-like layout, allows you to control threats with ease. To compensate, they'll come with ranged attacks, especially if you encounter [Vashnia](/Vashnia \"Vashnia\")'s crew. Non-humanoid snakes are fast... though most are slowed down by [cold](/Cold \"Cold\").\n\nIn addition to the obvious choice of [poison resistance](/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\"), [fire resistance](/Fire_resistance \"Fire resistance\") will help with the [salamanders](/Salamander \"Salamander\"), and [electricity resistance](/Electricity_resistance \"Electricity resistance\") will help with the [shock serpents](/Shock_serpent \"Shock serpent\").\n\nIf you're well prepared, and take things carefully, it won't take long until you slither across the [serpentine rune of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\").\n\n### Swamp\n\nThe Swamp is an open marsh filled with trees and water, and its inhabitants won't let you forget that.\n\nRight off the bat, [Eleionomae](/Eleionoma \"Eleionoma\") and [spriggan druids](/Spriggan_druid \"Spriggan druid\") will force you to beware of direct wooded contact. And be careful to only fight from solid ground, unless your character does well in shallow water or can [fly](/Fly \"Fly\"). Even then, [hydras](/Hydra \"Hydra\") (remember Lair?) and the many other threats of Swamp will straight up outrun you unless you are both flying *and* [hasted](/Haste \"Haste\"). Fortunately, if you've found a way to clear the multi-headed foes, those threats shouldn't be *too* hard to deal with. It might still be a struggle when a [swamp worm](/Swamp_worm \"Swamp worm\") pulls you into unfamiliar territory, especially if you don't have resistances (poison, [willpower](/Willpower \"Willpower\") for [fenstrider witches](/Fenstrider_witch \"Fenstrider witch\"), rCorr for [goliath frogs](/Goliath_frog \"Goliath frog\")) to manage.\n\nSome of the other bigger threats include [thorn hunters](/Thorn_hunter \"Thorn hunter\"), [shambling mangroves](/Shambling_mangrove \"Shambling mangrove\"), [tentacled monstrosities](/Tentacled_monstrosities \"Tentacled monstrosities\"), and at the end, possibly even [the Lernaean hydra](/The_Lernaean_hydra \"The Lernaean hydra\"). But if you can overcome it all, you will eventually find the [decaying rune of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\").\n\n### Shoals\n\n[The Shoals](/The_Shoals \"The Shoals\") are made up of several islands, surrounded by vast amounts of water. A source of flight is useful, as you'll probably need to fight from solid ground or [fly](/Fly \"Fly\") to avoid incurring penalties. Also useful is a source of invisibility, since almost none of the monsters here can see invisible. (However, invisibility is ineffective if you are standing in water instead of flying)\n\nExpect to have to deal with foes such as [merfolk bands](/List_of_merfolk \"List of merfolk\"), [various satyrs](/List_of_centaurs#satyrs \"List of centaurs\"), and perhaps even the dreadful Witch of the Tides, [Ilsuiw](/Ilsuiw \"Ilsuiw\"). Many of the enemies here use [Hexes](/Hexes \"Hexes\"), so [willpower](/Willpower \"Willpower\") is important. Ranged weapons are also common, so an [amulet of reflection](/Amulet_of_reflection \"Amulet of reflection\") or [scarf](/Scarf \"Scarf\") of [repulsion](/Repulsion \"Repulsion\") is invaluable here.\n\nWhatever you do, be very careful when you explore, only [autoexploring](/Autoexplore \"Autoexplore\") after you've eliminated most of the threats. Otherwise you will often find yourself trapped in combat, making your chances of collecting the [barnacled rune of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\") very slim.\n\n### Spider's Nest\n\nThe Spider's Nest has swarms of fast-moving [spiders](/List_of_arachnids \"List of arachnids\") that can quickly inflict severe poisoning, so don't enter without poison resistance unless absolutely necessary. But poison might quickly be the least of your worries...\n\nA variety of threats will swarm you in the cavernous layout of the Nest, with few true chokepoints to abuse. [Tarantellas](/Tarantella \"Tarantella\") have a confusing bite, leaving you stumbling about. [Entropy weavers](/Entropy_weaver \"Entropy weaver\") will [corrode](/Corrode \"Corrode\") you, lowering both armour and melee. Invisible [ghost moths](/Ghost_moth \"Ghost moth\") will rapidly drain your [MP](/MP \"MP\"), if you aren't [invisible](/Invisible \"Invisible\") yourself. All the while, [emperor scorpions](/Emperor_scorpion \"Emperor scorpion\") and [broodmothers](/Broodmother \"Broodmother\") are formidable melee threats on their own. Remember -- this is all *with* the fast, poisonous brood! Fortunately, the common spiders are frail, not particularly resistant, and vulnerable to [poison](/Poison \"Poison\").\n\nOnce you complete the final floor, you'll find the [gossamer rune of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\").\n\n## Late Game\n\nAfter you have completed both S-branches, you will need a third rune before you can enter [the Realm of Zot](/The_Realm_of_Zot \"The Realm of Zot\"). However, the other rune branches are significantly more dangerous than the S-branches, so players typically clear other areas for loot and XP before tackling a third rune.\n\n### The Elven Halls\n\nIf you're lacking in anything in particular, clearing the first two floors of the [Elven Halls](/Elven_Halls \"Elven Halls\") may provide you with them. The Halls feature many dangerous [deep elven](/List_of_deep_elves \"List of deep elves\") casters. The most common ones are [deep elf pyromancers](/Deep_elf_pyromancer \"Deep elf pyromancer\") and [zephyrmancers](/Deep_elf_zephyrmancer \"Deep elf zephyrmancer\"), meaning it's nice to have rF and rElec.\n\nBe careful about opening the [runed doors](/Runed_door \"Runed door\") on the second level, as they open to the [Hall of Blades](/Hall_of_Blades \"Hall of Blades\"). This can be a dangerous place and it may not even be worth visiting if you already have a good weapon. Dancing weapons are already a big turn off for an early Elf, being fast, not that weak, and near omni-resistant.\n\nThanks to the wide variety of magic, virtually every [resistance](/Resistance \"Resistance\") will come in handy, but the most important one is [willpower](/Willpower \"Willpower\"). If your willpower is too low, you could be [banished](/Banishment \"Banishment\") into the [Abyss](/Abyss \"Abyss\"). [Silence](/Silence \"Silence\") (or a [scroll of silence](/Scroll_of_silence \"Scroll of silence\")) will shut off most elven threats, though [deep elf blademasters](/Deep_elf_blademaster \"Deep elf blademaster\") and [master archers](/Deep_elf_master_archer \"Deep elf master archer\") still remain major threats. Dancing weapons also come with high [AC](/AC \"AC\") and a variety of resistances, meaning your own magic might not perform well.\n\nSome people like to complete this branch fairly early, even before finishing any of the S-branches. While this isn't impossible by any means, it's very difficult, and shouldn't be tried by inexperienced players.\n\nThe final level of the Elven Halls contains a treasure chamber with massive amounts of loot, but also lots and lots of the most dangerous types of elves.\n\n### The Vaults\n\n[The Vaults](/The_Vaults \"The Vaults\") are an excellent place to collect your third [rune](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\"), although some characters may prefer [the Abyss](/The_Abyss \"The Abyss\") or [Slime Pits](/Slime_Pits \"Slime Pits\"). In any case, entering the Vaults without at least one rune is foolish, as you will have to get a rune from either [Vaults:5](/The_Vaults#Vaults:5 \"The Vaults\") or [the Tomb](/The_Tomb \"The Tomb\") before you can exit.\n\nOnce you enter, the most helpful thing you can have is decent defenses: [AC](/AC \"AC\"), [EV](/EV \"EV\"), and [SH](/SH \"SH\"). Elemental damage isn't uncommon, and there's a wide variety, so it's best to have wide spread of [resistances](/Resistance \"Resistance\"). [Willpower](/Willpower \"Willpower\") is particularly important for [vault sentinels](/Vault_sentinel \"Vault sentinel\"), so if you don't think you can fight an entire floor at once, you'll also want that (as well as the ever present threat of [paralysis](/Paralysis \"Paralysis\") from here onwards).\n\n[Vaults:5](/The_Vaults#Vaults:5 \"The Vaults\") is exponentially harder than the earlier levels, so players often do Vaults:1-4 on their own, then complete [the Depths](/The_Depths \"The Depths\"), before attempting Vaults:5. Read the [V:5](/The_Vaults#Vaults:5 \"The Vaults\") page for a detailed list of the tools and strategies needed to reach that [silver rune of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\").\n\n### Crypt\n\nAs you explore the Vaults, you'll eventually find [the Crypt](/The_Crypt \"The Crypt\"), home to all manner of [undead](/Undead \"Undead\"). The Crypt tends to be dangerous to any living character due to many sources of [torment](/Torment \"Torment\"). You'll want [negative energy resistance](/Negative_energy_resistance \"Negative energy resistance\") (more is always better); cold resistance can also help. Therefore, it is great place for (re)gaining piety for [The Shining One](/The_Shining_One \"The Shining One\") or [Zin](/Zin \"Zin\").\n\nThere is usually no need to enter the Crypt in a three-rune game. Characters that can take torment -- the [undead](/Undead \"Undead\"), worshippers of [Kiku](/Kiku \"Kiku\"), and the aforementioned good gods -- won't mind, however.\n\n### Depths\n\n[The Depths](/The_Depths \"The Depths\") are fairly straightforward. Four floors of elaborate and often very open layouts teeming with monsters leading up to the [Realm of Zot](/The_Realm_of_Zot \"The Realm of Zot\") entrance. Along the way, you'll find entrances to [the Abyss](/The_Abyss \"The Abyss\"), [the Vestibule of Hell](/The_Vestibule_of_Hell \"The Vestibule of Hell\"), and [Pandemonium](/Pandemonium \"Pandemonium\"). If you are only going for a three-rune game, you will have little reason to enter the latter two branches, though the Abyss is an option for your third rune.\n\n## Third Rune\n\nBy the time you have completed Depths, you should be ready for a third rune. The three main options for the third rune are [Vaults:5](/The_Vaults#Vaults:5 \"The Vaults\"), [the Slime Pits](/The_Slime_Pits \"The Slime Pits\"), and [the Abyss](/The_Abyss \"The Abyss\"), in descending order of popularity.\n\n### Vaults:5\n\nYou should have already cleared Vaults:1-4 by this point, so Vaults:5 is all that's needed for the [silver rune](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\"). If Vaults:4 has an [escape hatch](/Escape_hatch \"Escape hatch\") or [shaft](/Shaft \"Shaft\"), use it to avoid the ambush at the center. Otherwise, it's recommended to buff up with [haste](/Potion_of_haste \"Potion of haste\") and [might](/Potion_of_might \"Potion of might\")/[brilliance](/Potion_of_brilliance \"Potion of brilliance\") before going down. Consider reading a [scroll of teleportation](/Scroll_of_teleportation \"Scroll of teleportation\") as well, as you will be surrounded, and [stair dancing](/Stair_dancing \"Stair dancing\") isn't reliable here. For more details, see [Vaults:5 Strategy](/The_Vaults#Vaults:5_Strategy \"The Vaults\").\n\n### Slime Pits\n\n[The Slime Pits](/The_Slime_Pits \"The Slime Pits\") are found in Lair:4-5 and require quite a lot of preparation before you can clear them with any semblance of safety. Once you feel you're ready to enter the pits, you will need [corrosion resistance](/Corrosion_resistance \"Corrosion resistance\"). All three [eyeballs](/List_of_eyeballs \"List of eyeballs\") inflict scary effects; [Malmutate](/Malmutate \"Malmutate\") from [shining eyes](/Shining_eye \"Shining eye\"), [willpower](/Willpower \"Willpower\")-based [confusion](/Confusion \"Confusion\") from [golden eyes](/Golden_eye \"Golden eye\"), and irresistible [fragility](/Fragile \"Fragile\") from [glass eyes](/Glass_eye \"Glass eye\"). Don't forget the actual slimes, which are pretty tough and come in great numbers. Players tend to dive the first 4 levels, going down staircases as soon as possible; there's no loot, and XP is minimal.\n\nSlime:5 is home to [the Royal Jelly](/The_Royal_Jelly \"The Royal Jelly\"), which spawns slimes whenever it takes damage, so fighting it without a strategy for dealing with it is a recipe for [disaster](/YASD \"YASD\").\n\nThe one exception to all of this is characters who worship [Jiyva](/Jiyva \"Jiyva\"), who can waltz in and pick up the [slimy rune of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\") with zero resistance after reaching 6 stars of [piety](/Piety \"Piety\").\n\n### Abyss\n\n[The Abyss](/The_Abyss \"The Abyss\") is the least consistent third rune option, though it's easier than the other branches you'll run across in the Depths. Unsurprisingly, followers of [Lugonu](/Lugonu \"Lugonu\") will have an easier time, as they can leave for the low cost of 15 piety. The Abyssal rune will generate on level 3-7, with higher chance the deeper you go. Players approaching the rune’s location will be notified, and have its exact tile marked on the map. Unfortunately, monster spawns also ramp up quickly on the deeper levels, so level 3 is often the deepest most characters will want to go. This might not always be your choice, as [banishment](/Banishment \"Banishment\") and abyssal shifts can send you deeper.\n\nKilling monsters will eventually open up a portal out (and even later, a portal deeper). As you travel through this plane, you'll acquire temporary [mutations](/Mutation \"Mutation\") and various forms of [stat](/Stat \"Stat\") drain that needs XP to be cured.\n\nTeleportation is often the best way to escape a dodgy situation in the Abyss. After teleporting, you can make good use of [potions of ambrosia](/Potion_of_ambrosia \"Potion of ambrosia\") to quickly heal up when no monsters have yet generated near you. Stealth and sources of regeneration help, as you will constantly be on the run (thus, have few places to heal up). Finally, [Apportation](/Apportation \"Apportation\") is great for nabbing that [abyssal rune](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\") before you teleport away.\n\n## Realm of Zot\n\n[Zot](/The_Realm_of_Zot \"The Realm of Zot\"), the final frontier... or maybe not, depending on your branch order. This is where you will find the [Orb of Zot](/Orb_of_Zot \"Orb of Zot\"), the reason of your adventure.\n\nTo obtain the orb, you'll want lots of [fire resistance](/Fire_resistance \"Fire resistance\") for the terrifying [orbs of fire](/Orb_of_fire \"Orb of fire\") that you'll eventually encounter. Other resistances and [see invisible](/See_invisible \"See invisible\") are also helpful.\n\nEventually you will arrive at [Zot:5](/Zot:5 \"Zot:5\"), which contains the infamous Orb Chamber. Read that page for more details on how to clear the place and finally obtain the Orb. Beware that [teleportation](/Teleport \"Teleport\") is delayed in Zot, or while holding the Orb.\n\nNote that even if you want to collect every rune, often it's best to clear out Zot (or at least Zot:1-4) first for the extra experience and items. Just don't pick up the orb until you're done!\n\n## Extended\n\n[Pandemonium](/Pandemonium \"Pandemonium\"), [Hell](/Hell \"Hell\"), and [the Tomb](/The_Tomb \"The Tomb\") comprise the \"extended\" game, called such because none of these areas need to be visited in a three-rune game. It's perfectly fine to ignore the extended game and pick up the orb after clearing Zot:5, but for those seeking an extra challenge, ten more [runes of Zot](/Runes_of_Zot \"Runes of Zot\") can be found in these branches. It's recommended to complete the third rune options and Zot before tackling extended.\n\n### Pandemonium\n\nThe [Pandemonium](/Pandemonium \"Pandemonium\") is a series of endless, but stable, realms, filled with all sorts of [demons](/Demon \"Demon\") and other endgame monsters.\n\nIt contains five runes, one of which, the [demonic rune of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\"), is guarded by a randomly generated lord. The [other four](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\") are guarded by unique [pandemonium lords](/Pandemonium_lord \"Pandemonium lord\"). You can only enter each of their realms once, leaving the rune forever if you can't kill, dodge, or outsmart them.\n\nThis place requires a ton of [preparation](/Pandemonium#Preparation \"Pandemonium\"), as you'll need to be able to deal with [Cerebov](/Cerebov \"Cerebov\"), [Mnoleg](/Mnoleg \"Mnoleg\"), [Lom Lobon](/Lom_Lobon \"Lom Lobon\"), and/or [Gloorx Vloq](/Gloorx_Vloq \"Gloorx Vloq\") whenever the game throws them at you. Definitely check out the [Pandemonium](/Pandemonium \"Pandemonium\") article and the articles on the individual pan lords before you enter!\n\n### Hell\n\nAfter you enter [the Vestibule of Hell](/The_Vestibule_of_Hell \"The Vestibule of Hell\") and kill its inhabitants, you'll come upon portals to the four branches of Hell: [Gehenna](/Gehenna \"Gehenna\"), [Cocytus](/Cocytus \"Cocytus\"), [Tartarus](/Tartarus \"Tartarus\"), and [The Iron City of Dis](/The_Iron_City_of_Dis \"The Iron City of Dis\"), each with their own [rune](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\"). Obtaining the [Horn of Geryon](/Horn_of_Geryon \"Horn of Geryon\") from [Geryon](/Geryon \"Geryon\") in the Vestibule may be viable - albeit dangerous - for any character with high [Evocations](/Evocation \"Evocation\") (and also isn't worshipping a god who would disapprove).\n\nAll of the branches are 7 levels deep and have their own theme with relevant resistances.\n\n- [Gehenna](/Gehenna \"Gehenna\"): Home to fire, [damnation](/Damnation \"Damnation\"), even more fire, and the [obsidian rune of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\").\n- [Cocytus](/Cocytus \"Cocytus\"): Realm of ice and large expanses of water. You'll find the [icy rune of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\") here.\n- [Tartarus](/Tartarus \"Tartarus\"): Full of [undead](/Undead \"Undead\"), [draining](/Draining \"Draining\"), and [dispel undead](/Dispel_undead \"Dispel undead\"). Contains the [bone rune of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\").\n- [Dis](/Dis \"Dis\"): A city where almost everything is made of iron, including the [iron rune of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\").\n\nEach hell enforces a conduct, such as restricting use of all [scrolls](/Scroll \"Scroll\"). In addition, every one will rapidly inflict [drain](/Drain \"Drain\") and temporary [mutation](/Mutation \"Mutation\"), which can only cured by gaining XP. Due to these effects, along with a lack of loot, it's best to skip branch floors as much as possible. Along with the already-hellish threats of each threat, delvers will want to be very prepared.\n\nIf you can't clear [the Realm of Zot](/The_Realm_of_Zot \"The Realm of Zot\"), you probably shouldn't even bother with Hell, or even Pan. However, the Hells are required if you want all 15 runes.\n\n### Tomb\n\nInside the Crypt is [the Tomb of Ancients](/The_Tomb \"The Tomb\"), chock-full of [mummies](/List_of_mummies \"List of mummies\") and home to the [golden rune of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\").\n\nThis is one of the most dangerous branches in the game, full of [smiting](/Smiting \"Smiting\"), [torment](/Torment \"Torment\"), and [death curses](/Death_curse \"Death curse\"). Often the first thing you'll see is a band of [sphinxes](/Sphinx \"Sphinx\") that can [paralyse](/Paralyse \"Paralyse\") and smite you to death, so tread lightly.\n\nLots of [negative energy resistance](/Negative_energy_resistance \"Negative energy resistance\"), and some way to deal with [draining](/Drain \"Drain\") are all required. Or, you could worship [Kikubaaqudgha](/Kikubaaqudgha \"Kikubaaqudgha\") for that wonderful death curse protection and torment resistance.\n\n## Ascension\n\nWhen you've finished ransacking every place you wish, proceed to Zot:5 and claim the [Orb of Zot](/Orb_of_Zot \"Orb of Zot\")!\n\nTo finish the game, simply book it towards D:1. Your priority now is speed: use every method of speeding yourself up available to you, [digging](/Dig \"Dig\") yourself shortcuts when needed.\n\nYou can also make use of the game's autotravel feature, which will automatically calculate the shortest route to your destination, but this won't automatically use items for you (in the case of the orb run, pressing **GD0** will take you right to the entrance of the dungeon.\n\nOccasionally, [demons](/Demon \"Demon\"), [Orb Guardians](/Orb_Guardian \"Orb Guardian\"), residents of [Pandemonium](/Pandemonium \"Pandemonium\"), and even [Pandemonium lords](/Pandemonium_lord \"Pandemonium lord\") will appear to block your path. If you can get around them, do so. If they block your path completely, only fight if you can clear a path within a few turns; otherwise, [dig](/Dig \"Dig\") yourself a new path, blink, teleport, or take another route.\n\nOnly stop to heal if you're in danger of dying, and do so on an upwards stairway if possible. Use [potions of ambrosia](/Potion_of_ambrosia \"Potion of ambrosia\") and sources of [regeneration](/Regeneration \"Regeneration\") to heal yourself faster. Just travel as quickly and efficiently as possible, avoid getting pinned down, and you should escape without too much trouble.\n\n## History\n\n- In [0.29](/0.29 \"0.29\"), the Abyss gives XP and piety again (but not random items). However, you'll always end up on the deepest floor you've been on, still making it harder to [scum](/Scum \"Scum\").\n- In [0.28](/0.28 \"0.28\"), the Abyss itself no longer gives items, XP, or piety. Prior to this, it was possible for strong characters to scum relatively safely in the Abyss for whatever they needed.\n- In [0.14](/0.14 \"0.14\"), [the Depths](/The_Depths \"The Depths\") branch replaced D:16-27, and it was made necessary to obtain a [rune of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\") to enter [the Vaults](/The_Vaults \"The Vaults\").\n\n| [Strategy Guides](/Strategy_guides

you'll find yourself in the <a href=\"/Dungeon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dungeon\">Dungeon</a>. The first levels are rather simple, but there are a few notable threats.\n</p><p>If you do decide to take on a threat, isolate it and use any tricks at your disposal -- <a href=\"/Ranged_weapon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ranged weapon\">ranged weapons</a>, <a href=\"/Spells\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spells\">spells</a>, <a href=\"/Wand\" title=\"Wand\">wands</a>, <a href=\"/Throwing\" title=\"Throwing\">throwing</a> weapons, and more. Remember, you're under no obligation to kill the monsters <b>now</b>. <i>You</i> get more powerful over the course of the game. The uniques and other \"local bullies\" don't. It is perfectly fine to partially skip a dangerous level and come back later if you want to.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"D:1\">D:1</span></h3>\n<p>While the first floor is the simplest, it isn't something to be taken lightly. Physically weaker characters (those not of a Warrior start) have to beware of fast monsters, namely <a href=\"/Jackal\" title=\"Jackal\">jackals</a> and <a href=\"/Quokka\" title=\"Quokka\">quokkas</a>, as you can't retreat from them. <a href=\"/Gnoll\" title=\"Gnoll\">Gnolls</a> are also tough enemies. Thankfully, you won't have to fight any <a href=\"/Unique\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Unique\">uniques</a> or gnoll packs just yet. Even as a tough brute, you'll want to always limit monster interactions to one at a time.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"D:2\">D:2</span></h3>\n<p>The threat of fast enemies persists, this time being <a href=\"/Adder\" title=\"Adder\">adders</a>. Adders are surprisingly difficult; their <a href=\"/Poison\" title=\"Poison\">poison</a> can catch up to you quickly. If absolutely necessary, drink <a href=\"/Potion\" title=\"Potion\">potions</a> and hope for a <a href=\"/Potion_of_curing\" title=\"Potion of curing\">potion of curing</a> or other threat-ending consumable. <a href=\"/Gnoll\" title=\"Gnoll\">Gnolls</a> and even <a href=\"/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orcs</a> can form bands (i.e. large groups). You don't want to be skewered by 3 <a href=\"/Spear\" title=\"Spear\">spear</a>-wielding gnolls, hitting you from afar, all at once. And you most likely won't want to deal with <a href=\"/Orc_wizard\" title=\"Orc wizard\">orc wizards</a> or <a href=\"/Orc_priest\" title=\"Orc priest\">orc priests</a> (detailed below) yet.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"D:3.2B\">D:3+</span></h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/Orc_priest\" title=\"Orc priest\">Orc priests</a> are 'in-depth' along with orc bands from D:3 onwards, though <a href=\"/Out_of_depth\" title=\"Out of depth\">out of depth</a> spawns can reach even into D:2. Low-HP species will be perennially afraid, as priests can <a href=\"/Smite\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Smite\">smite</a> for up to 17 damage per turn <i>as long as they can see you</i>. Even if you've started with a stronger character, fighting a full orc pack with a priest isn't a good idea.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/Ogre_(monster)\" title=\"Ogre (monster)\">Ogres</a> tend to spawn on D:4. Dealing up to 39 damage per melee hit thanks to their <a href=\"/Giant_club\" title=\"Giant club\">giant clubs</a>, ogres can easily 1-shot or 2-shot players. Thankfully, they attack slowly.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/Centaur\" title=\"Centaur\">Centaurs</a> have a natural depth of D:5. They can outrun you while being able to pelt arrows from range. You'll either need to face them in melee (where they won't fire at you anymore), or otherwise <a href=\"/Escaping_from_(and_avoiding)_trouble\" title=\"Escaping from (and avoiding) trouble\">use an item</a> to ease the situation.</li></ul>\n<p>Of course, there'll be threats everywhere, but these are some of the early highlights. Depending on your character build, you might find some of these threats unamusing. For example: An ordinary, average HP melee fighter won't find much difficulty with centaurs, if they hide behind walls in order to restrict <a href=\"/Line_of_sight\" title=\"Line of sight\">line of sight</a>. (Sight is reciprocal; if you can't see them, they can't see you).\n</p><p>However, there's a few monsters which are very dangerous to face...\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Uniques\">Uniques</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/Unique_monster\" title=\"Unique monster\">Unique monsters</a> always have a name, and can only spawn once per game. More often than not, they'll stand out from the crowd -- in a way that'll most likely get you killed. A D:2 <a href=\"/Sigmund\" title=\"Sigmund\">Sigmund</a> receives his title of \"Dreaded\" for good reason! Other extremely scary uniques are <a href=\"/Grinder\" title=\"Grinder\">Grinder</a> (who can <a href=\"/Paralyze\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Paralyze\">paralyze</a> you, meaning you'll take many enemy attacks while you have no <a href=\"/EV\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"EV\">EV</a>) and <a href=\"/Ijyb\" title=\"Ijyb\">Ijyb</a> (who always spawns with a <a href=\"/Wand\" title=\"Wand\">wand</a>). Regardless, if you're unfamiliar, you should check them out with <b>x</b> <b>v</b> in order to see their abilities.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Portals\">Portals</span></h3>\n<p>Throughout the game, you will find various <a href=\"/Portal\" title=\"Portal\">portals</a> to optional levels. Many of the portals are timed, so if you wish to enter them at all, you must do so quickly!\n</p><p>Portal levels have different themes, so always look up whichever portal you've found, and consider whether you're equipped to deal with it. Some of these are obvious; you'll want fire resistance for the <a href=\"/Volcano\" title=\"Volcano\">Volcano</a>, and cold resistance for the <a href=\"/Ice_Cave\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ice Cave\">Ice Cave</a>. If the portal abuses your weaknesses, skip it! Likewise, if the \"guards\" around the portal are too tough for you, you probably won't survive long in the portal itself.\n</p><p>Before you venture into these portals, be sure you have enough space in your inventory to bring back any loot you find, as you won't be able to re-enter the portal. Once you're in, take stock of the situation, and explore carefully. Keep track of the exit portals - there's always at least one handy - and leave whenever you feel you're outmatched!\n</p><p>Some of the first portals you might see include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The <a href=\"/Sewer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sewer\">Sewer</a>, filled with lots of water, and mostly weak monsters. Watch out for <a href=\"/Poison\" title=\"Poison\">poisonous</a> snakes, and whatever lurks at the end of this portal.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The <a href=\"/Ossuary\" title=\"Ossuary\">Ossuary</a>, with lots of <a href=\"/Zombie\" title=\"Zombie\">zombies</a> and <a href=\"/Mummy_(monster)\" title=\"Mummy (monster)\">mummies</a>, and occasionally some exotic undead.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The <a href=\"/Bailey\" title=\"Bailey\">Bailey</a>, home to militant <a href=\"/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orcs</a> and other monsters. Many of them hold <a href=\"/Boomerang\" title=\"Boomerang\">boomerangs</a> or <a href=\"/Crossbow\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crossbow\">crossbows</a> to abuse specially-crafted terrain.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Temple\">The Temple</span></h2>\n<p>The Ecumenical Temple, located somewhere on Dungeon:4-7, contains a plethora of <a href=\"/God\" title=\"God\">gods</a>. Players who've yet to find a god, that are able to worship a god, will most likely find the temple very useful. For more details, see the <a href=\"/Choosing_a_god\" title=\"Choosing a god\">choosing a god</a> article.\n</p><p>From here on out, threats start blending in. You'll acquire the strength and tools to handle many more situations, and gain more flexibility with avoiding threats altogether. This point might not be <i>exactly</i> when you enter the Temple, but getting a god often represents a large power spike. (Note: Most gods start providing perks at 1* of piety.)\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_Branches\">Early Branches</span></h2>\n<p>While exploring the dungeon, you will find the entrances to <a href=\"/The_Lair\" title=\"The Lair\">the Lair of Beasts</a> on Dungeon:8-11, and the <a href=\"/Orcish_Mines\" title=\"Orcish Mines\">Orcish Mines</a> on Dungeon:9-12.\n</p><p>Most players will find it easier to clear the Lair first, typically anywhere after clearing D:10 to D:12.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Lair\">The Lair</span></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"/Lair\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lair\">Lair</a> features fast moving enemies with poison, who are difficult to escape from. <a href=\"/Poison_resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Poison resistance\">Poison resistance</a> is definitely recommended. If your character lacks poison resistance, or defenses in general, you might wish to explore a bit more of the Dungeon.\n</p><p><a href=\"/Hydra\" title=\"Hydra\">Hydrae</a> are another major threat, able to mercilessly tear apart your character. Even if you can survive up to 8 attacks per turn, make sure not to use an edged weapon (<a href=\"/Long_blades\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Long blades\">long blades</a>, <a href=\"/Axes\" title=\"Axes\">axes</a>, <a href=\"/Lajatang\" title=\"Lajatang\">lajatangs</a>, or heavy <a href=\"/Polearms\" title=\"Polearms\">polearms</a>) without <a href=\"/Flaming\" title=\"Flaming\">flaming</a>, lest you grow even more. Other threats include packs of hard-hitting and hard-to-hit <a href=\"/Blink_frog\" title=\"Blink frog\">blink frogs</a>, petrifying <a href=\"/Catoblepae\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Catoblepae\">catoblepae</a>, and the occasional herd of powerful <a href=\"/Elephant\" title=\"Elephant\">elephants</a> or <a href=\"/Death_yak\" title=\"Death yak\">death yaks</a>. Apart from <a href=\"/Rime_drake\" title=\"Rime drake\">rime drakes</a> or the occasional <a href=\"/Unique\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Unique\">unique</a>, monsters dealing elemental damage are rare here.\n</p><p>Like all the other branches you'll encounter, the fifth and final level of Lair is the hardest. Unless there's a <a href=\"/Portal\" title=\"Portal\">portal</a> there, you won't lose anything by leaving it for later. Feel free to exit that floor if it's too hard, and come back to it when you're stronger.\n</p><p>The Lair always has three branches containing <a href=\"/Runes_of_Zot\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Runes of Zot\">runes of Zot</a>. Two are selected between <a href=\"/The_Shoals\" title=\"The Shoals\">the Shoals</a> or <a href=\"/The_Swamp\" title=\"The Swamp\">the Swamp</a> and <a href=\"/Snake_Pit\" title=\"Snake Pit\">Snake Pit</a> or <a href=\"/Spider%27s_Nest\" title=\"Spider&#39;s Nest\">Spider's Nest</a>, while the third and most dangerous of the three is <a href=\"/The_Slime_Pits\" title=\"The Slime Pits\">the Slime Pits</a>. These are all much more difficult than Lair, so ignore them until later!\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Orcish_Mines\">The Orcish Mines</span></h3>\n<p>Despite the fact that its entrance can appear earlier, the <a href=\"/Orcish_Mines\" title=\"Orcish Mines\">Orcish Mines</a> are often tougher than <a href=\"/The_Lair\" title=\"The Lair\">the Lair</a>. Various <a href=\"/List_of_orcs\" title=\"List of orcs\">special types of orc</a>, like <a href=\"/Orc_sorcerer\" title=\"Orc sorcerer\">sorcerers</a> or <a href=\"/Orc_high_priest\" title=\"Orc high priest\">high priests</a>, will stand in your way. The scariest brutes are <a href=\"/Orc_warlord\" title=\"Orc warlord\">orc warlords</a>, <a href=\"/Stone_giant\" title=\"Stone giant\">stone giants</a>, and <a href=\"/Ettin\" title=\"Ettin\">ettins</a>; though, thankfully, only the former appears with any regularity throughout Orc.\n</p><p>The first level is often split into disjointed rooms, so make sure you explore all the staircases on the lower level to avoid missing out on treasure and experience. The second level, in turn, will always contain multiple shops to spend the gold you've inevitably accumulated by this point.\n</p><p>Sources of <a href=\"/Willpower\" title=\"Willpower\">willpower</a> are useful here to prevent <a href=\"/Paralysis\" title=\"Paralysis\">paralysis</a> or other nasty effects that orcs might inflict on you.\n</p><p>You'll find the entrance to the <a href=\"/Elven_Halls\" title=\"Elven Halls\">Elven Halls</a> on the second level, but don't go in yet, as the elves are much tougher than the orcs.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Later_Dungeon\">Later Dungeon</span></h3>\n<p>The dungeon itself (from D:12 onward) is considered the \"3rd option\" at this stage of the game. It's perfectly fine to clear all the way up to D:15 if you wish. However, plenty of threats can dissuade Dungeon divers. <a href=\"/Ugly_thing\" title=\"Ugly thing\">Ugly things</a> hit hard and move quickly, <a href=\"/Skeletal_warrior\" title=\"Skeletal warrior\">skeletal warriors</a> are even tougher, and pregenerated entrance <a href=\"/Vault\" title=\"Vault\">vaults</a> (often, to <a href=\"/The_Vaults\" title=\"The Vaults\">the Vaults</a>) contain great danger. It is certainly possible to tackle these threats early, though a character who has cleared Lair and/or Orc will struggle a lot less. \n</p><p>As a soft rule of thumb, you can stay in the Dungeon, until you find a threat that's too much for you to handle. Then, go to either Lair or Orc.\n</p><p>You'll find the entrances to the Vaults and <a href=\"/The_Depths\" title=\"The Depths\">the Depths</a> before too long, but you should leave these for later. \n</p><p>Once you're done with all three branches, it's time to begin acquiring the <a href=\"/Runes_of_Zot\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Runes of Zot\">runes of Zot</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"S-Branches\">S-Branches</span></h2>\n<p>The easiest branches in which you can find <a href=\"/Rune\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rune\">runes</a> are the first two Lair branches, aka S-branches. One of the branches is always either the <a href=\"/Snake_Pit\" title=\"Snake Pit\">Snake Pit</a> or <a href=\"/Spider%27s_Nest\" title=\"Spider&#39;s Nest\">Spider's Nest</a>, while the other is either <a href=\"/The_Swamp\" title=\"The Swamp\">the Swamp</a> or <a href=\"/The_Shoals\" title=\"The Shoals\">the Shoals</a>. They're listed below in rough order of difficulty, from easiest to hardest. You might also refer to the Elven Halls section, if all the branches are too hard for you.\n</p><p>Poison resistance is helpful in Swamp and almost a requirement in Snake Pit and Spider's Nest. If you still haven't found any, you can attempt to slay a <a href=\"/Swamp_dragon\" title=\"Swamp dragon\">swamp dragon</a> for <a href=\"/Swamp_dragon_scales\" title=\"Swamp dragon scales\">its scales</a> in Swamp, hope for equipment to show up in Shoals, or (dubiously) explore levels 1-2 of the <a href=\"/Elven_Halls\" title=\"Elven Halls\">Elven Halls</a>.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/Slime_Pits\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Slime Pits\">Slime Pits</a> can also be found in the Lair, but they should be saved for later.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Snake_Pit\">Snake Pit</span></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"/Snake_Pit\" title=\"Snake Pit\">Snake Pit</a> is populated by hordes of <a href=\"/List_of_snakes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"List of snakes\">snakes</a> and <a href=\"/List_of_nagas\" title=\"List of nagas\">nagas</a>; <a href=\"/Poison\" title=\"Poison\">Poison</a> damage and <a href=\"/Constriction\" title=\"Constriction\">constriction</a> are both common, and <a href=\"/Mana_viper\" title=\"Mana viper\">mana vipers</a> are especially dangerous to spellcasters. Most of the nagas move fairly slow (until <a href=\"/Haste\" title=\"Haste\">hasted</a>), which combined with the Pit's Dungeon-like layout, allows you to control threats with ease. To compensate, they'll come with ranged attacks, especially if you encounter <a href=\"/Vashnia\" title=\"Vashnia\">Vashnia</a>'s crew. Non-humanoid snakes are fast... though most are slowed down by <a href=\"/Cold\" title=\"Cold\">cold</a>.\n</p><p>In addition to the obvious choice of <a href=\"/Poison_resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Poison resistance\">poison resistance</a>, <a href=\"/Fire_resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fire resistance\">fire resistance</a> will help with the <a href=\"/Salamander\" title=\"Salamander\">salamanders</a>, and <a href=\"/Electricity_resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Electricity resistance\">electricity resistance</a> will help with the <a href=\"/Shock_serpent\" title=\"Shock serpent\">shock serpents</a>.\n</p><p>If you're well prepared, and take things carefully, it won't take long until you slither across the <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">serpentine rune of Zot</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Swamp\">Swamp</span></h3>\n<p>The Swamp is an open marsh filled with trees and water, and its inhabitants won't let you forget that.\n</p><p>Right off the bat, <a href=\"/Eleionoma\" title=\"Eleionoma\">Eleionomae</a> and <a href=\"/Spriggan_druid\" title=\"Spriggan druid\">spriggan druids</a> will force you to beware of direct wooded contact. And be careful to only fight from solid ground, unless your character does well in shallow water or can <a href=\"/Fly\" title=\"Fly\">fly</a>. Even then, <a href=\"/Hydra\" title=\"Hydra\">hydras</a> (remember Lair?) and the many other threats of Swamp will straight up outrun you unless you are both flying <i>and</i> <a href=\"/Haste\" title=\"Haste\">hasted</a>. Fortunately, if you've found a way to clear the multi-headed foes, those threats shouldn't be <i>too</i> hard to deal with. It might still be a struggle when a <a href=\"/Swamp_worm\" title=\"Swamp worm\">swamp worm</a> pulls you into unfamiliar territory, especially if you don't have resistances (poison, <a href=\"/Willpower\" title=\"Willpower\">willpower</a> for <a href=\"/Fenstrider_witch\" title=\"Fenstrider witch\">fenstrider witches</a>, rCorr for <a href=\"/Goliath_frog\" title=\"Goliath frog\">goliath frogs</a>) to manage.\n</p><p>Some of the other bigger threats include <a href=\"/Thorn_hunter\" title=\"Thorn hunter\">thorn hunters</a>, <a href=\"/Shambling_mangrove\" title=\"Shambling mangrove\">shambling mangroves</a>, <a href=\"/Tentacled_monstrosities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tentacled monstrosities\">tentacled monstrosities</a>, and at the end, possibly even <a href=\"/The_Lernaean_hydra\" title=\"The Lernaean hydra\">the Lernaean hydra</a>. But if you can overcome it all, you will eventually find the <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">decaying rune of Zot</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Shoals\">Shoals</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/The_Shoals\" title=\"The Shoals\">The Shoals</a> are made up of several islands, surrounded by vast amounts of water. A source of flight is useful, as you'll probably need to fight from solid ground or <a href=\"/Fly\" title=\"Fly\">fly</a> to avoid incurring penalties. Also useful is a source of invisibility, since almost none of the monsters here can see invisible. (However, invisibility is ineffective if you are standing in water instead of flying)\n</p><p>Expect to have to deal with foes such as <a href=\"/List_of_merfolk\" title=\"List of merfolk\">merfolk bands</a>, <a href=\"/List_of_centaurs#satyrs\" title=\"List of centaurs\">various satyrs</a>, and perhaps even the dreadful Witch of the Tides, <a href=\"/Ilsuiw\" title=\"Ilsuiw\">Ilsuiw</a>. Many of the enemies here use <a href=\"/Hexes\" title=\"Hexes\">Hexes</a>, so <a href=\"/Willpower\" title=\"Willpower\">willpower</a> is important. Ranged weapons are also common, so an <a href=\"/Amulet_of_reflection\" title=\"Amulet of reflection\">amulet of reflection</a> or <a href=\"/Scarf\" title=\"Scarf\">scarf</a> of <a href=\"/Repulsion\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Repulsion\">repulsion</a> is invaluable here.\n</p><p>Whatever you do, be very careful when you explore, only <a href=\"/Autoexplore\" title=\"Autoexplore\">autoexploring</a> after you've eliminated most of the threats. Otherwise you will often find yourself trapped in combat, making your chances of collecting the <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">barnacled rune of Zot</a> very slim.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spider.27s_Nest\">Spider's Nest</span></h3>\n<p>The Spider's Nest has swarms of fast-moving <a href=\"/List_of_arachnids\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"List of arachnids\">spiders</a> that can quickly inflict severe poisoning, so don't enter without poison resistance unless absolutely necessary. But poison might quickly be the least of your worries...\n</p><p>A variety of threats will swarm you in the cavernous layout of the Nest, with few true chokepoints to abuse. <a href=\"/Tarantella\" title=\"Tarantella\">Tarantellas</a> have a confusing bite, leaving you stumbling about. <a href=\"/Entropy_weaver\" title=\"Entropy weaver\">Entropy weavers</a> will <a href=\"/Corrode\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Corrode\">corrode</a> you, lowering both armour and melee. Invisible <a href=\"/Ghost_moth\" title=\"Ghost moth\">ghost moths</a> will rapidly drain your <a href=\"/MP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"MP\">MP</a>, if you aren't <a href=\"/Invisible\" title=\"Invisible\">invisible</a> yourself. All the while, <a href=\"/Emperor_scorpion\" title=\"Emperor scorpion\">emperor scorpions</a> and <a href=\"/Broodmother\" title=\"Broodmother\">broodmothers</a> are formidable melee threats on their own. Remember -- this is all <i>with</i> the fast, poisonous brood! Fortunately, the common spiders are frail, not particularly resistant, and vulnerable to <a href=\"/Poison\" title=\"Poison\">poison</a>.\n</p><p>Once you complete the final floor, you'll find the <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">gossamer rune of Zot</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Late_Game\">Late Game</span></h2>\n<p>After you have completed both S-branches, you will need a third rune before you can enter <a href=\"/The_Realm_of_Zot\" title=\"The Realm of Zot\">the Realm of Zot</a>. However, the other rune branches are significantly more dangerous than the S-branches, so players typically clear other areas for loot and XP before tackling a third rune.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Elven_Halls\">The Elven Halls</span></h3>\n<p>If you're lacking in anything in particular, clearing the first two floors of the <a href=\"/Elven_Halls\" title=\"Elven Halls\">Elven Halls</a> may provide you with them. The Halls feature many dangerous <a href=\"/List_of_deep_elves\" title=\"List of deep elves\">deep elven</a> casters. The most common ones are <a href=\"/Deep_elf_pyromancer\" title=\"Deep elf pyromancer\">deep elf pyromancers</a> and <a href=\"/Deep_elf_zephyrmancer\" title=\"Deep elf zephyrmancer\">zephyrmancers</a>, meaning it's nice to have rF and rElec.\n</p><p>Be careful about opening the <a href=\"/Runed_door\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Runed door\">runed doors</a> on the second level, as they open to the <a href=\"/Hall_of_Blades\" title=\"Hall of Blades\">Hall of Blades</a>. This can be a dangerous place and it may not even be worth visiting if you already have a good weapon. Dancing weapons are already a big turn off for an early Elf, being fast, not that weak, and near omni-resistant.\n</p><p>Thanks to the wide variety of magic, virtually every <a href=\"/Resistance\" title=\"Resistance\">resistance</a> will come in handy, but the most important one is <a href=\"/Willpower\" title=\"Willpower\">willpower</a>. If your willpower is too low, you could be <a href=\"/Banishment\" title=\"Banishment\">banished</a> into the <a href=\"/Abyss\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Abyss\">Abyss</a>. <a href=\"/Silence\" title=\"Silence\">Silence</a> (or a <a href=\"/Scroll_of_silence\" title=\"Scroll of silence\">scroll of silence</a>) will shut off most elven threats, though <a href=\"/Deep_elf_blademaster\" title=\"Deep elf blademaster\">deep elf blademasters</a> and <a href=\"/Deep_elf_master_archer\" title=\"Deep elf master archer\">master archers</a> still remain major threats. Dancing weapons also come with high <a href=\"/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a> and a variety of resistances, meaning your own magic might not perform well.\n</p><p>Some people like to complete this branch fairly early, even before finishing any of the S-branches. While this isn't impossible by any means, it's very difficult, and shouldn't be tried by inexperienced players.\n</p><p>The final level of the Elven Halls contains a treasure chamber with massive amounts of loot, but also lots and lots of the most dangerous types of elves.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Vaults\">The Vaults</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/The_Vaults\" title=\"The Vaults\">The Vaults</a> are an excellent place to collect your third <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">rune</a>, although some characters may prefer <a href=\"/The_Abyss\" title=\"The Abyss\">the Abyss</a> or <a href=\"/Slime_Pits\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Slime Pits\">Slime Pits</a>. In any case, entering the Vaults without at least one rune is foolish, as you will have to get a rune from either <a href=\"/The_Vaults#Vaults:5\" title=\"The Vaults\">Vaults:5</a> or <a href=\"/The_Tomb\" title=\"The Tomb\">the Tomb</a> before you can exit.\n</p><p>Once you enter, the most helpful thing you can have is decent defenses: <a href=\"/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a>, <a href=\"/EV\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"EV\">EV</a>, and <a href=\"/SH\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"SH\">SH</a>. Elemental damage isn't uncommon, and there's a wide variety, so it's best to have wide spread of <a href=\"/Resistance\" title=\"Resistance\">resistances</a>. <a href=\"/Willpower\" title=\"Willpower\">Willpower</a> is particularly important for <a href=\"/Vault_sentinel\" title=\"Vault sentinel\">vault sentinels</a>, so if you don't think you can fight an entire floor at once, you'll also want that (as well as the ever present threat of <a href=\"/Paralysis\" title=\"Paralysis\">paralysis</a> from here onwards).\n</p><p><a href=\"/The_Vaults#Vaults:5\" title=\"The Vaults\">Vaults:5</a> is exponentially harder than the earlier levels, so players often do Vaults:1-4 on their own, then complete <a href=\"/The_Depths\" title=\"The Depths\">the Depths</a>, before attempting Vaults:5. Read the <a href=\"/The_Vaults#Vaults:5\" title=\"The Vaults\">V:5</a> page for a detailed list of the tools and strategies needed to reach that <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">silver rune of Zot</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Crypt\">Crypt</span></h3>\n<p>As you explore the Vaults, you'll eventually find <a href=\"/The_Crypt\" title=\"The Crypt\">the Crypt</a>, home to all manner of <a href=\"/Undead\" title=\"Undead\">undead</a>. The Crypt tends to be dangerous to any living character due to many sources of <a href=\"/Torment\" title=\"Torment\">torment</a>. You'll want <a href=\"/Negative_energy_resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Negative energy resistance\">negative energy resistance</a> (more is always better); cold resistance can also help. Therefore, it is great place for (re)gaining piety for <a href=\"/The_Shining_One\" title=\"The Shining One\">The Shining One</a> or <a href=\"/Zin\" title=\"Zin\">Zin</a>.\n</p><p>There is usually no need to enter the Crypt in a three-rune game. Characters that can take torment -- the <a href=\"/Undead\" title=\"Undead\">undead</a>, worshippers of <a href=\"/Kiku\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kiku\">Kiku</a>, and the aforementioned good gods -- won't mind, however.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Depths\">Depths</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/The_Depths\" title=\"The Depths\">The Depths</a> are fairly straightforward. Four floors of elaborate and often very open layouts teeming with monsters leading up to the <a href=\"/The_Realm_of_Zot\" title=\"The Realm of Zot\">Realm of Zot</a> entrance. Along the way, you'll find entrances to <a href=\"/The_Abyss\" title=\"The Abyss\">the Abyss</a>, <a href=\"/The_Vestibule_of_Hell\" title=\"The Vestibule of Hell\">the Vestibule of Hell</a>, and <a href=\"/Pandemonium\" title=\"Pandemonium\">Pandemonium</a>. If you are only going for a three-rune game, you will have little reason to enter the latter two branches, though the Abyss is an option for your third rune.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Third_Rune\">Third Rune</span></h2>\n<p>By the time you have completed Depths, you should be ready for a third rune. The three main options for the third rune are <a href=\"/The_Vaults#Vaults:5\" title=\"The Vaults\">Vaults:5</a>, <a href=\"/The_Slime_Pits\" title=\"The Slime Pits\">the Slime Pits</a>, and <a href=\"/The_Abyss\" title=\"The Abyss\">the Abyss</a>, in descending order of popularity.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Vaults:5\">Vaults:5</span></h3>\n<p>You should have already cleared Vaults:1-4 by this point, so Vaults:5 is all that's needed for the <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">silver rune</a>. If Vaults:4 has an <a href=\"/Escape_hatch\" title=\"Escape hatch\">escape hatch</a> or <a href=\"/Shaft\" title=\"Shaft\">shaft</a>, use it to avoid the ambush at the center. Otherwise, it's recommended to buff up with <a href=\"/Potion_of_haste\" title=\"Potion of haste\">haste</a> and <a href=\"/Potion_of_might\" title=\"Potion of might\">might</a>/<a href=\"/Potion_of_brilliance\" title=\"Potion of brilliance\">brilliance</a> before going down. Consider reading a <a href=\"/Scroll_of_teleportation\" title=\"Scroll of teleportation\">scroll of teleportation</a> as well, as you will be surrounded, and <a href=\"/Stair_dancing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stair dancing\">stair dancing</a> isn't reliable here. For more details, see <a href=\"/The_Vaults#Vaults:5_Strategy\" title=\"The Vaults\">Vaults:5 Strategy</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Slime_Pits\">Slime Pits</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/The_Slime_Pits\" title=\"The Slime Pits\">The Slime Pits</a> are found in Lair:4-5 and require quite a lot of preparation before you can clear them with any semblance of safety. Once you feel you're ready to enter the pits, you will need <a href=\"/Corrosion_resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Corrosion resistance\">corrosion resistance</a>. All three <a href=\"/List_of_eyeballs\" title=\"List of eyeballs\">eyeballs</a> inflict scary effects; <a href=\"/Malmutate\" title=\"Malmutate\">Malmutate</a> from <a href=\"/Shining_eye\" title=\"Shining eye\">shining eyes</a>, <a href=\"/Willpower\" title=\"Willpower\">willpower</a>-based <a href=\"/Confusion\" title=\"Confusion\">confusion</a> from <a href=\"/Golden_eye\" title=\"Golden eye\">golden eyes</a>, and irresistible <a href=\"/Fragile\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fragile\">fragility</a> from <a href=\"/Glass_eye\" title=\"Glass eye\">glass eyes</a>. Don't forget the actual slimes, which are pretty tough and come in great numbers. Players tend to dive the first 4 levels, going down staircases as soon as possible; there's no loot, and XP is minimal.\n</p><p>Slime:5 is home to <a href=\"/The_Royal_Jelly\" title=\"The Royal Jelly\">the Royal Jelly</a>, which spawns slimes whenever it takes damage, so fighting it without a strategy for dealing with it is a recipe for <a href=\"/YASD\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"YASD\">disaster</a>.\n</p><p>The one exception to all of this is characters who worship <a href=\"/Jiyva\" title=\"Jiyva\">Jiyva</a>, who can waltz in and pick up the <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">slimy rune of Zot</a> with zero resistance after reaching 6 stars of <a href=\"/Piety\" title=\"Piety\">piety</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Abyss\">Abyss</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/The_Abyss\" title=\"The Abyss\">The Abyss</a> is the least consistent third rune option, though it's easier than the other branches you'll run across in the Depths. Unsurprisingly, followers of <a href=\"/Lugonu\" title=\"Lugonu\">Lugonu</a> will have an easier time, as they can leave for the low cost of 15 piety. The Abyssal rune will generate on level 3-7, with higher chance the deeper you go. Players approaching the rune’s location will be notified, and have its exact tile marked on the map. Unfortunately, monster spawns also ramp up quickly on the deeper levels, so level 3 is often the deepest most characters will want to go. This might not always be your choice, as <a href=\"/Banishment\" title=\"Banishment\">banishment</a> and abyssal shifts can send you deeper.\n</p><p>Killing monsters will eventually open up a portal out (and even later, a portal deeper). As you travel through this plane, you'll acquire temporary <a href=\"/Mutation\" title=\"Mutation\">mutations</a> and various forms of <a href=\"/Stat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stat\">stat</a> drain that needs XP to be cured.\n</p><p>Teleportation is often the best way to escape a dodgy situation in the Abyss. After teleporting, you can make good use of <a href=\"/Potion_of_ambrosia\" title=\"Potion of ambrosia\">potions of ambrosia</a> to quickly heal up when no monsters have yet generated near you. Stealth and sources of regeneration help, as you will constantly be on the run (thus, have few places to heal up). Finally, <a href=\"/Apportation\" title=\"Apportation\">Apportation</a> is great for nabbing that <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">abyssal rune</a> before you teleport away.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Realm_of_Zot\">Realm of Zot</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/The_Realm_of_Zot\" title=\"The Realm of Zot\">Zot</a>, the final frontier... or maybe not, depending on your branch order. This is where you will find the <a href=\"/Orb_of_Zot\" title=\"Orb of Zot\">Orb of Zot</a>, the reason of your adventure.\n</p><p>To obtain the orb, you'll want lots of <a href=\"/Fire_resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fire resistance\">fire resistance</a> for the terrifying <a href=\"/Orb_of_fire\" title=\"Orb of fire\">orbs of fire</a> that you'll eventually encounter. Other resistances and <a href=\"/See_invisible\" title=\"See invisible\">see invisible</a> are also helpful.\n</p><p>Eventually you will arrive at <a href=\"/Zot:5\" title=\"Zot:5\">Zot:5</a>, which contains the infamous Orb Chamber. Read that page for more details on how to clear the place and finally obtain the Orb. Beware that <a href=\"/Teleport\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Teleport\">teleportation</a> is delayed in Zot, or while holding the Orb.\n</p><p>Note that even if you want to collect every rune, often it's best to clear out Zot (or at least Zot:1-4) first for the extra experience and items. Just don't pick up the orb until you're done!\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Extended\">Extended</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/Pandemonium\" title=\"Pandemonium\">Pandemonium</a>, <a href=\"/Hell\" title=\"Hell\">Hell</a>, and <a href=\"/The_Tomb\" title=\"The Tomb\">the Tomb</a> comprise the \"extended\" game, called such because none of these areas need to be visited in a three-rune game. It's perfectly fine to ignore the extended game and pick up the orb after clearing Zot:5, but for those seeking an extra challenge, ten more <a href=\"/Runes_of_Zot\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Runes of Zot\">runes of Zot</a> can be found in these branches. It's recommended to complete the third rune options and Zot before tackling extended.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pandemonium\">Pandemonium</span></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"/Pandemonium\" title=\"Pandemonium\">Pandemonium</a> is a series of endless, but stable, realms, filled with all sorts of <a href=\"/Demon\" title=\"Demon\">demons</a> and other endgame monsters.\n</p><p>It contains five runes, one of which, the <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">demonic rune of Zot</a>, is guarded by a randomly generated lord. The <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">other four</a> are guarded by unique <a href=\"/Pandemonium_lord\" title=\"Pandemonium lord\">pandemonium lords</a>. You can only enter each of their realms once, leaving the rune forever if you can't kill, dodge, or outsmart them.\n</p><p>This place requires a ton of <a href=\"/Pandemonium#Preparation\" title=\"Pandemonium\">preparation</a>, as you'll need to be able to deal with <a href=\"/Cerebov\" title=\"Cerebov\">Cerebov</a>, <a href=\"/Mnoleg\" title=\"Mnoleg\">Mnoleg</a>, <a href=\"/Lom_Lobon\" title=\"Lom Lobon\">Lom Lobon</a>, and/or <a href=\"/Gloorx_Vloq\" title=\"Gloorx Vloq\">Gloorx Vloq</a> whenever the game throws them at you. Definitely check out the <a href=\"/Pandemonium\" title=\"Pandemonium\">Pandemonium</a> article and the articles on the individual pan lords before you enter!\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hell\">Hell</span></h3>\n<p>After you enter <a href=\"/The_Vestibule_of_Hell\" title=\"The Vestibule of Hell\">the Vestibule of Hell</a> and kill its inhabitants, you'll come upon portals to the four branches of Hell: <a href=\"/Gehenna\" title=\"Gehenna\">Gehenna</a>, <a href=\"/Cocytus\" title=\"Cocytus\">Cocytus</a>, <a href=\"/Tartarus\" title=\"Tartarus\">Tartarus</a>, and <a href=\"/The_Iron_City_of_Dis\" title=\"The Iron City of Dis\">The Iron City of Dis</a>, each with their own <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">rune</a>. Obtaining the <a href=\"/Horn_of_Geryon\" title=\"Horn of Geryon\">Horn of Geryon</a> from <a href=\"/Geryon\" title=\"Geryon\">Geryon</a> in the Vestibule may be viable - albeit dangerous - for any character with high <a href=\"/Evocation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Evocation\">Evocations</a> (and also isn't worshipping a god who would disapprove).\n</p><p>All of the branches are 7 levels deep and have their own theme with relevant resistances.\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/Gehenna\" title=\"Gehenna\">Gehenna</a>: Home to fire, <a href=\"/Damnation\" title=\"Damnation\">damnation</a>, even more fire, and the <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">obsidian rune of Zot</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/Cocytus\" title=\"Cocytus\">Cocytus</a>: Realm of ice and large expanses of water. You'll find the <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">icy rune of Zot</a> here.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/Tartarus\" title=\"Tartarus\">Tartarus</a>: Full of <a href=\"/Undead\" title=\"Undead\">undead</a>, <a href=\"/Draining\" title=\"Draining\">draining</a>, and <a href=\"/Dispel_undead\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dispel undead\">dispel undead</a>. Contains the <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">bone rune of Zot</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/Dis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dis\">Dis</a>: A city where almost everything is made of iron, including the <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">iron rune of Zot</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>Each hell enforces a conduct, such as restricting use of all <a href=\"/Scroll\" title=\"Scroll\">scrolls</a>. In addition, every one will rapidly inflict <a href=\"/Drain\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Drain\">drain</a> and temporary <a href=\"/Mutation\" title=\"Mutation\">mutation</a>, which can only cured by gaining XP. Due to these effects, along with a lack of loot, it's best to skip branch floors as much as possible. Along with the already-hellish threats of each threat, delvers will want to be very prepared.\n</p><p>If you can't clear <a href=\"/The_Realm_of_Zot\" title=\"The Realm of Zot\">the Realm of Zot</a>, you probably shouldn't even bother with Hell, or even Pan. However, the Hells are required if you want all 15 runes.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tomb\">Tomb</span></h3>\n<p>Inside the Crypt is <a href=\"/The_Tomb\" title=\"The Tomb\">the Tomb of Ancients</a>, chock-full of <a href=\"/List_of_mummies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"List of mummies\">mummies</a> and home to the <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">golden rune of Zot</a>.\n</p><p>This is one of the most dangerous branches in the game, full of <a href=\"/Smiting\" title=\"Smiting\">smiting</a>, <a href=\"/Torment\" title=\"Torment\">torment</a>, and <a href=\"/Death_curse\" title=\"Death curse\">death curses</a>. Often the first thing you'll see is a band of <a href=\"/Sphinx\" title=\"Sphinx\">sphinxes</a> that can <a href=\"/Paralyse\" title=\"Paralyse\">paralyse</a> and smite you to death, so tread lightly.\n</p><p>Lots of <a href=\"/Negative_energy_resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Negative energy resistance\">negative energy resistance</a>, and some way to deal with <a href=\"/Drain\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Drain\">draining</a> are all required. Or, you could worship <a href=\"/Kikubaaqudgha\" title=\"Kikubaaqudgha\">Kikubaaqudgha</a> for that wonderful death curse protection and torment resistance.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ascension\">Ascension</span></h2>\n<p>When you've finished ransacking every place you wish, proceed to Zot:5 and claim the <a href=\"/Orb_of_Zot\" title=\"Orb of Zot\">Orb of Zot</a>!\n</p><p>To finish the game, simply book it towards D:1. Your priority now is speed: use every method of speeding yourself up available to you, <a href=\"/Dig\" title=\"Dig\">digging</a> yourself shortcuts when needed.\n</p><p>You can also make use of the game's autotravel feature, which will automatically calculate the shortest route to your destination, but this won't automatically use items for you (in the case of the orb run, pressing <b>GD0</b> will take you right to the entrance of the dungeon.\n</p><p>Occasionally, <a href=\"/Demon\" title=\"Demon\">demons</a>, <a href=\"/Orb_Guardian\" title=\"Orb Guardian\">Orb Guardians</a>, residents of <a href=\"/Pandemonium\" title=\"Pandemonium\">Pandemonium</a>, and even <a href=\"/Pandemonium_lord\" title=\"Pandemonium lord\">Pandemonium lords</a> will appear to block your path. If you can get around them, do so. If they block your path completely, only fight if you can clear a path within a few turns; otherwise, <a href=\"/Dig\" title=\"Dig\">dig</a> yourself a new path, blink, teleport, or take another route.\n</p><p>Only stop to heal if you're in danger of dying, and do so on an upwards stairway if possible. Use <a href=\"/Potion_of_ambrosia\" title=\"Potion of ambrosia\">potions of ambrosia</a> and sources of <a href=\"/Regeneration\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Regeneration\">regeneration</a> to heal yourself faster. Just travel as quickly and efficiently as possible, avoid getting pinned down, and you should escape without too much trouble.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n<ul><li>In <a href=\"/0.29\" title=\"0.29\">0.29</a>, the Abyss gives XP and piety again (but not random items).

page only covers the general strategy and route (where to go and when) of the game. For specific topics and tactics (i.e, what to do in combat), see the related pages. The following are good reads for beginners:\n\n*[[Background and race combinations for beginners]]\n*[[Character guides]]\n*[[Escaping from (and avoiding) trouble]]\n*[[Strategy guides]]\n*[[Tips and tricks]]\n*[[Weapon choice]]\n\nFor generic character building strategy see:\n\n*[[Early Game Character Building]]\n*[[Mid Game Character Building]]\n*[[Late Game Character Building]]\n\nYou can also check each of the individual [[Branch]] pages for more information on a particular part of the dungeon.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Early Dungeon==\nAs the game starts, you'll find yourself in the [[Dungeon]]. The first levels are rather simple, but there are a few notable threats.\n\nIf you do decide to take on a threat, isolate it and use any tricks at your disposal -- [[ranged weapon]]s, [[spells]], [[wand]]s, [[throwing]] weapons, and more. Remember, you're under no obligation to kill the monsters '''now'''. ''You'' get more powerful over the course of the game. The uniques and other \"local bullies\" don't. It is perfectly fine to partially skip a dangerous level and come back later if you want to.\n\n===D:1===\nWhile the first floor is the simplest, it isn't something to be taken lightly. Physically weaker characters (those not of a Warrior start) have to beware of fast monsters, namely [[jackal]]s and [[quokka]]s, as you can't retreat from them. [[Gnoll]]s are also tough enemies. Thankfully, you won't have to fight any [[unique]]s or gnoll packs just yet. Even as a tough brute, you'll want to always limit monster interactions to one at a time.\n\n===D:2===\nThe threat of fast enemies persists, this time being [[adder]]s. Adders are surprisingly difficult; their [[poison]] can catch up to you quickly. If absolutely necessary, drink [[potion]]s and hope for a [[potion of curing]] or other threat-ending consumable. [[Gnoll]]s and even [[orc]]s can form bands (i.e. large groups). You don't want to be skewered by 3 [[spear]]-wielding gnolls, hitting you from afar, all at once. And you most likely won't want to deal with [[orc wizard]]s or [[orc priest]]s (detailed below) yet.\n\n===D:3+===\n*[[Orc priest]]s are 'in-depth' along with orc bands from D:3 onwards, though [[out of depth]] spawns can reach even into D:2. Low-HP species will be perennially afraid, as priests can [[smite]] for up to 17 damage per turn ''as long as they can see you''. Even if you've started with a stronger character, fighting a full orc pack with a priest isn't a good idea.\n\n*[[Ogre (monster)|Ogre]]s tend to spawn on D:4. Dealing up to 39 damage per melee hit thanks to their [[giant club]]s, ogres can easily 1-shot or 2-shot players. Thankfully, they attack slowly.\n\n*[[Centaur]]s have a natural depth of D:5. They can outrun you while being able to pelt arrows from range. You'll either need to face them in melee (where they won't fire at you anymore), or otherwise [[Escaping from (and avoiding) trouble|use an item]] to ease the situation.\n\nOf course, there'll be threats everywhere, but these are some of the early highlights. Depending on your character build, you might find some of these threats unamusing. For example: An ordinary, average HP melee fighter won't find much difficulty with centaurs, if they hide behind walls in order to restrict [[line of sight]]. (Sight is reciprocal; if you can't see them, they can't see you).\n\nHowever, there's a few monsters which are very dangerous to face...\n\n===Uniques===\n[[Unique monster]]s always have a name, and can only spawn once per game. More often than not, they'll stand out from the crowd -- in a way that'll most likely get you killed. A D:2 [[Sigmund]] receives his title of \"Dreaded\" for good reason! Other extremely scary uniques are [[Grinder]] (who can [[paralyze]] you, meaning you'll take many enemy attacks while you have no [[EV]]) and [[Ijyb]] (who always spawns with a [[wand]]). Regardless, if you're unfamiliar, you should check them out with '''x''' '''v''' in order to see their abilities.\n\n===Portals===\nThroughout the game, you will find various [[portal]]s to optional levels. Many of the portals are timed, so if you wish to enter them at all, you must do so quickly!\n\nPortal levels have different themes, so always look up whichever portal you've found, and consider whether you're equipped to deal with it. Some of these are obvious; you'll want fire resistance for the [[Volcano]], and cold resistance for the [[Ice Cave]]. If the portal abuses your weaknesses, skip it! Likewise, if the \"guards\" around the portal are too tough for you, you probably won't survive long in the portal itself.\n\nBefore you venture into these portals, be sure you have enough space in your inventory to bring back any loot you find, as you won't be able to re-enter the portal. Once you're in, take stock of the situation, and explore carefully. Keep track of the exit portals - there's always at least one handy - and leave whenever you feel you're outmatched!\n\nSome of the first portals you might see include:\n\n*The [[Sewer]], filled with lots of water, and mostly weak monsters. Watch out for [[poison]]ous snakes, and whatever lurks at the end of this portal.\n\n*The [[Ossuary]], with lots of [[zombie]]s and [[mummy (monster)|mummies]], and occasionally some exotic undead.\n\n*The [[Bailey]], home to militant [[orc]]s and other monsters. Many of them hold [[boomerang]]s or [[crossbow]]s to abuse specially-crafted terrain.\n\n==The Temple==\nThe Ecumenical Temple, located somewhere on Dungeon:4-7, contains a plethora of [[god]]s. Players who've yet to find a god, that are able to worship a god, will most likely find the temple very useful. For more details, see the [[choosing a god]] article.\n\nFrom here on out, threats start blending in. You'll acquire the strength and tools to handle many more situations, and gain more flexibility with avoiding threats altogether. This point might not be ''exactly'' when you enter the Temple, but getting a god often represents a large power spike. (Note: Most gods start providing perks at 1* of piety.)\n\n==Early Branches==\nWhile exploring the dungeon, you will find the entrances to [[the Lair|the Lair of Beasts]] on Dungeon:8-11, and the [[Orcish Mines]] on Dungeon:9-12.\n\nMost players will find it easier to clear the Lair first, typically anywhere after clearing D:10 to D:12.\n\n===The Lair===\nThe [[Lair]] features fast moving enemies with poison, who are difficult to escape from. [[Poison resistance]] is definitely recommended. If your character lacks poison resistance, or defenses in general, you might wish to explore a bit more of the Dungeon.\n\n[[Hydra]]e are another major threat, able to mercilessly tear apart your character. Even if you can survive up to 8 attacks per turn, make sure not to use an edged weapon ([[long blades]], [[axes]], [[lajatang]]s, or heavy [[polearms]]) without [[flaming]], lest you grow even more. Other threats include packs of hard-hitting and hard-to-hit [[blink frog]]s, petrifying [[catoblepae]], and the occasional herd of powerful [[elephant]]s or [[death yak]]s. Apart from [[rime drake]]s or the occasional [[unique]], monsters dealing elemental damage are rare here.\n\nLike all the other branches you'll encounter, the fifth and final level of Lair is the hardest. Unless there's a [[portal]] there, you won't lose anything by leaving it for later. Feel free to exit that floor if it's too hard, and come back to it when you're stronger.\n\nThe Lair always has three branches containing [[runes of Zot]]. Two are selected between [[the Shoals]] or [[the Swamp]] and [[Snake Pit]] or [[Spider's Nest]], while the third and most dangerous of the three is [[the Slime Pits]]. These are all much more difficult than Lair, so ignore them until later!\n\n===The Orcish Mines===\nDespite the fact that its entrance can appear earlier, the [[Orcish Mines]] are often tougher than [[the Lair]]. Various [[List of orcs|special types of orc]], like [[orc sorcerer|sorcerers]] or [[orc high priest|high priests]], will stand in your way. The scariest brutes are [[orc warlord]]s, [[stone giant]]s, and [[ettin]]s; though, thankfully, only the former appears with any regularity throughout Orc.\n\nThe first level is often split into disjointed rooms, so make sure you explore all the staircases on the lower level to avoid missing out on treasure and experience. The second level, in turn, will always contain multiple shops to spend the gold you've inevitably accumulated by this point.\n\nSources of [[willpower]] are useful here to prevent [[paralysis]] or other nasty effects that orcs might inflict on you.\n\nYou'll find the entrance to the [[Elven Halls]] on the second level, but don't go in yet, as the elves are much tougher than the orcs.\n\n===Later Dungeon===\nThe dungeon itself (from D:12 onward) is considered the \"3rd option\" at this stage of the game. It's perfectly fine to clear all the way up to D:15 if you wish. However, plenty of threats can dissuade Dungeon divers. [[Ugly thing]]s hit hard and move quickly, [[skeletal warrior]]s are even tougher, and pregenerated entrance [[vault]]s (often, to [[the Vaults]]) contain great danger. It is certainly possible to tackle these threats early, though a character who has cleared Lair and/or Orc will struggle a lot less. \n\nAs a soft rule of thumb, you can stay in the Dungeon, until you find a threat that's too much for you to handle. Then, go to either Lair or Orc.\n\nYou'll find the entrances to the Vaults and [[the Depths]] before too long, but you should leave these for later. \n\nOnce you're done with all three branches, it's time to begin acquiring the [[runes of Zot]].\n\n==S-Branches==\nThe easiest branches in which you can find [[rune]]s are the first two Lair branches, aka S-branches. One of the branches is always either the [[Snake Pit]] or [[Spider's Nest]], while the other is either [[the Swamp]] or [[the Shoals]]. They're listed below in rough order of difficulty, from easiest to hardest. You might also refer to the Elven Halls section, if all the branches are too hard for you.\n\nPoison resistance is helpful in Swamp and almost a requirement in Snake Pit and Spider's Nest. If you still haven't found any, you can attempt to slay a [[swamp dragon]] for [[swamp dragon scales|its scales]] in Swamp, hope for equipment to show up in Shoals, or (dubiously) explore levels 1-2 of the [[Elven Halls]].\n\nThe [[Slime Pits]] can also be found in the Lair, but they should be saved for later.\n\n===Snake Pit===\nThe [[Snake Pit]] is populated by hordes of [[list of snakes|snakes]] and [[list of nagas|nagas]]; [[Poison]] damage and [[constriction]] are both common, and [[mana viper]]s are especially dangerous to spellcasters. Most of the nagas move fairly slow (until [[haste]]d), which combined with the Pit's Dungeon-like layout, allows you to control threats with ease. To compensate, they'll come with ranged attacks, especially if you encounter [[Vashnia]]'s crew. Non-humanoid snakes are fast... though most are slowed down by [[cold]].\n\nIn addition to the obvious choice of [[poison resistance]], [[fire resistance]] will help with the [[salamander]]s, and [[electricity resistance]] will help with the [[shock serpent]]s.\n\nIf you're well prepared, and take things carefully, it won't take long until you slither across the [[Rune of Zot|serpentine rune of Zot]].\n\n===Swamp===\nThe Swamp is an open marsh filled with trees and water, and its inhabitants won't let you forget that.\n\nRight off the bat, [[Eleionoma]]e and [[spriggan druid]]s will force you to beware of direct wooded contact. And be careful to only fight from solid ground, unless your character does well in shallow water or can [[fly]]. Even then, [[hydra]]s (remember Lair?) and the many other threats of Swamp will straight up outrun you unless you are both flying ''and'' [[haste]]d. Fortunately, if you've found a way to clear the multi-headed foes, those threats shouldn't be ''too'' hard to deal with. It might still be a struggle when a [[swamp worm]] pulls you into unfamiliar territory, especially if you don't have resistances (poison, [[willpower]] for [[fenstrider witch]]es, rCorr for [[goliath frog]]s) to manage.\n\nSome of the other bigger threats include [[thorn hunter]]s, [[shambling mangrove]]s, [[tentacled monstrosities]], and at the end, possibly even [[the Lernaean hydra]]. But if you can overcome it all, you will eventually find the [[Rune of Zot|decaying rune of Zot]].\n\n===Shoals===\n[[The Shoals]] are made up of several islands, surrounded by vast amounts of water. A source of flight is useful, as you'll probably need to fight from solid ground or [[fly]] to avoid incurring penalties. Also useful is a source of invisibility, since almost none of the monsters here can see invisible. (However, invisibility is ineffective if you are standing in water instead of flying)\n\nExpect to have to deal with foes such as [[list of merfolk|merfolk bands]], [[list of centaurs#satyrs|various satyrs]], and perhaps even the dreadful Witch of the Tides, [[Ilsuiw]]. Many of the enemies here use [[Hexes]], so [[willpower]] is important. Ranged weapons are also common, so an [[amulet of reflection]] or [[scarf]] of [[repulsion]] is invaluable here.\n\nWhatever you do, be very careful when you explore, only [[autoexplore|autoexploring]] after you've eliminated most of the threats. Otherwise you will often find yourself trapped in combat, making your chances of collecting the [[Rune of Zot|barnacled rune of Zot]] very slim.\n\n===Spider's Nest===\nThe Spider's Nest has swarms of fast-moving [[list of arachnids|spiders]] that can quickly inflict severe poisoning, so don't enter without poison resistance unless absolutely necessary. But poison might quickly be the least of your worries...\n\nA variety of threats will swarm you in the cavernous layout of the Nest, with few true chokepoints to abuse. [[Tarantella]]s have a confusing bite, leaving you stumbling about. [[Entropy weaver]]s will [[corrode]] you, lowering both armour and melee. Invisible [[ghost moth]]s will rapidly drain your [[MP]], if you aren't [[invisible]] yourself. All the while, [[emperor scorpion]]s and [[broodmother]]s are formidable melee threats on their own. Remember -- this is all ''with'' the fast, poisonous brood! Fortunately, the common spiders are frail, not particularly resistant, and vulnerable to [[poison]].\n\nOnce you complete the final floor, you'll find the [[Rune of Zot|gossamer rune of Zot]].\n\n==Late Game==\nAfter you have completed both S-branches, you will need a third rune before you can enter [[the Realm of Zot]]. However, the other rune branches are significantly more dangerous than the S-branches, so players typically clear other areas for loot and XP before tackling a third rune.\n\n===The Elven Halls===\nIf you're lacking in anything in particular, clearing the first two floors of the [[Elven Halls]] may provide you with them. The Halls feature many dangerous [[list of deep elves|deep elven]] casters. The most common ones are [[deep elf pyromancer]]s and [[deep elf zephyrmancer|zephyrmancers]], meaning it's nice to have rF and rElec.\n\nBe careful about opening the [[runed door]]s on the second level, as they open to the [[Hall of Blades]]. This can be a dangerous place and it may not even be worth visiting if you already have a good weapon. Dancing weapons are already a big turn off for an early Elf, being fast, not that weak, and near omni-resistant.\n\nThanks to the wide variety of magic, virtually every [[resistance]] will come in handy, but the most important one is [[willpower]]. If your willpower is too low, you could be [[banishment|banished]] into the [[Abyss]]. [[Silence]] (or a [[scroll of silence]]) will shut off most elven threats, though [[deep elf blademaster]]s and [[Deep elf master archer|master archers]] still remain major threats. Dancing weapons also come with high [[AC]] and a variety of resistances, meaning your own magic might not perform well.\n\nSome people like to complete this branch fairly early, even before finishing any of the S-branches. While this isn't impossible by any means, it's very difficult, and shouldn't be tried by inexperienced players.\n\nThe final level of the Elven Halls contains a treasure chamber with massive amounts of loot, but also lots and lots of the most dangerous types of elves.\n\n===The Vaults===\n[[The Vaults]] are an excellent place to collect your third [[Rune of Zot|rune]], although some characters may prefer [[the Abyss]] or [[Slime Pits]]. In any case, entering the Vaults without at least one rune is foolish, as you will have to get a rune from either [[The Vaults#Vaults:5|Vaults:5]] or [[the Tomb]] before you can exit.\n\nOnce you enter, the most helpful thing you can have is decent defenses: [[AC]], [[EV]], and [[SH]]. Elemental damage isn't uncommon, and there's a wide variety, so it's best to have wide spread of [[resistance]]s. [[Willpower]] is particularly important for [[vault sentinel]]s, so if you don't think you can fight an entire floor at once, you'll also want that (as well as the ever present threat of [[paralysis]] from here onwards).\n\n[[The Vaults#Vaults:5|Vaults:5]] is exponentially harder than the earlier levels, so players often do Vaults:1-4 on their own, then complete [[the Depths]], before attempting Vaults:5. Read the [[The_Vaults#Vaults:5|V:5]] page for a detailed list of the tools and strategies needed to reach that [[Rune of Zot|silver rune of Zot]].\n\n===Crypt===\nAs you explore the Vaults, you'll eventually find [[the Crypt]], home to all manner of [[undead]]. The Crypt tends to be dangerous to any living character due to many sources of [[torment]]. You'll want [[negative energy resistance]] (more is always better); cold resistance can also help. Therefore, it is great place for (re)gaining piety for [[The Shining One]] or [[Zin]].\n\nThere is usually no need to enter the Crypt in a three-rune game. Characters that can take torment -- the [[undead]], worshippers of [[Kiku]], and the aforementioned good gods -- won't mind, however.\n\n===Depths===\n[[The Depths]] are fairly straightforward. Four floors of elaborate and often very open layouts teeming with monsters leading up to the [[The Realm of Zot|Realm of Zot]] entrance. Along the way, you'll find entrances to [[the Abyss]], [[the Vestibule of Hell]], and [[Pandemonium]]. If you are only going for a three-rune game, you will have little reason to enter the latter two branches, though the Abyss is an option for your third rune.\n\n==Third Rune==\nBy the time you have completed Depths, you should be ready for a third rune. The three main options for the third rune are [[The Vaults#Vaults:5|Vaults:5]], [[the Slime Pits]], and [[the Abyss]], in descending order of popularity.\n\n===Vaults:5===\nYou should have already cleared Vaults:1-4 by this point, so Vaults:5 is all that's needed for the [[Rune of Zot|silver rune]]. If Vaults:4 has an [[escape hatch]] or [[shaft]], use it to avoid the ambush at the center. Otherwise, it's recommended to buff up with [[potion of haste|haste]] and [[potion of might|might]]/[[potion of brilliance|brilliance]] before going down. Consider reading a [[scroll of teleportation]] as well, as you will be surrounded, and [[stair dancing]] isn't reliable here. For more details, see [[The Vaults#Vaults:5 Strategy|Vaults:5 Strategy]].\n\n===Slime Pits===\n[[The Slime Pits]] are found in Lair:4-5 and require quite a lot of preparation before you can clear them with any semblance of safety. Once you feel you're ready to enter the pits, you will need [[corrosion resistance]]. All three [[list of eyeballs|eyeballs]] inflict scary effects; [[Malmutate]] from [[shining eye]]s, [[willpower]]-based [[confusion]] from [[golden eye]]s, and irresistible [[Fragile|fragility]] from [[glass eye]]s. Don't forget the actual slimes, which are pretty tough and come in great numbers. Players tend to dive the first 4 levels, going down staircases as soon as possible; there's no loot, and XP is minimal.\n\nSlime:5 is home to [[the Royal Jelly]], which spawns slimes whenever it takes damage, so fighting it without a strategy for dealing with it is a recipe for [[YASD|disaster]].\n\nThe one exception to all of this is characters who worship [[Jiyva]], who can waltz in and pick up the [[Rune of Zot|slimy rune of Zot]] with zero resistance after reaching 6 stars of [[piety]].\n\n===Abyss===\n[[The Abyss]] is the least consistent third rune option, though it's easier than the other branches you'll run across in the Depths. Unsurprisingly, followers of [[Lugonu]] will have an easier time, as they can leave for the low cost of 15 piety. The Abyssal rune will generate on level 3-7, with higher chance the deeper you go. Players approaching the rune’s location will be notified, and have its exact tile marked on the map. Unfortunately, monster spawns also ramp up quickly on the deeper levels, so level 3 is often the deepest most characters will want to go. This might not always be your choice, as [[banishment]] and abyssal shifts can send you deeper.\n\nKilling monsters will eventually open up a portal out (and even later, a portal deeper). As you travel through this plane, you'll acquire temporary [[mutation]]s and various forms of [[stat]] drain that needs XP to be cured.\n\nTeleportation is often the best way to escape a dodgy situation in the Abyss. After teleporting, you can make good use of [[potion of ambrosia|potions of ambrosia]] to quickly heal up when no monsters have yet generated near you. Stealth and sources of regeneration help, as you will constantly be on the run (thus, have few places to heal up). Finally, [[Apportation]] is great for nabbing that [[rune of Zot|abyssal rune]] before you teleport away.\n\n==Realm of Zot==\n[[The Realm of Zot|Zot]], the final frontier... or maybe not, depending on your branch order. This is where you will find the [[Orb of Zot]], the reason of your adventure.\n\nTo obtain the orb, you'll want lots of [[fire resistance]] for the terrifying [[orb of fire|orbs of fire]] that you'll eventually encounter. Other resistances and [[see invisible]] are also helpful.\n\nEventually you will arrive at [[Zot:5]], which contains the infamous Orb Chamber. Read that page for more details on how to clear the place and finally obtain the Orb. Beware that [[teleport]]ation is delayed in Zot, or while holding the Orb.\n\nNote that even if you want to collect every rune, often it's best to clear out Zot (or at least Zot:1-4) first for the extra experience and items. Just don't pick up the orb until you're done!\n\n==Extended==\n[[Pandemonium]], [[Hell]], and [[the Tomb]] comprise the \"extended\" game, called such because none of these areas need to be visited in a three-rune game. It's perfectly fine to ignore the extended game and pick up the orb after clearing Zot:5, but for those seeking an extra challenge, ten more [[runes of Zot]] can be found in these branches. It's recommended to complete the third rune options and Zot before tackling extended.\n\n===Pandemonium===\nThe [[Pandemonium]] is a series of endless, but stable, realms, filled with all sorts of [[demon]]s and other endgame monsters.\n\nIt contains five runes, one of which, the [[Rune of Zot|demonic rune of Zot]], is guarded by a randomly generated lord. The [[Rune of Zot|other four]] are guarded by unique [[pandemonium lord]]s. You can only enter each of their realms once, leaving the rune forever if you can't kill, dodge, or outsmart them.\n\nThis place requires a ton of [[Pandemonium#Preparation|preparation]], as you'll need to be able to deal with [[Cerebov]], [[Mnoleg]], [[Lom Lobon]], and/or [[Gloorx Vloq]] whenever the game throws them at you. Definitely check out the [[Pandemonium]] article and the articles on the individual pan lords before you enter!\n\n===Hell===\nAfter you enter [[the Vestibule of Hell]] and kill its inhabitants, you'll come upon portals to the four branches of Hell: [[Gehenna]], [[Cocytus]], [[Tartarus]], and [[The Iron City of Dis]], each with their own [[Rune of Zot|rune]]. Obtaining the [[Horn of Geryon]] from [[Geryon]] in the Vestibule may be viable - albeit dangerous - for any character with high [[Evocation]]s (and also isn't worshipping a god who would disapprove).\n\nAll of the branches are 7 levels deep and have their own theme with relevant resistances.\n\n*[[Gehenna]]: Home to fire, [[damnation]], even more fire, and the [[Rune of Zot|obsidian rune of Zot]].\n*[[Cocytus]]: Realm of ice and large expanses of water. You'll find the [[Rune of Zot|icy rune of Zot]] here.\n*[[Tartarus]]: Full of [[undead]], [[draining]], and [[dispel undead]]. Contains the [[Rune of Zot|bone rune of Zot]].\n*[[Dis]]: A city where almost everything is made of iron, including the [[Rune of Zot|iron rune of Zot]].\n\nEach hell enforces a conduct, such as restricting use of all [[scroll]]s. In addition, every one will rapidly inflict [[drain]] and temporary [[mutation]], which can only cured by gaining XP. Due to these effects, along with a lack of loot, it's best to skip branch floors as much as possible. Along with the already-hellish threats of each threat, delvers will want to be very prepared.\n\nIf you can't clear [[the Realm of Zot]], you probably shouldn't even bother with Hell, or even Pan. However, the Hells are required if you want all 15 runes.\n\n===Tomb===\nInside the Crypt is [[The Tomb|the Tomb of Ancients]], chock-full of [[list of mummies|mummies]] and home to the [[Rune of Zot|golden rune of Zot]].\n\nThis is one of the most dangerous branches in the game, full of [[smiting]], [[torment]], and [[death curse]]s. Often the first thing you'll see is a band of [[sphinx]]es that can [[paralyse]] and smite you to death, so tread lightly.\n\nLots of [[negative energy resistance]], and some way to deal with [[drain]]ing are all required. Or, you could worship [[Kikubaaqudgha]] for that wonderful death curse protection and torment resistance.\n\n==Ascension==\nWhen you've finished ransacking every place you wish, proceed to Zot:5 and claim the [[Orb of Zot]]!\n\nTo finish the game, simply book it towards D:1. Your priority now is speed: use every method of speeding yourself up available to you, [[dig]]ging yourself shortcuts when needed.\n\nYou can also make use of the game's autotravel feature, which will automatically calculate the shortest route to your destination, but this won't automatically use items for you (in the case of the orb run, pressing '''GD0''' will take you right to the entrance of the dungeon.\n\nOccasionally, [[demon]]s, [[Orb Guardian]]s, residents of [[Pandemonium]], and even [[Pandemonium lord]]s will appear to block your path. If you can get around them, do so. If they block your path completely, only fight if you can clear a path within a few turns; otherwise, [[dig]] yourself a new path, blink, teleport, or take another route.\n\nOnly stop to heal if you're in danger of dying, and do so on an upwards stairway if possible. Use [[potion of ambrosia|potions of ambrosia]] and sources of [[regeneration]] to heal yourself faster. Just travel as quickly and efficiently as possible, avoid getting pinned down, and you should escape without too much trouble.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], the Abyss gives XP and piety again (but not random items). However, you'll always end up on the deepest floor you've been on, still making it harder to [[scum]].\n*In [[0.28]], the Abyss itself no longer gives items, XP, or piety. Prior to this, it was possible for strong characters to scum relatively safely in the Abyss for whatever they needed.\n*In [[0.14]], [[the Depths]] branch replaced D:16-27, and it was made necessary to obtain a [[rune of Zot]] to enter [[the Vaults]].\n\n{{Guides}}\n\n[[Category:Strategy Guides]]"}

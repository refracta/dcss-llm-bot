All characters need to heal when combat wears them out, preferably in a hurry, but not all methods of healings are suitable for all characters. The following is a list of all means of HP recovery:\n\n==Healing Naturally==\n*Injured characters recover HP over time, allowing you to recover after combat by simply standing around. You can pass a single turn by pressing '''.''' or up to 100 turns by pressing '''5'''. The amount you recover is based upon your character's [[regeneration rate]].\n**Be aware that [[troll]]s, well-fed [[vampire]]s, and [[vine stalker]]s recover HP faster than normal this way, while [[deep dwarves]] and bloodless vampires won't recover HP from resting at all.\n**Wearing an [[amulet of regeneration]], [[troll leather armour]], [[artefact]] with the Regeneration intrinsic, or having the [[Good mutations#Regeneration|Regeneration]] [[mutation]] increase your regeneration rate.\n**By contrast, having the [[Slow Healing]] mutation decrease your regeneration rate whenever monsters are around.\n\n==Healing Through Spells==\n*The [[Regeneration]] spell gives you a temporary but massive boost to your regeneration rate, allowing you to recover quickly.\n*The [[Vampiric Draining]] spell allows you to steal HP from adjacent living enemies.\n*The [[Borgnjor's Revivification]] spell immediately recovers all your HP, but casting it permanently reduces your max HP by a small amount.\n\n==Divine Healing==\n*[[Elyvilon]]'s abilities allow you to directly heal yourself or others.\n*[[Gozag]]'s Potion Petition ability may give you the chance to buy a healing potion.\n*[[Makhleb]]'s followers may recover HP each time they kill a monster.\n*[[Ru]]'s Draw Out Power ability restores some HP at the cost of [[drain]]ing you.\n*[[The Shining One]]'s Followers may regain HP and MP each time they kill a demonic or undead monster.\n*[[Trog]]'s Trog's Hand ability temporarily increases your regeneration rate, along with its other benefits.\n*[[Xom]] occasionally decides to heal you when [[tension]] is high.\n*[[Yredelemnul]]'s Drain Life ability injures all living monsters around you, granting half of the damage dealt as healing to you.\n\n==Healing Through Items==\n*Some attacks against appropriate enemies made with a [[vampiric]] weapon heal the wielder for half the damage dealt.\n*[[Potions]]\n**[[Quaff]]ing a [[potion of curing]] restores 1d7+4 HP, along with its other benefits.\n**Quaffing a [[potion of heal wounds]] restores 3d28/3+9 HP.\n**Quaffing a [[potion of ambrosia]] gives you several turns of increased HP and MP regeneration, but also [[confusion|confuses]] you while you're regenerating.\n***Bloodless [[vampire]]s and [[ghoul]]s cannot regenerate while monsters are visible. [[Mummies]] are unable to quaff potions. [[Vine Stalker]]s cannot regain HP from potions.\n*[[Decks]]\n**Drawing the [[Potion card]] from a [[deck of changes]], [[deck of war|war]], or [[deck of defence|defence]] has a chance to restore you as though you'd drank a potion of curing or heal wounds.\n**Drawing the [[Elixir card]] from a deck of changes, war, defence, or [[deck of escape|escape]] greatly increases your regeneration for several turns.\n**Drawing the [[Alchemist card]] from a deck of changes, defence, escape, or [[deck of wonders|wonders]] restores HP in exchange for some [[gold]].\n*[[Wands]]\n**Zapping yourself with a [[wand of heal wounds]] restores 3d28/3+9 HP.\n***[[Vine Stalker]]s and characters wearing the [[Robe of Vines]] cannot heal from wands.\n\n==Species-specific Healing==\n*[[Demonspawn]] with the [[Demonspawn mutations#Powered by Death|Powered by Death]] [[mutation]] have a higher regeneration rate when near fresh corpses.\n*[[Ghoul]]s can recover current and max HP by eating [[chunk]]s.\n*Hungry vampires recover some HP and [[satiation]] each time they successfully [[Stabbing|stab]] a living enemy.\n\n==Amulet of Guardian Spirit==\n*[[Guardian spirit]] causes all damage taken by your character to be split between HP and [[MP]] until your MP reaches 0. Characters that don't use MP normally can treat this as additional HP, and enjoy a bonus to regeneration rate because both HP and MP regenerate separately.\n**Quaffing [[potions of magic]] or using [[channeling]] (excellent for mummy or [[lichform]] characters) are effective means of \"healing\" characters with this amulet.\n**Deep dwarves have difficulty taking advantage of this amulet, as their MP regeneration rate is set to 0 when they equip it. However, any of the above methods of restoring MP still function.\n\n[[Category:Strategy]]"}

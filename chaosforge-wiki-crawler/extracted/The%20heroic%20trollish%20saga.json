{"title":"The heroic trollish saga","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/The_heroic_trollish_saga","type":"raw","data":"{{diary}}\n\nThis diary has been made by Newtkiller.\nI recently discovered a fade in my afinity for demonspawn. I realised that I lived much longer when I was a troll. So I decided to focus on these species. Here are the trollish heroic sagas!\n\n=The troll berserkers=\n==Newtkiller, the untitled==\n===Level 1===\nOkay, Dungeons here i come. This level passes as a brease, with the NOTABLE exception of a kobold wielding a short sword of venom... frightening. \nAs usual with trolls, I slay everything in my path, eating all the corpses I find.\nDiscoveries of level one : scroll of teleportation, potion of healing & potion of restore abilities\nInteresting thins in inventory : an encrusted granite ring, a small golden amulet, a +2 shield (which I won't wearbecause it prevents me from moving well) and a glowing elven short sword of venom (which sounds interesting, but I keep to my claws for the moment.\nAlso, an evolution to level 2.\n\n===Level 2===\nAfter beating a rat, kobold an giant mite which were groupped together (thanks for regeneration against posoin, I survived), I evolve to lvl 3. Since my intelligence of 2 seems a bit shabby should there be something dangerous later, I augment my intelligence. And my racial bonus to strength comes along.\nTwo more identifications, the potion of confusion and the one of slowing. Thanfully, there was no one there when I drank them.\nCool, a hobgobelin gave me the power to get regeneration. But I already have that...\nA scroll of detect curse now... both pieces of jewellery are uncursed so I put them on.\nAlso an uncrease to level 4 in unarmed combat... these claws are good...\nA scroll which does nothing when pressed... strange. And a golden ring. Now level 3\n\n===Level 3===\nFirst whimpy monster on that level gives me my fourth level.\nChunks of raw orc finally manage to fill my stomach. My god is now going to eat a little...\nsince i found only one stair going down on this level, i go back up and through another stair... And SURPRISE : 4 orcs, an orc warrior, a jackal, a Kobold, an a rat come to greet me. A little rage, and they die, including all the ones whoa came to battle... my skin is soaked with blood, and I feel like resting a little. While doing that, I givesome sacrifices to my god (normal, he gave me the power to kill them.\n\n===Level 4===\nThe staircase to the Temple is the only thing new here.\n\n===Level 5===\nFound a book. Keeping it to block a way with fire later.\n\n===Level 6===\nA giant eyeball, I hate those guys. Nothing better fo YASD.\nFound a shiny steel ring. Another increase in attributes, and I increase my mind (again.) Found what potions of levitation were.\nFirst shop : general store, with lots of carp which I buy to know what it is, and a wand of disintegration which I can't buy. I'll come back later then.\nAnother shop, a wand one this time. lots of interesting things here, but I don't have the money. I save for later.\nNow Ijjyb, SOOOOO easy to defeat...\nAnd dead, a potion of degeneration turned my brain to wood.\n\n=Comments=\nPlease add your comments here, signed if possible [[User:Newtkiller|Newtkiller]] 09:21, 7 March 2009 (MST)"}

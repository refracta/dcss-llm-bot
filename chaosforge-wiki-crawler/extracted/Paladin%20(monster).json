They are constantly surrounded by a 2-tile halo [[aura]] and generally come with heavy armour, a shield of some sort, and a weapon of [[holy wrath]] (generally a [[blessed blade]]). While they are legitimate threats to [[undead]] and [[demonspawn]] characters, they are extremely rare, generally only appearing on holy-themed [[Pandemonium]] and [[Ziggurat]] floors.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you want to get a blessed blade without having to worship [[the Shining One]], paladins often carry them.\n*As with other holy monsters, killing a paladin may result in the Shining One smiting you with [[Cleansing Flame]]. If you're very low on health, avoid killing any paladins lest you suddenly meet an untimely end.\n\n==History==\nPaladins were removed in [[0.13]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]\n[[Category:Human]]"}

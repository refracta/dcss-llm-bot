{"title":"Lich","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lich","type":"raw","data":"{{version|031}}\n{{list of|liches}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Liches''' are extremely powerful casters, and easily one of the nastiest creatures in the game. Their spell set includes lethal [[Conjurations]], invisibility, and a debilitating [[Slow]] that make them a concern for all but the mightiest adventurers. If the RNG is on their side, they're capable of one-shotting wounded or recklessly low-level characters.\n\nLiches can be found throughout [[the Depths]], [[the Vaults]], [[the Abyss]], [[the Crypt]], [[the Tomb]], and [[the Realm of Zot]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Melee fighters should use corners to lure them next to you, or a [[scroll of blinking]] to get into range immediately.\n*Their HP and defenses are low enough that a strong offense can defeat one in two or three hits. Weapons of [[Holy wrath]] and [[Dispel Undead]] can speed this up even more, particularly while buffed.\n*[[Silence]] limits the lich to using its melee attack. While this does have a [[draining]] effect, it is still preferable to a lich that can cast spells.\n*[[Throwing net]]s are very useful against liches. Hitting one at the edge of your line of sight with one guarantees it won't be able to follow you for several turns, allowing a fairly safe escape. Hitting one in melee range will make it vulnerable to [[stab]]bing attempts, allowing [[Short Blades]] specialists to make very short work of them.\n*Their infinite [[willpower]] makes almost any hex worthless against them, except for [[Enfeeble]]. Find other ways to disable them if you rely on willpower-checking effects.\n\n==History==\n* Prior to [[0.27]], liches could have one of several spell sets:\n** [[Bolt of Cold]] (3d29), [[Force Lance]] (3d22), [[Summon Greater Demon]], [[Slow]], [[Invisibility]]\n** [[Bolt of Draining]] (3d27), [[Poison Arrow]] (3d27), [[Haunt]], [[Banishment]], [[Haste]]\n** [[Bolt of Fire]] (3d29), [[Iron Shot]] (3d34), Summon Greater Demon, [[Confuse]], Invisibility\n** [[Corrosive Bolt]] (3d23), [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] (3d40), [[Petrify]], Haste\n** [[Lightning Bolt]] (3d24), [[Orb of Destruction]] (9d17), [[Paralyze]], Haste\n* Prior to [[0.18]], liches had randomized spell sets.\n* Prior to [[0.16]], liches would generate with one of four predetermined spell sets."}

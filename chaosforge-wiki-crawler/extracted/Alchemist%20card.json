{"title":"Alchemist card","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Alchemist_card","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|The card depicts a bubbling flask left on a laboratory workbench.}}\n\nDrawing the Alchemist card restores some [[HP]] (and occasionally [[MP]]) in exchange for [[gold]]. The amount of healing and gold spent depends on the power level:\n*Power level 0\n**80% chance that it will spend 0-66 gold to restore 0-33 HP\n**20% chance that it will spend 0-99 gold to restore 0-33 HP and 0-6 MP\n*Power level 1\n**60% chance that it will spend 0-132 gold to restore 0-66 HP\n**40% chance that it will spend 0-198 gold to restore 0-66 HP and 0-13 MP\n*Power level 2\n**40% chance that it will spend 0-198 gold to restore 0-99 HP\n**60% chance that it will spend 0-297 gold to restore 0-99 HP and 0-19 MP\n\n{{crawlquote|\"You feel better. Some of your gold vanishes!\"}}\nThe amount of gold spent is directly proportional to the amount of healing the player receives. Actual amounts healed and spent are weighted toward the averages.\n\n==History==\nThe Alchemist card could be found in the following [[Decks|decks]] over the past several versions.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.11]]\n![[0.12]]\n![[0.13]]\n![[0.14]]\n![[0.15]]\n![[0.16]]\n![[0.17]]\n![[0.18]]\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n|}\n\n\n==History==\nThe Alchemist card was made unavailable when decks were simplified in [[0.19]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

{"title":"Silence","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Silence","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Silence''' is a level 5 [[Hexes]]/[[Air Magic]] spell which creates the Silence effect.\n\n==Effect==\nSilence itself creates an aura around the user, which mutes all [[noise]] and prevents creatures from doing the following actions:\n*Reading scrolls\n*Casting spells (all spells for the player)\n*Using [[god|divine]] abilities\n*[[T|Shouting]]\n\nMonster spells have a unique restriction. Spells or abilities that require spoken words - those with the ''Wizardly'', ''Vocal'', or ''Priest'' [[spell slot flags]] - are stopped by Silence. For example, most [[demon]]s are immune to silence - they use the ''Magical'' spell flag, meaning they cast from innate magical power rather than reciting from a [[spellbook]]. Even player spells like [[Fire Storm]] can be cast if they are set with the Magical flag.\n\nThe silence aura also inflicts a -50 [[stealth]] penalty while players are emitting it.\n\nFor the Silence spell, the duration and radius of this aura depends on [[spellpower]], but is slightly randomized. Using a [[scroll of silence]] creates a similar effect at a power of 30 - on average, creating a radius 4-5 aura.\n\n===Radius===\nThe radius starts shrinking with 43 turns to go, and during the last 6 turns only the center tile (you) is silenced. Pre-squared radius is reduced linearly from 37 = 6*6+1, which means that radius is reduced like <code>sqrt(duration)</code> - slowly at large radius, and faster near the end.\n\nThe Silence spell creates an aura with a duration of <code>19 + power/5 + 1d(power/2)</code> turns (capped at 100 turns)<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-selfench.cc|208}}</ref>.\n\nThat's at least 10 turns, at most 100. At 50 power (mid-game caster) you'll get an average of 34, which means you'll usually start below maximal radius.\n\n==Sources==\n*The spell and [[scroll of silence|scroll]]\n*Possible effect from [[Throw Klown Pie]], with a radius of 2.\n*Innate aura from [[silent spectre]]s.\n*The [[demonspawn mutation]], [[Black Mark (mutation)|Black Mark]] 3 (permanent radius 1, excluding your own tile)\n\n==Strategy==\nSilence stops certain types of enemies cold. So long as you can deal damage without casting spells, you can reduce many [[unique]]s and devastating spellcasters into pitiful melee opponents. Just be sure to defeat them before Silence wears out; the period where silence only affects you is especially deadly. [[Scrolls of silence]] replicate the effect of the silence spell, though the scrolls are rare and have a short duration.\n\nMake sure to use '''[[x]]''' then '''[[v]]''' (or right click in Tiles mode) to confirm that a given enemy is affected by silence. Examples of enemies that silence ''does'' work on include all sorts of [[list of deep elves|deep elves]], [[lich]]es, and [[mummy priest]]s. Examples of enemies that silence ''does not'' work on include [[dragon]]s, [[eyeball]]s, and all types of [[demon]]s (such as [[Azrael]], [[Mara]], and all [[pandemonium lord]]s).\n\nA [[potion of cancellation]] can end your own silence aura early. While it also dispels any buffs you had, ending silence can be worth it in order to use escape tools, such as god abilities and [[scrolls of blinking]].\n\nOn the other hand, monster silence can be incredibly threatening, even for melee characters, as losing escape tools is very dangerous. To escape silence, a player would need to walk away. As the most common silencing monsters (Mennas, Ereshkigal, many silencing pan lords) are fast, this is a near-impossible task. A [[wand of quicksilver]] can end monster silence, but it is inaccurate.\n\n==Monster Version==\n{{monsters with spell}}\nThe following enemy inherently radiates Silence:  \n*{{monsterlink|Silent spectre}} (as a permanent 12-tile [[aura]], whether awake or [[dormant]])\n\nYou can end the monster spell (but not the silent spectre aura) with a [[wand of quicksilver]]. If it [[alternate items|hasn't generated]], you'll need to let the spell run its course, kill the monster, or otherwise move away. \n\nIn the case of silent spectres, their silence aura has an effect larger than your [[LOS]], so you will have to resort to non-silenceable means of fighting them.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], silence lasted for <code>9 + power/4 + 1d(power/2)</code>, which resulted in lower duration at low spell power.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], Silence was a [[Charms]]/[[Air magic]] spell.\n*Before the magic school was removed from the game in [[0.8]], Silence was an [[Enchantments]]/[[Air Magic]] spell. Also, the spell was less reliable, because its duration had a high variance.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

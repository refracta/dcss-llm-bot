{"title":"Tukima's Studio","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tukima%27s_Studio","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n{{flavour|A marble floor of white and silver, with shades of pink here and there.}}\n\n'''Tukima's Studio''' is a beautiful mirror-lined hall of black and white marble. This [[Wizard Laboratory]] is filled with the results of her experiments with enchanted weaponry.\n\n==Summary==\nAs this is one of the smaller wizlabs, you won't need much preparation to deal with the contents if all you're doing is going in, getting the treasure, and getting out, with one significant exception: the strange machines can summon clones of the player\n\nThe rest of the vault isn't terribly dangerous.  Heavily armoured melee-oriented characters should be able to overpower the dancing weapons without too much trouble, if fighting on an isolated and individual basis; just watch out for ones with particularly dangerous brands. Casters should use non-elemental [[Conjurations]], direct attack [[Earth Magic]], or [[Airstrike]].\n\nOther than the dancing weapons, which include rarer [[ranged weapon]]s like [[triple crossbow]]s, loot includes artefact [[armour]] and a [[phantom mirror]].\n\n==Monsters==\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Dancing weapon}}\n| {{monsterlink|Rakshasa}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Walking crystal tome}}\n| {{monsterlink|Walking frostbound tome}}\n| {{monsterlink|Walking earthen tome}}\n| {{monsterlink|Walking divine tome}}\n|}\nTwo strange machines will spawn at the end.\n\n===Threats===\n{{Monsterlink|Dancing weapon}}s - Much like the [[Hall of Blades]], Tukima's Studio abounds with dancing weaponry. The weapons vary greatly in threat level depending on their type and brand - a dancing [[short sword]] of [[venom]] isn't going to be much of a threat, but a [[battleaxe]] of [[distortion]] could ruin your whole day. All dancing weapons have heavy elemental resists, high speed, high [[AC]], and high [[EV]], making them substantial threats. Near the end of the level, dancing [[ranged weapon]]s come into play.\n\n{{Monsterlink|Walking crystal tome}}s - [[Walking tomes]] of all types scatter the Studio; from rapidly throwing out living [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]]s to [[Smiting]]s. They may not have the same resistances as a dancing weapon, but they can still take a fair hit.\n\n===Strange machine===\n{{flavour| A mechanical contraption, all hisses and pops. Shadows seem to dance across its reflective surface.}}\n\n[[File:Tukima's machine.png]] The central chamber at the end of the studio holds two '''strange machines''', which summon deadly creatures. \n\n'''Spells:'''\n*[[Summon Illusion]]\n*[[Shadow Creatures]]\n\nPlayer clones are essentially the same as the ones generated by [[Mara]], or more specifically, a [[player ghost]] based on your character. It will know many of your spells, have all your melee and defensive capacities, and will benefit from any buffs you currently have active. Fighting it in a straight one-on-one duel would be risky; fighting it with multiple dancing weapons around is generally a Very Bad Idea. As such, the best approach to dealing with a player clone is generally not to deal with it at all.\n\nIt is entirely possible to deal the generator lethal damage before it can summon a player clone. If you fail to do so, teleporting away and returning when you're better prepared is a perfectly acceptable idea; the clone will vanish after enough time has passed. Buffs will help kill the machine faster, but be aware of how it'll effect your clones.\n\nOne effective tactic is to be [[invisible]]. The generators can't see invisible, and thus cannot clone you while you are invisible, making the whole experience significantly less threatening.\n\n==Map== \n[[File:Tukima_minimap_29.png]]\n\n<pre>\n            ccccccc\n            ccmmmcc\n        ccccccA.Acccccc\n       ccm...c...c...mcc\n       cc.............cc\n      cc..ccm.....mcc..cc\n      c~~ccccm...mcccc~~c\n      c2..\"\"\"cm~mc\"\"\"..2c\n     ccc.1c\"\"\"...\"\"\"c1.ccc\n     cmm..mcm.....mcm..mmc\n     cm...mcm.....mcm...mc\n     cm...mcm..2..mcm...mc\n     cm...mcm..V..mcm...mc\n     cm2..mcm1...1mcm..2mc\n     cm...mcm..1..mcm...mc\n     cm1.2mcm2.2.2mcm2.1mc\n     cc1..c'''...'''c..1cc\n     ccc..'''cm2mc'''..ccc\n      cc~~cccm...mccc~~cc\n     ccm1.mcm1...1mcm.1mcc\n     cm.3.mcm3.V.3mcm.3.mc\n    ccm..mccm2...2mccm..mcc\n  cccm...mcccm.5.mcccm...mcc\n  ccm2.-.1mcccm.mcccm1.-.2mcc\n ccm2....mcccm121mcccm....2mcc\nccm..mm...mmm.....mmm...mm..mcc\ncm4..cm......2.5.2......mc..4mc\nccm.....mm.3...4...3.mm.....mcc\n ccmd4.mccmmm.....mmmccm.4dmcc\n  ccmmmccccccdddddccccccmmmcc\n   ccccc    ccmmmcc    ccccc\n             ccccc\n</pre>\n\n==History==\n*This wizlab was reintroduced in [[0.28]].\n*This laboratory was removed in [[0.17]]. The old version had '''strange machines''', which would blink you, and '''strange generators''', which would create [[brand]]ed [[dancing weapon]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], this wizlab was rather different. Randomly-placed dancing weapons outside of the Hall of Blades lacked [[brand]]s, making the vault much safer, but also much less profitable. There were also quite a few more doors and nearly no strange machines in the paths to each chamber, the doors of which could be closed against the dancing weapons; most notably, with a shift in the strange generator's placement, all of its weapons could be safely ignored by leaving a select door closed and seeking out other entrances. Finally, the rewards contained a [[scroll of acquirement]] instead of an acquirement-level item and four scrolls of blinking.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Branches]]"}

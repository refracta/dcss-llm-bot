{"title":"Hill Dwarf","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hill_Dwarf","type":"raw","data":"{{Obsolete}}\n\n'''Hill dwarves''' are extremely robust but poor at using magic. They are excellent at melee combat, especially with [[axes]] or [[Maces & Flails|bludgeoning weapons]], and are good at using [[armour]] and [[shields]], but are poor at missile combat or at using [[polearms]] (which are usually too big for them to wield comfortably). The only forms of magic which they can use with even a minimal degree of aptitude are [[Earth Magic|earth]], [[Fire Magic|fire]], and [[conjuration]]s. They advance in levels at a similar rate to [[Elf|common elves]].\n\n==Available Classes==\nHill dwarves can be [[Fighter]]s, [[Priest]]s, [[Thief|Thieves]], [[Gladiator]]s, [[Berserker]]s, [[Hunter]]s, [[Conjurer]]s, [[Enchanter]]s, [[Fire Elementalist]]s, [[Earth Elementalist]]s and [[Healer]]s.\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[HP]] every 2 out of 3 levels.\n*-1 [[MP]] every 2 levels.\n*+1 [[strength]] every 4th level.\n\n{{Old_Apts\n|arm=70\n|ddg=120\n|sth=150\n|stb=140\n|shd=70\n|t&d=100\n|inv=100\n|evo=60\n|fgt=70\n|sbl=80\n|lbl=80\n|axs=60\n|m&f=70\n|pla=110\n|stv=130\n|u_c=100\n|thr=120\n|slg=130\n|bws=150\n|crb=120\n|drt=120\n|spc=160\n|coj=120\n|enc=150\n|sum=150\n|nec=160\n|trl=150\n|trm=120\n|div=130\n|fir=70\n|ice=130\n|air=150\n|ear=70\n|poi=130\n|exp=120\n}}\n\n==History==\n*Hill dwarves were removed in [[0.3]], due to their similarity to [[mountain dwarves]]. Their aptitudes were nearly identical, never more than ±20 in the old aptitude system (equivalent to ±1 aptitude today). MD were slightly better at magic, and HD slightly better at melee. When HD were removed, some of MD's aptitudes (notably Axes and M&F) were changed to compensate.\n:One notable difference between the species was that, back when \"non-recommended\" race/class combos were actually forbidden, HD could be [[berserker]]s while MD could not.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete species]]"}

Armed with a [[blowgun]], a [[dagger]] or [[quick blade]], and an assortment of debilitating [[needle]]s, spriggan assassins can [[confusion|confuse]] or [[paralyse]] you even if you have [[poison]] resistance. Once in melee, they will then [[stab]] you for significant amounts of damage. Spriggan assassins can be found accompanying [[the Enchantress]] and in certain spriggan-themed vaults.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*It's more than a little difficult to have both [[stasis]] and [[clarity]] at the same time, so a strong offense may be the best defense here. They're evasive but fragile, so try to hit them with strong unavoidable attacks if possible.\n\n==History==\nSpriggan assassins were added in [[0.13]] and removed in [[0.15]]\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

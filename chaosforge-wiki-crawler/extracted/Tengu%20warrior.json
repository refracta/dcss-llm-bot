{"title":"Tengu warrior","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tengu_warrior","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | tengu}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Tengu warriors''' are aggressive [[list of tengu|tengu]] combatants, with multiple melee attacks. They can slip behind the player when attacking, and come with decent armour and weapons. They can be found in the late [[Dungeon]] and early [[Depths]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Tengu warriors are not especially strong if you've cleared out [[the Lair]]. Their max damage is a bit over an [[orc warlord]]s', but spread over multiple attacks, and tengu don't have the same durability. An [[out-of-depth]] tengu, however, can be dangerous, due to their fast movement speed.\n*Tengu warriors often generate with [[ego]] [[buckler]]s or [[kite shield]]s.\n*Be careful if you are quickly pressing movement keys to attack, as these tengus can change position while attacking you.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], tengu warriors had fast movement but would not flank behind the player when attacking.\n*Tengu warriors were often accompanied with a band of [[raven]]s prior to their removal in [[0.17]].\n*Tengu warriors were added in [[0.13]], but were disabled due to the eventual scrapping of the [[Forest]]. They were reintroduced in [[0.14]], showing up with bands of [[tengu]] in the Depths, and started appearing with bands of ravens in [[0.15]]."}

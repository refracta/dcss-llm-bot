For targets of such valid holiness, it will also afflict them with [[Malmutate]]. Undead targets, which decompose rather than shift in form when inflicted with mutagenic energies, will be [[dazed]].\n\nThe card can be found in the following [[Decks|decks]] over these two versions.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.15]]\n![[0.16]] and beyond\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of destruction|Destruction]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of destruction|Destruction]]\n|----\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], polymorphing monsters caused them to heal (often to full health).\n*The Degeneration card was one of 23 cards to be kept when decks were simplified in [[0.19]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], it did not malmutate or daze targets.\n*The Degeneration card was added in [[0.15]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n{{cards}}\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

{"title":"Fruit","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fruit","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n{{flavour|A delicious edible flower ovary.}}\n\nA '''fruit''' is a [[herbivore|vegetarian]] [[food]] item which provides 850 nutrition when eaten (although [[spriggan]]s gain significantly more). Alternatively, it can be used to fuel several of [[Fedhas Madash]]'s abilities.\n\nFruit only takes 10 aut to eat, making it the quickest to eat among all food. When eaten, you receive a message revealing the specific fruit you ate. Possible fruits include:\n\n*Almond\n*Apple\n*[[Apricot]]\n*[[Banana]]\n*Bilberry\n*Blackberry\n*Blueberry\n*Breadfruit\n*Cherry\n*[[Choko]]\n*Coconut\n*Date\n*Dragonfruit\n*Durian\n*Eggfruit\n*Fig\n*Gooseberry\n*[[Grape]]\n*Guava\n*Huckleberry\n*[[Lemon]]\n*Lime\n*[[Lychee]]\n*Mango\n*Mangosteen\n*[[Orange]]\n*Peach\n*Pear\n*Plum\n*[[Rambutan]]\n*Raspberry\n*[[Snozzcumber]]\n*[[Strawberry]]\n*[[Sultana]]\n*Tangerine\n*Tomato\n*Watermelon\n\nThe message received has no actual impact on gameplay.\n\n==History==\n*Fruits were removed in [[0.21]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], there were individual items for each of the following fruits: [[apple]], [[apricot]], [[banana]], [[choko]], [[grape]], [[lemon]], [[lychee]], [[orange]], [[pear]], [[rambutan]], [[snozzcumber]], [[strawberry]], and [[sultana]]. The differences between these items were fairly minimal, and they quickly bogged down player [[inventory]], so they were condensed into a single omni-fruit for convenience's sake."}

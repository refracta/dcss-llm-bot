It places you in a maze of small, interconnected chambers filled with gold, shops, and a wide variety of unique opponents. Remembering what one can expect in each room is vital, as certain side paths are deadly to unprepared characters.\n\nSee the [[Sprint guide]] for further advice.\n\n==Layout==\nThe level map for Red Sonja is:\n\n[[File:Red Sonja level map.png]]\n\nThe dungeon map definition can be found in the source code repository<ref>https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/source/dat/des/sprint/red_sonja.des</ref>\n===Starting Path===\nYour character starts out in the upper left corner of the map. In the next three rooms to your right you will encounter [[Ijyb]], an [[ogre]], and then [[Sigmund]]. After that you can experiment on how to proceed.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Crawl variants]]"}

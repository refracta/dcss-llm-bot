{"title":"Tormentor","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tormentor","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''This article is about the monster. For a list of monsters capable of torment, see [[Torment#Sources of Torment (Monsters)|the main page on torment]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Tormentors''' are terrible [[tier-2 demon]]s which inflict [[torment]], tearing up characters without immunity or heavy resistance. They can be found in [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], the [[Hell]]s, and some monsters may summon them with [[Summon Greater Demon]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Tormentors are fast monsters which can halve your HP every turn. Not a big threat by themselves, but when near other monsters, make sure to finish them quickly.\n*Tormentors can't see [[invisible]]. While being invisible won't stop them from ever casting Symbol of Torment, it greatly reduces the frequency. Note that if the tormentor can see an [[ally]] that's vulnerable to torment, the fact that ''you'' are invisible doesn't do anything.\n*They have moderate [[willpower]], so status [[wand]]s can work well. A [[scroll of fear]] can scare them off with some reliability.\n*If [[summon]]ed by a torment vulnerable monster (e.g. [[deep elf demonologist]]s), they'll be much more hesitant to use Symbol of Torment.\n*As always, [[life protection]] (rN+) helps take the sting out of Torment significantly (5% reduction per rank). See the [[torment]] page for other means of reducing torment damage.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], tormentors used to cast the [[Pain]] spell.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], tormentors were [[tier-3 demon]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], tormentors only possessed Symbol of Torment in their emergency slot, meaning they would virtually never use it, [[Zin]]'s Sanctuary ability being one of the few ways to make them do so.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

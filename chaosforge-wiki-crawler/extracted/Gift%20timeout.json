{"title":"Gift timeout","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Gift_timeout","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\nThe '''gift timeout''' is the period during which you cannot receive any more [[gift]]s from your current [[god]], until you gain more [[piety]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nYour gift timeout increases whenever you get a god gift; the duration depends on the god. It decreases by 1 for every point of [[piety]] you gain.\n\nFor certain gods, having a gift timeout reduces your piety gain. For these gods, if you gain piety with a timeout, there's a 75% chance that you don't actually get piety - i.e., the piety is ''only'' used for reducing the timer.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|religion.cc|2436}}</ref> Not all gifting gods have this penalty.\n\nOnce timeout = 0, there is a chance, when gaining piety, to get a gift. This chance depends on the god. Afterwards, the timeout resets.\n\nWearing an [[amulet of faith]] increases your piety gain by +25%, speeding up the timeout by that amount. It also increases the chance you get a gift once timeout = 0 by 33%.\n\n==Gods==\nGods which grant gifts based on the gift timeout method include:\n*[[Okawaru]] - [[Throwing]] ammunition.\n*[[Sif Muna]] - [[Spellbooks]].\n*[[Trog]] - Melee weapons ([[brand]]s are limited to [[antimagic]], [[flaming]], [[vorpal]], or [[speed brand|speed]]).\n*[[Vehumet]] - Spells. For the first 5 gifts, Vehumet has [[Vehumet#Gift Breakpoints|another system]] in place of a timeout.\n\nThe following gods do not have the 75% piety penalty:\n*[[Elyvilon]] - Lifesaving at 5* or higher piety is based off Gift Timeout.\n*[[Nemelex Xobeh]] - [[Card]]s.\n*[[Jiyva]] - Bursts of [[mutation]]s.\n\n[[Beogh]] and [[The Shining One]] can gift ally blessings (gear, healing, new orcs for Beogh; healing/summon duration for TSO) when you gain piety, but these don't use Gift Timeout. [[Xom]]'s gifts are random, and do not follow timeout.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], [[Okawaru]] would gift armour and weapons using Gift Timeout. In addition, Okawaru's timeout for Throwing ammo was much smaller.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], [[Yredelemnul]] would gift permanent servants. Also, Elyvilon's lifesaving was not based off Gift Timeout.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], [[Trog]] gifted ammunition as well as any brand of weapon.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], [[Nemelex Xobeh]] would gift [[decks]] as physical items.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Nemelex Xobeh gifted [[decks of destruction]], [[deck of escape|escape]], [[deck of summoning|summoning]], and [[deck of wonders|wonders]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Nemelex Xobeh could gift [[decks of dungeons]] and the types of gifted decks were dependent on the types of sacrificed items. Yredelemnul gifted [[freezing wraith]]s instead of [[vampire (monster) | vampires]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Yredelemnul could gift [[rotting hulk]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], Vehumet gifted [[Conjurations]] and [[Summonings]] school spellbooks.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

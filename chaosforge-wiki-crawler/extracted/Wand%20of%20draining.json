These deal damage and reduce the target's [[HD]], rendering them weaker (and also less valuable in terms of XP).\n\n==Player Use==\nAs usual for wands, the beam from a wand of draining zapped by the player has a power rating of (30 + 2d([[Evocations]] skill)).\n\n==Monster Use==\nAs with any other wand, the bolt of draining projected by a wand of draining in the hands of a monster uses a power rating of (30 + (monster hit dice)). This gives it a typical damage output of 3d8 when used by low-level monsters and 3d9 when used by mid-to-high level monsters, and the player needs EV 19 to have a 50% chance of evading the beam without Repel or Deflect Missiles in force.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nAs a tier-1 attack wand, wands of draining provide a powerful backup attack. Melee characters should save them for living opponents that are unusually dangerous to engage in melee, such as [[hydra]]s and acidic monsters. [[Ice Magic]] and [[Fire Magic]] users should use them as a backup or alternate attack against living opponents that resist their elemental attack spells; very few living monsters have any [[Life Protection]] at all.\n\n==History==\nWands of draining was removed in [[0.18]]."}

{"title":"Paralysis","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Paralysis","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n:''This page is about the [[status effect]]. For the monster spell, see [[Paralyse]].''\n{{flavour|You are paralysed, and completely unable to act.}}\n\n'''Paralysis''' is a status effect which renders a player or monster unable to move or act for a period of time.\n\n==Effect==\nWhen paralysed:\n*Creatures are unable to act.\n*[[EV]] is set to almost 0, <code>2 + [[Evasion#Base EV|size_factor]]</code> for players, and set to 0 EV for monsters.\n*[[SH]] is set to 0.\n*Monsters are vulnerable to high-tier [[stab]]s.\n\nOnce paralysis ends, players get a brief (1-3 turns) period of immunity to all sources of paralysis. Unlike [[sleep]], paralysis doesn't end on hit. Unlike [[petrification]], there is no special damage resistance.\n\n[[Formicid]]s are immune to paralysis due to their [[stasis]].\n\n==Sources==\nThere are several sources of paralysis. Some are resistible, while some are not.\n\nSources of paralysis that can be resisted 100% of the time:\n*The spell [[Paralyse]], including [[wand of paralysis]] (2-5 turns for the player, must overcome the victim's [[willpower]])\n*The melee attacks of a [[hornet]] or [[jorogumo]] (1-3 turns; [[poison resistance]] blocks 2/3 of the time; poison immunity prevents it.)\n*The melee attacks of a [[formless jellyfish]] (1 turn; [[poison resistance]] blocks 2/3 of the time; poison immunity prevents it.)\n\nOther sources are irresistible for non-Formicids:\n*[[Stunning Burst]] (1 turn; 50% to resist with electricity resistance)\n*[[Starcursed mass]]es' shrieking, when 5+ are in sight (1 turn)\n*[[Zot trap]]s (2-5 turns)\n*[[Uskayaw]]'s or [[Zin]]'s wrath (2-5 turns)\n*Cancelling [[Death's Door]] with [[Borgnjor's Revivification]] (2-5 turns)\n*[[Stat zero]] (2-4 turns, ignores Formicids' stasis)\n\n==Strategy==\nIf a monster's paralysis can last for more than a single turn, it should be treated as '''''[[instant death]]'''''. Most monsters can kill you if you give them 4-5 free turns. Multiple monsters can ''definitely'' kill you in 4-5 turns. Even a single turn can cause a huge spike of damage. Having your [[EV]] and [[SH]] set to 0 is just the cherry on top; paralysis is nasty even for players with high [[AC]].\n\nGenerally, you should avoid paralysis as much as possible. Even a < 1% chance of instant death is too much for streak play.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\nMost sources of paralysis can be dealt with using one way or another:\n\n*The '''[[Paralyse]] spell''' requires line of fire. Spells can't be cast when a monster is [[silence]]d or [[waterlog]]ged. [[Willpower]] can protect against it, though it takes high will to reach 0% success. [[Willpower#Player resistance|Racial willpower]] matters if you want to reach 0% paralysis. See the table below for more details.\n\n*'''[[Hornet]]s''' are fast enemies which can paralyse on melee. Poison resistance gives a chance to resist the paralysis, but only poison immunity can prevent it. [[Wand]]s can often kill or [[wand of polymorph|polymorph]] a hornet with some Evocations training. [[Lignification]] can make it very unlikely for a hornet to kill you by itself, due to [[Tree Form]]'s rPois and increased AC.\n\n*'''[[Jorogumo]]''' are also fast enemies with a paralysis melee attack. Their melee works in the same way as hornets', but jorogumo have much better defenses and willpower, in addition to some dangerous ranged spells.\n\n*'''[[Air elemental]]s''' only paralyse for one turn, but when you're in range of a bunch of dangerous opponents, that can be lethal. Evasive, but relatively frail, try to target them with strong never-missing attacks (e.g. [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]], [[Airstrike]], or high Evocations [[wand of iceblast]]. A [[tin of tremorstones]] can miss, but is very accurate.) \n\n*'''[[Zot trap]]s''' require you or a monster to step on it, and the trap has to be in your [[LOS]] in order for it to function. Zot traps have a number of other nasty effects, so should be avoided if at all possible.\n{{Paralysis Spell Table}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the Paralyse spell and godly wrath could last from 2-7 turns.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], [[berserk]]ing had a chance to paralyze the player after it ends, and both [[Trog]] and [[Bad_mutations#Berserk|berserkitis]] would protect from it.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], severe [[Hexes]] [[miscast effect]]s could paralyse the player.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], [[needle]]s of paralysis existed.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], paralysis could be prevented by an [[amulet of stasis]].\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

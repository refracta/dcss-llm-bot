{"title":"Long Blades","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Long_Blades","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\nThe [[Long Blades]] skill that governs your proficiency with [[long sword]]s and other such blades. These weapons deal moderate-to-high damage, depending on whether you wish to wield one- or two-handed swords. It [[crosstrain]]s with the [[Short Blades]] skill.\n\nLong Blades use [[dexterity]] instead of [[strength]] for their attacks.\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n==List of Long Blades==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

DEX increases the evasion you gain from Dodging skill, which lends well to lighter armour.\n\nHowever, this is not an especially forcing reason to use Long Blades. A heavy armour character can use Long Blades just fine, while lightly armoured characters don't ''have'' to use one. Early on, if you find a great [[randart]] blade, don't hesitate to train Long Blades - \"DEX character\" or not.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], long blades now scale with [[dexterity]], instead of [[strength]].\n*In [[0.28]], long blades lost the ability to [[riposte]]. Base damage was returned to pre-[[0.19]] levels.\n*In [[0.19]], long blades gained the ability to [[riposte]] (counter-attack enemies that missed), with damage slightly decreased to compensate.\n*In [[0.16]], [[bastard sword]]s and [[claymore]]s were renamed back to double and triple swords. [[Blessed weapon]]s were removed.\n*In [[0.14]], double and triple swords were renamed to bastard swords and claymores, respectively.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Melee_weapon#Long Blades|List of long blades]]\n* [[Species#Melee_.26_Ranged_Combat|Table of species aptitudes]]\n\n{{Skills}}\n\n[[Category:Long blades|*]]\n[[Category:Weapon skills]]"}

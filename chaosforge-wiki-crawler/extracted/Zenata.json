{"title":"Zenata","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Zenata","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Zenata, Seeker of Sheza''' is an extremely dangerous [[unique]], particularly lethal to low-AC spellcasters. Her Sheza's Dance will summon a pack of hasted [[dancing weapon]]s, which will move at stupendous speed to encircle the player. For every two weapons adjacent to her victim, her smite-targeted Resonance Strike increases in power.\n\n==Location==\n*[[Elven Halls]]\n*[[Vaults]]: 1-4\n*[[Crypt]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Zenata will be much easier to fight if you disable her ability to cast spells. [[Phial of floods]] is an ideal tool for that, but if you don't rely on spells yourself, just use a [[scroll of silence]].\n*Hasted dancing weapons are '''blazingly''' fast. Once she has summoned them, escaping Zenata is almost impossible - even a [[scroll of blinking]] will have them rush to be in melee range of you in one or two turns.\n**Strategies that normally work against dancing weapons are as effective as ever - [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]], [[Summon Cactus Giant]], [[Airstrike]] and [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] are all spells with irresistible, unavoidable physical damage bound to tear through their minuscule HP pools. Many of these spells can also damage Zenata herself.\n*Zenata herself is not particularly durable, lacking in elemental resistances or even [[see invisible]]. She should be fairly easy to take down with a few attacks or spells - though getting this damage in before getting swarmed by her summons is a different story.\n*Expect to reset the battle a few times with a [[scroll of teleportation]] until she abstains from summoning dancing weapons for a turn or two, and leaves herself wide open for the kill. Pushing a battle when she has enough dancing weapons to completely encircle you is suicide.\n\n==History==\n*Zenata was introduced in [[0.29]]."}

{"title":"Summon Small Mammal","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summon_Small_Mammal","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Summon Small Mammal''' is a [[Summonings]] spell which summons one weak monster. \n\n[[Summoner]]s start with this spell memorized.\n\n==Useful Info==\nOne small mammal is summoned. Possible summons include:\n:{{monsterlink|Rat}} - Low damage and fragile, but better than nothing.\n:{{monsterlink|Bat}} - Extremely fast and evasive, but does virtually no damage.\n:{{monsterlink|Quokka}} - Decent damage and HP. Good all-round early on.\n\nHigher [[spell power]] can result in a stronger mammal. There is a <code>1 - 10 / <power></code> chance of a quokka. If a quokka was not summoned, there is an equal chance for either a rat or a bat.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|spl-summoning.cc|106}}</ref>\n\nDuration of the summon is around 27 turns; it does not depend on spell power.\n\nThere is a summon cap of 2; additional summons will cause the oldest to very quickly time out.\n\n==Strategy==\nSummon Small Mammal is a level 1 spell; it can kill most things on the early Dungeon floors. But, as it creates [[summon]]s, it can remain useful for a while longer:\n*By swapping places with a summon, you create a space, avoiding [[attacks of opportunity]] in the process. This can let you [[pillar dance]] any 10-speed melee enemy.\n*Even if you have no serious plans to summon things, this spell can be ''very'' effective when combined with a [[scroll of immolation]] (or the [[Inner Flame]] spell). When an ignited small mammal dies, it'll create a big (3x3) explosion, enough to take out all sorts of threats throughout Dungeon & [[Lair]].\n\n==Monster Version==\nA single cast will summon 1 to 3 creatures, with duration of around 81 turns. Each summoned creature has 33% chance of being a bat, otherwise it will be either a rat, a quokka, or a [[river rat]] with equal chances.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-cast.cc|5798}}</ref>\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], this spell had a summon cap of 4.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], this spell could also summon [[grey rat]]s, and had a summon cap of three.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], this spell could summon multiple creatures, and was known as 'Summon Small Mammals'.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], a more powerful version of the spell known as [[Vampire Summon]] was used by [[vampire (monster)|vampires]], [[vampire knight]]s, and [[deep elf summoner]]s. It summoned 3-5 mammals (with [[orange rat]]s in place of quokkas).\n*In [[0.6]], it was [[nerf]]ed again, limiting the effect to at most two summoned creatures, and [[green rat]]s and [[orange rat]]s were removed from the spell's possible results.\n*Prior to to [[0.4.3]], this spell was affectionately called 'Spammals' for its easy ability to flood your surroundings with allied monsters. The spell was nerfed somewhat for balance reasons.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

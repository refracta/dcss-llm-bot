It improves the power and/or success rate of most god-given powers. (For some gods, piety also has this effect.)\n\nInvocations also increases your maximum [[MP]], but does not stack with [[Spellcasting]] and is only half as effective.\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n==Applicable Gods==\nInvocations skill is useful when worshipping one of the following [[god]]s:\n\n<div style=\"column-count:4\">\n* [[Beogh]]\n* [[Cheibriados]]\n* [[Dithmenos]]\n* [[Elyvilon]]\n* [[Fedhas Madash]]\n* [[Hepliaklqana]]\n* [[Lugonu]]\n* [[Makhleb]]\n* [[Nemelex Xobeh]]\n* [[Okawaru]]\n* [[Qazlal]]\n* [[Sif Muna]]\n* [[The Shining One]]\n* [[Uskayaw]]\n* [[Yredelemnul]]\n* [[Zin]]\n</div>\n\nThe remaining gods do not use Invocations skill:\n* [[Kikubaaqudgha]]'s abilities are powered by [[Necromancy]]. \n* [[Ashenzari]], [[Gozag]], [[Ignis]], [[Jiyva]], [[Ru]], [[Trog]], and [[Wu Jian]] give abilities that are independent of skills.\n* [[Vehumet]] and [[Xom]] don't provide any active abilities.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], you could train this skill only if your god used it or if you had a [[manual]] of Invocations.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Nemelex Xobeh's abilities were based on Evocations.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Jiyva's abilities were based on Invocations.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], Invocations required 80% as much XP in order to train, but all species' aptitudes were 1 lower.\n \n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Skills]]\n{{Skills}}"}

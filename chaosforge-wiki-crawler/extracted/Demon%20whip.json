But even as it fell it swung its whip, and the thongs lashed and<br>\ncurled about the wizard's knees, dragging him to the brink. He staggered, and<br>\nfell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid into the abyss.”\n\n-J.R.R. Tolkien, _The Fellowship of the Ring_. II, 5, “The Bridge of<br>\nKhazad-dûm”. 1954.}}\n\n{{crawlquote|This weapon falls into the [[Maces & Flails]] category. It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Demon whips''' are one of the best one-handed weapons. They have a superb mindelay and good damage output.\n\nWorshippers of [[good]] [[god]]s cannot attack with them without suffering [[penance]]. However, worshippers of [[the Shining One]] can convert a demon whip into a [[sacred scourge]], with better stats and the [[holy wrath]] brand. You can reverse the process with [[Kikubaaqudgha]]'s or [[Lugonu]]'s blessing.\n\n==Strategy==\nDemon weapons are often found on the [[hell knight]]s in the [[Depths]] and the [[Vestibule of Hell]], often with good [[enchant]]ment levels and [[brand]]s. They can also be found early in the hands of [[Amaemon]].\n\n===Compared to eveningstar===\nThe differences between demon whips and [[eveningstar]]s are small. A +9 [[brand]]ed eveningstar is enough to win you the game, as is a +9 branded demon whip. Generally, the weapon you get ''first'' should be the one that you use. (The weapon you get first can benefit first from [[scrolls of enchant weapon]]).\n\nThere are cases where specific comparison is warranted, such as [[artefact]] weapons. Against a 0 AC opponent, a +0 demon whip is roughly 2.6% stronger than a +0 eveningstar. The demon whip attacks faster, so it is penalized more by [[AC]], and conversely benefits more from [[slaying]] and [[auxiliary attack]]s. Characters with lots of auxiliary attacks, like [[Vine Stalker]]s and monstrous [[Demonspawn]] will prefer a demon whip. Otherwise, it is mostly even: if you are at mindelay with both weapons, the eveningstar is favored slightly. This is independent of a character's [[strength]] or skill.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.14]], demon whips dealt slightly more damage than normal in the hands of [[demonspawn]] characters.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

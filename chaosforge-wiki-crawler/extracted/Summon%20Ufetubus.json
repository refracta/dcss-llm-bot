{"title":"Summon Ufetubus","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summon_Ufetubus","type":"raw","data":"{{version017}}\n'''Summon Ufetubus''' is a monsters-only spell which summons 2 + 1d2 [[ufetubus|ufetubi]] to harass an opponent, usually the player. The ufetubi are hardly a threat themselves, and the spell's duration is actually rather short, but the caster can summon hordes of them quickly. The greatest threat from this spell is that the quick ufetubi may surround you and block your movement, thereby leaving you open to smite-targeted attacks such as [[smiting]] or [[hellfire]].\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

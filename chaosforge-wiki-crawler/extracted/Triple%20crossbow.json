It takes a considerable amount of time to load and fire.\n\n----\n\n\"Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow;<br>\ndecision, to the releasing of a trigger.\"\n\n-Sun Tzu}}\n\n{{crawlquote|This weapon falls into the '[[Ranged Weapons]]' category. It is a two-handed weapon}}\n\nThe '''triple crossbow''' is a phenomenally powerful [[ranged weapon]]; at 23 base damage, it has the highest base damage of ''any'' weapon in the game. However, it's also one of the slowest weapons in the game: with a base delay of 2.3, it takes a whopping 26 skill in [[Ranged Weapons]] to reduce its attack speed to its mindelay of 1.0. \n\nUntil you get close to that point, you'll likely get much better performance out of a [[longbow]] or a well enchanted [[arbalest]]. Once you reach those near-max skill levels, however, there is little reason not to upgrade.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:triple_crossbow.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:triple_crossbow2.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]<br>triple crossbow\n|-\n| '''[[Sniper]]''' || [[File:New sniper.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], stats of the triple crossbow were changed (damage from 22 to 23, accuracy from 0 to -2), and they were affected by the [[Ranged Weapons#History|ranged weapons rework]] that applied to all launchers, including the removal of the dedicated [[Crossbows (skill)|crossbows skill]] and physical [[bolt]]s necessary to fire. [[Spriggan]]s also lost the ability to wield them.\n*Triple crossbows (as well as [[hand crossbow]]s and [[arbalest]]s) were added in [[0.15]], replacing vanilla [[crossbow (item)|crossbows]].\n\n{{weapons}}\n\n[[Category:Crossbows]]"}

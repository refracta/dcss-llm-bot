{"title":"Priest","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Priest","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n''This article is about the obsolete player background.  For information on monster priests, see their specific articles.''\n\n'''Priests''' are religious devotees of [[Zin]], the ancient and revered God of Law. [[Hill Orc]] Priests instead serve the Orc god [[Beogh]]. All Priests have some training in combat skills, but their main power comes from the [[Invocations]] granted by their god.\n\nPriests start with 45 [[piety]]. \n\n==Racial Restrictions==\n[[Demigod]]s, [[Mummies]], [[Demonspawn]], [[Ghoul]]s, and [[Vampire]]s cannot be Priests. [[Hill Orc]] Priests serve [[Beogh]] instead of Zin.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nMost species receive the following, though some [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[quarterstaff]]\n*+0 [[robe]]\n*[[Bread ration]]\n*20 [[gold]]\n\nHill Orc Priests instead receive:\n*+0 orcish [[hand axe]]\n*+0 orcish [[robe]]\n*[[Meat ration]]\n*20 [[gold]]\n\n==Starting Skills==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Fighting]]: 2\n*Chosen Weapon's Skill: 3\n*[[Dodging]]: 1\n*[[Invocations]]: 5\n\n==Strategy==\nLike [[Monk]]s, Priests start with worse gear and weapons, but have a head start with their god. Recommended species include [[High Elf]], [[Minotaur]], and [[Hill Orc]] which are strong in the early dungeon. As with all religious classes, it is not mandatory to play a Priest to worship Zin / Beogh, but priests start with Invocations skill, and start gaining piety earlier.\n\nUnlike in certain other RPGs, priests are not restricted in their choice of equipment - though [[Beogh]] boosts the power of [[racial equipment|orcish equipment]]. Priest's powers are not tied to healing or buffing, either. However, they ''are'' bound to the behavior restrictions laid down by their chosen god (at least if they want to avoid [[divine retribution]]).\n\n[[Zin]] does not inflict wrath on abandonment, unless you switch to an evil or chaotic god ([[Makhleb]], [[Lugonu]], [[Kiku]], [[Yred]], [[Jiyva]], [[Xom]]). Some priests may find it reasonable to switch to another god, using their background for the quarter staff and Invocations skill.\n\n==History==\n*The Priest background was removed in [[0.13]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete_backgrounds]]\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

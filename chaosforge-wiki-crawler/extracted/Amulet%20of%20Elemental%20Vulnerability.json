Its creator, an exceedingly practical woman, designed it to provide powerful protection against mundane jabs, stabs and bites. It's worse than useless against fire and frost, but how often does anyone really need to worry about that?}}\n\n[[File:Amulet of elemental vulnerability.png]] '''''the amulet of Elemental Vulnerability'''''\n\n+8 [[AC]]<br>\n[[Poison|rPois]]<br>\n[[Cold|rC]]--<br>\n[[Fire|rF]]--\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''amulet of Elemental Vulnerability'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|1685}}</ref> is an odd piece of jewellery. Matching the [[ring of the Tortoise]]'s amazing AC buff is great, and [[poison]] is the killer of many, many early characters. But even in the early [[Dungeon]], there are many elemental threats.\n*In early Dungeon, you'll find [[orc wizard]]s (who cast Throw Flame) and [[ice beast]]s.\n*[[The Lair]] isn't safe either; it has [[rime drake]]s and the occasional [[lindwurm]].\n*Any weapon-wielding monster can have a weapon of [[flaming]] or [[freezing]], increasing their threat level significantly. \n*You can also find [[unique]]s, like [[Dowan]], [[Azrael]], and [[Fannar]], with fire/cold attacks.\n\nOverall, this amulet will make 'average' encounters easier, but create entirely new threats in the process. Therefore, it is great for weak characters, namely those who struggle with the average encounters. Strong characters benefit much less: you can handle average encounters on your own, but this amulet can make you take damage spikes from otherwise nonthreatening enemies. (It introduces a ''player-side'' risk -- if *you* forget you are vulnerable, you can take surprising spikes of damage.)\n\nThis artefact is more likely to spawn in the early game, where it is more likely to be useful. By the time you reach [[Vaults]] and [[Depths]], there are a large amount of fire/cold monsters, so it becomes a very questionable choice.\n\n===Notes===\n*Vulnerabilities do not stack. Both rF-- and rF- give the same 150% damage from fire attacks and 200% damage from fire melee attacks.\n*[[AC]] protects against magic and most types of elemental damage, e.g. Throw Flame is reduced by AC. Melee \"[[attack flavour]]s\" (such as [[ice beast]] cold melee) are ''not'' blocked by AC - however, the ice beast needs to deal at least 1 physical damage in order to trigger the cold attack flavour.\n:In the very early game, the AC bonus can mean you take similar average damage from fire/ice attacks (though maximum damage increases):\n:*An orc wizard's Throw Flame deals 3d5 on its own. That's 9 avg. damage, 15 max. damage.\n:*With fire vulnerability, Throw Flame deals 3d5 * 1.5 damage. But the 8 AC reduces damage by an average of 4. That's 9.5 avg. damage, 23 max damage.\n\n==History==\n*The amulet of Elemental Vulnerabilty was introduced in [[0.29]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Amulets]]"}

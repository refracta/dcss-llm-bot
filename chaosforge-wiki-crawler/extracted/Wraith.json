{"title":"Wraith","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wraith","type":"raw","data":"{{version024}}\n''This page is about the [[monster]]. For the card, see [[Wraith card]]''\n\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Wraiths''' are [[evil]], incorporeal [[undead]] monsters. Like most undead they resist [[poison]] and [[cold]], and their melee attacks drain your vigor, inducing the [[slow]] [[status effect]] for several turns. Although potentially dangerous in a crowd, on their own they are fairly nonthreatening. They can be found in the middle-floors of [[the Dungeon]], as well as in [[the Crypt]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*You can summon your own wraiths with the [[Haunt]] spell, and [[Yredelemnul]] will occasionally gift them.\n*If you find a pack of wraiths, it might be a sign that [[Josephine]] is nearby.\n*Like all undead, they are not affected by forms of fear.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.18]], their melee attacks could slow only targets without [[negative energy resistance]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], wraiths would drain your [[experience]] with their melee attacks. This change accompanied the 0.13 overhaul to [[draining]] effects."}

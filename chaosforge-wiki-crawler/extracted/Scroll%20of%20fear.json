Allies of the reader will remain unaffected. Monsters that are non-living, undead, plants, berserk, or frenzied cannot be feared.}}\n\nReading a [[scroll of fear]] causes most [[natural]], [[demonic]], and [[holy]] monsters in the reader's view to become frightened and flee for a few turns. This will not affect friendly targets, such as [[summon]]s. This effect can be resisted by the monster's [[willpower]]. A scroll of fear always has a chance of failing the willpower check, even against 0 Will monsters. \n\nThe following monsters are immune to fear:\n* [[Undead]], [[nonliving]], and [[:Category:Plant holiness|plant holiness]] monsters.\n* Monsters that are [[berserk]] or under [[frenzy]]\n\nReading this scroll has the same effect as casting the [[Cause Fear]] spell with 200 [[spellpower]]. This equates to 96 \"enchantment power\".<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|beam.cc|7106}}<br>Equivalent to 35 * log2(1 + 200/35); stepdown function can be found at {{source ref|0.31.0|stepdown.cc|14}}.<br>While Cause Fear has a x1.5 enchantment power multiplier, the scroll reaches the cap of 200, so this has no effect.</ref> The higher the monster's willpower, the less likely the scroll is to succeed. See the [[Willpower#Resisting enchantments|Willpower]] article for more details.\n\n==Strategy==\nScrolls of fear are an effective \"get off me\" button. In the early/mid game, it's great against all sorts of dangerous monsters. Whether it be an untimely [[orc priest]], a pack of [[killer bee]]s, or a large crowd of [[list of nagas|nagas]] / [[list of arachnids|spiders]], it has a high (but not guaranteed) chance of success. Great escape tool, but can also be used to thin out a crowd.\n\nAs you enter the late-game, the value of these scrolls wane, since monsters have higher [[willpower]]. However, fear is still useful against groups of moderate will enemies. For example, while you probably won't scare [[Tiamat]], you'll have a great chance (90%) to fear any [[list of draconians|non-purple draconians]] and [[moths of wrath]] around her. Even if you have a 50% chance to fear each enemy, that's good - scaring 50% of the group can make a big difference.\n\nConsider your positioning, as well as the monsters' position, before using this scroll. Try to give your targets a suitable path for which to flee; if a fleeing monster finds itself cornered, it will turn around and fight.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*You can use a [[scroll of vulnerability]] to greatly increase the success chance. As an extreme example, it'll make [[Tiamat]] go from 16% to 72% success. Just beware of the usual risks of vulnerability.\n*Even in the late game, there are ''many'' dangerous enemies that have low will. [[Floating eye]]s (98%), [[moths of wrath]] (90%), and [[ettin]]s (90%) are good [[Depths]]-tier / [[Zot]]-tier targets. In [[extended]], both [[hellion]]s and [[tormentor]]s have moderate will.\n*You can check the chance of affecting nearby monsters yourself by quivering a scroll of fear. Press '''Q*''' to open your inventory, then select the scroll to quiver it. Press '''f''' to highlight susceptible monsters and activate targeting mode where you can move the cursor and check the chance.\n*You can use fear to scare monsters into dangerous clouds, like those from a [[scroll of poison]].\n\n===Success chance===\nThe chance of a scroll of fear succeeding is tabulated below:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"text-align: center\" border=1\n|-\n!Willpower !! Success (%)\n|-\n|0 || 99% \n|-\n|40 || 90%\n|-\n|60 || 73%\n|-\n|80 || 64%\n|-\n|100 || 47%\n|-\n|120 || 29%\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], fleeing monsters would not run into harmful [[cloud]]s (recklessly).\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the spell couldn't affect demonic and holy monsters.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], fleeing enemies could use [[scrolls of teleportation]] and [[scroll of blinking|blinking]] as emergency items. Also, fleeing monsters would use \"emergency\" flag spells rather than \"escape\" flag ones. This caused [[black bear]]s and [[polar bear]]s to be practically immune to fear; they would immediately [[berserk]] when inflicted with fear, which ended the fear.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

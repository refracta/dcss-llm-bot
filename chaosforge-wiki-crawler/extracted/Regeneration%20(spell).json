This unnatural act dramatically but temporarily increases the caster's health regeneration, while also speeding their metabolism.}}\n\n'''Regeneration''' is a level 3 [[Charms]]/[[Necromancy]] spell which temporarily boosts caster's health regeneration.\n\n==Effect==\nWhile active, your [[HP]] [[regeneration rate]] is increased by 100<ref>{{source ref|0.24.0|player.cc|1065}}</ref>. This effects lasts for <code>5 + 2d(<power> / 3 + 1)</code><ref>{{source ref|0.24.0|spl-selfench.cc|89}}</ref> turns. While Regeneration is active and your HP is below maximum, you also [[hunger]] significantly more quickly than usual.\n\nFor most characters, this means they will gain an additional 1 HP per turn, though this is affected by things such as the [[Slow Healing]] mutation (see [[regeneration rate]] for details). This effect can more than triple the speed at which you naturally heal, although it's more pronounced for low-level characters or characters with low maximum HP. This helps you recover between battles quickly, but don't expect it to make you invincible <i>during</i> combat; it only marginally increases your chance of survival in most dangerous encounters.\n\nAdditionally, characters under the effect of Regeneration will recover from [[sickness]] much faster. The increased recovery rate also helps counteract [[poison]] damage, making it much easier to simply wait out. As such, Regeneration can help you conserve [[potions of curing]] and lessens the need for [[poison resistance]].\n\nBe aware that Regeneration stacks with items that grant similar effects, such as an [[amulet of regeneration]], [[troll leather armour]], or being a [[troll]] or [[vine stalker]]. The effect does not stack with [[Trog's Hand]], but followers of Trog can't cast spells anyway, so the issue is moot.\n\nCharacters who worship good [[gods]] will probably want to avoid using Regeneration, as the spell qualifies as Necromancy and will upset them. Also, [[mummies]], [[deep dwarves]], and characters in [[lich form]] cannot use this spell. [[Vampire]]s can, but the benefit of the spell is dependent on their current blood state, because bloodless vampires cannot regenerate while monsters are visible.\n\n==History==\n*The Regeneration spell was removed in [[0.25]].\n*Prior to [[0.10]], [[ghoul]]s were unable to learn Regeneration.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], the spell increased hunger rate even when at full HP.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

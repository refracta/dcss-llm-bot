The other two intrinsics are nice to have, too. Clarity is especially helpful for [[Mummies]].\n\nUnless you have amazing willpower ([[Spriggan]]s, having a [[randart]] with Will++/Will+++...), it's definitely worth keeping. At the least, it can be used as a swap for where willpower and/or clarity are helpful.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the MR bonus was +100 instead of +120.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Amulets]]"}

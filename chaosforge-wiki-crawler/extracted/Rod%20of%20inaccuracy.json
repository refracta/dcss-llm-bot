While the rod is mostly useless against targets with even moderate [[EV]], you can use it to deal heavy, irresistible damage to targets with lousy evasion. Some of the best targets for this spell are particularly tough monsters such as [[hydra]]s, [[oklob plant]]s, [[Gastronok]], [[list of giants|giants]], and [[curse skull]]s, to name a few. Even better, this rod's hunger cost is relatively easy to negate, given that Bolt of Inaccuracy is only a level 3 spell.\n\nAny character that plans on using [[Evocations]] can make effective use of this rod. If you find this rod and haven't begun training Evocations yet, consider doing so, as it can be extremely helpful against many enemies that are difficult to safely defeat through other means.\n\n==History==\nThe rod of inaccuracy was removed along with all other [[rods]] in [[0.20]]"}

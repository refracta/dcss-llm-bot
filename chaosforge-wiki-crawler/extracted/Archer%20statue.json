{"title":"Archer statue","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Archer_statue","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Archer statues''' are stationary [[longbow]]-wielding [[statue]]s which shoot [[arrow]]s at you whenever you're in their [[LOS]]. They resist all elemental damage. Even worse, they often come with a ring of [[bush]]es surrounding them, preventing you from getting them in melee.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The fastest way to take them out is with [[Earth Magic]] spells. [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]] will take them down eventually, but [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] will speed the process up significantly.\n*They have a limited ammo supply. If you're patient, you can step into their range, take an arrow or two, step back, and heal up before repeating the process. Once they stop firing, simply march in and smash the statue.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.13]], there were several archer statue vaults that had statues armed with [[brand]]ed bows (such as [[chaos]], for example).\n\n[[Category:Vault-only monsters]]"}

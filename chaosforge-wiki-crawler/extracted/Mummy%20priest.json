Although they can summon demonic or undead reinforcements, their biggest strength lies in their ability to [[smite]] or [[torment]] you at will. Their [[death curse]]s are also some of the worse ones you will encounter. Fortunately, they are slow and easily run from if you turn around as soon as you see them. Mummy priests are found in [[the Tomb]] or near its entrance, in the [[Vestibule of Hell]] guarding the entrance to [[Tartarus]], and on Tomb-themed [[Ziggurat]] floors.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Mummy priests are extremely dangerous opponents, tormenting and smiting you from a safe distance while their summons and mummy allies slow you down.

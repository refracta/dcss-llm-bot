{"title":"Death Rattle","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Death_Rattle","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|Exhales the essence of the dying, creating clouds of noxious miasma.}}\n\n'''Death Rattle''' is a monster-only spell that blasts the target with a line of miasma clouds (similar to a [[catoblepas]]' [[Petrifying Cloud|petrification breath]]). This deals a small amount of impact damage, and creatures that end their turns in miasma are [[poison]]ed and [[slow]]ed. For more information on how miasma clouds work and how to resist them, see the [[Cloud#Miasma|Miasma]] page.\n\nMuch like other harmful cloud-generating spells, Death Rattle cannot create miasma in tiles that already have a cloud â€” a [[scroll of fog]] will keep the miasma off you as long as the fog lasts. Barring that, just be sure to move out of the miasma clouds as soon as they are generated, as they only affect you if you end your turn in them.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Death Rattle could create [[cloud]]s of negative energy.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], this spell could create a mix of [[miasma]] and [[Cloud#Negative energy|negative energy]] clouds.\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

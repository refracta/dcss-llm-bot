{"title":"Foo","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Foo","type":"raw","data":"'''Foo''' is a \"metasyntactic variable\", an inherently meaningless word which serves as a placeholder when the true word is variable, or is determined at the player's discretion.\n\nFor example, a certain [[skill titles|skill title]] might be \"Foo porcupine\", where \"Foo\" will be replaced, in game, by the character's [[species]]. \"Fooweight champion\" will assign a weight class (lightweight, heavyweight, etc.), again depending on the character's species.\n\nAlthough the word's history is long, most players might be most familiar with it from discussions on other [[Roguelike]]s, including ''NetHack''.\n\n==External Links==\n*[http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Foo NetHackWiki article on \"Foo\"]\n*[[wikipedia:foobar|Wikipedia article on \"Foobar\"]]\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

It is a two handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Great swords''' are large, two handed [[Long Blades]] that deal good damage, though they require high Long Blades skill to reach minimum delay. [[Triple sword]]s are stronger, but considerably rarer.\n\n==Strategy==\nGreat swords are rarely found on the Dungeon floor. However, they can occasionally generate on enemy [[wight]]s, [[orc warrior]]s, [[orc knight]]s, and a few other enemies.\n\nYou may prefer a [[demon blade]] or [[double sword]]; they deal slightly less damage, but can be worn with a [[shield]]. However, both weapons are rarer. The great sword is considerably stronger than other one-handed Long Blades (such as the [[scimitar]]).\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Greatsword1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Greatsword2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Greatsword3.png]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || [[Unrandarts|Unrandart]]<br>Great Swords\n|-\n| '''[[Sword of Power]]''' || [[File:Sword of power.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Sword of Cerebov]]''' || [[File:Sword of cerebov.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], Long Blades lost [[riposte]]. Damage was increased back to pre-riposte levels.\n*In [[0.19]], Long Blades gained riposte. Great swords were reduced by 2 base damage to compensate.\n*In very early versions of ''Crawl'', these (and triple swords) were governed by [[Great swords|their own skill]].\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Long blades]]"}

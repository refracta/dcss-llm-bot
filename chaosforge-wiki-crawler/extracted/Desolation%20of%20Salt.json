{"title":"Desolation of Salt","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Desolation_of_Salt","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{flavour|The Desolation was once ruled by the divines Sheza and Sargol. After the dread twins were cast down, the good gods reduced their former realm to salt, that such a terrible cult would never rise again. Amidst the ruins, only the last cultists of the dead gods, their heretical constructs, and the guardians of the cult's legendary treasure yet remain.}}\n'''The Desolation of Salt''' (or simply '''Desolation''') is a temporary [[portal]] level. The Desolation is a very open area, with packs of weak [[list of constructs|constructs]] accompanied by a variety of support-focused allies.\n\nDesolation may appear in [[Vaults]] and [[Elven Halls]]. The portal is signaled by a \"distant wind\".\n\n==Layout==\nThe layout of the Desolation is very simple, consisting of a large, open plain, largely devoid of structures save for the small, heavily guarded treasure vaults scattered around the centralized entrance and exit points. In lieu of permanent cover, there are large, shifting [[cloud]]s of salt that block line of sight but also conceal you from bands of foes, functioning as \"virtual terrain\" in an otherwise open level.\n\n===Useful Traits===\n*Fast movement\n*[[Stealth]]\n*[[Smite]]-targeted attacks\n*[[Fire]], [[cold]], [[electricity]], and [[negative energy]] resistance\n*Patience\n\n==Monsters==\nExclusive to the Desolation are a number of constructs and their human allies. While these enemies are each fairly weak, as a pack, they generate a massive of volume of attacks that can rapidly whittle your health down to dangerously low levels. Combined with the general of lack of substantial cover to funnel enemies through, fighting the inhabitants of the Desolation can prove dangerous to the unprepared. Besides the risk of getting surrounded and overwhelmed, each unit brings its own troubles:\n \n{{monsterlink|Saltling}} - Fast and plentiful, saltlings are common targets for ally buffs and can rapidly surround unfortunate players.\n\n{{monsterlink|Peacekeeper}} - Swift and resilient, peacekeepers buff allied constructs and [[Throw Barbs]], leaving immobilized players open to enemy onslaught.\n\n{{monsterlink|Crystal guardian}} - Durable sentinels with potent elemental ranged attacks.\n\n{{monsterlink|Guardian serpent}} - These dangerous sentinels can instantly [[Blink_Allies_Encircling|surround]] you with out-of-sight allies.\n\n{{monsterlink|Ironbound convoker}} - Infuriating support casters which [[Word of Recall|recall]] and [[Might|strengthen]] enemy units.\n\n{{monsterlink|Servant of whispers}} - These robed figures strike down interlopers with [[Lightning Bolt]]s and can cast [[Still Winds]], temporarily stripping away all cloud cover and shutting down [[cloud]]-based spells.\n\n{{monsterlink|Ragged hierophant}} - Although weak on their own, they can soak up damage directed toward allies and blast construct-surrounded foes with [[Resonance Strike]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Imperial myrmidon}} - These arcane fighters strip away [[willpower]] with their melee strikes, rendering their foes vulnerable to [[Agony]] and debilitating hexes.\n\n{{monsterlink|Halazid warlock}} - Dreadful undead summoners, capable of casting [[Shadow Creatures]] and then sacrificing them for bursts of massive [[negative energy]] damage.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe name of the game here is [[stealth]]. The Desolation lacks useful bottlenecks, and while racing into the clouds might seem like an easy way to lose pursuers (especially for fast characters), be aware that as soon as you run into a servant of whispers, that cover vanishes and you've suddenly attracted a lot of attention. Even worse, a peacekeeper's barbs make retreat an extremely painful proposition. It's better by far to avoid getting into those situations in the first place.\n\nWhile few enemies here are especially dangerous on their own, most of them have mechanics that make them much deadlier in groups. As such, engaging them individually goes a long way to staying alive here. Saltlings should be one of your first concerns. These misshapen lumps serve as capable tanks when buffed, dishing out surprising damage and preventing you from reaching the serious threats beyond. Fortunately, they also fail to make noise when injured; if you can draw their attention with a quiet spell or ranged attack from the edge of your line of sight, they'll charge into melee with you without awakening their allies. Use this tactic to clear them out first, circling around known packs and leaving the dangerous foes for last.\n\nThe myrmidons are likely the most dangerous single units present here, though crystal guardians and servants of whispers can dish out heavy elemental damage as well. Far worse are the ironbrand convokers, guardian serpents, and halazid warlocks, any of which can bring heavy reinforcements on top of you no matter how cautiously you avoid being social. Sound doesn't travel far here, so if need be, don't be afraid to unleash the heavy firepower to bring these guys down quickly. [[Earth Magic]] specialists shine here, as the many constructs you face serve wonderfully as targets for [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]], and nothing here enjoys [[Shatter]]. Finally, if faced with an especially bad situation, reading a [[scroll of teleport]] can be a lifesaver, especially once you've already cleared out the smaller foes outside of the more heavily guarded treasure vaults.\n\n==History==\nThe Desolation of Salt was added in [[0.19]]\n\n{{Portals}}\n\n[[Category:Portals]]"}

For example, if the player's natural stats are Str 28, Int 5, and Dex 10, then after a Shuffle the player might have Str 10, Int 28, and Dex 5. Shuffle does not exist in basic decks and is relatively rare in ornate decks.\n\n==History==\nThe Shuffle card could be found in the following [[Decks|decks]] before it was removed in [[0.15]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.11]]\n![[0.12]]\n![[0.13]]\n![[0.14]]\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n|----\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

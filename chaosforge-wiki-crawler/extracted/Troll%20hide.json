Why, look, already<br>\nYou bear yourself quite in a troll-like fashion!<br>\nAnd you want to become one, don't you?<br>\nPEER GYNT: Of course.<br>\nIn return for a bride and a well-found kingdom<br>\nI'm not unwilling to sacrifice something;<br>\nBut all things have a natural limit.<br>\nI have taken a tail, it is true; but, then,<br>\nI can undo the knots that our friend has tied<br>\nAnd take the thing off. I have shed my breeches;<br>\nThey were old and patched; but that won't prevent me<br>\nFrom putting them on if I have a mind to.<br>\nI shall probably find it just as easy<br>\nTo deal with your Trollish way of living.<br>\nI can easily swear that a cow's a maiden;<br>\nAn oath's not a difficult thing to swallow.<br>\nBut to know that one never can get one's freedom –<br>\nNot even to die as a human being –<br>\nTo end one's days as a Troll of the mountains –<br>\nNever go back, as you tell me plainly –<br>\nThat is a thing that I'll not submit to.\"\n\n-Henrik Ibsen, _Peer Gynt_. 1867.}}\nButchering a [[troll]] [[corpse]] may produce a '''troll hide'''. This \"[[armour]]\" increases your [[regeneration rate]] by +40, but only provides the [[AC]] of a [[robe]] and has an encumbrance rating, making it a rather poor item defensively. However, you can transform it into a far superior [[troll leather armour]] by using a [[scroll of enchant armour]] on it. This provides the same boost to regeneration, but with a much better AC.\n\n[[Deep dwarves]], [[troll]]s, and bloodless [[vampire]]s receive no regenerative benefits while wearing this armour.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Hide''' || [[File:Troll hide.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Troll leather armour|Armour]]''' || [[File:Troll leather armour.png]]\n|}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nButchering [[Purgy]] or [[Snorg]] may produce a named troll hide, but this has no impact on actual gameplay.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.19]], troll hide was removed along with several other hides.\n\nPrior to [[0.14]], troll hides only increased your regeneration rate by +30.\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Body armour]]\n[[Category:Troll]]"}

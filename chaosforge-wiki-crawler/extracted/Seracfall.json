The ice affects even cold-resistant creatures somewhat, due to the strong impact and cutting edges.}}\n\n'''Seracfall''' is a monster-only spell which destroys a [[simulacrum]] to launch a 3x3 explosion at the target. Like [[iceblast]], it deals 50% irresistible [[cold]] damage that never misses. This spell requires a simulacrum in the user's [[line of sight]] to be cast, and it must be friendly to the caster (i.e. it cannot use your own simulacrum against you).\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Seracfall's damage was 40% resistible (60% irresistible).\n*Seracfall was added in [[0.28]].\n\n[[Category: Monster spells]]"}

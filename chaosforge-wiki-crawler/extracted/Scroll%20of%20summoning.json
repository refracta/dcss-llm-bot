These monsters will \"belong\" to the floor you're currently on, similar to the [[Shadow Creatures]] spell. They have a long duration, but stronger monsters will last for a shorter time. Note that \"bands\" (like a pack of [[yak]]s) count as 1 monster for this scroll's purposes. It never summons creatures that your [[god]] hates.\n\nThis scroll is [[alternate items|mutually exclusive]] with the [[scroll of butterflies]]; only one of the two scrolls may spawn in any given game.\n\n==Sample Results==\n*In the [[Dungeon]], there's a very broad range of possible monsters. On D:12, it might produce a pack of ogres including an [[ogre mage]]... or it might produce a [[howler monkey]].\n*In [[The Lair]], this can produce anything from a [[water moccasin]] to a herd of [[death yak]]s.  \n*In the [[Orcish Mines]], it usually produces a group of orcs, possibly including warriors, priests, and sorcerers. [[Troll (monster)|trolls]] and ogres are possible, though.\n*In the Lair branches, it summons monsters you'd expect - arachnids for [[Spider's Nest|Spider]], snakes and nagas in [[Snake]], jellies in [[Slime Pits|Slime]]...\n*In [[the Realm of Zot]], it tends to summon [[dragon]]s, [[electric golem]]s, \"friendly\" [[moth of wrath|moths of wrath]], entire bands of [[draconian]]s, and even the occasional [[orb of fire]].\n**Be aware that moths of wrath will often berserk the hostile natives, which can lead to a nasty death for the unwary.\n*It is much less useful in places that have weak \"random encounters\" but very strong special encounters, such as [[the Tomb]] and the last level of [[the Vaults]].\n\n==Strategy==\nScrolls of summoning are quite rare. Summons scale with your current branch - if you're having difficulty with a monster, summoning 2-4 copies of that monster is bound to kill it, or at least give you time to escape. Therefore, it remains valuable for most of a 3-rune game.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Combining summons with a [[scroll of immolation]] works well. Surround your target with summons, then read immolation. Once something dies, it'll create a chain reaction of explosions, which works wonders against [[unique]]s and other dangerous monsters. (As usual with immolation, watch out for any explosions that hit you.)\n*Summoning can be particularly useful when fighting [[The Royal Jelly]]. If you surround TRJ with summons, the jellies it spawns will appear on the outskirts of your army, giving you time to damage it. Works especially well in a corridor.\n*Scrolls of summoning, as of 0.30, are the only scroll that monsters can read.\n\n==History==\n*Scrolls of summoning were useless in the [[Labyrinth]], which was removed in [[0.23]].\n*This current iteration of the scroll of summoning was added in [[0.12]].\n*Prior to [[0.11]], there was a different item called a scroll of summoning that would create a [[small abomination]] for you. It was renamed to a [[scroll of unholy creation]] in [[0.11]], and was removed entirely in 0.12.\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

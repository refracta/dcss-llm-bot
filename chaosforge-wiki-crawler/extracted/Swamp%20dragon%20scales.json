It confers resistance to poison on its wearer.}}\n\n'''Swamp dragon scales''' are a moderately light body [[armour]] that provides [[poison resistance]].\n\nThis item has a 33% chance to to generate when you slay a [[swamp dragon]].\n\n==Desirability==\nSwamp dragon scales are a light armour with relatively high AC, a direct upgrade to plain [[ring mail]]s and [[scale mail]]s. They are a good option for casters and [[EV]]-based characters.\n\nThe poison resistance is great in [[Spider's Nest]], [[Snake Pit]], and [[the Swamp]], where poison is a major threat. It can occasionally be useful in other places, such as [[Zot]]. However, even if you already have rPois, this armour can be good for its defensive merit.\n\nThe next heaviest scales are [[Fire dragon scales|fire]] and [[ice dragon scales]]. These offer more AC, but are significantly heavier than swamp dragon scales. In addition, both fire and ice scales make you vulnerable to the opposite element, while swamp offers no vulnerability. Overall, any of the three choices can be viable to complete a 3-rune game - which you should pick will vary from character to character.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], this item was known as [[swamp dragon armour]], and were obtained by [[scroll of enchant armour|enchanting]] [[swamp dragon hide]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

{"title":"Archmagi (ego)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Archmagi_(ego)","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|It increases the power of its wearer's magical spells.}}\n\nThe '''Archmagi''' [[ego]] acts as a [[spell enhancer]] for all forms of magic, increasing your [[spell power]] by up to 50%. It does not make spells any easier to cast.\n\n===Sources===\nThe archmagi ego can be found on:\n*[[Randart]] robes\n*[[Robe of Folly]]\n*the [[orange crystal plate armour]]\n*the [[ring of the Mage]]\n\n==Strategy==\nThis ego is useful to help maximize spellpower. It serves no purpose on spells which have reached the power cap. Also note that spellpower is gained with diminishing returns. If you're already at high spellpower, you'll receive a smaller percent boost from Archmagi.\n\nUseful for [[Hexes]], due to how [[willpower]] checks work. Also good for damaging spells, since it lets you kill enemies faster, making you safer and saving MP.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], this ego could be found on regular robes in addition to randart robes.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], this ego couldn't be found on randart robes.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], this ego was found on the [[Majin-Bo]].\n*In ancient versions of ''Crawl'', before [[0.8]], this ego reduced spell failure rates in addition to increasing spell power, but it also reduced XP gain to 1/4 of normal, providing a serious threat of undertraining to most characters.\n\n[[Category:Egos]]"}

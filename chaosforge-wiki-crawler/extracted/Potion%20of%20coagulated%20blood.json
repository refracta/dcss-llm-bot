Vital for all living creatures, as well as some undead ones. The blood within won't be palatable much longer.}}\n\nA [[potion of coagulated blood]] is essentially a [[potion of blood]] which has nearly gone bad. It functions identically, providing significant nutrition to [[vampire]]s, minimal nutrition (and possible [[sick]]ness) to others, and fueling the [[Sublimation of Blood]] spell, except:\n*It only provides vampires with 800 nutrition\n*It will disappear 500 turns after it generates\n\nGood [[god]]s (particularly [[the Shining One]]) disapprove of knowingly drinking blood.\n\nPotions of coagulated blood are generally brown, which makes identifying them by guesswork slightly easier. This is rarely an issue, as they are even less common than potions of blood -- probably the only time a player will see one is after one of their potions of blood coagulates.\n \n{{crawlquote|Vampires: \"This tastes delicious!\"<br>[[Carnivore]]s: \"This tastes like blood.\"<br>Others: \"Yuck - this tastes like blood.\"}}\n\n==History==\nPotions of coagulated blood were removed in [[0.16]].\n\nIn [[0.14]], potions of blood will no longer generate unless created by a vampire."}

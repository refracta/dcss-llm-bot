It's as slow as a naga and it can't swim, so escaping isn't difficult. If you do choose to face them head on, they may be a threat to low-level characters, as they tend to wield heavy weapons. They normally appear in [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], and the [[Hell]]s (especially [[the Iron City of Dis]]), but can also appear in [[vault]]s in the early [[Dungeon]] (safely locked away, of course).\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nIf you're in Hell, you can pretty much ignore these. If you worship [[the Shining One]] or [[Makhleb]], kill them for the healing. If you do find one in the early dungeon due to a vault, you're unlikely to be able to kill it due to its [[AC]] and resistances, so just walk away.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.16]], iron devils were replaced with [[rust devil]]s.\n\nPrior to [[0.15]], iron devils did not come armed, and were significantly less threatening.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

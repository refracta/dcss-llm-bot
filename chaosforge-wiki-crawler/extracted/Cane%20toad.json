{"title":"Cane toad","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cane_toad","type":"raw","data":"{{version|030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Cane toads''' are surprisingly dangerous enemies; they hit much harder than you'd expect, [[poison]] you, and are fast enough to make escape difficult. They are a very common cause of [[YASD]] for unprepared characters, and can be found in [[the Lair]] or guarding its entrance.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Dedicated melee characters with [[plate armour]] and [[poison resistance]] can probably take them on without much concern, but any other character should try to minimize their time spent in melee with cane toads. Treat them like fast, tiny [[hydra]]s and try to kill them at a distance if at all possible.\n*They are resistant to poison, so don't waste time trying to hit them with [[Mephitic Cloud]]. Their [[willpower]] is low, however, so other [[Hexes]] work well, and they may be [[slow]]ed when hit with cold damage.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], these were known as spiny frogs. They were not (and are still not) [[spiny]]."}

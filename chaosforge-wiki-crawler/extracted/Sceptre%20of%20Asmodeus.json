It may call forth fiery demons from their infernal home to do the wielder's bidding.}}\n[[File:Sceptre of asmodeus.png]] '''''the +13 sceptre of Asmodeus'''''\n\n+13 [[eveningstar]]\n\n10% chance to summon a fire-themed [[demon]] on hit<br>\n[[Evil]]\n\n==Mechanics==\nThe sceptre of Asmodeus may summon the following demons:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-func.h|1806}}</ref> \n\n*{{monsterlink|Balrug}}: 50%\n*{{monsterlink|Hellion}}: 33.3%\n*{{monsterlink|Brimstone fiend}}: 16.7%\n\nNote that the demon-summoning melee effect works only for the player. Neither Asmodeus nor your [[Beogh|orc friends]] get the summons when attacking with this weapon.\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''sceptre of Asmodeus'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|361}}</ref> is a special eveningstar that can only be obtained by killing [[Asmodeus]], lord of [[Gehenna]]. As an evil item, the [[good god]]s frown its use.\n\nIt's a moderately good weapon. But, by the time you kill Asmodeus, you'll usually have other options available. A +9 eveningstar of [[flaming]] / [[freezing]] will be more consistent against non-resistant enemies. An eveningstar of holy wrath (or [[sacred scourge]]) will almost certainly perform better, assuming you can wield holy wrath.\n\n[[Hellion]]s and [[Brimstone Fiend]]s will generally avoid hurting you, e.g. they won't fire [[damnation]] at an enemy in melee range, and the fiends won't cast [[torment]] on you. However, there's no guarantee, so this item can be risky.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the sceptre was a +7 [[staff]] that had an '''A'''bility to summon demons, with a chance to fail based on [[Evocations]]. The demons were [[durably summoned]], and would eventually become hostile.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the sceptre could be activated from the [[v|evoke]] menu instead of the [[a]]bilities menu. Also, the player needed slightly more Evocations to pass a skill check when summoning demons.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the sceptre could summon [[sun demon]]s and [[efreet]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], this sceptre would fire random [[Conjurations]] and summoned hostile demons when it failed to evoke properly.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]"}

{"title":"Throw Icicle","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Throw_Icicle","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Fires a shard of ice. Due to its strong impact and cutting edges, a significant portion of its damage bypasses cold resistance.}}\n\n'''Throw Icicle''' is a level 4 [[Conjurations]]/[[Ice Magic]] monster-only spell which hurls an icy shard at a single target up to 5 tiles away. Only 50% of its damage is reduced by [[cold resistance]], making it effective even against players with significant protection from [[cold]] damage.\n\nBecause Throw Icicle is a solid projectile, it can pass through [[cloud]]s of flame without negating them.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n{{Spell\n|name=Throw Icicle\n|level=4\n|school1={{Conjurations}}\n|school2={{Ice Magic}}\n|school3=\n|castingnoise=4\n|spellnoise=4\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Frost]] \n</div>\n}}\n{{AttackSpell\n|name=Throw Icicle\n|formula = 3d(3.33+Power/6) [[cold]]\n|maxdmg = 3d20\n|maxsp = 100\n|range = 6\n|target = Beam\n|tohit = 9+Power/12\n|special = Partially irresistible\n|hit_type = normal\n|hit_adder = 9\n|hit_num = 1\n|hit_denom = 12\n|dam_calculator = calcdice\n|dam_numdice = 3\n|dam_adder = 10\n|dam_num = 1\n|dam_denom = 2}}\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Throw Icicle was 40% resistible.\n*In [[0.25]], Throw Icicle was removed from the list of spells available to players in favor of [[Hailstorm]].\n*In an early version of ''Crawl'', Throw Icicle was known as '''Ice Bolt'''.

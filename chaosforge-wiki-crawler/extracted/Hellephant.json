{"title":"Hellephant","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hellephant","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Hellephants''' are hideously powerful [[demon]]s that resemble common [[elephant]]s. Like their smaller cousins, they are very sturdy, hit hard, and trample their opponents in combat, pushing them back a tile. Unlike elephants, however, they breathe powerful gouts of [[fire]], have [[demon]]ic immunities and [[holy]] vulnerability, and can blink at will. They are thankfully rare, appearing only in [[the Vestibule of Hell]], [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], or during the [[orb run]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Without at least rF++, you should expect to take a lot of damage when dealing with these guys.\n*As they can and will blink about the battlefield constantly, don't be afraid to go a little overboard taking them out quickly. A melee character can take a lot of abuse chasing one around before finally putting the thing down.\n*Similar to non-demonic [[elephant]]s, they are not resistant to poison, so you can use [[curare]]-tipped [[dart]]s to slow them down.\n\n==History==\nHellephants were added to the game in [[0.7]]."}

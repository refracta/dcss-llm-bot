The speed brand makes it safe to use even at low skill, though it really shines at mindelay, where you'll attack at least twice for every action by a normal speed enemy. Needless to say, Arga is an incredibly powerful weapon, easily able to define a run, and viable to swap to during the mid-game. The willpower boost is just a cherry on top.\n\nWhile a weapon with [[holy wrath]] might be stronger in the extended part of the game, Arga is still useful for anything unaffected by it, or if you're [[undead]]/[[demonspawn|demonic]] and unable to wield weapons of holy wrath.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Arga had a +2 Strength bonus.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Arga had a +10, +6 enchantment bonus.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Arga had a smaller [[magic resistance]] bonus.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Arga was a [[war axe]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Axes]]"}

This utterly useless [[amulet]] would never be used if not for the fact that it always generates [[cursed]]. Consider this a good reason to avoid putting on unidentified amulets without a [[scroll of remove curse]] on hand.\n\nAlthough they serve no useful purpose, [[artefact]]s might spawn with some useful properties. For example, the [[unrandart]] [[amulet of the Air]] \nadds several very useful benefits to compensate for its penalty to accuracy.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], amulets of inaccuracy, along with the [[curse]]s binding them to adventures, were removed. [[Amulet of the Air]] still has the Inacc property, though.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], amulets of inaccuracy were not always cursed, and would not identify when worn.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], this amulet's negative effect would not calculate correctly for ranged weapons.\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

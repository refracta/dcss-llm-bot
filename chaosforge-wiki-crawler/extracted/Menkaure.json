{"title":"Menkaure","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Menkaure","type":"raw","data":"{{version|024}}\n{{list of | mummies}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Menkaure, Prince of Dust''' is a [[unique]] [[mummy (monster)|mummy]] with limited access to dangerous [[Necromancy]]. He's just as vulnerable to fire as a regular mummy, but his powerful melee attacks, ability to [[haste]] himself, and tendency to [[torment]] half your health away in an instant makes him a significant threat.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:4-7\n*The [[Ossuary]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While undead characters have nothing to fear from Menkaure's spells, the living can lose half their HP in a single turn if he casts Symbol of Torment. Use any [[life protection]] equipment you have if you expect a drawn-out battle with him.\n**Undead characters should still be wary about engaging him in melee; as slow and fragile as he is, a potential 25 damage per hit isn't something to sneeze at this early in the game.\n*His fire vulnerability and awful [[EV]] makes him fall quickly to a [[wand of flame]] or pretty much any [[Fire Magic]]. [[Dispel Undead]] or weapons of [[holy wrath]] also work well.\n*So long as you have a reliable means of killing him, meeting Menkaure can be a good time to use a [[potion of lignification]], as being a tree gives you considerable AC and GDR as well as complete immunity to torment. Of course, you won't be able to flee from any other threats that may wander by.\n\n==Trivia==\nMenkaure was an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menkaure early Egyptian pharaoh]. The grandson of [[Khufu]], he also has a pyramid at Giza.\n\n==History==\nPrior to version [[0.17]], Menkaure had a [[death curse]] that would curse a single piece of equipment, much like a regular mummy.\n[[Category:Mummy]]"}

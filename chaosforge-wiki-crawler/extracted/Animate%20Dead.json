{"title":"Animate Dead","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Animate_Dead","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n[[Animate Dead]] is a level 4 [[Necromancy]] spell that attempts to raise living enemies as [[zombie]]s.\n\n[[Necromancer]]s begin with this spell in their libraries. [[Kikubaaqudgha]] may grant this spell at 1* piety.\n\n==Useful Info==\nGrants the '''Reap''' status for a spellpower-based duration: <code>20 + 1d(pow)</code> turns, for a maximum of 100 turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-other.cc|122}}</ref> For every [[natural]] monster you or your allies kill, you have a <code>(150 + 0.5 * power) / 2</code> percent,<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|mon-death.cc|1369}}</ref> chance to create a friendly zombie. Monsters from Kikubaaqudgha's Unearth Wretches that naturally die will also be reaped.\n\nZombies created by this spell have an unlimited duration, but will disintegrate if you recast the spell or leave the level. Their [[HD]] depends on the [[spellpower]]: <code>minion_hd = mons_hd * (100 + pow) / 300</code>. \n\nAnimate Dead and [[Death Channel]] may work on the same target simultaneously, but not any of the other undead-creating Necromancy spells. It only takes priority over the lower level spell [[Necrotise]]. \n\nThis spell does not work with [[Gozag]] (who turns corpses into gold), [[Yredelemnul]] (who reaps for you), or [[Okawaru]] (who forbids all allies).\n\n==Strategy==\nAnimate Dead is good against crowds of enemies. When fighting a group, you'll create zombies mid-fight, who in turn will fight their former allies and act as distractions. Since zombies last until you leave the floor, any remaining undead can help with your future endeavors. \n\nIt is a very powerful spell for [[Kikubaaqudgha]] followers, due to the Unearth Wretches ability. Using it at the start of a dangerous battle or even floor will generate a large gang of unlimited duration allies, at an affordable piety cost. Thankfully, Kiku can gift this spell, though it isn't guaranteed.\n\n===Tips and Tricks===\n*Works well with [[Anguish]] and [[Death Channel]], which are both spells that Kiku can gift. \n** Anguish is a hex which causes enemies to take damage whenever they attack ''something'', including zombies. Zombies are durable for the undead, making it a nice combination.\n** Death Channel is compatible with Animate Dead. Using both spells together wil you create up to 2 minions for every monster kill.\n*Fast species may want to use the Ctrl-T command to limit the auto-travelling speed to the speed of their slowest ally. This does not slow down manual movement.\n*In the [[Tomb]], [[death scarab]]s make for excellent zombies, as they lose their chaotic movement while retaining their lightning-fast speed, and are available in extremely plentiful numbers. Their combined strength lets them take out even [[royal mummies]] with ease.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Derived undead]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Animate Dead would revive all [[corpse]]s on the ground (and in sight) as undead. This required monsters to drop a corpse (effective 50% reanimate chance), zombies would wield weapons and armour on their tile, and they'd eventually expire. It had a spellpower cap of 200 and could not work on a few specific enemies' corpses.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the lifespan of raised undead didn't depend on spellpower, and was longer. Necromancers had to be slightly aware of [[food]], as raised zombies did not drop [[chunk]]s (but [[Animate Skeleton]] did).\n*Prior to [[0.17]], raised creatures were permanent until death. Also, some monsters could cast this spell.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], [[plague shambler]]s would also only produce skeletons.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], [[vampire mosquito]]es, [[ugly thing]]s, [[very ugly thing]]s, [[guardian serpent]]s, [[sky beast]]s and [[Arachne]] could not be animated.\n*Prior to [[0.10]] Animate Dead would ignore any corpses on a spot after the first corpse. \n*Prior to [[0.5]], zombies and skeletons could use stairs, making this an excellent spell for creating armies.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

Like all deep dwarves, they do not regenerate health naturally. They are occasionally found accompanied by a pack of undead allies in [[the Crypt]].\n\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster\n|number=\n|slot1=''none''\n|slot2=[[Animate Dead]]\n|slot3=[[Injury Mirror]]\n|slot4=''none''\n|slot5=[[Drain Life]]\n|slot6=[[Drain Life]]\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Their tendency to raise dead units as zombies can prolong fights. If there are raisable corpses around (in the Crypt, this likely means those of [[unique]]s), prioritize death knights.\n*Their Mirror Damage can be deadly: ''don't attack them while Mirror Damage is up.''  Be very careful when using area-of-effect spells when they are around, particularly extremely powerful ones such as [[Fire Storm|Fire]] or [[Ice Storm]].  It is a good idea, particularly if you are using console, to check them using '''x''' to be sure that they aren't mirroring damage.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.15]], Deep dwarf death knights were replaced by human [[death knight]]s.\n\n[[Category:Dwarf]]"}

{"title":"Item usage","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Item_usage","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\nA monster's '''item usage''' property describes which types of items it can use. There are four \"levels\", and each sequential level includes all the permissons of the previous ones.\n\n*\"Uses nothing\" (stored in the [[source code]] as <code>MONUSE_NOTHING</code>) means the monster cannot use items or doors.\n*\"Open [[door]]s\" (<code>MONUSE_OPEN_DOORS</code>) means the monster can open doors, but cannot use inventory-type items.\n*\"Starting equipment\" (<code>MONUSE_STARTING_EQUIPMENT</code>) means the monster is sometimes generated with items that it can use.  The items a monster starts with is dependent on its type; [[Gnoll_(monster)|gnoll]]s tend to start with [[polearm]]s, [[Sigmund]] always carries a magical [[scythe]], and [[centaur]]s always have [[bow]]s and may sometimes wear [[barding]].\n*\"Weapons & armour\" (<code>MONUSE_WEAPONS_ARMOUR</code>) means that the monster can pick up and use items on the floor, including [[wand]]s and certain [[potion]]s. Note that monsters can pick up only items the player has not seen yet.\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

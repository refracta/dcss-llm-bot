{"title":"Grum","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Grum","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{list of | gnolls}}''Not to be confused with [[Grunn]].'' \n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Grum the Hunter''' is a [[unique]] gnoll who comes with a pack of [[wolves]] and a two-handed [[polearm]].\n\nGrum is an alternate version of [[Grunn]]. Only one may spawn in a given game.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:8-11\n*[[The Lair]]:1\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While Grum isn't that tough on his own, his wolves can seriously complicate things, especially if you give him the opportunity to use his reaching weapon against you from a safe distance. Use narrow hallways to prevent that, but avoid giving Grum opportunities to hit you with that polearm. Alternatively, if you don't mind getting bit a few times, the amazing speed of his wolves makes it very easy to lure them away from their master and take them out in relative safety on the next floor up.\n*Neither Grum nor his pets have decent [[willpower]] or high [[HD]]. [[Hexes]] and [[status effect]] [[wand]]s of all sorts work very well against them.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Grum ran with a pack of [[war dog]]s."}

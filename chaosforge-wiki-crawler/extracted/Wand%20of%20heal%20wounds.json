If the player is at full HP, it can heal 2-6 points of [[rot]]. [[Evocations]] does not increase health healed. \n\nFollowers of [[Elyvilon]] may use these wands to pacify monsters in the same way they'd use their divine healing abilities (using Evocations instead of Invocations). Strangely enough, at perfectly equal skill levels, the wand of heal wounds has a better pacification success rate than divine healing.\n\nThe wand can hold a maximum of 9 charges, and is often found with only 1-3 charges to begin with. [[Deep Dwarves]] begin the game with a wand of heal wounds with 5 charges.\n\n==Strategy==\nHealing is valuable. Sometimes, healing one or multiple times can be your best/only option (such as when waiting on a [[teleport]]). A wand of heal wounds allow for more uses of a heal wounds potion.\n\nVery valuable for [[Mummies]], who can't use the potion of heal wounds. Can also repair rot, which reduces dependency on their expensive Self-Restoration ability.\n\n==History==\n*Wands of heal wounds were removed in [[0.20]].\n*Prior to [[0.10]], these were called '''wands of healing'''."}

{"title":"Poison Arrow","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Poison_Arrow","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Fires a magical arrow coated with the most vile and noxious toxin. Even those resistant to poison will be poisoned by it, and a small portion of its direct damage bypasses poison resistance.}}\n\n'''Poison Arrow''' is a monster-only spell which damages and [[poison]]s a target. On impact, Poison Arrow does (70% poison, 30% physical) damage. This means that Poison Arrow deals a total of 53% damage to those with [[poison resistance]], and 30% damage to those with poison immunity. \n\nIn addition to the impact damage, creatures damaged by this spell will always be poisoned (unless immune). Unlike most poison effects, resistance does ''not'' reduce the odds, nor does it reduce the amount of poison taken.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n{{spell\n|name=Poison Arrow\n|level=6\n|school1={{Conjurations}}\n|school2={{Poison Magic}}\n|school3=\n|castingnoise=6\n|spellnoise=6\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Annihilations]]\n}}\n{{AttackSpell\n|name=Poison Arrow\n|formula = 4d(3.75+Power/4)\n|maxdmg = 4d54\n|maxsp = 200\n|range = 7\n|target = Beam\n|tohit = 5+Power/10\n|special = [[Poison]], partially ignores resistance\n|hit_type = normal\n|hit_adder = 5\n|hit_num = 1\n|hit_denom = 10\n|dam_calculator = calcdice\n|dam_numdice = 4\n|dam_adder = 15\n|dam_num = 1\n|dam_denom = 1}}\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Poison Arrow was a level 6 [[Conjurations|Conjuration]]/[[Poison Magic|Poison]] spell available to players.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Poison Arrow could not poison [[demon]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Poison Arrow was better at piercing through the player's poison resistance; it dealt 65% against poison resistant players, and 44% against poison immune ones.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], 60% of Poison Arrow's damage was irresistible."}

Listening carefully, one can hear the distant echo of a thousand dreams from all corners of reality, their melody giving a warm sense of safety.}}\n\n[[File:Dreamshard necklace.png]] '''''the dreamshard necklace'''''\n\n[[Amulet of the acrobat]]\n\nProtects the wearer from lethal damage once\n\n==Mechanics==\nIf the user would be reduced to 0 HP,<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|ouch.cc|1063}}</ref> the dreamshard necklace's *Dream effect activates, causing the following effects:<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|spl-goditem.cc|1326}}</ref>\n*The triggering blow is negated; the wearer is left at 1 HP. [[Poison]] is removed, but [[Sticky Flame]] and [[Flay]] are not.\n*The wearer is immune to all damage until their next action.\n*[[Shadow Creatures]] is cast, creating several floor-appropriate allies\n*A [[scroll of fog|bank of fog]] is created.\n\nAfterwards, it loses the *Dream property, effectively becoming a regular amulet of the acrobat.\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''dreamshard necklace'''<ref>{{source ref|0.29.1|art-data.txt|1603}}</ref> lets you escape from a deadly situation once a game. This lets you take somewhat greater risks than you otherwise would.\n*At a human level of play, [[YASD|mistakes]] of some kind are inevitable. It can save you as you were mindlessly [[tab]]bing enemies.\n*For careful players, it can increase risk tolerance. For example: say a god ability has a 95% chance of keeping you alive, but a [[scroll of blinking]] has a 100% chance. Normally, you should use the scroll of blinking ASAP, since a 5% chance of death is too high in a permadeath game. With the dreamshard necklace, however, you can afford the risk. You can use the god ability, thus saving you from having to use the scroll 95% of the time.\n*There are a few cases where you can [[instadeath|instantly die]] in 1 turn, from 100% health, due no fault of your own. For instance, you could be teleported into the lungs of [[Zot:5]], and take too much damage. This amulet offers some protection against these theoretical cases.\n\nIt is best not to ''rely'' on the dreamshard necklace, since the *Dream effect can only be used once, and it only saves you for 1 turn. Thus, you should make sure you have a way to escape at 1 HP. Aside from those stipulations, if this amulet is used carefully, it can be a powerful tool.\n\nDespite already having multiple lives, [[Felid]]s still somewhat benefit from this amulet, since their extra lives are limited.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]]:\n**The dreamshard necklace didn't have [[Acrobat]], and drained the wearer on unequip. Also, when activated, the necklace was destroyed (this didn't trigger the *Drain).\n**The *Dream effect would restore 50% - 100% of your max HP, instead of leaving you at 1 HP.\n**The *Dream effect had a 50% chance to activate if you lost half of your current HP in a single turn.\n*The dreamshard necklace was added in [[0.28]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Amulets]]"}

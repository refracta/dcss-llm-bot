{"title":"Jewellery","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Jewellery","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Jewellery''' is a category of equipment, consisting of [[ring]]s and [[amulet]]s. \n\n==Useful Info==\nJewellery is always magical and typically helpful to your character.\n\n* [[Ring]]s can increase stats: attributes, defenses -- even your [[ring of slaying|slaying]]. You can also find rings that bolster your resistances or spellcasting.\n* [[Amulet]]s are typically more defensively oriented. The [[amulet of regeneration]] and [[amulet of reflection]] bolster your combat prowess directly, while the [[amulet of the acrobat]] makes you more evasive when moving or waiting.\n\nMost [[species]] can equip one amulet and two rings at a time. \n* [[Octopode]]s are able to wear eight rings at a time. \n* Wearing the [[macabre finger necklace]] will let you equip one additional ring.\n* Worshippers of [[Ru]] who have sacrificed a hand have one less ring slot than normal.\n\nJewellery is equipped with the '''P''' key and removed with the '''R''' key. Rings take 0.5 turns to take off or put on (or 1 turn to swap between two rings). Amulets take 5 turns to take off or put on (10 turns to swap between 2 amulets). You cannot change your jewellery while [[berserk]].\n\n==Strategy==\nRings can be changed very quickly; it's wise to keep extra rings for situational encounters, such as having a [[ring of resist corrosion]] for a monster with [[acid]]ic attacks. This isn't true for amulets, however.\n\nThe [[amulet of faith]] is the only piece of jewellery that punishes you for unequipping it; removing Faith will cut piety by 33%.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], you could find amulets of inaccuracy, rings of teleportation, and rings of attention, which were always [[curse]]d.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], ring enchantments could be negative or positive, so you could find a -4 ring of slaying or a -6 ring of strength.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], amulets could be removed as quickly as rings, but often needed to be attuned to their user first (or had some other cost).\n*Prior to [[0.25]], ring enchantments were random values between 1 and 6 (positive and negative).\n\n{{jewellery}}\n\n[[Category:Items]]"}

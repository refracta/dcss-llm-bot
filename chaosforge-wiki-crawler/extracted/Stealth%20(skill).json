{"title":"Stealth (skill)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Stealth_(skill)","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''This page refers to the Stealth [[skill]]. For the stat and mechanic, see [[stealth]].''\n\nThe '''Stealth''' [[skill]] is a representation of how well your character understands the art of moving silently. Until your adventurer blunders into the [[Dungeon]] and starts killing everything, most monsters spend their time sleeping or wandering about peacefully. Stealth decreases the chance that you are detected, increases the power of [[stab]]bing unweary monsters, and increases the effectiveness of some status-inflicting [[dart]]s.\n\nFor every point of stealth, you gain 15 [[stealth]] score. Note that there's many other factors in determining stealth score, such as [[armour]], [[size]], and [[dexterity]]. This score is used for detection, but not stabs or darts. Stealth skill (not score) is also directly used to open [[door]]s; each time you open a door, the chance of it making noise is <code>1 / ( (4/3 * [[Stealth]]) + 8 )</code>.\n\n{{skill aptitudes|Stealth}}\n\n==Strategy==\nIn ''Crawl'', Stealth is generally poor as your \"main\" offensive skill. If stabbing is the only way you can kill things, and the enemy wakes up, then you have a problem. You'll need a way to kill awake monsters. But, if you have a way to kill awake monsters, stealth becomes superfluous. If you have a way to stab awake foes ([[Hexes]], [[Petrify]], [[Uskayaw]], etc.), though, then \"hex stabber\" stealth can be a good way to deal with monsters.\n\nInstead, stealth is often used as a defensive skill. It can help you avoid dangerous monsters, such as [[Sigmund]], [[orc priest]]s and [[centaur (monster)|centaurs]]. If you've been [[shaft]]ed, stealth can help you avoid encounters on the way back up.\n\n[[Armour encumbrance]] reduces stealth score by a flat amount. [[Plate armour]] reduces it by -214, equal to 14.4 levels of Stealth skill, so its hard for heavy melee brutes to benefit at all from stealth.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.12]], stealth skill trained at 80% the XP cost. To compensate, this version raised all non-[[Naga]] aptitudes by one.\n\n{{Skills}} [[Category:Skills]]"}

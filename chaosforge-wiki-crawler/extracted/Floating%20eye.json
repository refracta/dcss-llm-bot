{"title":"Floating eye","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Floating_eye","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{list of | eyeballs}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Floating eyes''' are harmless on their own, but when around monsters, are one of the deadliest enemies in the game. They are capable of  [[paralysis|paralysing]] for 2-4 turns with their [[smite-targeted]] gaze, rendering you easy prey for anything nearby. They can be found rarely in [[the Dungeon]], and occasionally in [[the Depths]] and [[Slime Pits]]. They can also be summoned by monsters with the [[Summon Eyeballs]] spell.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*An incredibly deadly monster. Being paralysed for 4 turns (which also lowers your [[EV]] and [[SH]] to practically 0) near any other monster can outright kill you. Most dangerous to [[EV]]-based fighters, though anyone should take great caution.\n*Unlike some other gaze attacks, they don't require line of fire to gaze at you. If you can see them, you are at risk (unless you are behind a translucent wall). They can fire through [[iron grate]]s and [[statue]]s. [[Willpower]] provides no protection, either. The only ways to prevent paralysis are to be a [[Formicid]] or a follower of [[Jiyva]]. You are rendered immune for paralysis for 1-3 turns after a paralysis ends, but this means that you were paralysed in the first place.\n*Thankfully, floating eyes are fragile and have terrible [[willpower]] of their own. Most mid-level characters can easily one-shot them. However, this fact won't save you if you can't hit the monster in the first place. [[Penetration|Piercing]] and [[smite-targeted]] attacks are good; [[Airstrike]], [[javelin]]s, [[tin of tremorstones]], etc. all work well if the eye is behind an enemy. Note that damage isn't a 100% reliable way to kill enemies, since even if you can't miss, you could always low roll.\n*Paralysis Gaze requires 2 casts to function. The first cast charges the ability, the second cast paralyses you. Every turn, floating eyes have a 40% chance to cast the spell. Therefore, floating eyes require a minimum of 2 turns in order to paralyse, but they'll often take more.\n**Floating eyes do not lose charge if you break line of sight. A fully charged floating eye will remain charged until you encounter it again.\n*If you don't have a means of killing one quickly, try using a [[scroll of fear]] - it has a 98% chance of success. Chasing one off will give you some time to deal with its allies. A [[scroll of fog]] will also help by breaking line of sight, giving you time to take out closer enemies or escape.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], floating eyes were replaced with '''[[glass eye]]s'''.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], these monsters were known as '''giant eyeballs'''. They were slow, but their gaze worked immediately. Also, they didn't appear in the [[Depths]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], giant eyeballs would randomly generate in Slime and Depths."}

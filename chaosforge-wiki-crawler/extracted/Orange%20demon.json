{"title":"Orange demon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Orange_demon","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n[[Orange demon]]s are melee-based [[tier-4 demon]]s with [[reaching]] sting attacks that [[poison]] and [[weak]]en you. They are found in [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], the [[Lair#Lair:5 vaults|Evil Forest]] variant of Lair:5, and in the company of [[Amaemon]]. They can also be created by the [[Summon Demon]] spell.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Unlike most demons, they aren't resistant to [[poison]]. [[Curare]] will slow early orange demons, while [[Mephitic Cloud]] can disable them.\n*They aren't very dangerous for even moderately well-armoured characters, but if you end up in the Abyss far too early, remembering that they can't fly might make escape a little easier. In general though, try to avoid fighting anything dangerous while weakened.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.13]], orange demons lacked reaching and inflicted [[dexterity]] damage instead of weakness.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

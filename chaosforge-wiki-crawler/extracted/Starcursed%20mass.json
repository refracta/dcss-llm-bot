{"title":"Starcursed mass","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Starcursed_mass","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Starcursed masses''' are the Lovecraftian equivalents of [[slime creature]]s, with two unique mechanics. They can be found in [[the Abyss]].\n\nStarcursed masses can combine and divide randomly. A combined starcursed mass has more HP, but otherwise share the same stats. It displays no sign that it is combined (unless the [[XP]] boost happens to increase its [[threat]] level). On their own, these monsters tend to divide, but if struck they will regroup.\n\nIn addition, starcursed masses have a shriek ability. If you have [[line of sight]] to at least one, you can be hit for <code>2 + 1d5 + 1d(1.5 * #_masses)</code> AC-ignoring damage.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-abil.cc|593}}</ref> If there are 5 or more masses in sight, you also have a 33% chance to be [[paralysed]] for 1 turn. If there are 7 or more masses in sight, you instead have a 50% chance to be paralysed for 2 turns. Combined masses are treated as one monster for the purposes of shrieking.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Using area-of-effect attacks, like [[Fireball]], will force starcursed masses to regroup. AOEs also deal high damage, since you get to hit multiple targets at a time.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], starcursed masses had fast regeneration.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], starcursed masses' shrieking did not affect monsters with [[monster intelligence|mindless]] or insect intelligence.\n*Starcursed masses were added in [[0.12]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

{"title":"Salamander mystic","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Salamander_mystic","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nDistant relatives of the [[list of nagas|nagas]], '''salamander mystics''' are magically-gifted, fiery snake men that possess the ability to [[haste]] their allies and pelt you with modestly powerful [[conjurations]]. Unsurprisingly, they are immune to [[fire]] and vulnerable to [[cold]]. They can be found in the [[Snake Pit]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Fire resistance greatly reduces their ability to deal damage to you, but even then they can still provide dangerous support for their allies.\n*[[Haste Other]] only works on monsters of the same \"[[type|genus]]\" - this includes salamanders and nagas, but not snakes.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], salamander mystics had [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] instead of [[Force Lance]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], salamander mystics had [[Localized Ignite Poison]] in their spellset, making them dangerous to characters that had been heavily poisoned by nagas.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Localized Ignite Poison always affected players with naturally poisonous flesh ([[naga]]s, [[kobold]]s, green [[draconian]]s, or [[Spider Form]])\n*Salamander mystics were added in [[0.14]]."}

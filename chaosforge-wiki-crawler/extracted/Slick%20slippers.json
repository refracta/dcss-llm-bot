They lack the protective benefits of a good pair of boots, but they can get their wearers out of almost any bind.}}\n\n[[File:Slick slippers.png]] '''''the +2 pair of slick slippers'''''\n\n+2 slippers (modified [[boots]]: 0 base AC)<br>\nMake all damaging melee attacks [[trample]] their wearer backward (immune when climbing [[stair]]s)<br>\nProvide immunity to [[constriction]], [[engulf]]ing, [[web]]s, and [[throwing net]]s.<br>\n+4 [[EV]]\n\n==Desirability==\nA \"freedom of movement\" style effect from the '''slick slippers'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|1732}}</ref> is desirable, especially in places where nets/webs or constriction are common, like [[Spider's Nest|Spider]] and [[Snake]], respectively. The +4 EV is a welcome bonus.\n\nHowever, the slippery effect is generally a negative. Being forced to move, at seemingly random intervals, can cause a lot of problems. It makes [[stair dancing]] very difficult. You can be forced onto traps or into [[shallow water]]. It often makes your positioning worse. And slippery is unreliable: since you must be ''damaged'' in order for it to proc, dodging an attack means you won't actually get pushed back.\n\nIf you can manage your fights and positioning well, then you can negate much of the downside from the proc. For example, fighting with your back against a wall (or against another monster) will prevent you from being pushed around. It may be a positive in some situations, as it lets you back up for relatively free.\n\n==History==\n*The slick slippers were added in [[0.30]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Boots]]"}

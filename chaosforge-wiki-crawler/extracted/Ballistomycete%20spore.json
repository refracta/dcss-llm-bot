{"title":"Ballistomycete spore","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ballistomycete_spore","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | plants}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ballistomycete spores''' are fast-moving, suicidal creatures created by [[ballistomycete]]s. On contact with a target or on death, they explode in a 3x3 area. This deals <code>3d(6 + [[Invocations]] skill)</code> damage<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|mon-explode.cc|69}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-summoning.cc|2494}}<br>Note that the spore's HD is adjusted by +1 in {{source ref|0.30.0|mon-cast.cc|6545}}.</ref> and [[confusion|confuses]] living, [[unbreathing|breathing]] targets. They have only 1 HP, so any successful attack will destroy them.\n\nBallistomycetes are never found in the dungeon proper, but can be created using [[Fedhas]]' Grow Ballistomycete ability. Spores are considered plants, so you can fire through one without harming it.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Confusion is a very strong effect: it prevents spellcasting, allows [[stab]]s, and greatly lowers melee [[to-hit]]. A ballistomycete colony or two can take out most early game threats on its own, and help take out later ones. \n*Spores aren't mindful of what they hit. Don't be next to a spore when it explodes, or you'll take a huge chunk of damage and be confused. You can't '''[[t]]'''ell them to do anything, so don't bother.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.24]], [[ballistomycete]]s could reproduce via spores. The spores left mold as they moved, and new ballistomycetes could grow on it. Also, they had an explosion radius of 2 (5x5), and its damage was fixed at 3d15.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], ballistomycete spores were known as '''giant spores'''.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], ballistomycete colonies could spawn naturally, instead of being exclusively created by Fedhasites.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

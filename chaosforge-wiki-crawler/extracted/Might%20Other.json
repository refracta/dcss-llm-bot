Deep troll shamans can only use this spell on other [[list of trolls|trolls]]. Ironbrand convoker has no such limitation.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==Strategy==\nHaving a caster with Might Other on your side is extremely useful. Fortunately, deep troll shamans that you capture through [[Yredelemnul]]'s Enslave Soul ability are not limited to just buffing trolls.\n\n==History==\n*Might Other was added in [[0.12]].\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Berserk Other]]\n*[[Haste Other]]\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

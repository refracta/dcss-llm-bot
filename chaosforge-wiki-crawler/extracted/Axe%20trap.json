{"title":"Axe trap","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Axe_trap","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n[[File:Axe_trap.png]] '''Axe traps''' were [[trap]]s which fired [[hand axe]]s when stepped upon by a player or [[monster]]. They were the most damaging of the traps that fired ammunition, ranking just above the [[bolt trap]] (but still well behind the lethal [[blade trap]]).\n\nAxe traps held 2-7 +0, +0 hand axes, dealing between 1 and 15+''dungeon level'' damage to the player, or just between 1 and 15 to monsters. They could be disarmed with the [[Traps & Doors]] skill.\n\n[[Repel Missiles]] and [[Deflect Missiles]] both reduced the chance of this trap being able to hit the player.\n\n==History==\nAxe traps were added in [[0.5.2]], and were removed in [[0.11]].\n\n[[Category:Traps]]"}

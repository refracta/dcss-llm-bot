I cast Corona on the first few monsters and quickly pepper their illuminated bodies with arrows. I find a shortsword and swap it for my bow. The Corona + combat continues till I reach experience level 2, where I memorise Swiftness. This race/class combination wants as many escape combinations as it can get!\n\nA kobold hurls exploding darts, almost destroying me. I run up and hit him. Whew, that was close. Should've used my bow, probably. \n\nOn '''D:2''', nothing new at first. I grab a +2 robe from a hobgoblin. Upon reaching level 3, I learn Poison Weapon. I'll want more Enchantments skill to cast it at better rates than my current Poor. \n\n'''D:3''' - this game is forebodingly quiet and easy. I reach an Enchantments level of 3. An imp wandering the level clearly outmatches me, so I'll leave him here till I have enough spell levels to cast Freezing Aura. \n\nOn '''D:4''', I meet a hound. I cast Swiftness and Poison Weapon, strike it till it is heavily wounded, and retreat with my boosted speed while the poison takes effect. With the kill's XP, I train Spellcasting to 3 so I can learn Freezing Aura. I return and freeze the imp to death. A basalt altar to Yredelemnul stands by the stairs, but I ignore it and pass by. \n\nAs I step around a corner, I find the floor shimmering in various colours, fountains and water pools amidst the chaos. An altar to the chaotic deity Xom, I presume. Wanting to confirm this, I step forward, but an orc wizard is asleep on the floor. I exclude him - don't want to risk my life - and continue the quest. I wield a sabre in place of my short sword.\n\nAn amulet of conservation! Sweet! I also have a grand total of five teleportation scrolls. After kiting a giant beetle to death with poison, I find an unexplored area of D:3. An orc priest assaults me. I dive behind a corner to get him out of my LOS, poison my weapon and await it. He dies quickly enough, luckily without even smiting me once.\n\nBack on D:4, I strap on an orcish buckler. Any defences will greatly help me right now. I find an ogre! With Swiftness and poisoned arrows, I bring it down. Returning to the Xom altar vault, I approach the orc wizard - only to find him together with a priest and a gnoll. I have to dive through a hatch to '''D:5''' save my life, encountering an orc wizard at only 21 HP! This is far too risky, so I teleport immediately. Retrospectively, I should have probably done this on D:4. But it only puts me a bit away... the wizard still knows where I am. Two turns later, he's in LOS. Unimpressed, I hide behind a Fedhas altar's plant and teleport yet again. I'm in safety, and soon after return to D:4. I hunt down the remaining orcs. At the Xom altar, I find a dagger of chaos. I'll keep it, though I doubt it will serve me well. But my sabre is still very slow.\n\n\nI contine D:5. A twisted glowing staff lying around on the floor is not of any use right now, but could be later, so I take it with me. A few orcs and gnolls are but a minor threat now. But as I rest on D:4, an orc approaches and zaps me with a wand of cold. Argh! I run up and hit it with a poisoned weapon. Luckily, the wand only held three charges, so I survive easily. I read some un-IDed scrolls and thus manage to recharge it. My staff was of summoning, by the way.\n\nI find a golden ring and a bronze ring. The latter is a ring of magical power. Why not?\n\nAn attempt to melee an ogre ends in tears. I retreat and use my bow.\n\n'''D:6'''! The Temple should appear soon, making my life much much easier... \n\nAn imp and a giant frog attack me from two sides. I freeze both of them, since it is also effective against cold-blooded creatures. \n\nKobold room! I kite a few of them out and fight in a corridor. The big kobolds are tough and force me to retreat. After a few short fights, with me resting up inbetween, I kill them all. \n\nA wand of random effects. Bah.\n\nHello, Menkaure! He is mainly dangerous because of his Symbol of Torment and Pain spells. But he has Haste as well and hits hard in melee - and to make it worse, he is backed up by an ogre - so I leg it. And come across the Temple! Whee!\n\nI join the ranks of Kikubaaqudgha's followers. I have the feeling that a good old +9 sabre of pain would take the pain of this combo away.\n\n==Early game, pre-Lair==\nI flamebrand my sabre and make short work of my fellow mummy Menkaure. I definitely need more spell slots and can cast all brand spells and Swiftness reliably, so I turn off Enchantments in favour of Spellcasting for now. \n\n'''D:7''' and a helmet! I now have a grand total of 4 AC. Since I have a +1 robe of cold resistance and a ring of protection from cold (the previously unidentified one) I now have rC+++. Well, if I encounter any OOD ice dragons... rF+ would have been much nicer though. The bright side is that even robes can be enchanted to +8 in this old version. I find and wear a cloak.\n\nArgh! Jelly! For occasions like this, I brought a dwarven short sword. It resists corrosive effects. I let it flame and attack the jelly, casting Corona on it because I want to kill it as quickly as possible. Which I do. Luckily, my armour is still in a good state.\n\nDuvessa with her runed elven sabre! Greed! I cast Swiftness to lure her away from her twin brother Dowan who will be lurking around somewhere. I hate killing the two to be honest, I like the pair. After killer her, I examine her sabre. It's unbranded, which is actually good because I can still freely choose the brand this way. \n\nWonderful! A Book of the Sky! Flight's only Fair since it's Charms/Air, but this is definitely enough reason to go on training the school right now. Maybe I will get Silence and possibly Airstrike later, when I have high Necromancy and Short Blades skill and it's time to branch out. \n\nThere's Dowan! After his sister's death, he finds hidden reserves of power... hasted, with Throw Icicle and Stone Arrow, he's pretty dangerous! I zap my wand of cold at him once. Miss. He hits me for 15. I decide to waste another charge - oneshotting the poor chap. He has a wand of teleportation (7) on him. Wow! Nice!\n\nAfter entering '''D:8''', I find a scroll. Upon reading it, it's revealed as a scroll of enchant weapon III. Okay, it enchanted the sabre which is no problem at all.\n\nThen, I encounter a large pack of orcs. I kill the wizard and then swiftfly away from them. I round a corner. Then, suddenly...\n\n The centaur shouts!\n The centaur unwields an uncursed spear. The centaur wields a glowing bow.\n It bursts into flame! The centaur shoots an arrow of flame.\n The arrow of flame hits you! The fire burns you terribly!\n Ouch! That really hurt!\n You die...\n\nOh well. Mummy."}

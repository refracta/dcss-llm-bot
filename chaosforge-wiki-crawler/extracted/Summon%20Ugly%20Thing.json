The summoned things last a long time and some of their branded attacks can be quite powerful, especially against vulnerable enemies.\n\n[[File:very_ugly_thing_chance.png]]\n\n==History==\n*Summon Ugly Thing was removed in [[0.14]].\n*Prior to [[0.10]], this spell could occasionally summon hostile ugly things, particularly at low spell power.\n*In [[0.6]], the spell was improved so that it always summoned very ugly things at high spell power. It was weakened to its current form in [[0.7]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

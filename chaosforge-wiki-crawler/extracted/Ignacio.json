{"title":"Ignacio","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ignacio","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ignacio''' is a [[unique]] [[executioner]] of [[Makhleb]] with much more HP than normal, as well as an [[executioner's axe]] of [[Pain (brand)|pain]]. He can deal an insane amount of damage in melee, especially when hasted. A rare unique, he only exists in 50% of games, and if he does generate, will only be found on random floors in [[Pandemonium]]. If you flee the particular level of Pandemonium you found him on without killing him, he will appear in later Pan levels with a 10% chance.\n\n==Location==\n*[[Pandemonium]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Make sure to have at least one level of [[negative energy]] resistance to reduce the damage of Agony and his pain-branded axe. rN+++ is good to have if you can pull it off.\n*Don't expect an army of summoned allies to keep Ignacio away from you; his [[cleaving]] attacks allow him to clear away anything adjacent to him very quickly.\n*Like any executioner, he cannot fly, but good luck finding any [[lava]] or [[deep water]] to trap him behind.\n*With Ignacio, there really is no such thing as overkill - allowing him into melee range is suicidal for all but the most heavily-armored characters, and even they may find themselves taking frightening amounts of damage. Hit him with everything you have as quickly as possible.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], collecting pandemonium runes increased the chance to find Ignacio on a pandemonium floor.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Ignacio could cast [[Pain]]."}

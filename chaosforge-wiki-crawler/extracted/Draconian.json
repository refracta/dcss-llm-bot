{"title":"Draconian","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Draconian","type":"raw","data":"{{Version031}}\n''This article covers the player [[species]]. For the monster, see [[Draconian (monster)]]. For a list of all monstrous draconians, see [[List of draconians]].''\n{{flavour|Draconians are human-dragon hybrids: humanoid in form and approximately human-sized, with wings, tails and scaly skins. Draconians start out in an immature form with brown scales, but as they grow in power they take on a variety of colours. This happens at an early stage in their career, and the colour is determined by chromosomes, not by behaviour.\n\nMost types of Draconians have breath weapons or special resistances. Draconians cannot wear body armour and advance very slowly in levels, but are reasonably good at all skills other than missile weapons, and they develop natural physical defenses that compensate for the lack of body armour, without needing to train their Armour skill at all. Still, each colour has its own strengths and some have complementary weaknesses, which sometimes requires a bit of flexibility on the part of the player. They are good general-purpose spellcasters, and typically their spellcasting aptitudes will adapt slightly when they gain a colour.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*Draconians' wings and oddly-shaped heads prevent them from wearing [[helmet]]s or any form of [[body armour]]. They can't cast [[Animate Armour]].\n*'''Tail Slap''': Draconians have an [[auxiliary attack|auxiliary tail-slap attack]] (damage = 6; chance = <code>50% * (30 + XL)/59</code>).\n*'''Scales''': Draconians start with +4 [[AC]], and gain an additional +1 AC every 3rd level.\n*'''[[Cold-blooded]]''': Draconians are [[slow]]ed by certain [[cold]]-based attacks. [[Cold resistance]] negates this.\n*While in [[Dragon Form]], Draconians retain their scale bonus (with a -6 AC penalty), colour, and [[breath weapon]].\n\nDraconians have a base [[Strength]] of 10, [[Intelligence]] of 8 and [[Dexterity]] of 6 (before Background modifiers).\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Zealots:'''  [[Berserker]]\n*'''Warrior-mages:''' [[Transmuter]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Conjurer]], [[Fire Elementalist]], [[Ice Elementalist]], [[Air Elementalist]], [[Earth Elementalist]], [[Venom Mage]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*Draconians mature into a random colour at level 7, changing aptitudes and intrinsic characteristics. Some colors get another bonus at Level 14.\n*+1 to a random [[stat]] every 4th level.\n*10% more [[HP]] than average.\n*Average [[MP]].\n*+3 [[willpower]] per level (+6 for purple Draconians).\n*+1 AC every 3rd level as scales continue to harden.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Easy}}\n\nWith natural defenses and above average HP, Draconians are a relatively easy race to play. While they can't wear [[body armour]], their scales provide AC without the usual [[armour encumbrance]]. Because of this, Draconians make good spellcasters and [[Ranged Weapons|ranged fighters]]. Otherwise, their aptitudes are average or higher across the board, so they can do well in most roles.\n\nMost colours get [[Draconian breath attacks|breath attacks]] at level 7, which are powerful ranged options for the early game. Or, in the case of Pale Draconians, the ability to block [[line of sight]] with steam (very desirable, as monsters won't be able to see or attack you). Certain colours will receive a somewhat poor aptitude (-2) to one magic school; in many cases, this does not majorly affect game play.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Draconian}}\n\n==Colors==\nDraconians start at an immature brown with no special abilities, and reach their mature color at level 7. They receive a [[Draconian breath attacks|breath attack]], resistances, and an adjustment to their aptitudes which will retroactively adjust their skill levels.\n\n===Red===\n{{flavour|Red Draconians feel at home in fiery surroundings. They are bad with ice magic but very proficient with fire. Their scorchingly hot breath will leave a lingering cloud of flame.}}\n*Skills: +2 [[Fire Magic]], -2 [[Ice Magic]]\n*Resists: rF+\n*Breath: A bolt of flame that leaves a cloud of flame at the end of its range. (Can be aimed at the ground with [.])\n\n===White===\n{{flavour|White Draconians stem from frost-bitten lands, and are naturally resistant to frost. Their breath is piercing cold. They are versed in ice magic, but bad at fire.}}\n*Skills: +2 [[Ice Magic]], -2 [[Fire Magic]]\n*Resists: rC+ (negates effects of being cold-blooded)\n*Breath: A bolt of frost that may knock back monsters.\n\n===Green===\n{{flavour|Green Draconians are used to venomous surroundings and breathe clouds of mephitic vapours. They are especially good in the arts of poison and without deficiencies in other magic realms. Later on, they will develop a poisonous stinger.}}\n*Skills: +2 [[Alchemy]]\n*Resists: rPois\n*Breath: A bolt of noxious fumes that leaves behind [[Mephitic Cloud]]s on the affected tiles.\n*Melee: Gains a [[venom]]ous [[good_mutations#Stinger|stinger]] at level 14.\n\n===Yellow===\n{{flavour|Yellow Draconians have a sulphurous breath full of corrosive acid, and later gain an acidic bite attack. They are acid resistant, too.}}\n*Resists: rCorr\n*Breath: A corrosive [[acid]]ic glob that can splash onto adjacent enemies.\n*Melee: Gains [[Jiyva_mutations#Acidic_Bite|acidic saliva]] at level 14.\n\n===Grey===\n{{flavour|Grey Draconians have no breath weapon, but their bodies are adapted to the water, allowing them to swim. They are proficient with earth magic but bad with air magic, and they also have harder scales than other Draconians.}}\n*Skills: +2 [[Earth Magic]], -2 [[Air Magic]]\n*Resists: Immediate +5 to AC.\n*Movement: [[Amphibious]] (Can enter deep water, ignore movement and evasion penalties from water, immune to drowning.)\n\n===Black===\n{{flavour|Black Draconians can unleash huge electrical discharges, and are naturally insulated. They are good at air magic but feel cumbersome with earth magic. Their wings will eventually grow larger, which allows them to fly continuously when combined with their natural skill with air magic.}}\n*Skills: +2 [[Air Magic]], -2 [[Earth Magic]]\n*Resists: rElec\n*Breath: Wild explosions of lightning, mixing lightning bolts and orbs (powerful but uncontrollable).\n*Movement: Gains [[good mutations#Big Wings|big wings]] at level 14.\n\n===Purple===\n{{flavour|Purple Draconians are highly adapted to all spellcasting in general, and to hexes in particular. They are a bit better at evoking things than most other Draconians. They can breathe dispelling energy which strips those it hits of their enchantments, and are naturally stronger-willed than other draconians.}}\n*Skills: +2 [[Spellcasting]] (to +1), +2 [[Hexes]] (to +1), +1 [[Evocations]]\n*Resists: Increased [[willpower]] (gain +6 per level instead of +3).\n*Breath: A bolt of power that deals irresistible damage and removes buffs (e.g., [[Haste]], [[Invisibility]]).\n\n===Pale===\n{{flavour|Pale Draconians are better at air and fire magic, and have no deficiencies in other schools. They breathe steam and, like their Purple cousins, have a slight advantage at Evocations.}}\n*Skills: +1 Fire Magic, +1 Air Magic, +1 Evocations\n*Resists: rSteam\n*Breath: Steam clouds, which do little damage but block [[LOS]].\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Draconian breath attacks will be reworked. For more details, see [[Draconian breath attacks#History|here]]. In addition:}}\n**Grey draconians will get +5 AC at XL 14 instead of XL 7.\n**Purple draconians will no longer get extra willpower per level. Instead, they will get [[Strong-Willed]] 1 at XL 7, and they will get '''Inviolate Magic''' at XL 14, which prevents their magical effects from being unravelled and reduces hostile MP drain by 2/3rd.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], pale Draconian's breath had a cooldown twice as short.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Draconians did not have innate [[GDR]], as it was tied to a player's body armour. Also, grey Draconians were [[unbreathing]] instead of [[amphibious]], which granted them immunity to certain cloud effects. In addition, white Draconians' breath would only knock back [[flying]] opponents.\n*Prior to the [[Charms]] school's removal in [[0.26]], purple Draconians were particularly skilled with Charms compared to other draconians.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], players could also become mottled Draconians, which could breathe [[Sticky Flame]]s and learned  Fire Magic slightly quicker. Additionally, all mature draconian [[player ghost]]s had a negative energy breath weapon, making them even more dangerous opponents.\n*As of [[0.12]], all Draconians are considered [[cold-blooded]].\n*Prior to [[0.11]], grey Draconians were elementally neutral, receiving bonuses to [[Stealth]] and [[Stabbing]] in place of the Earth Magic boost, and they did not gain the +5 bonus to AC. Yellow Draconians only had rAcid (not rCorr).\n*Prior to [[0.10]], Draconians had access to any body armour that could fit large species, but could not wear boots or gloves.\n*Prior to [[0.7]], grey Draconians got better stats to make up for their lack of a breath attack.\n\n{{species}}"}

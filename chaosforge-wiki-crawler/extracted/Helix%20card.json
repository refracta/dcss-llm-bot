Otherwise, with equal probability:\n**Gain one random mutation.\n**Lose one random mutation then gain one random mutation.\n**Lose one random mutation.\n*Power level 1: If there are no mutations, gain one (likely to be [[Good mutations|good]]). Otherwise, with equal probability:\n**Gain one mutation (likely to be [[Good mutations|good mutation]]).\n**Lose one mutation (likely to be [[Bad mutations|bad mutation]] if the player has any bad mutations).\n**Gain one mutation and lose one mutation, with following probabilities:\n***25%: Lose one probably-[[Bad mutations|bad mutation]] and gain one random mutation.\n***25%: Lose one random mutation and gain one probably-[[Good mutations|good mutation]].\n***50%: Lose one random mutation and gain one random mutation.\n*Power level 2: With equal probability:\n**Lose a probably-[[Bad mutations|bad mutation]]; no effect if there are no mutations.\n**Gain one probably-[[Good mutations|good mutation]].\n**With equal probability:\n***Lose a probably-[[Bad mutations|bad mutation]] if the player has any, then gain a random mutation.\n***Lose a random mutation, then gain a probably-[[Good mutations|good mutation]].\n\nThe Helix card could be found in the following [[Decks|decks]] in the past.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.11]]\n![[0.12]]\n![[0.13]]\n![[0.14]]\n![[0.15]]\n![[0.16]]\n![[0.17]]\n![[0.18]]\n![[0.19]] and beyond\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of oddities|Oddities]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of oddities|Oddities]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of oddities|Oddities]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of oddities|Oddities]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n|----\n|}\n==History==\nThis card became unavailable in the deck simplification of [[0.19]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

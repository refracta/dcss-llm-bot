{"title":"Out of depth","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Out_of_depth","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For the other OOD, see [[Orb of Destruction]].''\n\nCrawl tends to create many '''out of depth''' ('''OOD''') monsters, or monsters who have spawned on a higher floor then where they are \"usually\" spawned. The source file mon-pick-data.h<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-pick-data.h|1}}</ref> defines where is a monster's base floor is, so anything above that is technically \"OOD\". The term typically refers to non-[[unique]] monsters which are much more difficult relative to where you are in the game, such as a [[sky beast]] on D:2.\n__NOTOC__\n==Creation==\nLike all monsters, out of depth monsters are spawned when the floor is generated. Their 'base floor' is fuzzed, favoring the actual number, but often either up or down. \n\nThere are also a few special cases with monster spawns which can break the \"normal\" rules of generation.\n*Monsters can often spawn in \"bands\", which have their own depth. Despite orc priests naturally spawning on D:4, they can spawn on D:3 or even D:2 as a part of an orc band. (Because this is common enough, D:3 Priests often aren't  considered OOD).\n*Monsters can spawn in pregenerated [[vault]]s. For instance, one [[Lair]] entrance vault contains [[death yak]]s. Death yaks don't naturally spawn in the Dungeon at all, but are very tough enemies for D:8.\n\nThere are some hardcoded assurances that certain, ridiculously difficult monsters can't spawn - [[water moccasin]]s can never spawn on D:2, though they can spawn on D:3.\n\n==Strategy==\nOut of depths are most noticeable in [[the Dungeon]]: it is the longest branch, ramps up in monster strength between floors, and is explored when you don't have as many options to escape. In other branches, out of depths can still be an issue, but less. For example, most characters will find D:5 [[killer bee]]s deadlier than [[Depths]]:2 [[caustic shrike]]s. Later on, [[unique]] monsters fill the role of an \"above-average monster\".\n\nWhen encountering an out-of-depth monster, check the monster's description, especially the speed and range, and determine if you can just walk away.\n*An OOD [[ogre (monster)|ogre]] or [[hydra]] might have brutal melee attacks, but they are 100% speed melee enemies. If nothing's in the way, you can just walk away if you see them. You can then go up stairs, then enter the floor from a different set of stairs.\n*An OOD [[orc priest]] can be extremely scary - it has 17 damage [[Smiting]] that can attack from anywhere in sight. But if the priest is at the edge of your [[line of sight]], you can also walk away (since monsters cannot attack outside LOS, and orc priests aren't fast). \n*An OOD [[centaur (monster)|centaur]] is faster than all players (except [[Spriggan]]s) ''and'' have a ranged attack. There's no running away, at least without using an item.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*[[Escaping_from_(and_avoiding)_trouble#Options_when_in_immediate_danger|Use your consumables]]! ''Especially'' if you can't escape by simply walking away.\n*If all else fails, you can simply skip the floor and descend downwards. After all, D:11 and Lair:1 are, ''most likely'', less dangerous than a D:10 with a wandering [[storm dragon]]. Even if the floor below would be dangerous, you can at least check out what's actually in store  (and decide from there).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.21]], monster spawning was used as a means to create out of depth monsters. If the [[out-of-depth timer]] went on too long, then it became more and more likely for these difficult monsters to spawn.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

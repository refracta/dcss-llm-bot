{"title":"Alligator","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Alligator","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{stub}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Alligators''' are a mean step up from [[crocodile]]s, capable of ambushing adventurers with surprising speed and powerful bites. They can be found in [[the Swamp]], with a 20% chance to be accompanied by a second alligator outside of [[vault]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Their willpower is non-trivial, but a gifted [[Hex]]er can overcome it. In addition, they lack any elemental resistances and are [[cold-blooded]], making [[Conjuration]]s reasonably effective against them. They also lack [[see invisible]], making invisibility an appealing option against them.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], alligators became faster and got a drag attack, but lost their [[Sprint]] ability. Also, alligators' damage and maximum HP were nerfed.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], alligators were able to [[submerge|hide]] in water.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], an alligator had a chance to spawn with additional [[baby alligator]]s.\n*Alligators were added in [[0.6|0.6-d619ec97]]."}

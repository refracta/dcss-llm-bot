{"title":"Held","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Held","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n\n'''Held''' is a status effect caused when you are ensnared in a [[throwing net]] or [[Trap#Physical traps|web]], displayed as {{red|Held}}. Being held prevents you from moving, making most physical attacks, and using a [[shield]] until you manage to break loose. Trying to move or attack will instead cause you to struggle against, and possibly escape, the trap.\n\n== Monster Version ==\nMonsters typically inflict a similar effect called [[constriction]], which deals damage and a few more effects.\n\n[[Jumping spider]]s and monsters with the [[Ensnare]] spell can create webs, which hold their target in place.\n\n== Tips and Tricks ==\n*Actions that don't involve moving like reading, quaffing, casting spells, or invoking items are work normally. \n*[[Blink]]ing, [[teleport]]ing, or [[Strong Legs|hopping]] can reliably free you from being held. [[Transformation|Transforming]] into something that cannot be held also frees you from being held.\n\n== History ==\n*Prior to [[0.10]], monsters could hold you instead of [[Constriction|constricting]] you.\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

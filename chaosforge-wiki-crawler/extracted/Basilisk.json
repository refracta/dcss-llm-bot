{"title":"Basilisk","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Basilisk","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Basilisks''' are reptilian monsters armed with an average bite and a [[Petrify|petrifying gaze]] attack that you can resist with [[willpower]]. They will try to petrify you as they rush into melee range, giving them a few turns to chomp at you while you recover, but they aren't very threatening unless there are other monsters around. They can be found in [[the Lair]] and, less commonly, in the middle-[[Dungeon]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Gargoyle]]s and players in certain forms ([[Shadow Form]], [[Statue Form]], [[Wisp Form]]) are immune to their gaze, as are followers of [[Zin]] who are using the Vitalisation ability.\n*If you find yourself petrifying with multiple enemies approaching, a timely [[teleport]] might send you to safety. But if you are on an unexplored floor, it's better to drink a [[potion of cancellation]].\n\n==History==\n*Basilisks were introduced in [[0.9]], replacing [[gila monster]]s."}

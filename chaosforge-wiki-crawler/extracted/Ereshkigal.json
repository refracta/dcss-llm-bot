{"title":"Ereshkigal","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ereshkigal","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ereshkigal''' is an umbral [[demon]] lord who guards the bone [[rune]] on the lowest floor of [[Tartarus]]. She is notable for being fast and very difficult to hit, and calls demons to her aid while tormenting and paralyzing you. On top of that, she can recover a tremendous amount of [[HP]] with her magic while simultaneously stopping your spells with [[Silence]]. She is encountered with a pack of [[Tzitzimimeh]] at her side.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*A source of [[torment]] resistance and maxed out [[negative energy]] resistance will greatly reduce her damage. [[Cold]] resistance is helpful against her [[Bolt of Cold]].\n**While [[Necromutation]] will provide living characters with immunity to torment, her [[Tzitzimimeh]] can quickly annihilate undead characters with [[Dispel Undead Range]]. Keep a large pack of summoned minions in the way to block their line of fire if you choose to face her while undead.\n\n*In addition, [[paralysis]] is always a deadly effect. Due to the [[willpower]]-halving effects of Tartarus, Ereshkigal has a 17% chance of paralysing you at max will. Even the most well-equipped characters can be instantly killed by her. You'll want as much willpower as you can (Will+++++ before entering Tartarus) to maximally improve your chances.\n: There are only a few ways of completely preventing paralysis:\n:*Creating a swarm of allies, since paralyse requires a line of fire. Having 5-6 angels from [[the Shining One]] will likely kill her outright. [[Dragon's Call]] works too.\n:*Attacking from outside [[line of sight]]. You can take advantage of [[Fire Storm]], with either [[Vehumet]]'s range increase or a [[scarf]] of [[shadows]]' LOS decrease. [[Haste]] yourself, throw a [[net]], step 1 tile back, and start firing. This also has the benefit of preventing silence. This strategy is still vulnerable to paralysis, during the turn(s) where you throw a net. \n:*[[Dithmenos]]' Shadow Form gives you infinite willpower, bypassing the restriction in Tartarus. Also, [[Formicid]]s are always immune to paralysis.\n\n*Her [[ev]]asion can be a major headache unless you have ways around it. Powerful, undodgeable spells such as [[Shatter]] or [[Fire Storm]] work well. Straight melee characters will have a harder time of it, but [[the Shining One]]'s divine halo and [[holy wrath]] weapons can help make your swings much more effective.\n**[[Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling]] is an interesting alternative for taking down Ereshkigal. If you can complete the channeling, she will be instantly defeated, but look out for her [[Silence]], which can dissipate your charge as you are accumulating it.\n\n*Try to buff yourself up before getting caught in her silence [[aura]], and remember that [[potion]]s, [[wand]]s, and other [[evocable items]] still function even then. A [[wand of quicksilver]], if you have it, will end silence (if it hits).\n\n==Trivia==\nIn Mesopotamian mythology, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ereshkigal Ereshkigal] was the goddess of Irkalla, the land of the dead or underworld.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Tartarus didn't halve [[willpower]]; enough willpower could always resist the paralysis.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Ereshkigal had [[Summon Greater Demon]] instead of Summon Tzitzimitl.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], Ereshkigal had only 250 HP. and her spell set was much weaker; she had [[Minor Healing]] in place of Major Healing, and [[Bolt of Draining]] in place of Silence."}

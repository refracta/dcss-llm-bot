Sand, ashes, and turf coat the boots' soles.\n\nDrawing this card can grant great speed to allies or terrible slowness to foes.\n\nIt is found in decks of escape.}}\n\nThe Velocity card has the following effects depending on power level:\n*<code>level in 2</code> chance to remove [[Slow]] from the player\n*<code>(level + 1) in 3</code> chance to slow down each enemy in your [[line of sight]]\n*<code>level in 2</code> chance to haste each ally in your line of sight\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.23]], the card could remove [[Haste]] from the player at the lowest power level. Also, the list of possible effects had [[Swiftness]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], this card functioned differently: it could slow down fast monsters and haste slow ones. At high power, the effect was more likely to be beneficial for the player and allies and harmful for enemies. Also, the card was strictly harmful for the player at the lowest power level, and it couldn't give [[Swiftness]].\n\nThe Velocity card could be found in the following [[Decks|decks]] over the past several versions.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.11]]\n![[0.12]]\n![[0.13]]\n![[0.14]]\n![[0.15]]\n![[0.16]]\n![[0.17]]\n![[0.18]]\n![[0.19]] and beyond\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n|----\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n{{cards}}\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

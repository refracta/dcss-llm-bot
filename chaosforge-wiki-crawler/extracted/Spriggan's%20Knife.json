Anyway, it's in some way associated with those fey folk.\n\nIt is more effective when stabbing unaware enemies, treating them as though they were completely helpless.}}\n[[File:Spriggan's_knife.png]] '''''the +7 Spriggan's Knife'''''\n\n+7 [[dagger]]\n\nConverts 50% of [[stabbing|stabs]] to [[sleep]]-tier stabs.<br>\n+4 EV<br>\n+50 [[Stealth]]\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''Spriggan's Knife'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|691}}</ref> is an incredibly powerful item for [[stab]]bers. Monsters who are distracted, [[confuse]]d, or even those who haven't noticed you yet will have a 50% chance to take a sleep-tier stab, which is often a one-shot for a character with good Short Blades and Stealth skill.\n\nThere are many ways to get stabs, even against monsters with extreme [[HD]] or [[willpower]]. All monsters can fail to notice you, only a select few monsters are immune to [[throwing net]]s, even fewer are immune to a [[wand of light]], and [[Uskayaw]]'s Line Pass works on any enemy. [[Gozag]], allied [[summon]]s, or animated [[undead]] can distract enemies, which monsters are not immune to.\n\nUnfortunately, it isn't much use to other characters unless you find it very early on, since an unbranded dagger is a poor weapon for general combat.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the Spriggan's Knife converted all stabs to sleep-tier stabs.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], the Spriggan's Knife also had Dex+4 and MR+, but did not convert stabs to sleep-tier stabs.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the Spriggan's Knife had a +4, +10 enchantment.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the provided MR was only +20.\n*This weapon was upgraded from a [[knife]] to a dagger with the removal of knives in [[0.9]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Short blades]]"}

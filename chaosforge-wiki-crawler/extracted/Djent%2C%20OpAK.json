{"title":"Djent, OpAK","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Djent,_OpAK","type":"raw","data":"{{diary}}\n\n\n== Last 2 hours of the 0.17 Tournament ==\n\n== Nemelex' Choice: OpAK ==\n\n'''Three failed attempts already'''\n\n= Attempt 4 =\nStarted with a hand axe in the Abyss. Found 9 gold pieces. I hope I will get to use them. Found a scroll before finding the exit out of the Abyss. Saved some piety with Lugonu by not using abilities to get out.\n\nBlinded by a glowing ruby potion entering the main dungeon. Traded my hand axe for a +2 dagger of venom from a Kobold. Drank a potion in vain aiming to be cured of my bad poison with 5 HP left. I grasp a few coins before succumbing to the poison. The last thing I hear is a goblin shouting.\n\n= Attempt 5 =\nThe Abyss seems very claustrophobic today. Found 17 gold and left. \n\nAgain, I find a Kobold wielding a dagger of venom. Again badly poisoned, I swap out my hand axe for the +1 dagger of venom and put on an unidentified ring hoping for poison resistance. I instead identify a +3 ring of slaying. There seems to be a lethal amount of poison in me, I cannot rest. I eat my free loaf of bread as a last meal.\n\n= Attempt 6 =\nThe Abyss seems to be low on items today. I pick up some stones when I reach the main dungeon.\n\nThe Dungeon is full of trees. Very clean smelling. My tentacles curl as I find a three-wide door. No Kobolds with poisoned daggers in this dream. I put on a moonstone ring. I feel as if I could see the supernatural. A bat empowers me to level 2. My first big fight is with a pack of jackals. I feel a flame in my soul as I equip a guilded ring. My stealth assists me in killing many monsters. A hobgoblin empowers me to level 3. I feel more dexterous. I now feel like I know Dungeon 1 very well.\n\nMy second large fight is with some gnolls. A lucky potion of ambrosia saves my life as I slash the gnolls. I then work my way through some sort of goblin fortress. Jackals seem to inhabit it as well. Ijyb gets put to rest without even giving me a scratch. Crazy Yuif proves no match for me. I feel as though I can remember Dungeon 2 fully.\n\nTwo newts and a Kobold are silently killed in their sleep near the upward staircase. My next large fight is with a group of Orcs. They have an Orc Wizard with them. I finish them off, but at a cost. I retreat to Dungeon 2 to recover from an otherwise fatal poison. I feel better. I return to Dungeon 3 and find Terence taking a nap. There is Natasha sleeping farther down the hallway. I cannot get away without waking her. Constricted, she meets her match. Almost like dejavu, I find Natasha again, and she meets a similar fate. Natasha the Felid an Terence the Human are finally put to rest. I find and equip a new Vampiric War Axe near an alter to Okawaru. I pick up a book labeled Fen Folio. I feel like I know Dungeon 3 very well.\n\nI find a stall selling food on Dungeon 4. They seem to specialize in meat and jerky. They won't be getting any gold out of me. My new War Axe blends a group of Orcs. I find Menkaure sleeping not far from an alter to the Shining One. I head the other direction finding a +3 ring of Dexterity. I accidentally wake Menkaure, and hide behind a closed door. As he gets close, I banish him to the Abyss, pleasing Lugonu. I find some wands and proceed to Dungeon 4.\n\nThere is a group of Orcish Beough worshippers in a room. I will test my War Axe on them. A wizard quickly brings my health down. I die to a magic dart."}

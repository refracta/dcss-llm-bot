{"title":"Maurice","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Maurice","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Maurice the Thief''' is a [[unique]] [[vine stalker]] thief who is perfectly happy to separate you from your hard-earned loot. He likes nothing more than sneaking up on you while invisible to pick your pockets as he attacks you, dealing damage and taking a random item (or gold) from your inventory. Thankfully, he drops whatever gear he stole upon death, assuming he hasn't used it yet. He generates with a [[cloak]] and [[dagger]] or [[short sword]], some [[gold]], and often a decent [[wand]].\n\nUnlike all other monsters, Maurice can pickup items you've seen or dropped.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|mon-act.cc|2645}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:7-12\n*The [[Orcish Mines]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Being able to [[see invisible]] will give you the chance to blast him on sight instead of letting him start the battle by taking your best attack wand.\n*[[Poison]]ing him will let you continue doing damage over time even when he blinks or teleports away from you.\n*His [[willpower]] and [[hit dice]] are both low, leaving him open to disabling spells like [[Hexes]] or [[Mephitic Cloud]].\n*If you have a [[wand of polymorph]] at hand and use it, he'll probably lose his weapon and his invisibility won't hamper you any longer.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Maurice will have more Will (20 -> 40).}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Maurice was a human and didn't have an antimagic bite. He spawned a bit later, on D:8-13 instead of D:7-12.\n*In [[0.18]], Maurice can now steal from the floor as well as your inventory.\n\n===Maurice Scumming===\nPrior to [[0.10]], uniques who were sent to the Abyss and then followed the player back out would not be removed from the Abyss spawn list: only killing them in the Abyss would do that. This led to an obscure but powerful exploit with Maurice. Let him steal an item, duplicate the monster, and voila, you have two items.\n\nIn [http://crawl.develz.org/morgues/0.9/xomscumming/morgue-xomscumming-20110905-165025.txt this game], the player used this exploit to duplicate scrolls of acquirement. Because Maurice would steal entire stacks of items as opposed to just a single one, the growth in scrolls would be exponential, making it possible to generate up to 300 or so scrolls of acquirement at a time this way (as many as you [[aum|could carry]]).\n\nSince gold contributed to [[score]] in these versions, this exploit could lead to a theoretically infinite amount of points. This was only limited by the hard cap of 99,999,999 points, also present in these versions. In the above game, the death was intentional (like any good mummy, killed by fire), as was the exact score gotten.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

{"title":"Armataur","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Armataur","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|The Armataurs are a large, scaled mammalian species, walking on four feet and swinging a powerful tail behind them. Their elephant-back armies terrorize the lands outside the Dungeon.\n\nArmataurs instinctively roll when moving toward foes, getting a free move and regenerating magic. They have great aptitudes with armour and shields, though their body shape reduces the protection offered by body armour early on. At higher levels they also regenerate both health and magic when rolling, making them truly resilient.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*Armataurs are a hybrid species, with a humanoid torso atop a larger body.\n**'''[[Deformed]]''': Armataurs get only half of their body armour's base [[AC]].\n**Armataurs get an [[EV]] and [[Dodging]] penalty, due to their size.\n**Armataurs cannot wear [[boots]], but may equip [[barding]]s.\n**Armataurs are large enough to attack and move normally while standing in [[shallow water]].\n*'''[[Tough Skin]] 3''': Armataurs are covered in tough skin (AC +3).\n*'''[[Rollpage]] 1''': Armataurs have innate [[rampaging]] - when moving in a straight line towards an enemy, they get a free move.\n**Also, after rampaging, Aramtaurs recover MP more quickly. See below for details.\n*'''[[Armoured Tail]]''': Armataurs have armoured tails that they may use to make especially damaging tail-slap [[auxiliary attack]]s.\n\nArmataurs have a base [[Strength]] of 13, [[Intelligence]] of 8, and [[Dexterity]] of 5 (before [[background]] modifiers).\n\n===Heal on Rampage===\nWhen Armataurs make a rampage move, a \"heal duration\" is increased by 1 turn, to a maximum of 7.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|player.cc|4921}}</ref> \n\nWhile this heal duration lasts, your MP regeneration is increased by <code>(turns_remaining + 1) * 0.33</code> MP/turn.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|player.cc|1297}}</ref>\n\nOnce you reach XL 7, you'll also recover HP faster. Your HP regeneration is increased by <code>(turns_remaining + 1) * 0.65</code> HP/turn.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|player.cc|1202}}</ref>\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Warriors''': [[Fighter]]\n*'''Zealots''': [[Berserker]]\n*'''Warrior-Mages''': [[Warper]]\n*'''Mages''': [[Hedge Wizard]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[strength]], [[intelligence]], or [[dexterity]] (equal chance) every 4th level.\n*10% more [[HP]] than average.\n*+3 [[willpower]] per level.\n*At XL 7, rampaging will recover HP in addition to MP ('''Rollpage 2''').\n\n==Starting Skills and Equipment==\nArmataurs start with the skills and equipment listed for their background.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Beginner}}\n\nArmataurs are a somewhat easy species to play. They have low [[EV]] and slightly below average aptitudes, but have high HP and a neat rampaging bonus. In general, Armataurs are well suited for both melee and magic play. \n\nArmataurs may have reduced AC from Deformed, but their natural skin, [[barding]]s, and aforementioned HP help make up for that. If you are wearing [[scale mail]] or lower, Armataur's Tough Skin bonus cancels out the negatives from Deformed. Even with [[plate armour]], the net AC loss is quite small (only -2 AC compared to regular species).\n\n{{species aptitudes|Armataur}}\n\n==Strategy==\nWatch out for rampaging - if you aren't paying attention, you may move further than intended. For example, you might zip past the [[stairs]] if a monster is in front of it. If you want to get to a specific tile, you might be able to zigzag diagonally to get there.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], Armataurs were reworked. Prior to this version:\n**Armataurs had Long Tongue (doubled potion effects) and Awkward Tongue ([[scroll]]s took 50% longer to read). Note that doubled potion effects had a few special cases: for example, the [[potion of might]] only doubled the duration, not doubled the damage from might. Also, the potion's duration was still capped at 80 turns, so it was often less than \"double\" duration in practice. See [http://crawl.chaosforge.org/index.php?title=Armataur&oldid=76915#Long_Tongue this revision] for details.\n**Armataurs did not recover HP or MP when rampaging.\n**Armataurs had [[Rugged Brown Scales]] 3 (+3 AC, +7% HP) instead of Tough Skin 3.\n*Armataurs were introduced in [[0.30]], replacing the [[Palentonga]] species.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{species}}"}

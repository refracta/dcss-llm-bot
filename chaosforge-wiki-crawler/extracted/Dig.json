{"title":"Dig","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dig","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{Flavour|Digs a tunnel through unworked rock.}}\n'''Dig''' is a monster-only spell which permanently destroys any rock [[wall]]s, as well as other sorts of diggable terrain (slimy walls, iron grates, inanimate statues, etc.), in a straight line from the caster. It cannot affect stone, metal, green crystal, or any other kind of wall. This spell does not harm you in any way, but makes both escape and limiting the number of enemies you face at once difficult. Note that monsters can cast Dig when they are outside the player's [[line of sight]].\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nPlayers may duplicate this spell's effects with a [[wand of digging]].\n\n==History==\n{{Spell\n|name=Dig\n|level=4\n|school1={{Earth Magic}}\n|school2=\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of the Earth]]\n</div>\n|castingnoise=3\n|spellnoise=3\n}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], monsters could use [[wands of digging]] to replicate this spell.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Dig was a level 4 [[Earth Magic]] spell available to the player.

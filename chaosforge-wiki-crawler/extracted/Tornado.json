Those affected will also be swept up into the air and tossed around. Only the eye of the storm is a safe place, and it follows the caster. The spell's effectiveness is greatly diminished in closed areas. After the tornado fades, it cannot be called forth again for a short time.}}\n\n'''Tornado''' is a level 9 [[Air Magic]] spell which creates a vortex of raging wind around you.\n\n==Useful Info==\nTornado creates [[cloud]]s of raging wind, dealing a base of <code>9d(pow/15)</code> physical damage per 1.0 turn. \n\nThe damage is then adjusted by:\n* Percentage of tiles open. In tight spaces, damage is reduced. Damage is multiplied by the ratio, <code>(tiles with wind) / (tiles that could have wind)</code>.\n* \"Duration-radius\" factor. Creatures on the outside of the vortex will receive the most damage.\n\nTornado's radius is equal to <code>sqrt([[aut]]_passed) * 7/5</code>, max. 5 tiles. Creatures and [[cloud]]s caught inside will rotate in a counterclockwise fashion. The \"rotation\" is a square shape, and done at a rate of ~1 full rotation per 6 turns.\n\nWhile casting the spell, the caster and anything caught inside will [[fly]] for a short period of time. Once it ends, there's a grace period of 1 turn until flight ends. Monsters won't make any effort to avoid falling into [[deep water]] or [[lava]].\n\nTornado lasts for 6 turns. It immediately ends if you [[blink]] or [[teleport]], or if you enter another floor. After it ends, it has a cooldown of 3.5 - 4.5 turns.\n\nCreatures with rTornado ([[Sojobo]], [[air elemental]]s) are immune to this spell. Also, those who are currently casting Tornado are immune to hostile Tornadoes.\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile Tornado has worse damage/turn than other level 9 spells, it has great MP efficiency and irresistible damage. For a single, 9 MP cast, you'll get up to 6 turns of damage. Plus, you can cast other spells while the tornado is running. Great in an open area, especially against crowds.\n\nThe downsides (other than damage/turn) mostly stem from the tornado mechanic itself. It is much weaker in a cramped area. For most of the duration, the tornado has a short radius. And, the spell has a lengthy cooldown.\n\nAs a single school spell, Tornado is easier to train than the likes of [[Fire Storm]]. Regardless, as a level 9 spell, it is a significant XP investment (for a 3 rune game). In a 3 rune game, training for a level 9 spell usually means sacrificing on your defenses. But, for a low-range, damage over time spell that excels in open areas, you'll want good defenses. Tornado can still be worth it, but don't rush for it.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*When the radius is 5, the amount of noise is 15. This number is multiplied by the delay of your last action (in [[aut]]s) and divided by 10.\n*Any [[tree]]s within Tornado's range have a chance of being destroyed by the spell.\n*Be careful not to use [[Blink]] while the spell is up unless you specifically want to end its effects.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], Tornado was replaced with [[Polar Vortex]]. Polar Vortex is functionally similar, but is a level 9 [[Ice Magic]] spell which deals 33% more damage and is 40% resistible by cold. rTornado/rVortex was also removed from air elementals and Sojobo.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], rTornado was called wind resistance, and also affected [[Airstrike]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Tornado was a circle (range 6) and rotated circularly.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], Tornado was slightly weaker.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], Tornado had stronger damage, didn't rotate monsters around, and didn't have a cooldown, but had a negative [[spell enhancer]].\n*Tornado was added in [[0.8]]."}

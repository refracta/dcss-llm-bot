{"title":"Dragon's Call","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dragon%27s_Call","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Dragon's Call''' is a level 9 [[Summonings|Summoning]] spell that keeps summoning [[list of dragons|dragon]]s while active.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen cast, you gain the {{White|Dragoncall}} status. As long as it lasts, and if you have enough MP, dragons are summoned adjacent to hostile targets in your [[line of sight]]. Possible summons include, in order of power:\n:{{monsterlink|Fire dragon}}\n:{{monsterlink|Ice dragon}}\n:{{monsterlink|Shadow dragon}}\n:{{monsterlink|Storm dragon}}\n:{{monsterlink|Iron dragon}}\n:{{monsterlink|Quicksilver dragon}}\n:{{monsterlink|Golden dragon}}\nFor worshippers of [[good god]]s, [[shadow dragon]]s are replaced with [[storm dragon]]s or [[iron dragon]]s.\n\nOne dragon is summoned at a time. Time between summons is <code>2 + 1d5 + <number of summons> * 5</code> [[aut]], where 'number of summons' only includes currently living summons from this spell.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-summoning.cc|463}}</ref> Each summon costs 2-3 MP. Upon each summon, a loud noise is increased at the caster's location. These dragons are summoned close to your enemies and don't need to be [[t]]old to attack. If there are no enemies in line of sight, or if the caster lacks the required MP, no dragons are summoned (but the Dragoncall status is retained).\n\nHigher [[spell power]] may increase the duration of the spell (not the summons) and result in stronger dragons.\n\nDragon's Call's duration is <code>14 + 1d15 + <power> / 5</code> turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-summoning.cc|384}}</ref> It's not possible to recast the spell while it's active. After the spell ends, you get the {{Yellow|-Dragoncall}} status for 16 to 26 turns<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|duration-data.h|464}}</ref>, during which you will be unable to recast it.\n\nThe duration of the summons is around 18 turns; it does not depend on spell power.\n\nThere is no hard summon limit.\n\n==Monster Version==\n[[Player ghost]]s with Dragon's Call instead gain [[Summon Dragon]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.20]], for followers of [[TSO]], [[Poisonous Cloud|poison]]-breathing [[golden dragon]]s were replaced with storm or iron dragons.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Dragon's Call would immediately expire if you ran out of MP.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Dragon's Call gained a power boost if you were in [[Dragon Form]].\n*Dragon's Call was introduced in [[0.14]], replacing [[Summon Dragon]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

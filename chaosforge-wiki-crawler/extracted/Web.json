The spider who left it must have been huge, as it seems to be made for trapping [player's species] rather than flies.}}\n\n[[File:Web.png]] A '''web''' is a [[trap]] which ensnares anything which steps onto it as though it were hit by a [[throwing net]]. The victim becomes entangled and cannot move, melee attack, or use [[ranged weapon]]s until they slip out of the web. Webs found on the Dungeon floor will not break after a creature escapes.\n\nCertain creatures are immune to webs:\n*All creatures with the [[:Category:Web immune|Web immune]] flag\n*All [[:Category:Insubstantial monsters|insubstantial]] creatures\n*Players in [[Spider Form]]\n\nWebs can be found in certain rare [[Dungeon]] vaults and [[the Crypt]], but they are mostly found in huge numbers all over the [[Spider's Nest]]. \n\nTemporary webs, which are destroyed after the victim escapes, can be created by [[jumping spider]]s or the [[Ensnare]] spell.\n\n==Strategy==\nWebs can be used against careless enemies, more so than other traps. The natives of the [[Spider's Nest]] are immune to webs, but [[unique]]s and residents of [[the Lair]] aren't. You can [[stab]] enemies that walk into one.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], web immunity was set by categories of monsters instead of with a flag.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], triggering a web trap alerted nearby monsters with the [[web sense]] flag.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], monsters could not be created on traps (including webs). This meant you couldn't [[summon]] monsters on a web tile, or use [[Animate Dead]] on corpses that were in webs.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], giant-sized monsters were immune to webs and would destroy webs as they walked through them.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], webs from [[jumping spider]]s and [[Ensnare]] were permanent. So you could have a jumping spider surround a staircase with webs, allowing you to trap enemies as you [[stair dance]]d.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], all webs were destroyed after a creature escaped from one. Therefore, it was often optimal to break webs as you explored.\n\n[[Category:Traps]]"}

{"title":"Iron giant","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Iron_giant","type":"raw","data":"{{version|022}}\n{{list of|giants}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Iron giants''' are huge, strong, durable humanoids that can deal massive damage with melee attacks, irresistible attack spells, and thrown allies. They are found most often in [[the Iron City of Dis]] and [[Ziggurat]]s, but can occasionally generate in [[the Depths]] or [[The Realm of Zot|Zot]].\n\nThe singular lethality of iron giants is their [[Throw Ally]] ability, which both deals unavoidable damage (1d35) and places dangerous enemies (that might even have been outside your [[LOS]]) immediately adjacent to you.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Unless you are a brawler, you are going to want to take advantage of Iron Shot's relatively short range (4 squares) and kite them with long-ranged attacks (increased movement speed from [[Swiftness]] or [[potion of haste|haste]] can help with this). Even then, they can still use Throw Ally if they're in sight and another creature happens to be next to them.\n*In certain respects, treat iron giants like [[Guardian serpent]]s (who know the [[Blink Allies Encircling]] spell). Always be aware of the monster(s) adjacent to the iron giant, since at any point that monster may become adjacent to you. Keep in mind that, even if the iron giant is seemingly alone, if it's at the very edge of your [[LOS]], the tiles out of your LOS and next to the giant may harbor a monster that it can use as ammunition against you. (The iron giant always selects the ally farthest away from you; thus, if the giant is in a mob at the edge of your LOS, the monster it tosses is ''guaranteed'' to be one you have not seen yet.) \n*Spawn summons to hold the giant's attention while you attack it or are making an escape. Just remember that the giant's thrown ally behaves like a [[penetration|penetrating]] [[Bolt spells|bolt]], moving ''through'' any interposing monsters instead of stopping at the first hit the way an arrow might. So, while your summons will impede the giant's movement and possibly be a target of its Iron Shot, they will provide no cover from its thrown allies.\n*As with all other average-speed threats, if all else fails, just walk towards the nearest staircase and leave. However, since they have the potential to throw fast-moving allies or allies with ranged attacks (say, a [[Hell sentinel]] or ''another'' iron giant), a [[scroll of blinking]] or [[scroll of teleportation|teleport]] might be the safest escape. A [[scroll of fog]] can buy you some time; the iron giant cannot target what it cannot see.\n*This would be a good time to have [[reflection]]. The giant's thrown allies are not reflectable, but Iron Shot is.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.22]], they didn't have [[Harpoon Shot]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], iron giants were somewhat stronger but slower than average. Also they had Throw, an ability to throw the player next to dangerous monsters, instead of [[Throw Ally]].\n*Iron giants were added in [[0.18]], inspired by [[Dungeon Sprint]]'s [[the Iron Giant]]."}

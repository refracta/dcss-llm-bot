{"title":"Dart trap","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dart_trap","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n[[File:Dart trap.png]]\n\nThe [[dart trap]] is the weakest [[trap]] in the game. It holds 3-11 [[dart]]s and fires when stepped upon, poisoning the target.\n\n[[Repel Missiles#Player sources|Repel Missiles]] reduces the chance of this trap being able to hit the player.\n\nMuch like other traps, dart traps cannot be disarmed, but they do have a limited supply of ammunition. They are fairly uncommon, appearing only in the [[Ossuary]] branch and in the [[Tomb]].\n\n==History==\n*Dart traps were removed with all mechanical traps in [[0.27]].\n*In [[0.24]], [[needle]]s were replaced with [[dart]]s, and dart traps were brought back.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], traps could be disarmed by \"attacking\" the trap in place by pressing '''Ctrl-<Direction>'''. This was enhanced by the [[Traps (skill)|Traps]] skill, also removed in [[0.13]].\n*[[Dart]]s and dart traps were removed in [[0.15]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], mechanical traps could spawn randomly through the dungeons.\n\n[[Category:Traps]]"}

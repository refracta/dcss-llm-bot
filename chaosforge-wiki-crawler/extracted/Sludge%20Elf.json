{"title":"Sludge Elf","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sludge_Elf","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|This is a somewhat degenerate species of Elves. They are mirror images of High Elves in some respects: they have no special proficiency with bows or swords (long or short), nor do they have any aptitude in the traditional areas of High Elven magic (charms and conjurations). On the other hand, they are superlative transmuters, and are comfortable dabbling in necromantic, poison and elemental magic. As fighters, they are often more dangerous unarmed than armed. They advance in levels slightly slower than Humans, but faster than all other Elves.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*Sludge Elves get a small bonus when using [[racial equipment|elven]] weapons and armour. For Sludge Elves, elven armour impeded spellcasting less than other armours and improved their effective [[Armour skill]]. They were slightly more accurate with elven weapons.\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Warriors:''' [[Monk]], [[Hunter]], [[Assassin]]\n*'''Zealots:''' [[Healer]]\n*'''Warrior-mages:''' [[Transmuter]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Wizard]], [[Summoner]], [[Necromancer]], [[Fire Elementalist]], [[Ice Elementalist]], [[Air Elementalist]], [[Earth Elementalist]], [[Venom Mage]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[intelligence]] or [[dexterity]] (equal chance) every 4th level.\n*10% less [[HP]] than average.\n*10% more [[MP]] than average.\n*+4 [[magic resistance]] per level.\n\n==Starting Equipment and Skills==\nSludge Elves start with the equipment and skills listed for their background, with the following exceptions:\n*All equipment is \"[[racial equipment|elven]]\" in quality, where such variants exist.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\nSludge Elves are a moderately difficult species to play: they have -10% HP, and their aptitudes favor a few, complicated, styles of play. They are great at Unarmed Combat and Transmutations... but without the HP, strength, or Claws of a [[Troll]], Unarmed is harder to 'get off the ground'.\n\n{{obsolete_species_aptitudes|Sludge Elf}}\n\n==History==\n*Sludge Elves were removed in [[0.13]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete species]]\n[[Category:Elf]]"}

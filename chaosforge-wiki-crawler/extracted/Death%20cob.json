{"title":"Death cob","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Death_cob","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Death cobs''' are hasty undead monsters found throughout [[the Realm of Zot]]. Their fast attacks deal decent damage and quickly drain your [[speed]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Avoid engaging them while near other enemies. You will be promptly slowed for the whole fight. That being said, running is quite difficult.\n**Death cobs are one of the few enemies in Zot who can not [[see invisible]], along with [[list of draconians|draconian]]s and [[ghost moth]]s. Spare [[potions of invisibility]] are useful if you have no other option.\n*Quaffing a [[potion of haste]] or otherwise speeding up will nullify the slow effect for the whole fight. Just be aware of nearby [[quicksilver dragon]]s removing your enchantments while the death cob reapplies its slow.\n*Death cobs have low [[willpower]], which makes them good targets for [[Hexes]].\n**If you have a [[wand of charming]], you can turn death cobs into powerful allies who can slow down even [[orbs of fire]].\n**A [[wand of paralysis]] will reliably shut them down with little evocations training.\n*[[Formicid]]s have permanent stasis, which makes them immune to speed-draining attacks.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.18]], they stopped draining [[satiation]], draining speed again.\n*Death cobs received buffs to HP and attack in [[0.17]]. Their attacks also started draining satiation."}

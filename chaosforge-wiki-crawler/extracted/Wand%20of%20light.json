Only living, demonic, and angelic monsters can be blinded. Tougher monsters will recover their vision more quickly.}}\n\nThe '''wand of light''' fires a powerful, somewhat inaccurate, ray of light which [[blind]]s enemies. It can pierce through monsters like a bolt.\n\nPlayers will deal <code>4d(5.5 + 10.5 * [[Evocations]]/20)</code> untyped damage with this wand.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|zap-data.h|1424}}<br>Specifically, you'll deal <code>4d(13/4 + 3 * pow/20)</code> damage, for pow = <code>15 + 3.5 * Evocations</code> ({{source ref|0.31.0|evoke.cc|189}}). If you have the [[MP-Powered Wands]] mutation, then your \"pow\" gains a +33% boost.</ref> Players have a [[to-hit]] of <code>10.6 + (3.5 * Evocations)/25</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|zap-data.h|1425}}</ref> \n\nMonsters will deal <code>3d(7 + (30 + [[HD]])/12)</code> damage with this wand.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|zap-data.h|1426}}</ref>\n\nWhen the wand damages a valid monster, it has a 100% chance to blind it for <code>54/[[HD]] to 2 * 54/HD</code> turns (min. 1-2 turns).<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|beam.cc|4883}}</ref> [[Nonliving]], [[holiness#Plant|plant]], and [[undead]] holiness monsters cannot be blinded, and a few others are [[:Category:Unblindable|immune]]. If it deals damage to the player, it has a 1/3 chance of [[confuse|confusing]] them for 2-3 turns instead.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|beam.cc|4050}}</ref>\n\nIt is [[alternate items|mutually exclusive]] with the [[wand of acid]] and [[wand of quicksilver]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nWands of light inflict strong, untyped damage and disables monsters for a few turns. When blinded, monsters treat you as [[invisible]] (even with [[see invisible]]), it'll make them less likely to hit or use abilities. Thus, it is valuable as both an offensive and defensive tool.\n\nLight can be especially useful for [[stab]]bers, since it can blind monsters regardless of their HD or willpower. It can't blind [[orbs of fire]], but it can blind [[pandemonium lord]]s and other types of tough opponents.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|players will be blinded instead of confused when damaged by a wand of light.}}\n*Piror to [[0.31]], wands of light could blind [[nonliving]] and [[undead]] monsters.\n*The wand of light was added in [[0.29]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{wands}}"}

The number created depends on spell power.}}\n\n'''Simulacrum''' is a level 6 [[Ice Magic|Ice]]/[[Necromancy]] spell which creates [[Simulacrum (monster)|simulacra]] from a dying monster.\n\n==Useful Info==\nCasting Simulacrum irresistibly grants the '''Simulacrum''' enchantment on a single living, demonic, or holy monster anywhere in [[line of sight]] for <code>20 + 1d(pow/10)</code> turns<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-monench.cc|206}}</ref>. When the monster dies, it will create <code>1 + 1d(pow/40)</code><ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|mon-death.cc|1276}}</ref> (1-6) [[Simulacrum (monster)|simulacra]]. Simulacra last for a finite duration or until you leave the floor they were created on.\n\nThe simulacrum created will have the same [[HD]] as the original monster. They deal 80% their original physical damage, but a great amount of additional ice damage, so the damage output of creatures with multiple attacks is greatly increased. When killed, simulacra leave behind only a short-lived freezing [[cloud]].\n\nSimulacrum takes priority over [[Animate Dead]] and [[Necrotise]]. [[Infestation]] overrides Simulacrum, while [[Death Channel]] works alongside it. Simulacrum does ''not'' work with [[Gozag]] (who turns corpses into gold, first) or [[Yredelemnul]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Simulacra often have extremely large damage output, but are outstandingly frail. Be mindful of [[fire]] attacks, which are capable of wiping out your horde in a few turns.\n**Monsters with multiple attacks/turn are very strong, as their cold damage is amplified. [[Hydra]]s, [[entropy weaver]]s, and [[ettin]]s are all fair game. [[The Lernaean hydra]] as a simulacrum can deal over 1000 damage per turn. Monsters with [[constriction]] ([[list of reptiles and amphibians|snakes]], [[tentacled monstrosities]]) are also good targets, as constriction is kept in undeath.\n**Avoid using this spell on physically deficient mages (like [[wizard]]s or magical [[list of deep elves|deep elves]]), as you'll spend 6 MP to create pathetic simulacrum. [[Animate Dead]] or [[Infestation]] will be more efficient.\n**[[List of jellies|Slimes]] of all flavours tend to be impressive as simulacra. Due to the mass of slimes in the [[Slime Pits]], it's easy to create a big army.\n*Simulacra are immune to cold, which means spells such as [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]] can be cast safely without angering them. [[Polar Vortex]] is off-limits, however, as a portion of its damage bypasses cold resistance.\n\n==Monster Version==\nMonsters have access to [[Bind Souls]], which is a similar effect. They cast it on their own allies (still hostile monsters), it works on every target in sight, but it can only create one simulacra per monster. Bind Souls takes priority over your own Simulacrum spell.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Derived undead]]\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], this spell was replaced with [[Sculpt Simulacrum]].\n*Prior to [[0.30]], this spell would create <code>1 + 1d(pow/20)</code> simulacra per monster.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Simulacrum would create multiple undead from a [[corpse]] you were standing on. The amount depended on the size of the corpse. This also meant that simlacrum of corpseless monsters (including holy and demonic) could not be created.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], simulacra's duration was significantly longer.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the spell would turn all corpses in line of sight into Simulacra. Some monsters were also able to cast the spell.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], you needed to wield a [[chunk]] of meat to cast Simulacrum.\n*Between versions [[0.11]] and [[0.14]], Simulacrum could be cast on wielded carnivorous food items.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

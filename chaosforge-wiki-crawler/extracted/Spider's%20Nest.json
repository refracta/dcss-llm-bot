Adventurers willing to brave it are rewarded with the gossamer [[rune of Zot]] on its lowest floor. \n\nSpider's entrance is located between [[Lair]]:2 and Lair:3. If you find Spider, you will not find [[Snake Pit]] in your current game. \n\n==Layout==\nIn general, Spider's floor plan is chaotic and haphazard. Like [[the Lair]], but cramped, it's filled with narrow tunnels and large caverns. Choke points are uncommon, giving swift monsters many opportunities to surround you. [[Web]]s and pools of [[shallow water]] are common.\n\nDo not underestimate the final vault on Spider:4 â€” not only is it full of more dangerous creatures, but a [[moth of wrath]] can turn a posse of jumping spiders, wolf spiders, and emperor scorpions into a deadly tide of chitin extremely quickly.\n\n===Monster Description===\nThis branch is teeming with 'common' spiders, like [[redback]]s and [[tarantella]]s. Fast, evasive enemies in great numbers, they'll swarm you in no time. Thankfully, these spiders have no resistances, low [[AC]], minimal [[willpower]], and are vulnerable to [[poison]], so many crowd-control options are effective (see below for a list). \n\nYou'll find many tougher threats interspersed throughout the crowd. The likes of [[entropy weaver]]s, [[broodmother]]s, and [[jorogumo]] are strong on their own, and even worse when combined with a pack of spiders. [[Demonic crawler]]s regenerate extremely quickly; you'll need high damage/turn (or a way to disable them). Casters should be especially weary of [[ghost moth]]s, naturally [[invisible]] monsters who'll quickly drain your MP. \n\nThere are also many \"buffing\" enemies, including [[torpor snail]]s ([[slow]] you), [[pharaoh ant]]s (cast [[Bind Souls]] on death, turning killed spiders into [[simulacrum]]), and [[moths of wrath]] ([[berserk]] others, turning even [[redback]]s into powerful melee threats).\n\n==Strategy==\nPoison resistance is very helpful. The common [[redback]] can deal 33 - 58 HP worth of [[poison]] per hit, and each spider can move twice per player turn. If you don't have rPois, be prepared to use many [[potions of curing]].\n\nCrowd-control options that work particularly well against spiders:\n*'''[[Poison]]'''. [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] is brutally effective against spiders, while [[Mephitic Cloud]] can disable most things here. Note that most of the 'tough' threats are only neutral to poison, while [[emperor scorpion]]s, [[ghost moth]]s, and [[pharaoh ant]]s are resistant/immune to it.\n*'''[[Necromancy]]'''. With so many spiders, it's easy to create a swarm of undead on your side. Undead are immune to poison, so they'll perform well in combat. Note that you'll need a way to kill things (such as [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]]) before you can create undead allies.\n*'''[[Evocations]]'''. The [[tin of tremorstones]] and [[condenser vane]] are tailor made for fighting crowds; if you have good [[Evocations]] skill, these work phenomenally. A [[lightning rod]] can be used in a similar fashion. The common spiders all have low willpower, so hex [[wand]]s are good, too. A [[wand of charming]] turns spiders on your side, a [[wand of paralysis]] gives you 1 less thing that's attacking you in melee.\n*'''[[Scrolls of fear]]'''. Fear won't work against spider [[simulacrum]], but it's very likely to scare the living and demonic creatures here.\n*'''[[Invisible|Invisibility]]'''. Almost everything is unable to [[see invisible]]. Even [[ghost moth]]s can't see invisible, giving casters protection against MP drain. Standing inside a [[sun moth]]s' halo will reveal you if invisible, however.\n\n===Useful Traits===\n*Strong [[AC|physical defenses]]\n*[[Poison resistance]]\n\nOptional:\n*[[Corrosion resistance]] for [[entropy weaver]]s\n*[[Cold resistance]], useful for fighting [[pharaoh ant]]-created [[simulacrum (monster)|simulacra]]\n*[[Negative energy resistance]], to reduce damage from [[Jorogumo]]s' [[Bolt of Draining]]\n*[[Electricity resistance]], to make [[spark wasp]]s less deadly\n\n==Monsters==\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n|{{monsterlink|Redback}} || {{monsterlink|Tarantella}} || {{monsterlink|Jumping spider}} || {{monsterlink|Culicivora}} || {{monsterlink|Boulder beetle}}\n|-\n|{{monsterlink|Orb spider}} || {{monsterlink|Wolf spider}} || {{monsterlink|Demonic crawler}} || {{monsterlink|Steelbarb worm}} || {{monsterlink|Torpor snail}} \n|-\n|{{monsterlink|Pharaoh ant}} || {{monsterlink|Entropy weaver}} || {{monsterlink|Radroach}} || {{monsterlink|Moth of wrath}} || {{monsterlink|Ghost moth}}\n|-\n|{{monsterlink|Emperor scorpion}} ||  {{monsterlink|Broodmother}} || {{monsterlink|Jorogumo}} || {{monsterlink|Spark wasp}} || {{monsterlink|Meliai}}\n|-\n|{{monsterlink|Sun moth}} || {{monsterlink|Death scarab}}\n|}\n\n===Uniques===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Agnes}}\n| {{monsterlink|Aizul}}\n| {{monsterlink|Arachne}}\n| {{monsterlink|Asterion}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Azrael}}\n| {{monsterlink|Bai Suzhen}}\n| {{monsterlink|Donald}}\n| {{monsterlink|Frances}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Jorgrun}}\n| {{monsterlink|Josephine}}\n| {{monsterlink|Kirke}}\n| {{monsterlink|Louise}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Mara}}\n| {{monsterlink|Nikola}}\n| {{monsterlink|Roxanne}}\n| {{monsterlink|Rupert}}\n|}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], the Spider's Nest overwent an overhaul; changing existing inhabitants while adding many new ones ([[Culicivora]], [[pharaoh ant]]s, [[steelbarb worm]]s, [[radroach]]es, [[jorogumo]], [[broodmother]]s). The branch was also made normal noise again (instead of quiet).\n*In [[0.26]] [[boulder beetle]]s came back as rare inhabitants.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], [[boulder beetle]]s and [[wasp]]s inhabited the Spider's Nest.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Spider's Nest was 5 floors long. [[Goliath beetle]]s, [[boring beetle]]s and [[giant mite]]s were removed, while [[entropy weaver]]s and [[torpor snail]]s were added.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], the Spider's Nest was a simple 1-floor sub-branch with similar monsters and some treasure (occasionally including ambrosia), but no rune.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Branches]]\n\n{{branches}}"}

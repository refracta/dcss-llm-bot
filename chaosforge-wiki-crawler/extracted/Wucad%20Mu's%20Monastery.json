{"title":"Wucad Mu's Monastery","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wucad_Mu%27s_Monastery","type":"raw","data":"{{version018}}\n{{flavour|Though a thousand feet may have trod these floors, they appear solid and indestructible.}}\n\n'''Wucad Mu's Monastery''' is a quiet, seemingly empty place locked in perpetual autumn. It is filled with shadowy figures which take on the form of various monks that once trained and meditated there, as well as the immortal crystal semblance of Wucad Mu himself.\n\nUnlike most [[Wizlab]]s, there are very few actual monsters to fight in the monastery. The only combat you will see prior to the final chamber is when the shadows coalesce into hostile monks. These count as summoned creatures, and can be [[Abjuration|abjured]] with ease. An [[amulet of warding]], [[macabre finger necklace]], or [[staff of summoning]] will also help protect you from them, as they only ever attack in melee. If you lack any other means to deal with the monks, simply run away from them until they despawn; they are dangerous melee combatants, more will always appear to take their place, and there are zero benefits to defeating them.\n\nAs you explore the silent hallways, shadowy apparitions will occasionally recreate scenes from ages past. Each of these numbered flavour messages takes place in the areas marked on the map, unless you defeat the statue before reaching said spots:\n{{flavour|1. Strange, shadowy figures dance through the air in front of you.<br>\n2. This room is filled with shadowy figures, quietly meditating.<br>\n3. Here, spectral monks perform complicated, martial routines; they fade quickly.<br>\n4. Faint laughter comes from somewhere. Too faint to be real.<br>\n5. Grey monks gather around the fountain. They do not speak, nor look at each other.<br>\n6. There is a faint scream of pain from a crouched figure. This too fades quickly.<br>\n7. A figure sits in silent meditation. It spots you, gestures wildly, and disappears.}}\n\nThe central hall of the monastery contains an [[orange crystal statue]] depicting Wucad Mu himself. It is more dangerous than the average orange crystal statue, although it has lower hitpoints. Destroying the statue also destroys the shadows inhabiting the place, including any monks that are attacking you. ''(The shadows inhabiting this place fade forever.)''\n\nWhat little treasure is present is guarded by the statue and stored in a nearby room. What the treasure lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality; a [[potion of experience]], [[potion of beneficial mutation]], [[Book of Enchantments]], and a [[manual]] (33% chance of [[Fighting]], 16.67% of [[Armour]], [[Spellcasting]], [[Staves]], or [[Dodging]]). Under the statue itself is the [[staff of Wucad Mu]].\n\n==Monsters==\n{{flavour|A flimsy representation of a monk; little more than a half-formed memory, yet still ready to fight.}}\n[[File:Deep troll monk ghost.png]] [[File:Demonspawn monk.png]] [[File:Draconian monk ghost.png]] '''Shadowy monks''' will occasionally form themselves out of the shadows in the monastery. Though only as strong as their base monsters ([[deep troll]]s, [[monstrous demonspawn]]s, and [[draconian monk|grey draconian monk]]s) and possessing only melee capabilities, these are opponents normally only found in [[the Depths]], [[the Realm of Zot]], and [[Pandemonium]], and they have significant strength and health. It is recommended to flee and time-out their summon duration, at most using [[Abjuration]] or fighting in the few chokepoints as absolutely necessary.\n\nSaid shadows are summoned every 150 to 300 [[aut]]: it is imperative to avoid getting hurt much during your visit and rush towards Wucad Mu, as there is little chance for rest otherwise.\n\n===Boss: Statue of Wucad Mu===\n{{flavour|This statue, made from a fine glassy orange crystal, depicts a mystic known as Wucad Mu, who mastered the matters of the mind. Beware of the statue's powers, as you have no chance in mental combat against it.}}\n\n[[File:Wucad mu statue.png]] Source of the shadows inhabiting the place, the '''Statue of Wucad Mu''' guards the central room of the monastery. It has half the [[HP]] of an ordinary [[orange crystal statue]], but another normal statue blocks your line-of-fire, delaying your attack. Unlike normal orange crystal statues, it also has the ability to cast [[Shadow Creatures]] and summon up to the cap of 4 of the following random monster list: (27.78% chance each) [[monstrous demonspawn]], [[deep troll]]s, (16.67% each) [[draconian monk|grey draconian monks]], [[shadow]]s, (5.56% each) [[hungry ghost]]s, and [[flayed ghost]]s.\n\nThe statue will be spamming [[Divinations]] [[miscast effect|miscasts]] at you ([[confusion]], [[MP]] drain, and intelligence drain),  while continuing to summon. You can partially protect yourself with an [[amulet of clarity]] and a [[ring of sustain abilities]] and try nailing it with powerful non-elemental spells like [[Orb of Destruction]], [[Iron Shot]], or [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]]; even with the MP drain, the slow regeneration of [[Artificial|artificial-holiness]] monsters allows hit-and-run tactics. [[Aura of Abjuration]] is particularly useful here, as you'll be unmaking its summons as fast as it creates them, and without wasting time. Melee-oriented characters without any of these options can buff themselves as much as possible, then rush or blink in with the heaviest weapon they have. If you're not confident you can smash the statue without being overcome by summons and confusion, you may wish to skip the level.\n\nOnce you've gotten rid of the statue, you're completely safe for the remainder of your stay in the monastery.\n<pre>\nMAP\ntttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt\ntttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt\nttttttttttttttTTTTTTTttttttttttttttttttt\nttttttTTTTTTTT.......TTTTTTTTTTTTttttttt\ntttttT.........ccccc.............Ttttttt\nttttT.........cc777cc.............Tttttt\ntttT.......cccc77777cccc...........Ttttt\nttT.......cc..cc777cc..cc......ccc..Tttt\nttT......cc....cc+cc....cc....cc6cc..Ttt\nttT.....Tc....G.....G....cT..cc6U6cc.Ttt\nttT.....cc...............cc...cc6cc..Ttt\nttT......+.G.....8.....G.c.....c+c...Ttt\nttT.....cc...............cc..........Ttt\nttT.....Tc....G.....G....cT..........Ttt\nttT.c..cTcc.............cccT.........Ttt\nttTcc++ccccccc.......ccccccc+cc......Ttt\nttcc5555cccdeccc+++cccfgccc444cc.....Ttt\nttc555555c....c.....c....c44444c....Tttt\nttc555555cc.............cc44444cc..ctttt\nttc555555ccccccccccccccccccc+cccc++ccttt\nttcc5555ccc.............ccc222cc3333cctt\ntttccccccc...............+22222+33333ctt\nttttttttccc..ccc+++ccc..ccc222cc3333cctt\ntttttttttcccccTT111Ttccccccccccccccccttt\nttttttttttttttT11111Tttttttttttttttttttt\ntttttttttttT.........TTTTTTttttttttttttt\ntttccccctttT.....G........Ttcccccttttttt\nttcc...cctT..............Ttcc...cctttttt\nttc..A..'..................'..<..ctttttt\nttcc...cctT.....TTTT.....Ttcc...cctttttt\ntttccccctttT...TTttTT....Tttcccccttttttt\nttttttttttttTTTTttttTTTTTttttttttttttttt\ntttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt\ntttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt\nENDMAP\n</pre>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Human monk.png]] [[File:Iron troll monk ghost.png]]\n\n*Prior to [[0.14]], [[human (monster)|human]] and [[iron troll]] monks were used instead of monstrous demonspawn and grey draconians, making the monks much less dangerous and significantly slower. Also, shadows arrived somewhat less often (150 - 400 auts), and the statue of Wucad Mu did not know [[Shadow Creatures]].\n*Prior to [[0.12|0.12-ea06430c]], [[rock troll]] monks were used instead of deep trolls.\n*In [[0.15|0.15-6e04a135]], orange crystal statues will be immune to disintegration, making Wucad Mu's threat levels consistently high.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Branches]]"}

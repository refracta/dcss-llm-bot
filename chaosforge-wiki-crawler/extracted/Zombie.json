The zombie, they say, is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but taken from the grave and endowed by sorcery with a mechanical semblance of life-it is a dead body with is made to walk and act and move as if it was alive. People who have the power to do this go to a fresh grave, dig up the body before it has had time to rot, galvanize it into movement, and then make of it a servant or slave, occasionally for the commission of some crime, more often simply as a drudge around the habitation or the farm, setting it dull heavy tasks, and beating it like a dumb beast if it slackens.\"<br>\n-William Seabrook, _The Magic Island_. 1929.}}\n\n'''Zombies''' are the reanimated corpses of once-living creatures. As a type of [[derived undead]], their stats are based on what the monster had in life.\n\n==Useful Info==\nZombies are slower, stupider, and clumsier than their alive counterparts. However, they have good durability for a derived undead. Zombies of certain monsters may be more durable than their non-undead selves.\n\n*'''HP:''' (HD)d5 + 6*HD\n*'''AC:''' Original - 2\n*'''EV:''' Original - 5\n*'''Speed:''' Original - 2 (at least 3)\n*'''Melee attacks:''' 80% of original\n*'''Attack flavour:''' None\n*'''Special:''' Does not regenerate, cannot traverse stairs\n\nZombies are immune to poison, negative energy, torment, and resistant to cold damage. Like all undead, they are vulnerable to [[holy]].\n\nZombies may be created by [[Animate Dead]] spell, [[Yredelemnul]]'s passive reaping, and the [[unrand]] [[Sword of Zonguldrok]]. Hostile zombies may be found [[the Crypt]] and in various [[vault]]s.\n\n==Strategy==\nAs servants, zombies are great meatshields. Despite being weaker than the base monster, a mass of zombies can be quite effective. Most monsters are glass cannons (relative to the player), so 80% damage is still significant.\n\nEven the weakest zombies can be used as retreat fodder. Keep these zombies behind you, and when things go poorly, go behind the zombies. The fodder will block shots and allow you to escape from [[attacks of opportunity]]. You can also attack behind zombies with [[Polearms]] or [[smite-targeted]] attacks.\n\nYour zombies will crumble when you leave the current floor.\n\n==Identifying Zombies==\nAlthough zombie versions of each monster will have different stats, ''Crawl'' tends to lump them together, making identification at a glance difficult. In console mode, zombies will be separated into '''z'''s and '''Z'''s, representing large or small zombies. Tiles mode is more specific, providing unique tiles for several categories of monster, but there is still a lot of possible variation within those categories. In either mode, you can always press '''x''' and highlight the zombie in question to determine exactly what type of monster you are dealing with.\n\nBelow are all the categories of zombies in tiles mode:\n\n[[Image:Zombie adder.png]] [[Adder]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie bear.png]] [[List of bears|Bears]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie bee.png]] [[Killer bee|Bees]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie bird.png]] [[List of birds|Birds]]\n\n[[Image:Bat zombie.png]] [[Bat]]s\n\n[[Image:Beetle zombie.png]] [[List of arthropods|Beetles]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie hound.png]] [[List of canines|Canines]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie centaur.png]] [[Centaur (monster)|Centaurs]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie crab.png]] [[List of arthropods#Crabs|Crabs]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie draconian.png]] [[List of draconians|Draconians]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie drake.png]] [[List of dragons#Drakes|Drakes]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie dragon.png]] [[List of dragons|Dragons]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie quicksilver dragon.png]] [[Quicksilver dragon]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie iron dragon.png]] [[Iron dragon]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie gold dragon.png]] [[Gold dragon]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie elephant.png]] [[Elephant]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie elf.png]] [[List of deep elves|Elves]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie eye.png]] [[List of eyeballs|Eyeballs]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie faun.png]] [[List of centaurs#Satyrs|Fauns]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie frog.png]] [[List of reptiles and amphibians#Amphibian Types|Frogs]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie cockroach.png]] [[Giant cockroach]]es\n\n[[Image:Zombie gnoll.png]] [[List of gnolls|Gnolls]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie goblin.png]] [[Goblin]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie guardian serpent.png]] [[Guardian serpent]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie harpy.png]] [[Harpy|Harpies]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie hobgoblin.png]] [[Hobgoblin]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie hornet.png]] [[Hornet]]s/[[Spark wasp|Wasps]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie horror.png]] Horrors\n\n[[Image:Zombie howler monkey.png]] [[Howler monkey]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie human.png]] [[Human (monster)|Humans]]\n\n[[Image:Small zombie.png]] Humanoids (small)\n\n[[Image:Large zombie.png]] Humanoids (large)\n\n[[Image:Zombie hydra 1.png]] [[Image:Zombie hydra 2.png]] [[Image:Zombie hydra 3.png]] [[Image:Zombie hydra 4.png]] [[Image:Zombie hydra 5.png]] [[Hydra]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie bug.png]] [[List of arthropods|Insects]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie jackal.png]] [[Jackal]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie jelly.png]] [[List of jellies|Jellies]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie juggernaut.png]] [[Juggernaut]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie kobld.png]] [[List of kobolds|Kobolds]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie kraken head.png]] [[Kraken]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie lernaean 1.png]] [[Image:Zombie lernaean 2.png]] [[Image:Zombie lernaean 3.png]] [[Image:Zombie lernaean 4.png]] [[Image:Zombie lernaean 5.png]] [[Image:Zombie lernaean 6.png]] [[Image:Zombie lernaean 7.png]] [[Image:Zombie lernaean 8.png]] [[Image:Zombie lernaean 9.png]] [[Image:Zombie lernaean 10.png]] [[The Lernaean hydra]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie lindwurm.png]] [[Lindwurm]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie lizard.png]] [[List of reptiles and amphibians|Lizards]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie meliai.png]] [[Meliai]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie merfolk.png]] [[List of merfolk|Merfolk]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie minotaur.png]] [[Minotaur]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie naga.png]] [[List of nagas|Nagas]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie octopode.png]] [[Octopode (monster)|Octopodes]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie ogre.png]] [[List of ogres|Ogres]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie orc.png]] [[List of orcs|Orcs]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie small quadruped.png]] Quadrupeds (small)\n\n[[Image:Zombie large quadruped.png]] Quadrupeds (large)\n\n[[Image:Zombie winged quadruped.png]] Quadrupeds (winged)\n\n[[Image:Zombie quokka.png]] [[Quokka]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie rat.png]] [[List of rats|Rats]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie salamander.png]] [[List of nagas#Salamander Types|Salamanders]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie scorpion.png]] [[Scorpion]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie snake.png]] [[List of snakes|Snakes]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie spider small.png]] [[List of arachnids|Spiders]] (small)\n\n[[Image:Zombie spider.png]] Spiders (large)\n\n[[Image:Zombie spriggan.png]] [[List of spriggans|Spriggans]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie troll.png]] [[List of trolls|Trolls]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie turtle.png]] [[List of reptiles and amphibians#Turtle Types|Turtles]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie ugly thing.png]] [[Ugly thing]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie worm.png]] [[List of worms|Worms]]\n\n[[Image:Zombie wyvern.png]] [[Wyvern]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie yak.png]] [[Yak]]s\n\n[[Image:Zombie yaktaur.png]] [[List of centaurs#Yaktaurs|Yaktaurs]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], zombies required a [[corpse]] item to be raised by [[Animate Dead]], which implicitly forbid monsters like [[List of jellies|Slimes]] from being zombies.

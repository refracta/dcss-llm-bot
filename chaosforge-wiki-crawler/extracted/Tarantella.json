{"title":"Tarantella","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tarantella","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Tarantellas''' are non-[[poison]]ous spiders that inflict [[confusion]] with their touch. They are thankfully fairly fragile, but often appear along with other spiders. They can be found in the [[Spider's Nest]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Poison resistance]], poison immunity, and [[willpower]] do nothing to stop their confusion effect. Other than not getting hit, only [[clarity]] can prevent the confusion.\n*A [[potion of curing]] will cure confusion. [[Elyvilon]]'s Purification and [[Ru]]'s Draw Out Power can also cure it.\n*They're vulnerable to poison themselves, so [[Mephitic Cloud]] can take them out of commission easily.\n*Tarantellas might be fragile, but they're fast and they hit about as hard as [[yak]]s, even without the added confusion. Be careful if you're fighting lots of [[list of arachnids|spiders]] at once.\n\n==Trivia==\nNote that these monsters aren't named \"tarantulas\"; instead, they are named after [[wikipedia:tarantella|tarantella]]s, a type of Italian folk dance.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.17]], chunks from tarantella [[corpse]]s were poisonous.\n\n[[Category:Arachnid]]"}

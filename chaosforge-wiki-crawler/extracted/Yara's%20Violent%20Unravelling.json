It also dismisses [[summon]]s.\n\n==Useful Info==\nYara's is a [[smite-targeted]] spell, able to target any creature in line of sight. All cancellable effects on a target are dispelled. If the target is a [[summon]] and not [[durable summon|durable]], then it is instantly dismissed, regardless of its current duration.\n\nIf a status was dispelled (or summon dismissed), it creates a 3x3 explosion centered on the target. This explosion deals <code>3d(3 + power / 6)</code> damage<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|zap-data.h|1440}}</ref> and causes the [[malmutate]] status to any enemy caught in it. Damage does not scale with number of statuses dispelled.\n\nFor a full list of cancellable effects, see the [[list of dispellable effects]] page. Note that some permanent effects can be dispelled by Yara's, but some are truly permanent and can't be dispelled. For example, the haste and might enchantments of monsters that spawn from [[aspiring flesh]] can be dispelled. On the other hand, buffs given to monsters by [[Gozag]]'s wrath can't be dispelled by any means.\n\n==Strategy==\nYara's Violent Unravelling has two main purposes:\n\n#To get rid of buffs. Monsters become a lot less threatening when they're no longer [[haste]]d. Yara's can get rid of a large number of statuses, including monster-only spells like [[Bind Souls]], [[Repel Missiles]], and [[Word of Recall]]. Enemies will often waste turns recasting their buffs, giving yourself another combat advantage.\n#To get rid of summons. Not only do you get rid of the summon, but you can also damage and malmutate the summoner.\n\nAlso, this spell inflicts [[malmutate]], a potent status. In addition to lowering [[AC]], it lowers [[HD]] and [[willpower]], making foes easier to disable with other Hexes.\n\nEven if you don't use Yara's all the time, it can be great to have against enemies that buff themselves or summon enemies. Generally worth the spell levels.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*There are many ways to hit monsters with a unravelling, even if they don't have buffs/summons of their own:\n**Hexers can use enchantments, like [[Slow]], [[Inner Flame]], or [[Dazzling Flash]]. Evocations experts can use a [[wand of paralysis]] or [[wand of light|light]]. Other dispellable spells include the likes of [[Mephitic Cloud]], [[Petrify]], and [[Teleport Other]].\n**[[Curare]] darts can be used on any enemy not resistant to poison, regardless of HD or willpower.\n**Your own [[summon]]s can be unravelled. If at low HP, they might as well go in a blaze of glory (and mutagenic radiation). Note that the [[good god]]s forbid this kind of betrayal. Also, don't stand next to an unravelled summon!\n:Note that Yara's isn't an especially damaging spell. If you want pure damage, virtually any [[Conjurations]] spell will be better. However, the malmutate status can be very useful, lowering [[AC]] and making enemies easier to hex.\n*In a pinch, casting Yara's Violent Unravelling on yourself can work as a poor man's [[potion of cancellation]]. However, this makes a lot of noise, inflicts heavy irresistible damage, and [[malmutate]]s you, so this is best reserved for true emergencies.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Yara's Violent Unravelling was not smite-targeted and could not affect summons.\n*In [[0.27]], more monster enchantments were made dispellable.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], this spell was not considered destructive by [[Vehumet]].\n*This spell was introduced in [[0.18]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

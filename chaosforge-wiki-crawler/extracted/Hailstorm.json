{"title":"Hailstorm","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hailstorm","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n{{AttackSpell\n|name=Hailstorm\n|formula = 3d(3.33+Power/6)\n|maxdmg = 3d20\n|maxsp = 100\n|range = 2-3\n|target = Area\n|tohit = 9 + Power/10}}\n\n'''Hailstorm''' is a Level 3 [[Conjurations]]/[[Ice Magic]] spell that drops hail on all tiles that are 2-3 spaces away from the caster (marked with 'x'):\n\n .........\n .xxxxxxx.\n .xxxxxxx.\n .xx...xx.\n .xx.@.xx.\n .xx...xx.\n .xxxxxxx.\n .xxxxxxx.\n .........\n\nHailstorm deals 50% [[cold]] damage. 50% of the damage is physical, which makes it usable against creatures with cold immunity (like [[ice beast]]s or [[simulacra]]).\n\n[[Reaver]]s start with this spell in their libraries.\n\n==Strategy==\nHailstorm deals decent damage. While it's most useful against groups, it can deal respectable damage against single targets, too. \n\nBut the range of 2-3 is awkward, to say the least. Spells like [[Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot]], [[Gell's Gravitas]], and [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]], or abilities like [[Fedhas]]' Wall of Briars, can keep targets right in your line of fire. [[Summon]]s can be used to a similar effect, as long as you don't hit the summon. Characters with fast movement (namely [[Spriggan]]s) can [[kite]] with this spell.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n* Good synergy with [[Frozen Ramparts]] and [[Ozocubu's Armour]]. Before enemies can enter Hailstorm's range, you can cast those spells. When enemies do get into range, you'll deal extra damage and have more AC.\n* Standing near the edge of a corridor can allow you to take advantage of this configuration:\n .xxxxx.\n .xxxxx.\n ..#m#..\n ..#@#..\n ..#.#..\n:Only one monster (if that) can engage you in melee at a time, but you can hit multiple enemies at a time.\n*If the opportunity presents itself, allowing weaker enemies to stand next to you will force stronger ones to stand helplessly 2-3 tiles away. Be warned; strong pack creatures or intelligent monsters can generally force their way to the front, so this tactic may not always work.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Hailstorm was a level 4 spell. It did not have a chance to miss. Also, it was 45% resistible.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Hailstorm didn't affect creatures made entirely out of ice - [[ice beast]]s, [[ice statue]]s, and [[simulacra]].\n*Hailstorm was added in [[0.25]], replacing [[Throw Icicle]] in player spell lists."}

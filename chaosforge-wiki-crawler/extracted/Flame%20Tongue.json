At low [[spell power]] it only has a range of 2 (although [[Fire Elementalist]]s will start with sufficient power for it to be range 3), but its range rises to 5 as you improve your skill.  It has a higher to-hit chance than the level 2 spell [[Throw Flame]], and comparable damage until high spellpower.\n\nIts maximum spellpower is 25 for damage and accuracy, and 40 for range.\n\n[[Fire Elementalist]]s start with this spell memorized.\n\n{{AttackSpell\n|name=Flame Tongue\n|formula = 1d(8+(power/4))\n|maxdmg = 1d14\n|maxsp = 40\n|range = 2-5\n|target = Beam\n|tohit = 11+Power/6\n|<!-- power_cap = 25\n|hit_type = normal\n|hit_adder = 11\n|hit_num = 1\n|hit_denom = 6\n|dam_calculator = dicedef\n|dam_numdice = 1\n|dam_adder = 8\n|dam_num = 1\n|dam_denom = 4 --> }}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.25]], Flame Tongue was removed in favor of the new [[Foxfire]] spell.\n*In [[0.10]] the range of Flame Tongue was increased from 1-4 to 2-5."}

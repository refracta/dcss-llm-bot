{"title":"Pig Form","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Pig_Form","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{flavour|You have been transformed into a pig. You move quickly but are less effective in melee.\n\nAny equipped weapons, armour and rings are melded, and you are unable to cast spells. The effectiveness of your melee attacks while in this form is based on experience level instead of on Unarmed Combat skill.}}\n\n'''Pig Form''' is a [[bad form]] that can be inflicted by various means: the [[unique]] monster [[Kirke]]'s [[Porkalator]] spell, by being [[polymorph]]ed (whether through the spell, a [[Killer Klown]], or with the [[wand of polymorph|wand]]), or by drawing the Swine card via [[Nemelex Xobeh]]'s wrath. Becoming a [[hog]] melds almost all equipment, suppresses [[mutation]]s, and prevents spellcasting. Even characters with significant training in [[unarmed combat]] will find themselves incapable of fighting competently. The one advantage given by Pig Form is an increase to your character's base speed and evasion, improving your odds of fleeing to safety.\n\n==Pros==\n*[[Fast]] 2 ([[movement]] delay 0.7)\n*Small size (good evasion)\n\n==Cons==\n*Sets base [[AC]] to 0\n*All equipment is melded except for [[amulet]]s\n*Can't cast spells\n*[[Unarmed Combat]] base damage is reduced to <code>1 + UC/5</code>\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

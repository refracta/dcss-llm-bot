Players first enter in an enclosed, threatless chamber that contains a transporter that leads to a ring of broken, Abyss-like terrain patrolled by a few Abyssal monsters. Note that while this terrain may resemble the Abyss, it is static and will not shift over time. This ring surrounds an enclosed central chamber that contains the majority of the level's loot, and is surrounded in turn by a ring of eight outer chambers. Both the outer and inner chambers have sections of transparent stone walls that allow players to see the monsters and items within them.\n\nThe majority of travel in the Roulette of Golubria is done via transporter; one outer chamber will have a door granting access, but the rest can only be reached by using transporters. There are three sets of transporters, shown here in their default position as they correspond to the map’s chambers (inside grid teleport locations from transporters on outside ring, and with 9 having 7 / 3 outward transporters):\n<pre>\n 2 8 4 9\n6\\  |  /5\n  8 1 2 \n1       1\n -7 9 3-\n5       6\n  6 5 4\n9/  |  \\2\n 4 8 3 7\n</pre>\n147 make one set, 258 another, and 369 the third. Sets 147 and 258 are randomly rotated clockwise (thus producing potential arrangements 714 or 471 plus 825 or 582). Before these set rotations, every clockwise / counter-clockwise transporter goes to the transporter 3 plus from the base or 2 minus from the base (so, 1 links to 8 and 4, 2 to 7 and 5, etc), though which of these goes in which direction has a 50% chance to be flipped per set (and the ninth chamber places its transporters completely randomly). On top of this, the map can be mirrored or rotated before it is placed (though with its rotational symmetry and starting placement, this is still derivable). An example result (with the base rotated 90 degrees clockwise, the 147 set rotated clockwise once, the 258 set rotated clockwise twice, and the 258 set flipping the outward transporter rotation correspondence) along with what it would look like outside of said knowledge:\n<pre>\n 4 2 7 5        1 2 3 4\n9\\  |  /9      9\\  |  /9\n  6 4 2          8 1 2  \n6       5      8       4\n-8 9 7-        -7 9 3- \n2       1      2       6\n  1 3 5          6 5 4  \n8/  |  \\3      7/  |  \\5\n 4 1 6 8        1 6 8 7 \n</pre>\nDespite such complicated rules, all chambers are still reachable from all other chambers, so brute-force experimentation will eventually allow one to fully explore the laboratory. Such knowledge is unnecessary short of optimizing vault exploration.\n\nWalls randomly consist of [[Wall|metal, stone, crystal, or rock,]] with selective translucent stone windows and random tiles of [[deep water]]. The central chamber contains a section of iron grates surrounding an [[altar]] to [[Lugonu]], as well as [[teleport trap|teleport]] or [[dispersal trap]]s that spew [[cloud]]s of translocational energy. Exits are placed in the central chamber, one random outer chamber, and the entry chamber. No rock walls are used in the borders of individual chambers, but use of [[Shatter]] or [[Fedhas]]'s Overgrow ability can be used to bypass the transporter chain sequence.\n\n==Monsters==\nUnlike most wizlabs, this map uses a very wide range of monsters. Each chamber has a group consisting of members from several sets: one abyss-like native (the list under 4 and 5), one monster directly linked to translocation (1), and a vaguely-themed casting monster with a minor chance of carrying a weapon of [[distortion]] (3) or else [[boomerang]]s of [[dispersal (brand)|dispersal]] (2). The last of these can be randomly replaced with a version of the monster equipped with an explicit chance of distortion, or (at least once) a much higher-tier Abyss-themed or Abyss-dwelling threat (6).\n\n(Of minor note is that the random monster list also contains a spread of such monsters, for use by both [[boggart]]s and [[shadow demon]]s within the vault.)\n\nMonster set definitions (refer to the map below):\n*'''''1'' (Translocation monsters):''' [[Spatial vortex]] (31.82%), [[blink frog]] (45.55%), or nothing (22.73%). There are sixteen of these, with two per outer chamber.\n*'''''2'' (Unarmed spellcasting monsters):''' [[Boggart]] (33.33%), [[Wizard (monster)|wizard]] (33.33%), [[deep elf knight]] (16.67%), or [[rakshasa]] (16.67%). Each comes without a weapon, but has a 57.14% chance to carry [[boomerang]]s of [[dispersal (brand)|dispersal]], 14.29% chance for ordinary boomerangs, and a 28.57% chance for nothing extra. There are three 75% chances to place them within the outer chambers.\n*'''''3'' (Armed spellcasting monsters):''' Wizard (50%), rakshasa (25%), or boggart (25%). Each is armed with a [[whip]], [[spear]], or [[dagger]]; their weapons have a 62.5% chance of a [[distortion]] brand; otherwise, they will have a [[vorpal]] brand. They also are guaranteed to carry boomerangs of dispersal. There are two 20% chances and three 8.33% chances to place one of these better-equipped monsters in the outer chambers.\n*'''''0'' and ''4'' (lesser Abyss-dwellers A):''' Can be (13.64% chance each) [[thrashing horror]], [[skeleton]], [[worldbinder]]; (11.36% each ) [[lesser demon]]; (6.82% each) [[large abomination]], [[small abomination]]; (4.54% each) [[hellwing]], [[orange demon]], [[ice devil]], [[hell hound]]; (2.27% chance each) [[unseen horror]], [[freezing wraith]], [[chaos spawn]], [[red devil]], [[mana viper]], [[fire elemental]], or [[air elemental]]. Ten of these place in the map, one each for six of the outer chambers and four of the eight evenly-spaced monsters in the initial Abyss-like ring.\n*'''''5'' and ''9'' (lesser Abyss-dwellers B):''' (13.95% Chance) [[tentacled starspawn]], (9.30%) [[ancient zyme]], (4.65%) [[ynoxinul]], [[smoke demon]], [[sixfirhy]], [[demonic crawler]], [[raiju]], [[lurking horror]], [[water elemental]], [[ugly thing]], [[List_of_draconians|any base draconian]], [[guardian serpent]], [[shadow wraith]], [[glowing orange brain]], (2.33%) [[sun demon]], [[efreet]], [[soul eater]], [[hell knight]], [[earth elemental]], [[eidolon]], [[anaconda]] skeleton, [[great orb of eyes]]. Four are guaranteed to place in the initial entry ring, plus two in the outer chambers. After that, there are two 40% chances and three 16.67% chances to place more in random outer chambers.\n*'''''6'' (greater Abyss-dwellers):''' Can be a (16.67% chance) [[starcursed mass]], (11.11% chance each) [[tentacled monstrosity]], [[draconian shifter]], [[apocalypse crab]], (5.56% chance each) [[cacodemon]], [[shadow demon]], [[blizzard demon]], [[reaper]], [[angel]], (2.78% chance each) [[executioner]], [[balrug]], [[hellion]], [[tormentor]], [[lorocyproca]], [[lich]], [[profane servitor]], or [[death drake]]. One is guaranteed to be in one of the outer chambers, and there are two 40% chances to place another in random outer chambers.\n\n===Central chamber===\nThe central chamber contains an [[obsidian statue]] in an open structure of [[Wall#Iron_Grate|grates]] and one or two [[eldritch tentacle]]s. Since the obsidian statue can flood players with demons while the tentacles reach out with their extreme [[chaos]]-branded melee attacks, successfully retrieving the loot is easier said than done.\n\nIt should be noted that obsidian statues are vulnerable to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] (which can be targeted through the grates). While the eldritch tentacle has enough AC to reliably shrug off shrapnel damage, every little bit helps. It is also worth noting that the tentacles can only reach out to five tiles away; canny fighters can stand back and hit them from a distance with irresistible damage or summons.\n\nAlternatively, a [[potion of haste]], [[Apportation]], and judicious gathering can let one abscond with the majority of the treasure before getting overwhelmed.\n\n==Rewards==\nThere are several loot items scattered about, many themed around Translocations and Abyss escape aides. The outer chambers may contain an item or two, but the bulk of the loot will be in the central chamber. Some of these include: [[scroll of blinking]], [[scroll of teleportation]], [[ring]]s, [[spellbook]]s ([[There-And-Back Book]], [[Book of Displacement]], or an artefact spellbook with a Translocations focus), or a [[manual]] of Translocations. The center chamber has an array of such items; as a reference to the spell [[Shroud of Golubria]], it also includes several high-quality [[cloak]]s that may be [[artefact]]s or even [[unrandart]] cloaks (such as the [[Cloak of Starlight]] or the [[Cloak of the Thief]]).\n\nYou also have a decent chance to grab a weapon of [[distortion]] off of one of the enemies within the Roulette, should you desire one.\n\nShould you desire to worship [[Lugonu]], there is an altar placed under the obsidian statue in the central chamber as well as a decent chance of others showing up throughout the roulette.\n\n== Source ==\nWalls are cC, glass is E, monsters are on 0-9 as written out above.

The transporter rotational rules were roughly the same, except sets contained four chambers each rather than three.\n* The Roulette of Golubria was added in [[0.11]].\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

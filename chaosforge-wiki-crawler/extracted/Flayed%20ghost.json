{"title":"Flayed ghost","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Flayed_ghost","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Flayed ghosts''' are unusual [[undead]] opponents who inflict the [[Flay]]ed [[status effect]]. Being flayed \"damages\" you for 25% of your current HP, which can stack, but is never directly lethal. All flay damage vanishes the moment you kill ''any'' flayed ghost (regardless of which one caused the status), after you've spent enough time without getting flayed, or if you drink a [[potion of cancellation]]. Otherwise, being flayed is exactly like taking damage from any other source. They are found in [[the Depths]], [[the Crypt]], or created by [[Summon Undead]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*On their own, flayed ghosts are fairly harmless; it isn't hard to kill them long before you've been heavily flayed. Coupled with other enemies, however, they can be extremely lethal. Try to lure off individuals and avoid overconfidence.\n*If a flayed ghost hides behind other enemies, use [[penetration|penetrating]] or [[smite]]-targeted attacks to kill it.\n*If multiple flayed ghosts are in view, killing one will cure all of your flay, no matter which one caused the status in the first place.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.13]], flayed ghosts were one of the least interesting undead opponents. They were fairly beefy melee fighters, but otherwise had no distinguishing features. They were also one of the possible results you could wind up with when casting [[Haunt]]."}

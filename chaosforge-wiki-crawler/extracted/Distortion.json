Unwielding it can cause banishment or high damage.}}\n\n'''Distortion''' is a [[brand]] that any melee [[weapon]] may have. Distortion weapons bend and tear the fabric of space-time, and generate a variety of effects when they hit:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|attack.cc|486}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n|-\n!

Pious followers of Lugonu can have a weapon branded with distortion once per game, guaranteeing them access to the brand's effects.\n__TOC__\n\n==Strategy==\nDistortion is a powerful brand. It deals more damage than [[electrocution]], even before considering the banish chance, and distortion can't be resisted. In practice, banishment equates to a 5% of a one-hit kill; it can even banish otherwise hex-immune foes like the [[Hell]] lords. Like electrocution, it works best on fast weapons (e.g. [[Short Blades]] and [[demon whip]]s), since faster weapons will activate more distortion effects.\n\nHowever, this brand isn't perfect; it might blink ranged enemies away, or banish foes with desired equipment. Note that blinking gives you no message when it occurs, which can suddenly leave you with empty space where that monster used to be. When auto-attacking, you may move into an unintended spot. \n\nNote that distortion is quite rare to come by without Lugonu, and has very dangerous unwield effects.\n\n===Enemy Distortion===\nFor monsters with distortion weapons (or with an inherent distortion-branded attack, like [[spatial vortex|spatial vortices]]), do your absolute best not to let them into melee range. For underleveled characters, getting sent into the [[Abyss]] can quickly lead to unwinnable situations. XL 27 characters can likely survive Abyss, at least before A:7.\n*[[Tukima's Dance]] is a great spell against distortion-wielding foes; not only does it permanently disarm their weapon, but it becomes a [[dancing weapon]] on your side.\n*Certain [[uniques]] are likely to possess distortion weapons: [[Psyche]], [[Sonja]], and [[The Enchantress]].\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Even if you never plan to use it, you may want to keep a weapon of distortion around. The unwield effects, while usually negative, can be used as a last-ditch escape tool:\n**If you're [[confuse]]d by [[Sigmund]] with 0 other options, you can try to activate the teleport effect. Banishment might end up helping you, as [[Lugonu]] altars frequently appear in the Abyss.\n**Getting sent to the Abyss is deadly for most stages of the game, but the Abyss can be safer than [[Zot:5]]'s Orb chamber, and is likely safer than [[Mega-Zig]] floors.\n**For turn count [[speedrun]]s, you can unwield distortion in order to get to Abyss faster. Getting \"unintentionally\" banished means you can end up on Abyss:3-4, without having to pass through the upper levels first.\n*Casters that like to keep enemies away from them may find a distortion branded polearm quite useful, since its blink effect creates space between you and monsters. It's wise to train at least a little skill so you can hit at a reasonable (1.0) delay.\n*Banish does ''not'' count as a kill, even though it gives full experience. Most gods won't reward you, and effects like [[Powered By Death]] won't activate.\n**Pay special attention to [[the Royal Jelly]]. If you banish TRJ, the walls won't open unless you dive to the Abyss to kill it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], distortion wouldn't offend the [[good god]]s. Also, if a monster performed an [[attack of opportunity]], distortion could not inflict banish or blink.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], distortion was an extremely punishing brand for those who wield-[[Identification|ID]]'d items. Weapons were not identified until you wielded them, and any glowing weapon could have been distortion-branded.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], distortion had a 10% chance to banish on attack, but banishment gave half experience.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], distortion weapons had a chance of [[teleport]]ing monsters away from you when attacking. They also caused [[Translocations]] [[miscast effect]]s when unwielded.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], distortion weapons could sometimes heal [[blink frog]]s (including the unique blink frog [[Prince Ribbit]]), who were immune to all of the effects of the distortion brand. Additionally, the spell [[Warp Weapon]] existed, which could apply a temporary distortion brand to your weapon.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], rebranding a distortion weapon (e.g. by a [[Scroll of brand weapon]]) caused a distortion effect.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], followers of Lugonu were not protected from the effects of unwielding a distortion weapon.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], this brand was safer when found on sharp weapons, since blunt weapons didn't allow butchering corpses.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], using a weapon of distortion would offend the good gods.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{brands}}\n\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

It will briefly daze monsters that are affected.}}\n\nReading a '''scroll of holy word''' will [[daze]] for 10-19 turns<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|spl-goditem.cc|1051}}</ref> and deal <code>3d15 + 1d20 - 1</code> damage<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|spl-goditem.cc|1017}}</ref> to all [[undead]] and [[demon]]ic targets in your [[line of sight]]. If you read this scroll and you are [[Undead]] or [[Demonspawn]], your hit points will be halved, as if you read a [[scroll of torment]].\n\nDeliberately reading this scroll will anger [[Yredelemnul]] (but not [[Kikubaaqudgha]]).\n\n==Strategy==\n*Similar to a [[scroll of torment]], reading this scroll as a [[Demonspawn]] or while [[undead]] will halve your hit points, but unlike its effect upon undead or demonic monsters, it will never kill the player outright.\n*Much like scrolls of torment, scrolls of holy word are largely situational. They can be useful in undead/demon-heavy branches like [[Crypt]], [[Tomb]], the [[Hell]]s, or [[Pandemonium]], but are otherwise more likely to be taking up space in your inventory.\n**Regardless of how many runes you'll be getting, the fact that demons and [[pandemonium lord]]s spawn in the [[orb run]] always gives some value to holy word.\n*While their damage output is somewhat mediocre in said late-game areas, the fact that scrolls of holy word can daze opponents and (unlike scrolls of torment) cause no backlash damage to most species help make up for that lack.\n\n==History==\n*Scrolls of holy word were removed in [[0.29]]. The holy word effect still exists from [[Zin]]'s Recite, [[the Shining One]]'s weapon blessing, and the [[Torment card]] (when used against torment-immune species).\n*Prior to [[0.15]], these scrolls also [[Cause Fear|scared]] targets, and the good gods made these scrolls more powerful for their followers.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], reading an unknown scroll of holy word would anger your own [[Yredelemnul]] servants.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

As an unfortunate side effect, it also amplifies all damage dealt to the wearer, albeit to a lesser degree. When the effects of the amulet are severed by removing it, the magical backlash significantly drains the wearer.}}\n\nWearing an '''amulet of harm''' makes you deal 30% more damage than normal, but also increases the damage you take by 20%. The damage is increased after [[AC]] and resistances are accounted for, but before [[deep dwarf]] damage shaving. All forms of damage, including [[torment]], are affected. Removing the amulet has a [[draining]] effect.\n\n==Desirability==\nWhether or not an amulet of harm is worth using greatly depends on the character. Characters with good defences, especially AC, may appreciate the extra damage they're able to do while ignoring most of the negative effects. Characters with good ranged attacks, who deal damage at a distance more often than they receive damage, may also benefit.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.25]], the amulet was removed. The [[harm]] ego was moved to [[scarves]] and [[randart]] [[armour]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the amulet was considered [[evil]]. Also, both dealt and received damage were increased by 25%.\n*The amulet of harm was added in [[0.18]].\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

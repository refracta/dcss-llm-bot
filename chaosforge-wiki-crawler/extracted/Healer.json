{"title":"Healer","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Healer","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|The Healer is a priest of Elyvilon. Healers begin with minor healing powers, but can gain far greater abilities in the long run. They are able to persuade monsters to abstain from bloodshed, gaining both piety and experience that way.}}\n\n'''Healers''' are followers of [[Elyvilon]] the Healer. Elyvilon's creed is one of pacifism, and her worshipers can actually pacify monsters by healing them. However, they are forbidden from harming non-hostile monsters, letting their allies die, or using any form of evil magic or weapons.\n\nHealers start the game with 55 [[piety]].\n\n==Preferred Races==\n[[Deep Dwarf]], [[Hill Orc]], [[Naga]], [[Minotaur]], [[Draconian]] and [[Gargoyle]] are the recommended races if you pick a Healer Background.\n\n==Racial Restrictions==\n[[Demigod]]s, [[Demonspawn]], [[Ghoul]]s, [[Mummies]], and [[Vampire]]s may not be Healers, as they are banned from worshipping Elyvilon.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+1 [[robe]]\n*[[Potion of curing]]\n*[[Potion of heal wounds]]\n*2 [[bread ration]]s\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Fighting]]: 1\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Invocations]]: 3\n\nChoosing Healer adds 4 to your starting [[Strength]], [[Intelligence]] and [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Stategy==\nPacification is a more powerful ability than it may seem at first, allowing you to [[smite]]-target dangerous beasts and remove them from the fight entirely. Just be aware that doing so grants you less XP than killing the thing.\n\n==History==\nHealers were removed in [[0.16]].\n\nPrior to [[0.15]], Healers started with 100 [[gold]], 2 levels of fighting, and only one bread ration.\n\nPrior to [[0.14]], Healers started with 4 levels of Invocations.\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]\n[[Category:Obsolete backgrounds]]"}

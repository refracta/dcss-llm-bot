It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Quick blades''' are extremely rapid weapons. Whenever you swing with a quick blade, you get two attacks. This is treated as if you attacked twice with any other weapon, so factors like [[brand]], [[auxiliary attack]]s, and [[AC]] can activate twice.\n\n==Sources==\nQuick blades are rare items. \n*For those invested into Short Blades, [[Trog]]'s weapon gifts are likely to gift one eventually. [[Scrolls of acquirement]], or [[Okawaru]]'s weapon gift, also have a high chance of gifting 'rare' weapons.\n*The [[Elven_Halls#Elf:2 - The Hall of Blades|Hall of Blades]] has a decent chance (~41.5%) of having a [[dancing weapon|dancing]] quick blade, always [[brand]]ed. Also, [[deep elf blademaster]]s have a 1/26 chance of holding one. \n*Some of the more powerful [[List of spriggans|spriggans]] have a chance of spawning with one.\n\n==Strategy==\nEssentially, quick blades are [[rapier]]s that swing twice with more than half the base damage. They benefit greatly from flat damage effects, such as [[enchant]]ment, [[slay]]ing, [[auxiliary attack]]s, and [[stab]]bing. After all, if every hit gets +1 damage, then hitting twice as fast means you get twice the benefit. Conversely, enemy [[AC]] has a greater effect. Therefore, you should use a quick blade if you have many flat damage bonuses. With a good flat damage [[brand]] (namely [[electrocution]], [[pain (brand)|pain]], [[distortion]], and [[chaos]]), quick blades are quite powerful; a quick blade of distortion can take you through [[Zot]].\n\nFor [[stabbing]] purposes, quick blades are better than [[dagger]]s for everything except [[sleep]] stabs, assuming you've reached mindelay with both weapons. While daggers may get bonus damage, quick blades make twice as many stabs. Since the dagger bonus is ''always'' less than twice the damage, quick blades are just better. Sleeping enemies are the sole exception: since sleeping enemies wake up after the first stab, the stronger first hit off a dagger is better.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Quick blades\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Quickblade.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Quickblade2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Quickblade3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]s\n|-\n| '''[[Gyre and Gimble]]''' || [[File:Gyre and Gimble.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Vampire's Tooth]]''' || [[File:Vampire's tooth.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], quick blades only made 1 attack per swing, but had a base delay of 0.7 decaAut and mindelay of 0.3 decaAut.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], quick blades could not naturally generate with [[brand]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], quick blades dealt 5 base damage and scaled with strength instead of dexterity.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], [[Cheibriados]] disapproved of quick blades.\n\n{{weapons}}\n\n[[Category:Short blades]]"}

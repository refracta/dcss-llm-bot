{"title":"Lost soul","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lost_soul","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Lost souls''' are wandering confluxes of necromantic power. They do nothing on their own, but lost souls can sacrifice themselves to revive a living or undead monster in its [[line of sight]].\n\nA monster can only be revived once. If a valid ally is killed, the lost soul may sacrifice itself the moment it dies.\n*Undead allies are restored to full HP and have their [[status effect]]s reset. [[Derived undead]] cannot be revived.\n*Living, zombifiable monsters are turned into \"ghostly\" monsters. Ghostly monsters are almost identical copies, keeping gear, spells, and status effects. However, they become [[undead]]: ghostly monsters are immune to [[poison]] and [[negative energy]], but are vulnerable to [[holy]].\n\nLost souls do not always choose to sacrifice themselves; if monsters of varying strength are present, they will often ignore the deaths of weak monsters in order to save themselves for the strong. If several lost souls are clustered together, they will be more likely to sacrifice themselves for weaker things. On their own, lost souls move quickly and avoid getting close to you, but are generally fragile.\n\nLost souls can be summoned by [[deep elf death mage]]s. Non-summoned lost souls are quite rare and can be found only in [[ziggurat]]s, the [[Borgnjor's Mausoleum]] wizlab or in [[Tartarus]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While it's normally reasonable to focus your attention on the largest threat in a fight with multiple enemies, be careful when doing so with lost souls around. They're fairly fragile, so it's usually worth spending a turn or two to take them out before finishing off any powerful foes.\n*Area-of-effect attacks, like a [[tin of tremorstones]] or [[lightning rod]], can prove to be effective.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], non-summoned lost souls could be found in [[the Crypt]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], lost souls could [[submerge]] if no allies were in sight.\n*Lost souls were added in [[0.13]]."}

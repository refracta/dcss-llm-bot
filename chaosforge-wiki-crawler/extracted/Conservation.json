{"title":"Conservation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Conservation","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\nThe '''conservation''' [[intrinsic]] reduces the chance of [[item destruction]] from most sources by 90%. There are three sources of conservation:\n*[[Amulet of conservation]]\n*[[Cloak of preservation]]\n*[[Maxwell's Patent Armour]]\n\nThere are also three sources of item protection that are similar to conservation, but function separately. They all stack with conservation.\n*Followers of [[Jiyva]] gain an alternative version of conservation that has a success rate based on [[piety]].\n*[[Demonspawn]] can gain [[demonspawn mutation]]s that protect their scrolls ''or'' their potions 90% of the time.\n*Wielding the [[great mace]] [[Firestarter]] provides similar protection against scroll destruction.\n\n==History==\nConservation was removed in [[0.15]], along with item destruction.\n\n[[category:Stats]]"}

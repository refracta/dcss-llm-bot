Taking damage will typically wake the target, and loud sounds can potentially do so as well.}}\n'''Sleep''' is a status effect and monster-only spell. It prevents the target from moving or attacking until woken up.\n\n==Effect==\nBeing asleep has the following effects:\n\n*Creatures are unable to act until woken up.\n*[[EV]] is set to almost 0, <code>2 + [[Evasion#Base EV|size_factor]]</code> for players, and set to 0 EV for monsters.\n*[[SH]] is set to 0.\n*Players take 2.5x damage in melee.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|melee-attack.cc|3641}}</ref>\n*Monsters are vulnerable to high-tier [[stab]]s.\n**Monsters take 2.5x damage from other monsters' melee attacks.\n\nBoth players and monsters will wake up after taking any amount of damage. Monsters can also wake up if you fail a [[stealth]] check, or if they hear a [[noise]].\n\n===Sleepwalking===\nMonsters that are asleep and [[confuse]]d at the same time will exhibit '''sleepwalking'''. They are vulnerable to high-tier stabs, but wander around as if they were confused. They can wake up, as with the normal sleep condition, though this doesn't end the confusion status.\n\nUsually, this requires the monster to be confused, then put to sleep, since most ways of confusion will wake a monster up. The spell [[Alistair's Intoxication]] can confuse sleeping monsters, however.\n\n===Immunity===\nFor players, you can be immune by being undead ([[Ghoul]], [[Mummy]], bloodless [[Vampire]]), nonliving ([[Gargoyle]], [[Djinni]]), by having [[clarity]], or being [[berserk]]. Undead/nonliving [[transformation]]s (such as [[Statue Form]] or [[Storm Form]]) are also immune.\n\n[[Undead]], [[nonliving]], and [[plant]] monsters cannot be put to sleep, but they can still generate \"dormant\".<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|actor.cc|151}}</ref> [[Berserk]] monsters and monsters that have slept recently are immune to sleep.\n\n==Sources==\nOther than the Sleep spell, the sleep status can be inflicted by the following:\n\n*The [[Ensorcelled Hibernation]] spell ([[cold resistance]] renders immunity).\n*The ''Sleep'' [[attack flavour]] of [[sleepcap]]s.\n*The [[Dream Dust]] ability of [[dream sheep]].\n\nMonsters are usually asleep at the time that they are generated (or \"dormant\", if incapable of sleep).\n\n==Monster Spell==\nThe Sleep spell attempts to put the target to sleep. It must have line of fire, and can be resisted by [[willpower]].\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.24]], [[needle]]s of sleeping existed.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], monsters would tend to fall asleep if enough time has passed since they last encountered the player.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

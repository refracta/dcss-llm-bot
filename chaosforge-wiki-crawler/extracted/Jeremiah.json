{"title":"Jeremiah","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Jeremiah","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Jeremiah the Dreamer''' is a [[unique]] [[barachi]]an, who comes with a [[trident]] of [[draining]] and a random [[orb]] (between [[energy]], [[guile]], and [[mayhem]]). Jeremiah has [[Smiting]] and has the ability to hop away.\n\nWhen \"awake\" and in [[line of sight]], Jeremiah generates short-lived [[butterflies]] every turn.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:6-9\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*With high HP, constant butterflies getting in the way, and [[Smiting]], Jeremiah can be a real nuisance. But, as a Barachi, Jeremiah is slow-moving; you can eventually run away.\n*Using a [[scroll of immolation]] can be effective, but ''extremely'' dangerous. Once any butterfly dies, it will create a big chain reaction, which will take Jermiah out. Due to butterflies' random movement, it has a good chance to hit you, too. Before using immolation, either have good [[fire resistance]] (rF++ or better) or be ''absolutely sure'' that you won't get hurt by the explosions.\n\n==History==\n*Jeremiah was introduced in [[0.31]]."}

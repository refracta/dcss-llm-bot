When moved a glimmer of chaos from some cosmic game is imposed upon the battlefield. This glimmer afflicts a random foe with one of the following: haste, invisibility, might, corona, slow, paralyse, confuse, malmutate, petrify, or sleep.}}\n\nEvoking a '''piece from Xom's chessboard''', in the spirit of [[Xom]], allows you to cause a random effect<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|evoke.cc|883}}</ref> on a random monster within LOS. You must beat the enemy's [[willpower]] in order for it to work. Your [[Evocations]] skill will increase the duration of the effect - positive or negative, as well as the chance to defeat the enemy's willpower.\n\nEven though it favors negative effects, you should always stay careful by being far away and having an escape plan.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" ; style=\"float:right; border:none; margin:5px;\"\n!

Carrying multiples is no more useful than carrying one, since charges are shared between all pieces.\n\n[[Cheibriados]] dislikes this item, as it may cause [[haste]]. You'll only lose piety if you actually get the haste effect. [[Zin]] dislikes any of the random effects.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

Compared to the wand, the chesspiece can not produce any directly damaging effects. It also has a random target.\n*Pieces from Xom's chessboard were considered for inclusion in [[0.18]], with a completely different effect. They would have you swap places with monsters, which had a chance to [[confusion|confuse]] them. It could backfire and instead cause a random bad [[Xom]] action.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Evocables}}"}

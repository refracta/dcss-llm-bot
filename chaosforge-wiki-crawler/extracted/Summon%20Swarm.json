[[Spell power]] augments the number of monsters summoned and their duration, but has no impact on the composition of the swarm. Since this is a [[rod]]-based spell, spell power is based on your [[Evocations]] skill, not Summonings.\n\nPossible summons include:\n*{{monsterlink|Worker ant}} (25%)\n*{{monsterlink|Killer bee}} (25%)\n*{{monsterlink|Spider}} (16.7%)\n*{{monsterlink|Scorpion}} (8%)\n*{{monsterlink|Worm}} (8%)\n*{{monsterlink|Vampire mosquito}} (8%*)\n*{{monsterlink|Wasp}} (8%)\n*{{monsterlink|Butterfly}} (8%)\n\n[*] Worshipers of [[good gods]] will never summon [[vampire mosquito]]s.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.18]], [[rod of the swarm]] was removed and so was Summon Swarm\n\nSummon Swarm could summon [[goliath beetle]]s prior to their removal in [[0.17]].\n\nSummon Swarm used to be capable of summoning [[wolf spider]]s as well. When wolf spiders were improved in [[0.11]], this spell was nerfed to only be capable of summoning regular spiders."}

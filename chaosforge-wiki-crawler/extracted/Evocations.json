{"title":"Evocations","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Evocations","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n\n'''Evocations''' is the [[skill]] related to the use of [[evocable items|evocable magical items]], such as [[wand]]s.\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n==Useful Info==\nIncreasing Evocations skill results in the following:\n*Increases the [[spell power]] of effects produced by most evoked items.\n*Increases the success rate of [[Invisibility_(ego)|scarves of invisibility]] and [[artefact]]s with evocable abilities (invisibility, [[blink]]ing).\n*Increases damage inflicted with [[magical staff|magical staves]].\n\nFor more details on how Evocations impacts an evocable, see that item's individual page.\n\n==Monster Evocations==\nWhen monsters wield weapons that are affected by Evocations, they are given skill equal to [[HD]] if they are intelligent, and have no skill otherwise. When monsters attempt to use evocable invisibility or blink, they succeed 100% of the time, regardless of their effective skill.\n\n==Strategy==\nIn general, Evocations is an \"emergency\" tool that you can use many times. For melee characters, it is a ranged option that isn't affected by [[encumbrance]]. For magical characters, it can damage enemies without using MP. Any character can make use of the various evocable effects, like [[summon]]s and statuses. You won't have enough charges for every fight, but like most items in Crawl, use evocables early and often.\n\nWands generate much more frequently in [[Swamp]] than [[Shoals]]. If the former branch is in your game, you may want to favor Evocations a little more.\n\nMany evocables are affected by the [[alternate items]] mechanic. For example, a single game can spawn either the [[wand of iceblast]] or the [[wand of roots]], not both. This may change how much you want to use Evocations.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Artificer]]\n*[[Evocable items]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Evocations increased maximum [[MP]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Evocations improved [[Nemelex Xobeh]]'s abilities\n*In [[0.17]], all races had their Evocations aptitude decreased by one.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], Evocations cost 80% as much XP to train; aptitudes were adjusted up by one to compensate.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], Evocations had no impact on your max MP.\n\n{{Skills}}\n\n[[Category:Skills]]\n[[Category:Evocations]]"}

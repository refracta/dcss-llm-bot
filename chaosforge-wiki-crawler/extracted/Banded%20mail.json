It is strictly inferior to a [[splint mail]].\n\n==Tips and tricks==\nWhile most intermediate armours are to be generally avoided, this is particularly the case with banded mails - it is strictly worse than a splint mail (same EV penalty but one fewer base AC).  Don't wear it unless you can find nothing better, or you have an absurdly powerful artefact (along the lines of the +8 banded mail of Fun {rF++ rC++ Dam+4})\n\n==History==\nBanded mail was removed from the game in [[0.10]]; [[chain mail]] and other medium armours shifted up a point of AC to take its place.\n\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

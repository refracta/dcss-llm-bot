This damage is never directly lethal.}}\n\n'''Symbol of Torment''' is a monster-only spell which inflicts [[torment]] to everything in sight, halving their HP. The damage can be reduced by [[negative energy resistance]] and torment resistance, but unlike [[Agony]], [[willpower]] has no effect.\n\nWhile it technically affects everything in sight, including the caster, all users of this spell are immune to torment. In addition, this spell is most commonly seen in areas such as [[the Tomb]] and [[Hell]], where most monsters are immune to torment.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nPlayers can invoke torment using a [[scroll of torment]], [[Kikubaaqudgha]]'s Torment ability, and a few other methods.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Torment]] - details & strategies on how to deal with torment.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.8]], players could cast a version of Symbol of Torment as a level 6 [[Necromancy]] spell. Unlike the monster version, this spell would not function if the caster had torment immunity.\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

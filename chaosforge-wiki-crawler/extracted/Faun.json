{"title":"Faun","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Faun","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For a list of all centaur-type creatures, see [[list of centaurs]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Fauns''' are pesky ranged attackers who travel in packs, occasionally led by a [[satyr]]. Although individually weak, a pack will pelt you with a painful barrage of [[sling]]s, while lowering your [[willpower]]. They can be found in [[the Shoals]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Leaving yourself in the open to a pack of fauns can result in a lot of damage. Use whatever terrain is available to limit the number of enemies shooting you at any given time.\n*Strip Willpower isn't terribly threatening when you're only dealing with fauns. However, it makes it more likely for satyrs (or other enemies) to hex you.\n**Corona negates [[invisible]] and makes you easier to hit. Not great if you're relying on invisibility to escape.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], fauns could have one of two possible spell sets:\n**[[Corona]] and [[Confuse]]\n**[[Corona]] and [[Slow]]\n*Fauns were added in [[0.14]]."}

{"title":"Pain card","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Pain_card","type":"raw","data":"{{Version027}}\n{{flavour|The card depicts an iron wheel, menacing with spikes and rusted with blood.\n\nDrawing this card unleashes a necromantic attack spell.}}\nThe Pain card unleashes a necromantic attack spell, determined by power level:\n* Power level 0: [[Agony]]\n* Power level 1: [[Bolt of Draining]]\n* Power level 2: Invokes [[torment]] against all living creatures in your line of sight, excluding yourself.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], at level 2 the Pain card would summon a [[flayed ghost]] and flay all natural monsters in sight for 40% of their HP. The flaying was reversed when the flayed ghost died.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], level 2 effects were weaker. Enemies were flayed only for 20% of their HP, and the card dealt 5 damage to the player. Also, if there was no space to spawn a flayed ghost, the card did nothing instead of downgrading to level 1 effect (Bolt of Draining).\n*The Pain card could be found in the following [[Decks|decks]] over the past several versions. In older versions it could cast Symbol of Torment, a mixed blessing for the player.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.11]]\n![[0.12]]\n![[0.13]]\n![[0.14]]\n![[0.15]]\n![[0.16]]\n![[0.17]]\n![[0.18]]\n![[0.19]] and beyond\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of destruction|Destruction]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of destruction|Destruction]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of destruction|Destruction]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of destruction|Destruction]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of destruction|Destruction]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of destruction|Destruction]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of destruction|Destruction]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of destruction|Destruction]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of destruction|Destruction]]\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n{{cards}}\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

{"title":"Asterion","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Asterion","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Asterion the Fallen King''' is an extremely dangerous [[unique]] [[minotaur (monster)|minotaur]], usually generated with a [[spectral]]-branded [[demon blade]], [[demon whip]], [[demon trident]], or [[broad axe]], as well as a (possibly [[ego|magical]]) [[kite shield]]. A worshipper of [[Makhleb]], he is capable of launching a variety of powerful elemental attacks against you at range, and he hits astonishingly hard in melee, even before [[Haste|hasting]] himself and summoning a mighty demon to his aid.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Snake Pit]]\n*The [[Spider's Nest]]\n*[[The Vaults]]:1-3\n*The [[Elven Halls]]\n*[[The Depths]]:1-3\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*His Major Destruction ability allows him to hit you with the following spells: [[Bolt of Fire]], [[Lightning Bolt]], [[Sticky Flame]], [[Iron Shot]], [[Bolt of Draining]], [[Fireball]], and [[Orb of Electrocution]]. It's unlikely that you'll have resistance to all of these elements, but even so, it is far better to try to quickly kill him at range than to allow him into melee. With the aid of his [[Haste]] spell, he can deal extraordinary amounts of damage very quickly, particularly when you consider how early in the game he appears.\n*His Greater Servant of Makhleb ability allows him to summon an [[executioner]], [[cacodemon]], [[balrug]], [[blizzard demon]], or [[green death]] with a summon cap of one. \n*He has sufficient [[willpower]] and [[HD]] to make most debilitating effects chancy at best. Dedicated [[Hexes]] specialists might be able to weaken him with [[status effect]]s, but others are unlikely to get much use out of such abilities.\n*He is vulnerable to [[silver]] damage, so ranged weapons users with silver [[javelin]]s can deal very heavy damage to him, likely taking him down before he gets close.\n*He doesn't need very many turns to kill poorly armoured characters. Err on the side of paranoia when it comes to fleeing a fight before it has a chance to get ugly.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.30]], Asterion now always generates with a [[spectral]]-branded weapon.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Asterion had [[Spectral Weapon]] instead of [[Greater Servant of Makhleb]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Asterion could appear in the [[Swamp]] or [[Shoals]].\n*Asterion was added in [[0.14]]."}

{"title":"Levitation (ego)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Levitation_(ego)","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\nThe '''levitation ego''' grants you the [[ability]] to begin [[levitating]] (or [[fly]]ing if you have the [[Control Flight]] [[intrinsic]]) for as long as you wish. Once in the air, you can land again with a separate ability. However, each time you take off costs you 101-200 [[satiation]] (weighted toward 150).\n\nAlthough contantly flying offers few downsides, constantly levitating makes certain necessary actions impossible; you can't pick up items or descend [[stairs]] unless you land. Even so, the ability to travel over [[lava]] and [[deep water]], or to ignore the effects of [[shallow water]] and mechanical [[trap]]s, makes it occasionally very useful. In either case, be careful using this around enemies with the [[Airstrike]] spell.\n\nThis ego can be found on [[boots]] and [[barding]]s. Note that the [[ring of levitation]] functions differently, offering you a limited period of levitation.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*You can avoid [[Trog]]'s wrath by activating a levitation item and hovering over a 3Ã—3 area of lava. None of his penances will be able to touch you! Just be sure to have enough food on hand and expect to waste a lot of turns.\n*It particularly shines in [[the Abyss]]. Being able to cross the unpredictably impassable terrain lets you avoid getting cornered by packs of enemies and makes it much easier to escape pursuit by non-flying opponents.\n\n==History==\nLevitation was removed in [[0.12]]."}

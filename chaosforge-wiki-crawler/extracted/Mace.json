It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''mace''' is a fairly light [[Maces & Flails]] weapon. Many [[background]]s can start with one.\n\n==Strategy==\nAs a \"simple\" starting weapon, the mace is slightly weaker than the [[falchion]], but stronger than a [[hand axe]]. Maces & Flails scale with [[strength]] and have good single-target damage, making them good for characters planning to use heavy armour.\n\nAlthough a decent option for the early game, you'll want to find something more powerful in fairly short order. [[Flail]]s are stronger and attack just as quickly, though at an accuracy penalty. \n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Mace1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Mace2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Mace3.png]]\n|}\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

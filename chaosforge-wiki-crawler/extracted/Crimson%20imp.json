{"title":"Crimson imp","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Crimson_imp","type":"raw","data":"{{version021}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Crimson imps''' are [[tier-5 demon]]s, and likely the first [[demon]]s players will encounter. They are annoying pests that [[regeneration rate|regenerate]] quickly and [[blink]] often. On their own, they are mostly harmless (if annoying), but they may complicate a fight with other monsters.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you can't kill it, just run; it will blink, giving you an opportunity to get away. Leading it upstairs before doing so will remove the pest entirely, a technique called imp parking. Most early characters can eventually kill an imp with enough successive solid hits (especially with cold- or holy wrath-branded ones), but it's not always worth the effort. With a decently heavy weapon, almost any character can eventually whittle away at it until you overcome its regeneration. Just beware of other wandering monsters joining the fight.\n*A [[wand of polymorph other]] will often polymorph them into something that's technically easier to kill, but pretty much any other imp is more dangerous, and if you're simply trying to get around their fire resistance, be aware that [[iron imp]]s are nearly as bad in that regard.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.10]], \"crimson imps\" were named \"imps.\"\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

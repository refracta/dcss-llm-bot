However, they will recharge as you gain experience.}}\n\nA '''lamp of fire''' is an [[Evocable items#elementalevokers|elemental evoker]] which allows you to fire powerful, semi-controlled gouts of flame at your opponents. When evoked, you may choose a target tile, and up to three blasts of flame will be launched in that general direction, generating flame [[cloud]]s along the path to the target. At low [[Evocations]] skill, this will likely create a single weak bolt of flame, but at higher skill levels you can deal surprisingly high amounts of damage and leave much of the battlefield engulfed in flames. \n\nUsing this item depletes it, rendering it inert, but it will recharge each time you gain sufficient [[experience]] while it is in your possession.\n\nCarrying multiple lamps is no more useful than carrying one, since evoking one causes all lamps, both carried and stashed, to become temporarily inert.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Evoking a lamp of fire can be very useful as a virtual \"smite\" attack versus a particular damaging creature protected by a mob (e.g., a [[silent spectre]] in a [[ziggurat]]).\n*The ability to control the direction the lamp fires at is increased at higher [[Evocations]], but characters with 0 evocations can still use it to great effect in corridors.\n\n==History==\n*Lamps of fire were removed in [[0.25]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], using this item would summon up to three allied [[fire elemental]]s near the target.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], all [[Evocable items#elementalevokers|elemental evokers]] recharged simultaneously.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], this item simply allowed you to summon fire elementals one at a time from flaming [[cloud]]s or [[lava]].\n*Prior to [[0.9]], it appeared unidentified as a '''blazing lamp'''."}

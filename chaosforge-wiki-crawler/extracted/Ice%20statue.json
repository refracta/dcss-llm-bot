{"title":"Ice statue","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ice_statue","type":"raw","data":"{{version|030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ice statues''' are stationary guardians which use assorted [[Ice Magic]] to kill you from a distance and summon [[ice beast]]s while you're in their [[LOS]]. Unlike normal [[statue]]s, ice statues are immune to [[wands of digging]] . Instead, use [[fire]] or [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] to make short work of them. They are commonly found in [[Ice Cave]]s, and occasionally accompany [[Antaeus]] in the depths of [[Cocytus]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Cold#Cold_Resistance|Cold resistance]] helps a lot here, as you'll be taking heavy damage from the statue's spells and its summoned ice beasts without it.\n*[[Fire Magic]] suggestions:\n**Statues are stationary, so you can hit them with [[Sticky Flame]], [[blink]] away, and repeat the process when they stop melting. [[Starburst]] kills them even faster.\n**If you have [[Fireball]], you don't even need to be in their LOS to hit them: stay around a corner and target an adjacent square.\n*Another way to destroy an ice statue without being in its LOS is to blow it up with [[Fulminant Prism]]s.\n*Those with [[Iron Shot]] and similar can make good use of it here, as ice statues have abysmal EV.\n*Characters without ranged options should pile on the cold resistance, then charge the statue from the closest available cover. Depending on your equipment and abilities, further buffing oneself or [[Scroll of blinking|blinking]] into melee range may also be recommended.\n*Ice statues can't [[see invisible]]. Attacking them while [[invisible]] allows you to [[stab]] them and greatly reduces the odds of them casting anything at you."}

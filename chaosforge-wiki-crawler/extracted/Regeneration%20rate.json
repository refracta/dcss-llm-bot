It is affected by many things, almost all of which stack.\n\n===Base regeneration===\nYour base regeneration rate (BRR) is calculated as follows:\n::<font size=\"3\"><code>20 + MHP / 6</code></font>\nSo for every 1 max HP, BRR increases by 1/6.<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|player.cc|1312}}</ref>\n\n===Modifiers===\nTotal regeneration rate (TRR) is modified as follows, in this order:\n*The Regen+ property adds 80 per instance, which stacks with no limit.\n**An [[artefact]] may generate with Regen+.\n**An [[Amulet of regeneration]] gives a rank of Regen+.\n**A [[troll leather armour]] has Regen+.\n***The [[moon troll leather armour]] [[unrandart]] adds another rank of the property (Regen++ in total).\n**The [[Good_mutations#regeneration|regeneration mutation]] adds a rank of Regen+ per level.\n**The [[robe of Vines]] gives Regen++++.\n*The [[demonspawn]] mutation [[demonspawn mutations#Powered by Death|Powered by Death]] has a chance to add a temporary regen bonus of up to 100*level. Further kills can increase this up to a maximum of 1000-1200, but falls by 100 every 2-5 turns.\n*[[Armataur]]s gain a temporary regen bonus when [[rampaging]] at XL 7.\n*If you are a [[vampire]] and Alive, add 20.\n*If you are [[sick]] or have [[Bad_mutations#Inhibited_Regeneration|-Regen]] (with monsters in [[LOS]]), set your rate to 0.\n*[[Jiyva]] adds anywhere between 80 and 160, depending on piety level.\n*[[Trog|Trog's Hand]] adds 100.\n\nBecause the last two effects are applied last, they are not modified by any other factors, and can heal you even if you have -Regen.\n\nEvery turn (10 auts) you accumulate regeneration points equal to your TRR. When you accumulate 100 points, you heal 1 HP, and excess regeneration points are carried over to the next turn. If your action lasted longer/shorter than 10 aut, then the regeneration is scaled with time taken.\n\nAt 100 MHP, your BRR is 36.6. In order to get 50 BRR (regain 1 HP every 2 turns), you would need 180 MHP; for 100 BRR (heal every turn), you would need 480 MHP. Items or mutations that increase regeneration are far more efficient at raising your regeneration rate than stacking HP.\n\n===Examples===\n*You have 30 MHP. Your BRR is 20 + 30/6 => 25. It will take 4 turns to accumulate 100 regeneration points and heal by 1 HP. Your healing rate is 1 HP for every 4 turns.\n\n*You have 180 MHP. Your BRR is 20 + 180/6 => 50. It will take 2 turns to accumulate 100 regeneration points and heal by 1 HP. Your healing rate is 1 HP for every 2 turns.\n\n*Same as above, except you're wearing a [[troll leather armour]], which adds 80 to this rate. Your TRR is 50+80 => 130. You accumulate 100 regeneration points and heal by 1 HP every turn, with 30 left over. Your healing rate is 1 HP every turn, with an additional HP every 3.33 turns.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], base regeneration rate was <code>MHP / 3</code> if under 60 max HP, and <code>MHP / 6 + 10</code> if over it. Regeneration rate was lower at all max HP levels.\n**This made health regeneration significantly slower at lower levels.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the Regen+ property gave a bonus regen of 100 (1.0 HP/turn) instead of 80.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the Regen+ property gave a bonus regeneration rate of 40 (0.4 HP/turn) instead of 100.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

{"title":"Trample","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Trample","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\nA '''trample''' attack is a melee attack which knocks the victim back one tile; the trampler then occupies the tile previously occupied by its target. The knockback can't move a target through an impassible (wall, lava, etc.) or occupied tile.  \n\nTargets smaller in [[size]] than the attacker have a greater chance of being knocked back, and almost all monsters that can trample are among the largest monsters in the game.\n\n==Monsters That Trample==\nThe following is a comprehensive list of all monsters that trample:\n*All elephants:\n**{{monsterlink|Elephant}}\n**{{monsterlink|Dire elephant}}\n**{{monsterlink|Hellephant}}\n**{{monsterlink|Nellie}}\n*Most [[dragon]]s:\n**{{monsterlink|Swamp dragon}}\n**{{monsterlink|Fire dragon}}\n**{{monsterlink|Ice dragon}}\n**{{monsterlink|Storm dragon}}\n**{{monsterlink|Iron dragon}}\n**{{monsterlink|Bone dragon}}\n**{{monsterlink|Golden dragon}}\n**{{monsterlink|Xtahua}}\n**{{LightCyan|D}} [[File:Bai Suzhen (dragon).png]] '''[[Bai Suzhen#Dragon Form|Bai Suzhen]]''' (in dragon form)\n**{{Black|D}} [[File:Serpent of Hell (Gehenna).png]] [[File:Serpent of Hell (Cocytus).png]] [[File:Serpent of Hell (Dis).png]] [[File:Serpent of Hell (Tartarus).png]] '''The [[Serpent of Hell]]'''\n*{{monsterlink|Hell beast}}\n*{{monsterlink|Thrashing horror}}\n*{{monsterlink|Mlioglotl}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Pay careful attention to tramplers when near [[stair]]cases. If one is adjacent as you climb up a stair, you can be trampled off, and it will occupy your former escape route.\n*Trample works oddly with [[Inner Flame]]. When killing a target with Inner Flame, the victim is knocked back, then the victim explodes, then the trampler moves to the new tile (thus not getting hit by the explosion).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], players in [[Dragon Form]] could trample their opponents."}

{"title":"Broodmother","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Broodmother","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{stub}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Broodmothers''' are enormous spiders found in the [[Spider's Nest]]. They have respectable combat stats, but also constantly summon smaller spiders in combat.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Unlike most spiders, broodmothers are not weak to poison, though not resistant, either. Spells like [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] can wear down the summons and the mother, but the broodmother's large HP pool makes taking them on directly with [[Alchemy]] less than ideal.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|broodmothers won't be able to [[abjuration|abjure]] hostile summons.}}\n*Broodmothers were added in [[0.28]]."}

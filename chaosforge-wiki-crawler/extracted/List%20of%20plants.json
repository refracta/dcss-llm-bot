{"title":"List of plants","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_plants","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For the standard dungeon plant, see [[plant]].''\n\nThe majority of the '''plants''' you'll find in [[the Dungeon]] are stationary \"creatures\", serving as harmless obstacles to a player's exploration. However, there are a wide variety of aggressive, carnivorous plants that will attack you as readily as any other threat. Plants are most common in nature-themed [[branch]]es like [[the Lair]] and [[the Swamp]], though many varieties can be found elsewhere. Many plants are immune to magical effects and [[torment]], but [[fire]] tends to work well against them.\n\nAll plants are sacred to [[Fedhas Madash]]; followers of Fedhas will not be harmed by the more hostile plants (and are forbidden from harming them in return) and gain several powers that allow them to harness plants to hinder or even directly attack their enemies.\n\n==Plant types==\n===Harmless===\nThese plants are simple obstacles; most are fragile and will wither quickly when damaged. Worshipers of [[Fedhas Madash]] may move (albeit slowly) and attack freely through them. [[Tree]]s also exist, but they are considered a type of [[Wall#Trees|wall]] rather than a monster. Not even Fedhas can enable you to pass through trees.\n\n{{monsterlink|Toadstool}} - Short-lived fungi often associated with rotting [[corpse]]s.\n\n{{monsterlink|Fungus}} - Huge mushrooms that grow well in the [[Dungeon]]'s damp conditions.\n\n{{monsterlink|Plant}} - Lush flora that grow abundantly in certain Dungeon [[branch]]es.\n\n{{monsterlink|Bush}} - Tough, woody plants that block movement but not line of fire. Particularly hardy specimens of plant life, they require considerable effort to remove without resorting to fire.\n\n===Hostile===\n{{monsterlink|Sleepcap}} - Motile fungi that can put passersby to sleep to get easier meals.\n\n{{monsterlink|Wandering mushroom}} - Shy fungal creatures that quietly follow you while you aren't looking. When threatened, they defend themselves with blasts of confusing spores.\n\n{{monsterlink|Oklob sapling}} - Immature [[oklob plant]]s, their [[acid|vitriolic]] secretions are nonetheless hazardous to both your health and your gear.\n\n{{monsterlink|Oklob plant}} - Hateful, deadly plants that corrode flesh and equipment alike with their [[acid]]ic projectiles.\n\n{{monsterlink|Burning bush}} - Rare incendiary [[bush]]es that periodically spew flames at passersby.\n\n{{monsterlink|Thorn hunter}} - Predatory plants that block their quarry's escape with briar patches before downing them with volleys of thorns.\n\n{{monsterlink|Briar patch}} - [[Spiny]] tangles called forth by [[thorn hunter]]s to entrap their prey, or by followers of Fedhas to ward off attackers.\n\n{{monsterlink|Shambling mangrove}} - Mobile trees that grasp at their attackers' feet with their roots while pummeling them with their branches. Some of them are known to carry hives of [[hornet]]s.\n\n{{monsterlink|Starflower}} - The [[Abyss]]al version of oklob plants, starflowers can warp space to grant their strikes abnormally long reach, or [[Harpoon Shot|pull their targets into range]] if they're too far away.\n\n{{monsterlink|Snaplasher vine}} - Strong vines that pull intruders into the [[Awaken Forest|forest]] at the behest of a [[dryad]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Deathcap}} - Foul, undead fungi called into existence by [[curse toe]]s. They can drain the life out of their foes from a distance.\n\n{{Green|*}} [[File:Ballistomycete spore.png]] {{Magenta|P}} [[File:Ballistomycete.png]] '''[[Ballistomycete spore]]s and [[Ballistomycete]]s''' - Two different stages of the ballistomycete's life cycle: adult fungi create spores, which chase down other creatures and explode. They have since gone extinct in the Dungeon, though followers of Fedhas may temporarily reintroduce them.\n\n{{monsterlink|Cactus giant}} - Especially thorny giants that are painful to fight up close. They're not native to the Dungeon, but some mages can learn to [[Summon Cactus Giant|summon them]] as allies.\n\n==Retired==\n{{LightRed|P}} [[File:Hyperactive ballistomycete.png]] '''[[Ballistomycete#Hyperactive Ballistomycete|Hyperactive Ballistomycete]]''' - A ballistomycete that was affected by Fedhas's Evolution ability. It constantly created explosions of spores and would eventually destroy itself in doing so.\n\n{{monsterlink|Thorn lotus}} - Deceptively beautiful flowers that floated serenely on the surface of ponds and rivers. Careless admirers found themselves suddenly pelted with sharp spikes.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], all plants were immune to [[negative energy]].\n*Hyperactive ballistomycetes were removed in the Fedhas rework of [[0.24]].\n*Thorn lotuses were removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

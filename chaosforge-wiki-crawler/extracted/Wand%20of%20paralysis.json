This effect has to overcome the target's [[willpower]] to succeed, but having a high [[Evocations]] skill will increase your odds of success.\n\nThis wand and the [[wand of charming]] are mutually exclusive; only one may spawn in a given game.\n\n==Strategy==\nParalysis is a ''very'' strong effect:\n*Preventing an enemy from attacking for a few turns is valuable on its own. When you're swarmed by enemies, taking one fewer attack per turn can make a big difference. In a hallway, you can paralyse a weak enemy to prevent anything from coming through. A few free attacks can give you the edge you need to win a fight.\n*Paralysed enemies have 0 [[EV]] and are vulnerable to high-tier [[stab]]s. If your character is competent in melee, you're likely to kill just about ''any'' (individual) monster before the duration runs out. No [[Stealth]] required.\n\nMany dangerous creatures, even [[unique]]s, have low willpower. Examples include [[two-headed ogre]]s, [[hornet]]s, [[Nessos]], and [[Sonja]].\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Just as paralysis is strong against monsters, paralysis is strong against you. Getting hit once by paralysis can kill you from 100% health.\n*A [[scroll of vulnerability]], preferably when no monster can hex you, allows for many more targets to be effectively neutralized. Big threats like [[Mara]] and [[Parghit]] can be stopped entirely by vulnerability -> paralysis. Of course, vulnerability reduces your own willpower, so mind the usual risks.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], this wand was made exclusive with the wand of charming.\n\n{{wands}}"}

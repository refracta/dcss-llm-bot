{"title":"Snorg","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Snorg","type":"raw","data":"{{version|025}}\n{{list of | trolls}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Snorg the Insatiable''' is a ferocious [[unique]] [[troll (monster)|troll]] who hits hard in melee and goes [[berserk]] with reckless abandon.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]: 10-14\n*[[The Lair]]: 3-6\n*[[The Orcish Mines]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Going into melee against Snorg can be dangerous. Her berserk usually lasts longer than yours, hasting her and increasing the damage of her attacks by 1.5x (for an average damage/time increase of 2.25x). Summoners can spam cheap summoned monsters, letting them take her attacks and softening her up until her berserk expires. Extremely fast characters can [[kite]] her, though this usually isn't an option ([[Haste]] + better than average base move speed required). Those who want to engage her in melee should buff themselves first: a [[potion of haste]] and a [[potion of might]] will not go amiss. High defensive stats certainly also help.\n*Snorg goes berserk more often when she's wounded. If you can't handle her berserking, it's best to either kill or disable her quickly or run away without hurting her.\n*Killing Snorg may produce a named [[troll leather armour]] that has a chance to come pre-enchanted.\n\n[[Category:Troll]]"}

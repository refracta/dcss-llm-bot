It illuminates the dungeon's recesses, revealing the machinations of those who would prefer to stay invisible.\n\n----\n\n“But soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, then gathered the folk about the pyre of glorious Hector.”\n\n-Homer, _The Iliad_, XXIV, 776.<br>\ntrans.

It's a viable weapon, even into [[Zot]].\n\nThe halo provides a handy [[see invisible]] effect, and increases your accuracy against enemies. However, it lowers your [[stealth]] and prevents you from going invisible. Thankfully, the halo won't make enemies more accurate against you.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*When stealth is at a premium (say, for lower-level characters entering a new level), unwield Eos when exploring, and wield when you actually engage in combat.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], it had no halo, but granted See Invisible and disabled teleporting. Also, the enchantment was +11 instead of +10.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], \"Eos\" had a +11, +11 enchantment.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], \"Eos\" had a +5, +5 enchantment.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

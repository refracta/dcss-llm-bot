For the removed player race, see [[Centaur]]. For a list of all monstrous centaurs, see [[list of centaurs]].''\n{{monster info|centaur}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Centaurs''' are the bane of low-level, lightly armoured characters. Swift enemies with [[shortbow]]s, they can fire arrows while chasing you down.  They can be found in the [[Dungeon]] (alone early; in packs later) and in themed [[vault]]s within [[the Lair]] and [[Shoals]]. The earliest you can find an [[out-of-depth]] centaur is D:3.\n\nAs an enemy with the [[:Category:Archer flag|archer flag]], centaurs deal up to 7 extra damage with ranged weapons.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Centaurs are fast - only [[Spriggan]]s can naturally outrun one, so retreating beyond a few tiles is usually out of the question. Don't be afraid to burn [[potion]]s, [[scroll]]s, or other consumables against an early centaur.\n*Knowing monster AI is important against centaurs:\n**Centaurs will unwield their bows when the player is in melee range, dealing significantly less damage. Even casters may want to hide around corners and enter melee with them. \n***Note that having a [[summon]] in melee won't stop the centaur from firing at you.\n**Charging in may not be the wisest idea, but remember that monsters can't attack from outside the player's [[line of sight]]. Ducking behind corners, using a [[scroll of fog]], or closing a [[door]] can force the centaur to approach you. In a pinch, a [[potion of attraction]] can pull monsters towards you.\n**Centaurs won't attack you if other hostile monsters are in the way. \n*Centaurs have low willpower/[[HD]], so all sorts of [[Hexes]] and status effects are effective. Successful use of [[Tukima's Dance]] will render them mostly helpless. A [[wand of paralysis]] will disable them, while a [[wand of polymorph]] will usually make them drop the bow. [[Mephitic Cloud]] inflicts confusion, making it very unlikely for a centaur to actually hit you. \n*Be careful when repositioning; if you leave melee range, they'll pull out their bows and resume firing.\n*Your allies can tank the arrows for you. But since your allies might dodge (letting the arrow continue its path), this isn't 100% reliable.\n*Centaurs can pick up items on the ground (if you haven't seen it yet). A centaur with a [[great sword]] is just as dangerous in melee as in range. A D:3 centaur with a [[wand of acid]] or [[wand of quicksilver|quicksilver]] is a nightmare opponent, able to kill you with little counterplay.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], centaurs dealt 10 base damage with their weapon (before the archer flag), but did not have a melee kick attack. This change was to compensate for the hidden weapon penalties removed in this version.  Also, centaurs could rarely be found on D:2.\n:In addition, monsters were limited by [[arrow]] supply, so you could run them out of arrows by [[stair dancing]]."}

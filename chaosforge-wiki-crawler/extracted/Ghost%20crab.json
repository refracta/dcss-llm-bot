{"title":"Ghost crab","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ghost_crab","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ghost crabs''' are aggravating amphibious opponents which flood the battlefield with spectral mist clouds, damaging non-undead targets and summoning [[branch]]-appropriate [[spectral thing]]s to assault you. They are durable enough to take a hit or two, and inflict [[draining]] with their melee attacks, but more often than not simply blast you from the back row while their summons tear you apart. They can be found in [[the Swamp]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Laying down your own clouds will prevent a ghost crab from filling those tiles with spectral mist. A [[scroll of fog]] is your safest bet, and it's easy to lure the thing into your cloud bank so you can take it out at close range. If you have [[poison]] resistance, [[Mephitic Cloud]] also works, and doesn't require using a consumable.\n*Ghost crabs have relatively low [[willpower]], which makes them good targets for [[hex]] spells and [[wands]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], it was possible to create [[derived undead]] from ghost crabs.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], ghost crabs had multi-[[holiness]] ([[:Category:Natural_holiness|Natural]] and [[:Category:Undead_holiness|Undead]]). They weren't susceptible to weapons of [[holy wrath]] or [[Dispel Undead]] and also were vulnerable to [[poison]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], their [[Spectral Cloud|spectral mist]] could heal all [[undead]], including undead players.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], ghost crabs weren't [[amphibious]] and weren't resistant to [[rotting]]."}

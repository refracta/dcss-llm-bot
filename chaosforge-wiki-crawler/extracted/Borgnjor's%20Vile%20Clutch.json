In most cases, the monster will die or escape before the status runs out. If you leave [[line of sight]] of any affected enemies, they are immediately released. \n\n==Resistant Enemies==\nOnly a small number of monsters are not affected by BVC, all of which are also immune to regular types of constriction. They include:\n*[[List of jellies|All slimes and jellies]].\n*[[:Category:insubstantial monsters|Insubstantial]] enemies, including [[wraith]]-type [[undead]], many monsters in [[the Abyss]], and [[orbs of fire]].\n*[[Spiny]] enemies\n\nEnemies over [[deep water]] or [[lava]] are unaffected.\n\n==Strategy==\nBVC is a very versatile spell: You basically now have access to an unlimited number of [[throwing net]]s that cannot only pin but even kill a large number of enemies in a few casts, and has a few specific benefits:\n*Cannot be dodged and is largely irresistible (except for creatures listed above).\n*Significantly reduces the target's EV, making them easier to hit with melee or other destructive spells. This combos well with other [[Earth Magic]] spells, like [[Iron Shot]] or [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]], which both suffer somewhat from low accuracy. \n*Pins the target in place, allowing the player to move away even from fast enemies without [[attacks of opportunity]].\n*Makes the target waste turns trying to escape, similar to nets. Enemies that can reach you will still attack you in melee, but this means BVC's effect will last longer since they're no longer trying to escape. Casters can still cast spells, but at their usual rate - they generally won't cast for every single turn.\n*Destroys whole groups of enemies in corridors, since it affects the whole beam path. Other piercing attacks, like [[javelin]]s, work well in conjunction.\n*Note that unlike [[throwing net]]s, BVC doesn't provide an opportunity for [[stab]]bing attacks.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], BVC's base damage was <code>2d(3.5 + pow/20)</code> per turn. Also, you couldn't constrict [[invisible]] enemies if you didn't have [[see invisible]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], a few more monsters were spiny - [[porcupine]]s, [[torturous demonspawn]], and [[hell sentinel]]s - and thus immune to constriction.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], BVC affected a smite-targeted 3x3 area instead of a beam path.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], [[Necromancer]]s started with BVC, and it did 33% more damage.\n*The spell was added in [[0.21]]."}

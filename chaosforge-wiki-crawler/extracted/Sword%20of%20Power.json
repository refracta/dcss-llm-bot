Particularly hale users will find that power directed into their foes in the form of devastating, though inaccurate, energy bolts.}}\n[[File:Sword_of_power.png]] '''''the +9 sword of Power'''''\n\n+9 [[great sword]]\n<br>When striking in melee, has a <code>10 * HP / 27</code> % chance to fire an inaccurate 1d40 range 4 [[bolt spell|bolt]] in the direction of your target.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-func.h|292}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|zap-data.h|1731}}</ref>\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''sword of Power'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|241}}</ref> is a decent weapon for most high-level [[Long Blades]] users, if they don't mind giving up their off-hand slot. It's especially effective when fighting groups of enemies in straight corridors, as the beams will cut through the creatures standing behind your target.\n\nThis sword reaches its full potential when wielded by robust species ([[Ogre]]s, [[Naga]]s, [[Minotaur]]s, etc.) or characters that can consistently go [[berserk]]. Frail characters, as the flavor suggests, should probably choose a different sword; a +9 [[brand]]ed [[triple sword]] deals similar damage independent of your HP, while a [[demon blade]] or [[double sword]] requires less skill investment and allows you to use a [[shield]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the Sword of Power was a +5 [[vorpal]] great sword.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the Sword of Power was a +0, un[[brand]]ed great sword. Every 10 HP you had increased its enchantment, up to a max of +[[27]].\n*In older versions, the Sword of Power's enchantment would vary from -4, -4 to +20, +20, making it anywhere from distinctly bad to being still worse than a well-branded [[triple sword]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Long blades]]"}

Even without training [[Evocations]], [[Deflect Missiles]] can be tremendously useful for dealing with dangerous ranged attackers; throwing it up before entering an obviously dangerous [[vault]] can make a huge difference, even if it only lasts the length of one fight. With a little training, the others can be useful too. [[Abjuration]] is always appreciated when dealing with summoners capable of calling up [[demon]]ic allies, [[Condensation Shield]] is a decent pre-fight buff when engaging in melee, and [[Cause Fear]] essentially functions as an unlimited supply of [[scrolls of fear]] (a very useful panic button in low [[magic resistance]] [[branch]]es like [[the Lair]] and the [[Spider's Nest]]). Just remember that these three spells will be cast at very low power unless you raise you Evocations skill first!\n\n==History==\nThe rod of warding was removed in [[0.14]]."}

{"title":"Nausea","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Nausea","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n'''Nausea''' is a [[status effect]] that prevents characters from eating food until it wears off. It sometimes occurs when susceptible [[species]] eat a contaminated [[chunk]] of meat.\n\nNauseated characters may only consume food if they are at, or near, [[starving]], but doing so is penalized. Permafood only provides 50% of its normal nutrition, and chunks restore even less (15% - 35%). On top of this, eating any sort of food has a chance of inflicting [[sickness]].\n\n{{crawlquote|''There is something wrong with this meat.'' (Onset of nausea)<br>\n''You can't stomach food right now!'' (Trying to eat while nauseous but not starving)<br>\n''You force it down, but cannot stomach much of it.'' (Eating food while nauseous)<br>\n''That was not very filling.'' (Eating a chunk while nauseous)<br>\n''That was extremely unsatisfying.'' (Eating a chunk while nauseous)<br>\n''You feel ill.'' (Onset of sickness)<br>\n''Your stomach is not as upset anymore, and you want to eat.'' (Nausea ends)}}\n\n==History==\nNausea was introduced in [[0.10]] to prevent tedious workarounds of the sickness status effect, and was removed in [[0.13]] in favor of other food reform ideas.\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

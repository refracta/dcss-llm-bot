She continued to insist on leading her armies from the front even into her dotage, and as her aging body failed her, this coat helped to enhance the healing draughts that kept her alive.}}\n\n[[File:Kryia's mail coat.png]] '''''the +7 Kryia's mail coat'''''\n\n+7 [[scale mail]]\n\nPotionHeal*2<br>\n[[Cold#Cold_Resistance|rC+]]\n\n==Desirability==\nThe ability of '''Kryia's mail coat'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|1483}}</ref> to double healing from potions is of great use up into the midgame, though it's ultimately limited by being a scale mail. Casters will usually wear something lighter to minimize penalties to spellcasting, and fighters will typically want heavier armour that provides better defenses. Hybrids have superior defensive options in [[dragon scales]]. And over time, even the power of doubled [[potions of heal wounds]] starts to wane. Regardless, for a character lacking in cold resistance or relying heavily on healing as a crutch, Kryia's mail coat is very useful.\n\nThis artefact is more likely to spawn in the early game, where it is more likely to be useful. A +7 scale mail is better than a +0 [[plate armour]].\n\n[[Vine Stalker]]s and [[Mummies]] cannot heal from potions and receive no special benefit from this armour.\n\n==History==\n*Early game weighting was added in [[0.28]].\n*Prior to [[0.20]], Kryia's mail coat gave DeviceHeal, which would also double the [[wands of healing]]. Also, the multiplier didn't work on [[Deep Dwarf]] characters.\n*Kryia's mail coat was added in [[0.17]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

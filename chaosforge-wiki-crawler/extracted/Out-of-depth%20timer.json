{"title":"Out-of-depth timer","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Out-of-depth_timer","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\nCrawl sometimes [[monster_generation|generates]] unusually hard '''out of depth''' (OOD) monsters to keep you on your toes. The possibility of out of depth monsters increases the longer you spend on a level (although the overall spawn rate progressively slows after 3,000 turns on that level, stopping altogether at 15,000 turns).\n\n==Mechanics==\nThere are \"moderate\" and \"super\" out of depth monsters, which spawn at different rates.\n\n*Moderate OODs are up to 5 levels out of depth (favoring lower values). Most floors have a flat 14% chance of moderate OOD fuzz for each monster. The chances of moderate OODs ramps up, reaching 100% after 7800 turns.\n*Super OODs are either <code>(2 * floor_level) + 4</code> or <code>floor_level + 2d(27)/2 - 1</code> levels out of depth. They can happen after you reach <code>1400 - (117 * depth)</code> turns. The initial chance is 0.02%. After 3000 turns, the chance increases until reaching 100% at 12000 turns.\n\nThe OOD timer does not apply to [[portal]] vaults, any 1-level branches, [[Zot]], [[Pandemonium]], [[Abyss]], or any of the [[Hell]]s. In addition, OODs do not apply for the first 700 turns on D:1, and are applied less often for 584 turns on D:2.\n\nNote that certain [[vault]]s can place OODs at level generation. They may place random OODs or have a specific set of monsters (e.g. [[death yak]]s on D:8).\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Monster generation]]\n\n==History==\n*As of [[0.21]], monsters no longer spawn over time. Therefore, the out-of-depth timer became obsolete. \n\n[[Category:Monsters|*]]\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

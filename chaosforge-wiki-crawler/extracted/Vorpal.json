Melee weapons with the vorpal brand do extra damage of at least 1 and up to 33% each hit, averaging +16.6%. Ranged weapons do an average of 20% more damage. This bonus is applied after [[AC]], so it has an equal effect for both fast and slow weapons.\n\nVorpal weapons are inferior damage-wise to most other brands, but versatile because nothing can resist the extra damage.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.30]], this brand was replaced with the [[heavy]] brand.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], different types of weapons used different descriptors based on the type of damage they inflicted (\"Piercing\", \"Chopping\", \"Slicing\", \"Crushing\", \"Velocity\", etc.).\n*Prior to [[0.16]], this brand was called \"stabbing\" on short blades.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], this brand increased your damage between 0% and 25% each hit, averaging 12.5%.\n\n{{brands}}\n\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

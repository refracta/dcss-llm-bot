Try to get at least ascensions before the tourney ends (though more are certainly welcome)\n*Get a 15 rune win: Collecting runes for the first time are worth a lot more points than in consecutive games. If possible, go for a 15 rune win; the value of the Hell and Pan runes alone will be worth a tidy bundle.\n*Snipe high value species/backgrounds/gods: The value of a win is very highly dependent on how often your species and background has ascended so far. Winning with the first minotaur of the tournament will be worth a hell of a lot more than winning with the fiftieth. As such, if you haven't won one of the newb-favored species (minotaur, merfolk, gargoyle, vine stalker), backgrounds (fighter, berserker, gladiator), or gods (Okawaru, Trog) early on, you might want to pass up on it. That being said, if you only feel comfortable grabbing a highly valued background using a low-value species, or by playing a low-value god, feel free to do so: when backgrounds get ignored for long enough, cashing in on them can be very worthwhile, even if the species bonus is zero. You can find the current value of species/backgrounds/gods [http://dobrazupa.org/tournament/0.16/species-backgrounds.html here].\n*Nemelex's Choice: Winning Nem's Choice backgrounds is often risky and difficult, but pulling it off grants a very sizable prize. If you see a combo pop up that you know you can win, give it a shot ASAP. Only the first seven winners get rewarded, so it might be worth ignoring them if there's already a few wins registered. There are other banner rewards available; feel free to attempt them, but don't expect them to be easy.\n*Dabble or delve into a Ziggurat: You can earn a chunk of points by entering a Ziggurat and escaping alive. At some point in the tournament, try to make some progress in at least one. Reaching the bottom of it has the best payout by far, but without the proper build, doing so is likely to get you killed (and cost you all the points a win can earn you).\n\n==Useful Links==\n*[http://dobrazupa.org/tournament/0.16/ Tournament Overview]\n*[http://dobrazupa.org/tournament/0.16/teams.html Clan Leaderboard]\n*[http://dobrazupa.org/tournament/0.16/clans/moogledan.html Clan page]\n*[http://dobrazupa.org/tournament/0.16/species-backgrounds.html Current high value class/species]\n*[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23crawlwiki ##crawlwiki IRC chat]\n\n==See Also==\n[[Tournament/TeamWiki archive]]\n\n[[Category:Tournament]]"}

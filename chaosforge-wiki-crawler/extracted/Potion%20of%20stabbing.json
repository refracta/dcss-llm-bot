{"title":"Potion of stabbing","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Potion_of_stabbing","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{item\n |itemtype=Potion\n |name=Potion of Stabbing\n |cost=35\n |weight=4.0\n}}\n\n{{Flavour| A potion which makes the drinker better at attacking unaware enemies, giving attacks against distracted, confused or otherwise unaware creatures a chance to deal increased damage as if the target were completely helpless.}}\n\n'''Potions of stabbing''' grant your character the Stab [[status effect]] for <code>1d40 + 34</code> (more) turns, up to a max of 80. This gives [[stabbing]] attacks you do against creatures that are confused, distracted, blind, netted, etc. a chance of being upgraded to [[sleep]]-level stabs.\n\nThis potion is rather situational -- it can be a significant boon to stealthy characters or those who invest in [[Hexes]], disabling [[wand]]s, or [[summon]]ed allies, but heavily armored brutes, ranged weapon specialists, and pure mages will have few opportunities to make use of the benefits.\n\nAs [[The Shining One]] prevents you from making any stabbing attacks at all, its followers have no use for potions of stabbing. Characters that are lucky enough to have found the [[Spriggan's Knife]] can just use that, as it already provides a more reliable version of this potion's effects.\n\n{{Crawlquote|Quaff Normally: \"You feel ready to backstab.\"<br>Quaff While Stabbing: \"You feel more ready to backstab.\"}}\n\n==History==\n*Removed in [[0.26]], replaced by the [[potion of attraction]].\n*Introduced in [[0.25]], replacing [[potions of agility]].\n\n{{potions}}"}

{"title":"Translocations","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Translocations","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\nThe '''Translocation''' school of magic governs the manipulation of the fabric of space. Practitioners gain access to several useful panic buttons, the ability to travel long distances in an instant, and a number of useful offensive and defensive support spells. While its most powerful spells require significant training to acquire, even its level 1 and 2 spells can be extremely useful, making it a popular school for otherwise magic-free brutes to dabble in.\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n{{spell table by level|Translocation}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{spell sources|Translocation|Book of Displacement,Book of Spatial Translocations,Book of the Warp,There-And-Back Book}}\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Warper]]\n\n==History==\n*[[0.28]] Nerfed [[Blink]] and [[Passage of Golubria]].\n*[[0.27]] Added [[Manifold Assault]].\n*[[0.26]] Removed [[Controlled Blink]], [[Recall]], and [[Shroud of Golubria]].\n*[[0.17]] Removed [[Control Teleport]] and [[Singularity]].\n*[[0.16]] Added Singularity.\n\n\n{{Skills}}\n\n[[Category:Translocations|*]]\n[[Category:Magic skills]]"}

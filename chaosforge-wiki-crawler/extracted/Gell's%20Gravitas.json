This effect could move monsters through ineligible terrain (like [[lava]]), but not into it. It did not affect the caster.\n\n[[Warper]]s started with this spell available.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Gell's Gravitas can do a surprising amount of damage if used in large clusters of enemies, particularly large-sized monsters. Use it on fragile spellcasters out of your direct line of sight to deal with them quickly.\n*Gell's Gravitas can be used to clump multiple enemies into one location, making it an ideal setup for area-of-effect spells such as [[Fireball]], [[Inner Flame]], and [[Freezing Cloud]].\n*Be careful when using this spell around friendly targets. [[Summon]]s will vanish, and other allies, like [[Necromancy]]'s undead, will turn hostile.\n\n==History==\n*Removed in [[0.32]] and replaced with the [[evocable]] [[Gell's gravitambourine]] with a much larger and stronger effect.\n*In [[0.20]], this spell was moved to [[Warper]], from [[Arcane Marksman]]'s book.\n*In [[0.19]], this spell was moved to the [[Book of the Warp]].\n*In [[0.17]], Gell's Gravitas became part of the [[Book of Hinderance]] and the [[Book of Debilitation]], set to level 3 and smite-targeted, but no longer confusing enemies.\n*Gell's Gravitas was added in [[0.16]]."}

In the hands of a skilled person, it also increases resistance to hostile enchantments.}}\n\nA '''staff of enchantment''' is a [[magical staff]] which aids in the casting of [[Charms]] and [[Hexes]]. Equipping it will cause it to auto-identify. Any Charms or Hexes cast while wielding a staff of enchantments will gain a boost to [[spell power]], usually causing it to have a higher success rate and/or last longer (the specific impact of this, if any, depends on the spell). Additionally, the wielder is better protected against resistible magic spells: [[magic resistance]] is increased by an amount dependent on your Charms/Hexes skill.\n\nThe staff can also be used in combat, functioning as a +0, +0 [[staff]]. Unlike some other magical staves, it provides no magical combat effects, but you can still improve your damage output, accuracy, and attack speed through training [[Fighting]] and [[Staves]].\n\n==History==\n*It was removed in [[0.12]].  Temporarily, the enhancer effect could have been found on [[Spear of the Botono]], but with its removal all the effects of the original staff are no longer found in-game.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], the chance of a staff of enchantments auto-identifying when wielded depended on the Charms/Hexes skill of the wielder."}

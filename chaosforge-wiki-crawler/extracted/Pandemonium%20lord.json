Each one is different, with its own set of strengths and weaknesses.}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Pandemonium lords''' ('''pan lords''') are powerful, semi-random [[demon]]s who rule over [[Pandemonium]]. All pan lords have a few things in common: see invisible and demonic resistances. They are otherwise unpredictable, with variable speed, defenses, [[spell]] sets, etc.\n\nIn Pandemonium, there is usually one pan lord per floor, who may be wandering on the floor or placed in a [[vault]]. These vaults can have a 11.1% or 100% chance - depending on the vault - to have the demonic rune. Pan lords also spawn on the [[orb run]], where multiple lords can be on the same floor. In addition, chaos-themed [[Ziggurat]] floors can have many, many pan lords.\n\n==Properties==\nPan lords are semi-randomly generated, but their potential properties, while complex, can be enumerated:<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|ghost.cc|298}}</ref>\n\n===Base properties===\n*HP: <code>100 + 3d50</code> (103-250)\n**Non-casters get 50% more HP.\n*Total defense (AC + EV): 10-49\n**AC: 1-45\n**EV: 1-45\n***Pan lord AC/EV tend to be weighted towards one or the other.\n***Non-casters get +5 AC and +5 EV.\n*HD: <code>10 + 2d10</code> (12-30)\n**Non-casters get +5 HD.\n*Speed:\n**Non-casters: <code>11 + 2d4</code> (13-19)\n**Casters: 33% chance of being speed 10, otherwise <code>8 + 2d5</code> (10-18)\n*Melee damage: one attack, with a maximum damage of <code>20 + 2d20</code> (22-60).\n**Non-casters get +10 damage.\n*Melee attack flavor: 33% chance of having an attack flavor. The table below shows the chance of a given brand being picked:<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|ghost.cc|226}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=1|[[Attack flavour]]s || Chance\n|-\n|[[:Category:Antimagic_flavour|Antimagic]] || 10%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Chaos_flavour|Chaos]] || 10%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Distort_flavour|Distortion]] || 10%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Trample_flavour|Trample]] || 10%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Corrode_flavour|Corrode]] || 5%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Drag_flavour|Drag]] || 5%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Drain_speed_flavour|Drain speed]] || 5%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Electricity_flavour|Electrocution]] || 5%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Ensnare_flavour|Ensnare]] || 5%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Fire_flavour|Flaming]] || 5%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Cold_flavour|Freezing]] || 5%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Pain_flavour|Pain]] || 5%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Vampiric_flavour|Vampirism]] || 5%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Weakness_flavour|Weakness]] || 5%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Drain_experience_flavour|Draining]] || 2.5%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Drown_flavour|Drown]] || 2.5%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Poison_flavour|Venom]] || 2.5%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Drain_intelligence_flavour|Drain Intelligence]] || 1%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Drain_strength_flavour|Drain Strength]] || 1%\n|-\n|[[:Category:Drain_dexterity_flavour|Drain Dexterity]] || 0.5%\n|}\n*Non-casters will always get a melee brand.\n\n===Resistances and Intrinsics===\n*Flight: 2/3 chance.\n*Fire and cold resistance:\n**10% chance of being vulnerable (rF- / rC-)\n**30% chance of having no resistance\n**30% chance of having one level of the resistance (rF+ / rC+)\n**20% chance of having two levels of the resistance (rF++ / rC++)\n**10% chance of being immune (rF+++ / rC+++)\n*Electricity resistance: 60% chance of having a single level of electricity resistance and 10% chance of being immune to electricity.\n*Always have the standard demonic resistances (poison, negative energy, torment) and [[see invisible]].\n\n===Spellcasting===\nPan lords have a 75% chance of being spellcasters. Non-casters gain some bonuses to defenses, melee and speed, as seen above. Pan lords who are spellcasters are given spells from fixed lists.\n\n*Slot 1. 90% chance to get a conjuration spell: [[Call Down Damnation]], [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]], [[Corrosive Bolt]], [[Quicksilver Bolt]], [[Orb of Destruction]], [[Bolt of Devastation]], [[Mindburst]], [[Bolt of Fire]], [[Bolt of Cold]], [[Iron Shot]], [[Poison Arrow]], [[Bolt of Draining]], or [[Lightning Bolt]].\n*Slot 2. 90% chance to get a summoning spell '''or''' an AOE conjuration spell (even chance of each):\n**Summoning spells:\n***[[Haunt]], [[Malign Gateway]], [[Summon Dragon]], [[Summon Horrible Things]], [[Summon Eyeballs]], or [[Summon Vermin]].\n***OR [[Summon Demon]] or [[Summon Greater Demon]].\n***Summoners without Summon (Greater) Demon spell have a 50% chance to get [[Blink Allies Encircling]].\n**AOE conjuration spells: [[Symbol of Torment]], [[Fire Storm]], [[Glaciate]], [[Chain Lightning]], [[Freezing Cloud]], [[Poisonous Cloud]], [[Metal Splinters]], [[Energy Bolt]], [[Orb of Electrocution|Orb of Electricity]], or [[Conjure Ball Lightning]].\n*Slot 3. 50% chance to get a self-enchantment spell: [[Haste]], [[Silence]], [[Invisibility]], [[Blink]], or [[Blink Range]].\n*Slot 4. 50% chance to get a spell from the misc spell list: [[Dispel Undead Range]], [[Paralyse]], [[Sleep]], [[Mass Confusion]], [[Drain Magic]], [[Petrify]], [[Polymorph]], [[Force Lance]], [[Slow]], [[Sentinel's Mark]], or [[Dimension Anchor]].\n\nNon-casters have a 33% chance to get one \"spell\" from the following list: [[Blinkbolt]], [[Blink Close]], or [[Harpoon Shot]].\n\nObviously, this produces widely varied spell lists.  In theory, it could range from a demon possessing only [[Blink]] to a monstrosity with [[Fire Storm]], [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]], [[Haste]], and [[Paralyse]].\n\n==Cloud rings==\n\nNon-casters and casters with AOE conjuration spells have a 1/7 chance to have a ring of [[clouds]]:\n\n*thunder clouds, 22%\n*flame clouds, 22%\n*freezing clouds, 22%\n*clouds of negative energy, 11%\n*clouds of seething chaos, ~6%\n*acidic clouds, ~6%\n*miasma clouds, ~6%\n*mutagenic clouds, ~6%.\n\n==Uniques==\nThere are four [[unique]], fixed Pan lords: \n*{{monsterlink|Cerebov}}, guarding the fiery rune of Zot.\n*{{monsterlink|Gloorx Vloq}}, guarding the dark rune of Zot.\n*{{monsterlink|Lom Lobon}}, guarding the magical rune of Zot.\n*{{monsterlink|Mnoleg}}, guarding the glowing rune of Zot.\n\nOnly Cerebov has loot. The game will alert you when you enter the realm of one of these lords; you can check the milestones by pressing '''?:''' keys to see which lord's realm you have entered. \n\nBe careful: if you leave the level before getting the rune (except through [[banishment]]), you will not be able to get the rune that game, and thus cannot do an all-rune ascension. \n\nShould you pick up the rune on a unique Pan lord's level ''without'' killing them, they will randomly spawn on all subsequent Pan levels and the [[orb run]] until you do kill them.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Checking out a pan lord's stats is highly recommended. You might be up against a brutal [[crystal spear]] + [[Fire Storm]] caster, a very fast [[Silence|Silencing]] pan lord with [[torment]], or a wimp with nothing but [[Drain Magic]].\n*Killing them quickly is entirely appropriate, especially when facing multiple lords at once. \n*Having a spread of resistances helps. [[Fire]]/[[cold]]/[[electricity]] resistance is good against the level 9 spells, [[torment]] resistance is good for all of Pandemonium, and [[willpower]] is essential against their hexes. More unusually, be prepared to wipe out a group of eye-type monsters from [[Summon Eyeballs]] - [[floating eye]]s can paralyse in 2 turns, which can be instant death.\n*Pandemonium lords are not immune to [[throwing net]]s. While a fast panlord may break through quickly, throwing a net is not a bad idea during the [[orb run]].\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.26]], Pan lords got new spells and attack types. Also, some Pan lords have a ring of dangerous [[clouds]] around them.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], Pan lords' spell sets and attack brands were not revealed. Also, followers of [[Elyvilon]] could pacify them.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], Pan lords could cast [[Shatter]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Pan lords had more spells on average, but some of those spells were weaker (e.g. [[Throw Icicle]] or [[Throw Flame]]). Also, non-caster Pan lords didn't have offense and defense bonuses.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Pan lords could not get [[Quicksilver Bolt]] instead of IMB in their second slot, and could not get [[Orb of Electrocution|Orb of Electricity]] in their first slot. Also, the proportion of non-casters was 1/3 instead of 1/4, and not all Pan lords could see invisible.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], demonic runes would continue to spawn even if you already had one, allowing for truly ridiculous high scores.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

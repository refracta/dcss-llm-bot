Having numerous sources of guaranteed heal wounds can bail you out of many possible situations, but that doesn't stop the effects of potentially harmful potions like [[potion of berserk rage|berserk rage]], [[potion of lignification|lignification]], and [[potion of mutation|mutation]]. MP recovery is slightly less desirable, though it will still help any casters in need of an MP boost.\n\nPast the early [[Dungeon]], it is generally more useful to have a plethora of identified escape items than to take advantage of these gloves' ID ability. But no matter what, they are still +1 gloves for characters who have not found another pair to wear yet.\n\nThis artefact is more likely to spawn in the very early game, where its ability is most likely to be useful.\n\n==History==\n*Delatra's gloves were added in [[0.28]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Gloves]]"}

{"title":"Frederick","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Frederick","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Frederick the Flawless''' is a dangerous [[unique]] [[demigod (monster)|demigod]] caster. Although he's only fair in melee combat, the damage output of his spells is on par with [[Cerebov]].\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Depths]]:3-4\n*[[The Vaults]]:2-5\n*[[The Crypt]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Frederick's spells can be brutally powerful. If he manages to get a Spellforged Servitor on the field, he essentially becomes twice as deadly. Frederick is an excellent opponent to use those [[scrolls of silence]] or [[phial of floods]] against. His melee skills may be decent (particularly if he has a weapon with a dangerous brand), but they're much less likely to deal 100+ damage to you in a single turn.\n*Alternatively, try to fight him at at extreme long range, popping spells like [[Freezing Cloud]] and then backing away. If you can hit him with a [[curare]] [[dart]] first, this [[kiting]] process will be even easier.\n*Summons can help block Frederick's Bombard, but they won't stop his Plasma Beam.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Frederick's melee damage will be slightly reduced, 50 -> 44, but he'll get the [[Fighter flag]].}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Frederick had [[Force Lance]], [[Bolt of Cold]], and [[Iron Shot]] instead of Plasma Beam and Bombard. Also, he had less HP, lower HD (21), and a much weaker melee attack (27 damage).\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Frederick had [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] instead of [[Force Lance]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Frederick was known as Frederick the Vigilant, was a [[list of humans|human]] instead of a demigod, and knew [[Invisibility]] instead of Spellforged Servitor.\n*In early versions of ''DCSS'', he was known as Adolf."}

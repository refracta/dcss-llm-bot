{"title":"Earth elemental","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Earth_elemental","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of|elementals}}\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Earth elementals''' are lumbering brutes. They are easily outrun, but are durable, and are immune to most common elements. They appear in [[the Elven Halls]], though [[deep elf elementalist]]s can summon them with [[Awaken Earth]]. You can summon them by using [[Qazlal]]'s Elemental Force (when used on clouds of sparse dust or calcifying dust).\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They are slow. If you find a lone earth elemental, you can easily [[kite]] it.\n*While elemental spellcasters may have a hard time with them, they'll take decent damage from any irresistible spell ([[Irradiate]], [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]], etc.).\n**Don't bother using [[Magic Dart]], [[Sandblast]], or throwing [[stone]]s. The elemental's [[AC]] means that you won't deal much damage with these weak options.\n*Try not to let yourself get surrounded by earth elementals. Each elemental can deal up to 40 damage per hit, so 8 elementals can deal lots of damage. Plus, since they are immune to various elements, monsters can fire [[Lightning Bolt]]s, [[Stunning Burst]]s, [[Fireball]]s, and other elemental spells through them.\n\n== History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], you could summon your own earth elementals by evoking a [[stone of tremors]]."}

I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.”<br>- _The Princess Bride_. 1987}}\n\nThe '''ring of poison resistance''' grants [[poison resistance]] when worn.\n\n==Desirability==\nHaving poison resistance is very useful for certain parts of the game. [[Poison]]ous monsters are a threat from D:2, [[Lair]] is filled with them, and one Lair branch is guaranteed to be poisoned-themed. Even in [[Zot]], some form of rPois is nice to have against [[green draconian]]s and [[golden dragon]]s. Rings of poison resistance are a conveniently swappable way to get it.\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

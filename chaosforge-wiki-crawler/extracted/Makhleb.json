{"title":"Makhleb","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Makhleb","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n[[File:Makhleb_altar.png]] \"Blood and souls for Makhleb!\"''\n{{flavour|Makhleb the Destroyer is a fearsome deity of bloodshed and mortification of the flesh. Followers are expected to cleanse others by inflicting suffering and death on them in Makhleb's name. Dedicated followers may also access the raw energies and hell-spawned servants of chaos, so that they may better break the impure world and its false laws for their evil god's glory.\n\nMakhleb offers followers the ability to unleash bolts of chaotic destruction at the cost of their own health as well as call in help from powerful (if sometimes uncooperative) demons. The most devoted of worshippers will eventually be gifted with knowledge of Infernal Marks, allowing them to ritually brand their own bodies in exchange for one of the Destroyer's many hellish powers.\n\nMakhleb's powers all come with a price in blood. However, Makhleb will grant followers renewed health in return for killing beings of all kinds.\n\nMakhleb likes it when you or your allies kill living beings, you or your allies kill the undead, you or your allies kill demons and you or your allies kill holy beings.}}\n\n'''Makhleb''' is the [[evil]] and [[chaotic]] god of the [[Hell]]s.\n\n==Racial Restrictions==\n[[Demigod]]s may not worship Makhleb (or any other deity).\n\n==Appreciates==\n*You or your allies killing living, undead, holy, or demonic beings (67% or more chance of +1 piety)\n\n==Deprecates==\n*Inactivity: You lose 1 piety per 340 turns, on average (1/17 chance every 20 turns).\n*Abandonment. Your penance counter will be set to 25.\n\n==Given Abilities==\n'''[[Piety|Piety level -]]''': \"Spawn of Chaos\"\n*No abilities.\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level *]]''': \"Disciple of Destruction\"\n*'''Gain Health From Killing''' - When '''you''' kill a monster, you have a piety-dependent chance of healing, with the amount healed based on the monster's [[HD]]. You have a <code>30 + (50 * (max(piety - 30, 130)/130)</code>% chance<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|mon-death.cc|2581}}<br>piety_breakpoint(0) = 1* piety = 30<br>piety_breakpoint(5) = 6* piety = 160</ref> of healing <code>HD/2 + 1d(HD/2) - 0.5</code> hit points.<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|mon-death.cc|2587}}</ref> At max piety, you have an 80% chance to heal an average of <code>3/4 * HD - 0.25</code> HP. This will not trigger if your ally deals the killing blow. (Passive)\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level **]]''': \"Fanfare of Bloodshed\"\n*'''Unleash Destruction''' - Hurl a non-piercing blast of random destructive energy (fire, cold, electricity or negative energy). Damage and accuracy are based on your [[Invocations]] skill. This ability is upgraded at 4*. (6.5% + 2 HP)\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ***]]''': \"Fiendish\"\n*'''Infernal Servant''' - Summons a random demon from the table below for a short time, with Invocations skill increasing the strength. There is a 1/6 chance of additionally spawning a durably summoned hostile demon; when this happens, the friendly demon will be stronger.

(Pain: 2/3 of your current HP)\n\n==Infernal Marks==\nUpon reaching 6*, Makhleb will offer you the choice of three of the following Infernal Marks:\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0;\"\n! Mark !! Description\n|-\n| Mark of Annihilation || Infernal Servant is replaced with '''Globe of Annihilation''', which conjures an [[Orb of Destruction]]-like ball of destructive energy that explodes in a radius based on how far it has traveled (will explode in a 3x3 radius at a point blank collision). The damage type is modified by which type of Destruction you have.\n|-\n| Mark of Atrocity || Unleash Destruction becomes more powerful as you use it consecutively, increasing in power and cost until the fourth use which causes a barrage of random bolts to shoot out at several targets.\n|-\n| Mark of Carnage || Summons from Infernal Servant are summoned next to a random enemy and cause a large blast (dependent on your Destruction type) which only harms enemies.\n|-\n| Mark of Execution || Each melee kill has a chance to temporarily activate the '''Execution''' status, which gives you [[rampage]] and an aux attack that automatically retaliates for attacks that miss you. Doing anything other than attacking will quickly cause the transformation to expire.\n|-\n| Mark of Haemoclasm || Killed enemies have a chance of exploding into gore based on the number of adjacent enemies, which does damage proportional to how much health that enemy had. Enemies killed by this explosion always explode. Does not harm the player.\n|-\n| Mark of the Celebrant || Falling below 50% HP will fire several blood arrows at random targets that do invocations-based damage and always grant healing on kill. Recharges after reaching maximum health. If few enough enemies are present, up to 2 arrows will be deliberately fired per target and the rest will be shot in random directions.\n|-\n| Mark of the Fanatic || Grants the '''Vessel of Slaughter''' ability, which transforms you into a [[demon]] (with standard demonic resistances), giving great boosts to your attacks and defensive abilities, however in exchange you will be dragged down to the Crucible of Flesh after the transformation ends and have to fight XL-dependent demons and paralyzed mortal victims to regain your freedom.\n|-\n| Mark of the Legion || Infernal Servant is replaced with '''Infernal Legion''', which calls in a swarm of weaker demons over time (similarly to [[Dragon's Call]]) picked from the same list but using Invocations/2. You are also able to fire Unleash Destruction through these summons without harming them.\n|-\n| Mark of the Tyrant || Infernal Servant summons have a longer duration, and stronger demons (i.e. [[tier-1 demon]]s) can be summoned at higher invocations. Killing enemies has a chance to grant [[haste]], [[might]], [[regeneration]] or [[brilliance]] to one of your servants.\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0;\"\n!

The greatest punishments are reserved for the strongest sinners; crystal spears and Executioners are hurled with abandon only at those Makhleb finds truly deserving!\n\nMakhleb's wrath lasts for a relatively short duration.}}\n\nUpon desertion, you will occasionally experience one of the two following forms of [[divine retribution]], demons or destruction (equal chance):\n*Makhleb rains destruction upon you, which cannot be avoided by any means. You are instantly struck with one of the following spells, depending on your XL:\n**XL 1-8 (100%), XL 9-13 (50%):\n***[[Throw Flame]], [[Pain]], [[Stone Arrow]], [[Shock]], or [[Spit Acid]]\n**XL 9-13 (50%), XL 14-17 (100%), XL 18-27 (50%):\n***[[Bolt of Fire]], [[Fireball]], [[Lightning Bolt]], [[Sticky Flame]], [[Iron Shot]], [[Bolt of Draining]], or [[Orb of Electricity]]\n**XL 18-27 (50%):\n***[[Fireball]], [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]], [[Orb of Electricity]], [[Flash Freeze]], or [[Ghostly Fireball]]\n*Makhleb sends demons to punish you. The total number of demons is <code>1dXL/5 + 0.8</code>, capped at 6 at XL 25.\n**Starting at XL 7, there's a chance that a Greater Servant of Makhleb will be summoned. There could be up to 6 such demons at XL 27. The rest will be Lesser Servants.\n**Greater Servants include [[executioner]]s, [[green death]]s, [[blizzard demon]]s, [[balrug]]s, and [[cacodemon]]s.\n**Lesser Servants are [[hellwing]]s, [[neqoxec]]s, [[orange demon]]s, [[smoke demon]], and [[ynoxinul]]s.\n\n==Strategy==\nMakhleb offers a powerful summoning ability and a Conjurations ability that has no piety or MP cost. It also offers healing - a small amount at low piety, but significant at 6*. Melee characters appreciate these abilities the most, though all sorts of characters can benefit.\n\nInfernal Servants can be great allies, especially in numbers. Multiple demons are enough to take out threatening enemies, such as [[hydra]]s, in the mid-game. As your Invocations skill increases, you will start to get tier-2 demons, which are strong whether on their own or in groups. But, like with many things in Crawl, it's best to summon your demonic allies ''before'' engaging a tough enemy. If you're already in danger, summoning a hostile demon probably won't help.\n\nThe healing is particularly appreciated by [[Ghoul]]s and bloodless [[Vampire]]s, who have issues healing normally, and [[Djinn]], who use HP to cast their spells. You should not rely entirely on this healing, but it can help you sustain a bit longer during a fight.\n\nUnfortunately, Makhleb doesn't offer great panic buttons. If you're already at low HP, this god won't help much. Also, in order for Makhleb's abilities to be reliable, you'll need a fair bit of Invocations skill. \n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*If you decide to abandon Makhleb for another [[god]], be aware that Makhleb's wrath cannot miss; [[Dodging]], [[Shields]], and [[Repel Missiles#Player sources|Repel Missiles]] won't help. An untimely [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] can bring your game to a sudden end, especially if you have a very low [[HP]] pool.\n\n==History==\n*Makhleb was overhauled in [[0.32]], with the addition of Infernal Marks. Previously, its active abilities were as follows:\n**2* - Minor Destruction - for a fixed cost of 1 HP, cast one of [[Throw Flame]], [[Throw Frost]], [[Vitriol]], [[Stone Arrow]], and [[Pain]] at random\n**3* - Lesser Servant of Makhleb - summon a friendly level 3-4 [[demon]]. At low Invocations, there was a chance the demon could spawn hostile.\n**4* - Greater Destruction - cast one of [[Fireball]], [[Bolt of Cold]], [[Bolt of Draining]], [[Corrosive Bolt]] or [[Lightning Bolt]] at random\n**5* - Greater Servant of Makhleb - summon a friendly level 2 demon or [[Executioner]]. At low to moderate Invocations, the demon could spawn hostile.\n:Also, the chance to heal on kill was <code>piety - 30</code>%, which gave very little healing at low piety and cared about piety beyond the 6* threshold.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Makhleb would heal double HP on kill (<code>HD + 1d(HD) - 1</code>). Major Destruction was weaker and could create [[Fireball]], [[Orb of Electricity]], [[Sticky Flame]], and [[Iron Shot]] instead of [[Corrosive Bolt]] and [[Bolt of Magma]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], the player could sacrifice fresh [[corpse]]s to increase piety.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Makhleb's wrath would consist only of summoning hostile demonic servants.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], Makhleb's abilities cost MP instead of HP.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], Makhleb's Gain Health From Killing ability could also restore your MP. \n*Prior to [[0.8]], [[Chaos Knight]]s could select Mahkleb as a starting god.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{gods}}\n[[Category:Chaotic Gods]]\n[[Category:Evil Gods]]\n[[Category:Crystal Ball Articles]]"}

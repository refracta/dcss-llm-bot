Wherever they go, they generate rain clouds and (more importantly) [[twister]]s which create a [[Tornado]] [[aura]] around them. They can be found in [[the Abyss]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Fighting one is rather like fighting an extremely dangerous [[bat]]; use the same sort of strategy you've developed early in the dungeon.\n*Staying airborne will keep you above the [[shallow water|shallow]] and [[deep water]] that will be generated by their rain clouds.\n*Their storm will eradicate other enemies just as readily as it trounces you. Consider it a freebie.\n*Melee-focused characters that try to charge them will eventually find themselves deposited next to the source of the storm, or they can simply walk out by continually trying to walk away. With high enough AC, this isn't too painful a process, but flimsier characters should try to kill the butterfly from a distance if possible.\n*While chaos butterflies are difficult to hit even without the twisters constantly blowing you around, they're fairly fragile. Unavoidable attacks like [[Fireball]] help, though the various [[cloud]] spells can be tricky to land if there are [[twister]]s around (as their effects will blow the clouds around).\n**They're vulnerable to poison, so if you really don't have anything better, a few shots of [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] will start killing them slowly.\n**Unfortunately, chaos butterflies are immune to [[Airstrike]], one of the best counters for zippy flying monsters.\n\n==Trivia==\nChaos butterflies are a reference to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect Butterfly effect], a popular summarization of chaos theory which states that a small change in the world (such as the flapping of a butterfly's wings) could eventually result in drastic events down the line (such as a raging storm). The Butterfly effect is sped up dramatically in ''Crawl'' for obvious reasons.\n\n==History==\nChaos butterflies were briefly added in [[0.12]], but they were disabled soon after due to flooding issues.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

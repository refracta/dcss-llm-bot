{"title":"Orcish idol","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Orcish_idol","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n{{flavour|An idol of the orc god Beogh.}}\n\n[[File:Orcish_idol.png]]'''Orcish idols''' are [[dungeon features]] associated with [[orc]]s and the worship of the orcish god [[Beogh]]. They can be found most often in the [[Orcish Mines]] (where they will often be found ''en masse'') and anywhere else that orcs congregate to worship Beogh (e.g. near the entrance of the Orcish Mines in the [[Dungeon]]).\n\nThe are notable for being the only obvious [[Statue|statuary]] (non-[[altar]]) which is dedicated to a god. \n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Beogh would smite players who destroyed orcish idols, accompanied by a variety of acrimonious utterances against the player, their race, and their deity. Other gods could protect their followers from the smiting, though.\n:{{crawlquote|The idol screams as its substance crumbles away!}}\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

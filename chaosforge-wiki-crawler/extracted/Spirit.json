It is a slow and timid creature, but as something divine it is sure to be under celestial protection.\n\n----\n\n\"In ancient tales, O friend, thy spirit dwelt;<br>\nThere, from of old, thy childhood passed; and there<br>\nHigh expectation, high delights and deeds,<br>\nThy fluttering heart with hope and terror moved.\"\n\n-Robert Louis Stevenson, \"Et Tu In Arcadia Vixisti\", _Underwoods_. 1887.}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Spirits''' were supposed to be insubstantial, seemingly harmless [[holy]] creatures which did nothing but avoid you, using [[Blink]] to escape in spite of their miserably low speed. After roughly 200 turns of existence, however, they immediately turned into random other holy monsters. They were also protected by [[the Shining One]]; killing a spirit might result in him smiting you for light damage.\n\n<!--spl-bot-begin-->\n==Spells==\n\n{{Spellcaster\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Blink Away]]\n|slot2=[[Blink Away]]\n|slot3=[[Blink Away]]\n|slot4=[[Blink Away]]\n|slot5=[[Blink Away]]\n|slot6=[[Blink Away]]\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n<!--spl-bot-end-->\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nKilling them as spirits guaranteed your safety, but you get more XP from killing pretty much any other holy monster.\n\n==History==\nSpirits were designed and considered for use in ''Crawl'', but were never included in any official release.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

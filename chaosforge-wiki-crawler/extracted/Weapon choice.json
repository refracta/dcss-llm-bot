{"title":"Weapon choice","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Weapon_choice","type":"markdown","data":"***Version [0.31](/0.31 \"0.31\")**: This article **may not be** up to date for the [latest stable release](/0.32 \"0.32\") of Crawl.*\n\n**This article contains advice from other players, which may be subjective, outdated, inaccurate or ill-advised.** Take advice as you see fit, and read at your own risk!\n\n*Crawl* presents the player and character with a potentially bewildering array of **[weapon](/Weapon \"Weapon\") choices**. However, when all the dust clears and the parade of short swords, demon whips, and clubs has passed by, weapons have a few main properties:\n\n- Damage per turn: How much damage a weapon deals, compared to how much time it takes to swing it.\n- Accuracy & Skill: How often you hit, and relatedly, how fast your [species](/Species \"Species\") can learn to use the weapon type effectively.\n- Handedness: One-handed weapons can be wielded with a [shield](/Shield \"Shield\").\n- Special: Most types of weapon have their own unique properties.\n\nIn addition, you must consider various in-game factors, such as \"what weapons are physically available\", \"what skills you have\", and any [artefacts](/Artefact \"Artefact\") you find. If your desired weapon isn't available, for example, you may have to go off-course.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Properties](#Properties)\n\n  - [1.1 Damage per turn](#Damage_per_turn)\n  - [1.2 Accuracy & Skill](#Accuracy_.26_Skill)\n    - [1.2.1 Cross-training](#Cross-training)\n  - [1.3 Handedness](#Handedness)\n  - [1.4 Special](#Special)\n\n- [2 Weapon Types](#Weapon_Types)\n\n  - [2.1 Short Blades](#Short_Blades)\n  - [2.2 Long Blades](#Long_Blades)\n  - [2.3 Maces & Flails](#Maces_.26_Flails)\n  - [2.4 Axes](#Axes)\n  - [2.5 Polearms](#Polearms)\n  - [2.6 Physical Staves](#Physical_Staves)\n  - [2.7 Magical Staves](#Magical_Staves)\n\n- [3 Non-Standard Weapons](#Non-Standard_Weapons)\n\n  - [3.1 Unarmed Combat](#Unarmed_Combat)\n  - [3.2 Ranged Weapons](#Ranged_Weapons)\n\n- [4 An Ingame Approach](#An_Ingame_Approach)\n\n  - [4.1 Early Game](#Early_Game)\n  - [4.2 Mid/Late Game](#Mid.2FLate_Game)\n\n- [5 Judging Artefacts](#Judging_Artefacts)\n\n- [6 Shield or Two-Handed?](#Shield_or_Two-Handed.3F)\n\n- [7 History](#History)\n\n## Properties\n\n### Damage per turn\n\nDamage per turn is simply equal to `average damage / weapon delay`.\n\n**Damage:** A weapon's damage rating (\\~ maximum damage, rounded up) can be viewed in the **[i](/I \"I\")**nventory. You can also see damage rating by looking up (**? / i**) a given weapon. For details on how this is calculated, see [weapon damage](/Weapon_damage \"Weapon damage\"). Note that, as the damage formula is random and rounds down, weapons with weak attacks are a bit weaker than their damage rating suggests.\n\n**Weapon delay:** Weapon delay is how long you swing your weapon. The bigger the delay, the slower you swing. It is equal to:\n\n```\n   Delay = base delay − weapon skill/2\n   IF Unarmed Combat: Delay = base delay - skill/5.4\n```\n\nWeapons have a \"minimum delay\", where skill has no more impact on attack speed (though skill still increases damage/accuracy). This can also be viewed in the inventory. It is usually equal to:\n\n```\n    smaller of: 0.7 OR base delay / 2\n```\n\nWith a few exceptions: [rapiers](/Rapier \"Rapier\") and [quick blades](/Quick_blade \"Quick blade\") are set to 0.5 delay, a few [Ranged Weapons](/Ranged_Weapons \"Ranged Weapons\") are locked to 1.0 delay.\n\nYour delay is displayed in units of [decaAuts](/DecaAut \"DecaAut\") (0.8, 1.1, etc). It is then slowed by a [shield](/Shield \"Shield\"), if wearing one. For [Ranged Weapons](/Ranged_Weapons \"Ranged Weapons\") exclusively, [body armour](/Body_armour \"Body armour\") also slows your attacks down.\n\n### Accuracy & Skill\n\n\"Skill\" comprises of three related, but distinct factors. Other than damage, skill also boosts accuracy and weapon speed. In addition, your [species](/Species \"Species\") may learn some skills faster than others.\n\n**Accuracy:** How likely you are to hit with a weapon. Each weapon has a base accuracy, which is added onto factors from skill, dexterity, and enchantment. See [to-hit](/To-hit \"To-hit\") for how this is calculated.\n\n**Base Delay:** Weapons with a lower base delay are easier to train: they (usually) take less skill to reach mindelay.\n\n**Species Aptitude:** How fast your [species](/Species \"Species\") can learn a given weapon skill. Higher aptitudes mean it takes less skill XP to level up the skill.\n\nOverall, a weapon with high base delay and low accuracy will be hard to use at low skill. The lower your aptitude, the harder it is to get skill levels.\n\n#### Cross-training\n\nCertain weapon skills [cross-train](/Cross-train \"Cross-train\") with each other. If you train one weapon skill, any cross-trained skills will get 40% of the XP for free.\n\n- [Short Blades](/Short_Blades \"Short Blades\") and [Long Blades](/Long_Blades \"Long Blades\") cross-train each other\n- [Axes](/Axes \"Axes\") and [Staves](/Staves \"Staves\") cross-train [Polearms](/Polearms \"Polearms\") and [Maces & Flails](/Maces_%26_Flails \"Maces & Flails\")\n- [Maces & Flails](/Maces_%26_Flails \"Maces & Flails\") and [Polearms](/Polearms \"Polearms\") cross-train [Axes](/Axes \"Axes\") and [Staves](/Staves \"Staves\")\n\n(Axes and Staves don't cross-train each other, neither do Maces & Flails and Polearms.)\n\nWhile it's impractical to rely on cross-training alone, it does make it easier to switch between weapon types, E.g. if you were training Axes and come across an awesome [artefact](/Artefact \"Artefact\") trident, it can be easier to use. It can also give you an out against [hydras](/Hydra \"Hydra\").\n\n### Handedness\n\nWeapons are either one-handed or two-handed. One-handed weapons can be used with a [shield](/Shield \"Shield\"), two-handed weapons can't.\n\nShields provide a significant amount of defense, but come with penalties (slows attack speed, increases spell failure rate). These penalties mitigated by strength and Shields skill. Two-handed weapons, meanwhile, are almost always stronger than their one-handed counterparts. Ultimately, your strength and species' aptitudes should be taken into account.\n\n[Kobolds](/Kobold \"Kobold\") and [Spriggans](/Spriggan \"Spriggan\"), as small species, have trouble wielding certain weapons. For them, some one-handed weapons are two-handed, some two-handed weapons are unusable. [Formicids](/Formicid \"Formicid\") can wield all weapons but [giant clubs](/Giant_club \"Giant club\") with one hand.\n\n### Special\n\nMost weapon types have certain traits that distinguish them from the others:\n\n**Damage boosted by dexterity:**\n\n- [Short Blades](/Short_Blades \"Short Blades\") are weak, but give a bonus to [stab](/Stab \"Stab\") damage, and attack quickly.\n- [Long Blades](/Long_Blades \"Long Blades\") have no special features, but have above average stats.\n- [Ranged Weapons](/Ranged_Weapons \"Ranged Weapons\") can attack from any distance. However, they are weaker, and are heavily penalized for heavy body armour.\n\n**Damage boosted by strength:**\n\n- [Maces & Flails](/Maces_%26_Flails \"Maces & Flails\") have no special features, but have above average stats.\n\n- [Axes](/Axes \"Axes\") have [cleaving](/Cleaving \"Cleaving\"): when attacking, you also hit all other adjacent enemies for 70% damage.\n\n- [Polearms](/Polearms \"Polearms\") have [reaching](/Reaching \"Reaching\"): they can attack from two tiles away, and can even attack behind [allies](/Allies \"Allies\").\n\n- [Staves](/Staves \"Staves\"):\n\n  - Non-magical staves have no special features, but have low base delay relative to their damage output.\n  - Magical staves are weak, but enhance your [spell power](/Spell_power \"Spell power\"), and have special bonus to melee.\n\n- [Unarmed Combat](/Unarmed_Combat \"Unarmed Combat\") is always available. Skill has a strong impact on unarmed combat, but your fists cannot be [enchanted](/Enchant \"Enchant\") or [branded](/Brand \"Brand\").\n\nIn addition, certain weapons cut [hydra](/Hydra \"Hydra\") heads, including: Long Blades, Axes, two-handed Polearms, and lajatangs. Cutting hydra heads is a bad thing unless the weapon has the [flaming](/Flaming \"Flaming\") brand. If you cut a hydra's head, two more will grow back.\n\n## Weapon Types\n\n### [Short Blades](/Short_Blades \"Short Blades\")\n\nHighest aptitudes: +3 ([Kobold](/Kobold \"Kobold\")), +2 ([Merfolk](/Merfolk \"Merfolk\"))\n\nShort Blades are best used for stabbers, whether you're using [Hexes](/Hexes \"Hexes\"), [stealth](/Stealth \"Stealth\"), or [gods](/God \"God\") (namely [Uskayaw](/Uskayaw \"Uskayaw\")) to stab enemies.\n\nWhen not stabbing, Short Blades attack fast, but weak. Thus, they benefit most from sources of \"flat\" damage. For example, you have a chance to make an [auxiliary attack](/Auxiliary_attack \"Auxiliary attack\") *per hit*, no matter how strong it is. Short Blades, swinging faster, activate more auxiliary attacks. However, they are hindered most by [AC](/AC \"AC\"), a flat source of damage reduction. Overall, Short Blades have below average damage output.\n\nNote that an early Short Blade of [venom](/Venom \"Venom\") or [electrocution](/Electrocution \"Electrocution\") can be a boon for the early game. Both venom and elec are flat damage brands, and both daggers and short swords are more likely to have these brands. Even at 0 skill, a dagger of venom can tear monsters before [Lair](/Lair \"Lair\"). (This does not mean you should train Short Blades skill, though. It's the brand that's doing most of the work, not the weapon, so no need to train further.)\n\n**Top Weapons**\n\n- If you have good sources of flat damage, [quick blades](/Quick_blade \"Quick blade\") are the strongest short blade. Daggers might have a higher stab bonus, but since quick blades attack faster, they get more stabs.\n- [Rapiers](/Rapier \"Rapier\") are a lot more common than quick blades. Without a major source of flat damage, they have similar or better damage output than quick blades.\n\n**Advantages**\n\n- Bonus [stab](/Stab \"Stab\") damage. [Daggers](/Dagger \"Dagger\") get an extra boost.\n\n- Fastest, most accurate weapons in the game.\n\n  - Somewhat synergizes with flat damage ([slaying](/Slay \"Slay\"), [might](/Might \"Might\") status, [electrocution](/Electrocution \"Electrocution\"), [auxiliary attacks](/Auxiliary_attack \"Auxiliary attack\")...)\n  - Requires less skill to reach 1.0 delay.\n\n- Cross-trains with Long Blades, which also use dexterity.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n- Low damage without stabbing (even with flat damage)\n  - Especially poor against foes with high [AC](/AC \"AC\").\n\n### [Long Blades](/Long_Blades \"Long Blades\")\n\nHighest aptitudes: +2 ([Barachi](/Barachi \"Barachi\"), [Minotaur](/Minotaur \"Minotaur\"), [Merfolk](/Merfolk \"Merfolk\"))\n\nLong Blades are plain weapons with good stats. They scale with dexterity, so are suited towards [Dodging](/Dodging \"Dodging\")-reliant characters. They also cross-train with Short Blades. However, you shouldn't ignore an awesome [artefact](/Artefact \"Artefact\") Long Blade just because you're a \"heavy armour character\".\n\n**Top Weapons**\n\n- The strongest one-handed Long Blades are [double swords](/Double_sword \"Double sword\") and [demon blades](/Demon_blade \"Demon blade\"). Both are roughly equal to each other. Demon blades are *slightly* better with flat damage, and double swords *slightly* less affected by AC, but the differences are small.\n- The strongest two-handed Long Blade is the [triple sword](/Triple_sword \"Triple sword\").\n\n**Advantages**\n\n- Highest damage melee weapon that uses dexterity.\n- Cross-trains with Short Blades, which also use dexterity and boost stab damage.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n- Characters may prefer a strength-based weapon.\n- Cuts [hydra](/Hydra \"Hydra\") heads.\n\n### [Maces & Flails](/Maces_%26_Flails \"Maces & Flails\")\n\nHighest aptitudes: +2 ([Minotaur](/Minotaur \"Minotaur\")), +1 ([Barachi](/Barachi \"Barachi\"), [Hill Orc](/Hill_Orc \"Hill Orc\"), [Tengu](/Tengu \"Tengu\"))\n\nMaces & Flails have no special gimmick, but have better stats to make up for it (around the same as Long Blades). Unlike Long Blades, Maces & Flails scale with strength.\n\n**Top Weapons**\n\n- The strongest one-handed weapons are [eveningstars](/Eveningstar \"Eveningstar\") and [demon whips](/Demon_whip \"Demon whip\"). Eveningstars are fairly standard melee weapons. Demon whips are fast weapons, so they benefit more from flat damage effects (See [#Short Blades](#Short_Blades) for more).\n- If you are a large species or [Formicid](/Formicid \"Formicid\"), [giant spiked clubs](/Giant_spiked_club \"Giant spiked club\") are the strongest two-handed weapons.\n- For other species, [great maces](/Great_mace \"Great mace\") are the strongest two-handed weapons available.\n\n**Advantages**\n\n- Highest damage melee weapon that uses strength.\n- Cross-trains with Axes & Staves.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n- No cleaving or other special abilities.\n- If not a large species or Formicid, the two-handed options are relatively weak.\n\n### [Axes](/Axes \"Axes\")\n\nHighest aptitudes: +2 ([Minotaur](/Minotaur \"Minotaur\")), +1 ([Barachi](/Barachi \"Barachi\"), [Hill Orc](/Hill_Orc \"Hill Orc\"), [Tengu](/Tengu \"Tengu\"))\n\nAxes have cleaving - when you attack a monster, every other monster adjacent to you is hit for 70% damage. (The original target is still hit for 100% damage.)\n\nEven with an axe, it's good practice to fight 1v1 or in hallways - this way, you avoid taking damage from multiple monsters. That being said, sometimes you'll be forced to fight multiple surrounding monsters at once. For example, you could be swarmed by fast monsters, or encounter a pack with no nearby hallway. In these cases, cleaving is helpful.\n\n**Top Weapons**\n\n- The strongest one-handed weapon is the [broad axe](/Broad_axe \"Broad axe\").\n- The strongest two-handed weapon is the [executioner's axe](/Executioner%27s_axe \"Executioner's axe\").\n\n**Advantages**\n\n- Can cleave to hit multiple enemies.\n- Cross-trains with Polearms and Maces & Flails.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n- The game encourages you to take 1v1 fights, where cleaving doesn't help you.\n- Worse stats compared to other weapons.\n- Cuts hydra heads.\n\n### [Polearms](/Polearms \"Polearms\")\n\nHighest aptitudes: +3 ([Merfolk](/Merfolk \"Merfolk\")), +2 ([Minotaur](/Minotaur \"Minotaur\"))\n\nPolearms have [reaching](/Reaching \"Reaching\") - they can attack from two tiles away, instead of just one. You can attack behind your own [allies](/Allies \"Allies\"), but with a 50% chance to fail. Against most enemies, this lets you get one \"extra\" attack off.\n\n[Spears](/Spear \"Spear\") are the best \"simple\" starting weapons (before considering [aptitudes](/Aptitude \"Aptitude\")). While their damage/turn is slightly worse, the reaching makes up for it. Also, spears can attack <= 1.0 delay with just your starting skill.\n\n**Top Weapons**\n\n- The strongest one-handed weapon is the [demon trident](/Demon_trident \"Demon trident\").\n- The strongest two-handed weapon is the [bardiche](/Bardiche \"Bardiche\").\n\n**Advantages**\n\n- Reaching; allows one extra attack in melee.\n- Synergy with [summons](/Summon \"Summon\"), [allies](/Allies \"Allies\"), [deep water](/Deep_water \"Deep water\"), etc. - you can attack behind them.\n- Cross-trains with Axes and Maces & Flails.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n- Worse stats compared to other weapons.\n- One-handed options can be limited. Until you get demon tridents, the next best weapons are regular [tridents](/Trident \"Trident\").\n  - Small species have no good one-handed options.\n\n### Physical [Staves](/Staves \"Staves\")\n\nHighest aptitudes: +2 ([Minotaur](/Minotaur \"Minotaur\"))\n\n[Quarterstaves](/Quarterstaff \"Quarterstaff\") and [lajatangs](/Lajatang \"Lajatang\") are the two non-magical staves available. Both are \"skill friendly\" - they have a low base delay relative to their damage output. However, both of these weapons aren't very common.\n\n**Advantages**\n\n- Lower base delay (good damage/turn at lower skill)\n- Lajatangs can generate with the [spectral](/Spectral \"Spectral\") and [speed](/Speed_\\(brand\\) \"Speed (brand)\") brands.\n- Cross-trains with Polearms and Maces & Flails.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n- No one-handed options.\n\n- Options in general are limited:\n\n  - Lajatangs are rare.\n  - Quarterstaves are good for the early game, but quickly outclassed.\n\n### [Magical Staves](/Magical_staves \"Magical staves\")\n\nMagical staves' main purpose is to boost the [power](/Spell_power \"Spell power\") of certain spells. They can still be alright melee weapons, though. When using a magical staff in melee, you get a special damage bonus. This bonus scales off your skill in the staff's magic school, as well as [Evocations](/Evocations \"Evocations\"). Magical staves can't be enchanted or branded.\n\n**Advantages**\n\n- Boosts spellpower.\n- Most magical staves provide a resistance.\n- Can be a decent option if you run out of MP..\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n- Weak base type that can't be [enchanted](/Enchant \"Enchant\") or [branded](/Brand \"Brand\").\n- Most magical staves deal elemental damage, and are subject to enemy resistances.\n- Requires magic skill and [Evocations](/Evocations \"Evocations\") to be competent, in addition to Staves skill.\n\n## Non-Standard Weapons\n\n### [Unarmed Combat](/Unarmed_Combat \"Unarmed Combat\")\n\nHighest aptitudes: +1 ([Barachi](/Barachi \"Barachi\"), [Ghoul](/Ghoul \"Ghoul\"), [Hill Orc](/Hill_Orc \"Hill Orc\"), [Minotaur](/Minotaur \"Minotaur\"))\n\nOf course, you don't have to wield a weapon to kill foes; it's perfectly feasible to beat things to death with your fists. Whether or not it's worthwhile largely depends on your build.\n\nThere are a few quirks with Unarmed Combat. Your fists are not a weapon - it cannot be [enchanted](/Enchant \"Enchant\") or [branded](/Brand \"Brand\") by [normal means](/Scroll \"Scroll\"). Also, Unarmed Combat gets more damage from each point of skill. Otherwise, it acts much like the other forms of melee.\n\nThere are two types of character who particularly like Unarmed Combat:\n\n- [Claws](/Claws \"Claws\") - Claws provide a bonus to Unarmed Combat damage. While minor by the late game, species that start with Claws ([Ghouls](/Ghoul \"Ghoul\") and [Trolls](/Troll \"Troll\")) benefit a lot from the early boost.\n- [Shapeshifting](/Shapeshifting \"Shapeshifting\") - [Talismans](/Talisman \"Talisman\") can greatly improve the damage of Unarmed Combat.\n\n**Advantages**\n\n- Always available, no matter how bad RNG is.\n- Starts at 1.0 attack delay and has a minimum delay of 0.5.\n- Can be boosted by [talismans](/Talisman \"Talisman\").\n- Stronger damage bonus from skill.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n- No [enchantment](/Enchant \"Enchant\"), [brand](/Brand \"Brand\"), or [artefact](/Artefact \"Artefact\") properties.\n- At low skill, if you don't have a transformation, Unarmed Combat is relatively weak.\n\n### Ranged Weapons\n\n*Main Article: [Ranged Weapons#Strategy](/Ranged_Weapons#Strategy \"Ranged Weapons\")*\n\nHighest aptitudes: +3 ([Deep Elf](/Deep_Elf \"Deep Elf\"), [Kobold](/Kobold \"Kobold\"))\n\nRanged weapons work quite differently from other weapons. Obviously, they can fire from an entire screen's distance, instead of being limited to melee. They are slowed down by [armour encumbrance](/Encumbrance_rating \"Encumbrance rating\"), so heavy armoured characters are hindered (even with high strength).\n\nThey all scale with [dexterity](/Dexterity \"Dexterity\") rather than strength.\n\n**Top Weapons**\n\n- The strongest one-handed weapon is the [hand cannon](/Hand_cannon \"Hand cannon\").\n- The strongest two-handed weapon is the [triple crossbow](/Triple_crossbow \"Triple crossbow\").\n\n**Advantages**\n\n- Full screen range; multiple \"free\" attacks against melee monsters, able to fight ranged monsters without needing to approach.\n\n- Very common from monsters:\n\n  - [Centaurs](/Centaur_\\(monster\\) \"Centaur (monster)\") and [centaur warriors](/Centaur_warrior \"Centaur warrior\") nearly always have a [shortbow](/Shortbow \"Shortbow\") or [orcbow](/Orcbow \"Orcbow\").\n  - [Kobold blastminers](/Kobold_blastminer \"Kobold blastminer\") often carry [arbalests](/Arbalest \"Arbalest\") and rarely carry [hand cannons](/Hand_cannon \"Hand cannon\").\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n- Most ranged weapons are two-[handed](/Hand \"Hand\").\n- Slowed down significantly by body [armour encumbrance](/Armour_encumbrance \"Armour encumbrance\").\n- Weaker damage output than comparable melee weapons.\n- Arbalests, hand cannons, triple crossbows all have a minimum delay of 1.0.\n\n## An Ingame Approach\n\nWhile knowing about each weapon type is helpful, most of this page so far has been theory. Who cares if a [double sword](/Double_sword \"Double sword\") is technically the best weapon for you - if you don't have one, you don't have one. If you find an amazing [randart](/Randart \"Randart\") mace, you shouldn't ignore it just because you are a \"dexterity character\".\n\n### Early Game\n\nThe biggest factors for weapons at this stage are the weapon's [enchantment](/Enchant \"Enchant\") and [brand](/Brand \"Brand\"), and the weapon's attack delay.\n\n- If you started with a weapon, you should probably use that weapon type over any *plain* (+0, no brand) weapons you find on the floor. E.g. if you start with a +0 hand axe, you shouldn't switch to a +0 mace.\n\n* A weapon with high enchantment and a brand can be worth swapping to. If all you have is a +0 hand axe, a +6 flail {flaming, Int+2} is an upgrade worth using. Both the +6 enchant and the flaming brand greatly increase damage. Plus, in this case, you benefit from [cross-training](/Cross-train \"Cross-train\"). But, even if it was a +6 [falchion](/Falchion \"Falchion\") of flaming (which axes don't cross-train), you might want to consider a swap.\n\n- Brands that deal flat damage - namely [venom](/Venom \"Venom\") and [electrocution](/Electrocution \"Electrocution\") - stand out. Their damage is unaffected by weapon or character strength; Venom is amazing on D:1, but is underwhelming by D:15. Electrocution remains viable for longer, but is still superb for the early Dungeon.\n\n  - Thankfully, these brands are weighted to show up on early weapons, such as [daggers](/Dagger \"Dagger\"), [whips](/Whip \"Whip\"), and [spears](/Spear \"Spear\"). These weapons have high accuracy and low base delay, so they are effective even at 0 skill. (Training Short Blades skill for a dagger of venom is *not* worth it.)\n  - [Distortion](/Distortion \"Distortion\") is even better than electrocution, but with a drawback: if you unwield a distortion weapon, you get nasty side effects.\n\n* If you find an endgame tier weapon early, consider using it, at least for the long-term. For example, [Amaemon](/Amaemon \"Amaemon\") always wields a [demon whip](/Demon_whip \"Demon whip\"), a weapon which is great for an entire 3-rune game. In this case, demon whips don't require a lot of skill, so you can switch to it relatively early.\n\n- A key breakpoint is when you **reach 1.0 weapon delay**. When you're above 1.0 delay, a 100% speed monster can potentially get a double-turn for every weapon swing you make (i.e. 1.1 may effectively round up to 2). After you reach this point, there exists a major cost for switching weapon types. It's not impossible to switch, especially if you have cross-training, but it becomes less desirable to do so.\n\n* You'll want to keep a ranged weapon around, even without any training. Against a melee enemy, you can switch to the ranged weapon, take a few potshots, then switch back to your primary weapon. You should not fight ranged enemies this way, since an untrained weapon fires slowly.\n\n### Mid/Late Game\n\nIf you've finished the [Lair of Beasts](/Lair_of_Beasts \"Lair of Beasts\") as a weapon-user, you probably have a \"main\" weapon type. Keep using it unless you find something especially good.\n\n- There is a point where, once you've invested enough in a weapon skill, you can win the game with said weapon skill. You could find another weapon with better stats... but switching to it would spend valuable XP. Short of finding something like [Wyrmbane](/Wyrmbane \"Wyrmbane\"), the switch probably isn't worth it. This point may occur around 14-16 skill (mindelay for one-handers, 1.0 delay for two-handers), but might be sooner or later depending on the character.\n\n* At this point, you'll often have [scrolls of brand weapon](/Scrolls_of_brand_weapon \"Scrolls of brand weapon\") and [scrolls of enchant weapon](/Scrolls_of_enchant_weapon \"Scrolls of enchant weapon\"), so brand/enchant matters less. The most important factor, as mentioned above, is current skill investment. Then, it is available weapons and available [artefacts](/Artefact \"Artefact\").\n\n- You should save scrolls of brand weapon / scroll of enchant weapon *if you can afford to do so*.\n\n  - If you can comfortably kill enemies, you should preserve these scrolls for a \"top-tier\" weapon of your class. E.g. a one-handed Axe user should save scrolls for a [broad axe](/Broad_axe \"Broad axe\") if possible.\n  - If you do not expect to comfortably kill enemies, you should spend scrolls to increase immediate survival. For example, tackling the Lair branches with a +0 war axe will likely be a rough time. If you don't have a particularly great character, you might want to spend a few boosting scrolls to get past.\n  - If you have a lot of scrolls (\\~3+ brand weapons; 9+ enchant weapons) early on, you can spend them as you please.\n\n## Judging Artefacts\n\n[Artefacts](/Artefact \"Artefact\") may look slick, have a cool name, and a bunch of perks. But when are they good?\n\n- Firstly, look at their enchantment, brand, and base type. A artefact +6 [trident](/Trident \"Trident\") of freezing is still a +6 trident of freezing, except that you can't even [enchant](/Enchant \"Enchant\") it. Whenever this is good is largely dependent on the gamestate: a novice [Merfolk](/Merfolk \"Merfolk\") stuck with a [spear](/Spear \"Spear\") will gladly take it, but its all but useless in combat when compared to a [demon trident](/Demon_trident \"Demon trident\").\n  - As mentioned above, if you've trained significant amounts in another weapon skill, and don't even have cross-training for the artefact, don't consider it. However, in the early game, you won't have significant skill training. Many artefacts - simply due to their high enchantment - will carry you through the early game, and are worth considering. You can swap to the artefact after training, or use it at 0 skill.\n- Some [properties](/Randart#Properties \"Randart\") are dangerous to wield, namely \\*Slow and \\*Rage. It's certainly possible to use weapons with them, though you'll have to be aware of their risks. Other negative properties like \\*Drain and \\*Corrode are much more tolerable in comparison.\n- Small stat modifiers don't matter much; -2 strength is a minimal decrease to damage. However, big modifiers do: +8 strength increases your damage significantly; +10 dexterity will greatly improve [EV](/EV \"EV\"). Also, certain characters might have to beware of [stat zero](/Stat_zero \"Stat zero\").\n- It might be worth keeping a weapon around if it provides some [resistances](/Resistances \"Resistances\"), even if you never use it as a weapon. Against a dangerous elemental opponent, you can wield the resistance-giving weapon, then use [wands](/Wand \"Wand\"), [Throwing](/Throwing \"Throwing\"), and/or [god](/God \"God\") abilities to take it out.\n\n## Shield or Two-Handed?\n\nTwo-handed weapons deal more damage, but shields provide valuable defense. Which should you choose?\n\n- Even when counting unblockable attacks, a trained +8 tower shield can block >50% of all attacks you'll encounter in a game. Note that shields can only block [so many attacks](/Shields#Blocking \"Shields\") in 1 turn, so they are less effective when fighting multiple opponents.\n- Meanwhile, upgrading from a [double sword](/Double_sword \"Double sword\") to a [triple sword](/Triple_sword \"Triple sword\") provides \\~28% more base damage.\n\nAt a glance, taking 30% less attacks and dealing 30% more damage might seem balanced. But in *Crawl*, raw defense is usually more valuable. The extra defense works when you aren't attacking; defense helps you survive an emergency. So, even when considering the Shields skill investment, and the penalties to EV/attack speed, shields are strong. That being said, two-handed is still somewhat viable, especially if you find a good [artefact](/Artefact \"Artefact\"), or have poor aptitude in Shields.\n\nOther things worth noting:\n\n- If you haven't found a shield yet, two-handed weapons lose their main disadvantage. While most of the 'big' two-handers are rare and require a lot of skill, there are a few early game two-handers, like [dire flails](/Dire_flail \"Dire flail\") and [halberds](/Halberd \"Halberd\").\n- If you've invested a lot of Shields skill, stick with one-handed + shields.\n\n## History\n\n- [0.29](/0.29 \"0.29\") [reworked](/Ranged_Weapons#History \"Ranged Weapons\") Ranged Weapons and changed Short/Long Blades and Ranged Weapons to scale with Dex.\n- [0.28](/0.28 \"0.28\") removed Long Blades' [riposte](/Riposte \"Riposte\"). The XP costs for high-level skills were reduced, and the base delay of the biggest weapons in the game was also lowered.\n- [0.27](/0.27 \"0.27\") increased the penalty for wearing [shields](/Shields \"Shields\"), indirectly affecting all one-handed weapons.\n- [0.24](/0.24 \"0.24\") reworked throwing. [Tomahawks](/Tomahawk \"Tomahawk\") as well as [blowguns](/Blowgun \"Blowgun\")/[needles](/Needle \"Needle\") were replaced with boomerangs and darts. Javelins now had innate [penetration](/Penetration \"Penetration\").\n- [0.19](/0.19 \"0.19\") added riposte for Long Blades.\n- [0.15](/0.15 \"0.15\") introduced several new ranged weapons: greatslings, hand crossbows, arbalests, and triple crossbows.\n- [0.12](/0.12 \"0.12\") introduced [cleaving](/Cleaving \"Cleaving\") for Axes. Prior to 0.12, there were two additional forms of handedness: hand-and-a-half weapons and double weapons. These each received further penalties when wielded with a shield, but were otherwise one-handed weapons.\n- [0.10](/0.10 \"0.10\") introduced innate [reaching](/Reaching \"Reaching\") for Polearms.\n\n| [Strategy Guides](/Strategy_guides \"Strategy guides\") |

You can also see damage rating by looking up (<b>? / i</b>) a given weapon. For details on how this is calculated, see <a href=\"/Weapon_damage\" title=\"Weapon damage\">weapon damage</a>. Note that, as the damage formula is random and rounds down, weapons with weak attacks are a bit weaker than their damage rating suggests.\n</p><p><b>Weapon delay:</b> Weapon delay is how long you swing your weapon. The bigger the delay, the slower you swing. It is equal to:\n</p>\n<pre>   Delay = base delay − weapon skill/2\n   IF Unarmed Combat: Delay = base delay - skill/5.4\n</pre>\n<p>Weapons have a \"minimum delay\", where skill has no more impact on attack speed (though skill still increases damage/accuracy). This can also be viewed in the inventory. It is usually equal to:\n</p>\n<pre>    smaller of: 0.7 OR base delay / 2\n</pre>\n<p>With a few exceptions: <a href=\"/Rapier\" title=\"Rapier\">rapiers</a> and <a href=\"/Quick_blade\" title=\"Quick blade\">quick blades</a> are set to 0.5 delay, a few <a href=\"/Ranged_Weapons\" title=\"Ranged Weapons\">Ranged Weapons</a> are locked to 1.0 delay. \n</p><p>Your delay is displayed in units of <a href=\"/DecaAut\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"DecaAut\">decaAuts</a> (0.8, 1.1, etc). It is then slowed by a <a href=\"/Shield\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield\">shield</a>, if wearing one. For <a href=\"/Ranged_Weapons\" title=\"Ranged Weapons\">Ranged Weapons</a> exclusively, <a href=\"/Body_armour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Body armour\">body armour</a> also slows your attacks down. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Accuracy_.26_Skill\">Accuracy &amp; Skill</span></h3>\n<p>\"Skill\" comprises of three related, but distinct factors. Other than damage, skill also boosts accuracy and weapon speed. In addition, your <a href=\"/Species\" title=\"Species\">species</a> may learn some skills faster than others.\n</p><p><b>Accuracy:</b> How likely you are to hit with a weapon. Each weapon has a base accuracy, which is added onto factors from skill, dexterity, and enchantment. See <a href=\"/To-hit\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"To-hit\">to-hit</a> for how this is calculated.\n</p><p><b>Base Delay:</b> Weapons with a lower base delay are easier to train: they (usually) take less skill to reach mindelay. \n</p><p><b>Species Aptitude:</b> How fast your <a href=\"/Species\" title=\"Species\">species</a> can learn a given weapon skill. Higher aptitudes mean it takes less skill XP to level up the skill.\n</p><p>Overall, a weapon with high base delay and low accuracy will be hard to use at low skill. The lower your aptitude, the harder it is to get skill levels.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cross-training\">Cross-training</span></h4>\n<p>Certain weapon skills <a href=\"/Cross-train\" title=\"Cross-train\">cross-train</a> with each other. If you train one weapon skill, any cross-trained skills will get 40% of the XP for free.\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/Short_Blades\" title=\"Short Blades\">Short Blades</a> and <a href=\"/Long_Blades\" title=\"Long Blades\">Long Blades</a> cross-train each other</li>\n<li><a href=\"/Axes\" title=\"Axes\">Axes</a> and <a href=\"/Staves\" title=\"Staves\">Staves</a> cross-train <a href=\"/Polearms\" title=\"Polearms\">Polearms</a> and <a href=\"/Maces_%26_Flails\" title=\"Maces &amp; Flails\">Maces &amp; Flails</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/Maces_%26_Flails\" title=\"Maces &amp; Flails\">Maces &amp; Flails</a> and <a href=\"/Polearms\" title=\"Polearms\">Polearms</a> cross-train <a href=\"/Axes\" title=\"Axes\">Axes</a> and <a href=\"/Staves\" title=\"Staves\">Staves</a></li></ul>\n<p>(Axes and Staves don't cross-train each other, neither do Maces &amp; Flails and Polearms.)\n</p><p>While it's impractical to rely on cross-training alone, it does make it easier to switch between weapon types, E.g. if you were training Axes and come across an awesome <a href=\"/Artefact\" title=\"Artefact\">artefact</a> trident, it can be easier to use. It can also give you an out against <a href=\"/Hydra\" title=\"Hydra\">hydras</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Handedness\">Handedness</span></h3>\n<p>Weapons are either one-handed or two-handed. One-handed weapons can be used with a <a href=\"/Shield\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield\">shield</a>, two-handed weapons can't. \n</p><p>Shields provide a significant amount of defense, but come with penalties (slows attack speed, increases spell failure rate). These penalties mitigated by strength and Shields skill. Two-handed weapons, meanwhile, are almost always stronger than their one-handed counterparts. Ultimately, your strength and species' aptitudes should be taken into account.\n</p><p><a href=\"/Kobold\" title=\"Kobold\">Kobolds</a> and <a href=\"/Spriggan\" title=\"Spriggan\">Spriggans</a>, as small species, have trouble wielding certain weapons. For them, some one-handed weapons are two-handed, some two-handed weapons are unusable. <a href=\"/Formicid\" title=\"Formicid\">Formicids</a> can wield all weapons but <a href=\"/Giant_club\" title=\"Giant club\">giant clubs</a> with one hand.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Special\">Special</span></h3>\n<p>Most weapon types have certain traits that distinguish them from the others:\n</p><p><b>Damage boosted by dexterity:</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/Short_Blades\" title=\"Short Blades\">Short Blades</a> are weak, but give a bonus to <a href=\"/Stab\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stab\">stab</a> damage, and attack quickly.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/Long_Blades\" title=\"Long Blades\">Long Blades</a> have no special features, but have above average stats.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/Ranged_Weapons\" title=\"Ranged Weapons\">Ranged Weapons</a> can attack from any distance. However, they are weaker, and are heavily penalized for heavy body armour.</li></ul>\n<p><b>Damage boosted by strength:</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/Maces_%26_Flails\" title=\"Maces &amp; Flails\">Maces &amp; Flails</a> have no special features, but have above average stats.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/Axes\" title=\"Axes\">Axes</a> have <a href=\"/Cleaving\" title=\"Cleaving\">cleaving</a>: when attacking, you also hit all other adjacent enemies for 70% damage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/Polearms\" title=\"Polearms\">Polearms</a> have <a href=\"/Reaching\" title=\"Reaching\">reaching</a>: they can attack from two tiles away, and can even attack behind <a href=\"/Allies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Allies\">allies</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/Staves\" title=\"Staves\">Staves</a>:\n<ul><li>Non-magical staves have no special features, but have low base delay relative to their damage output.</li>\n<li>Magical staves are weak, but enhance your <a href=\"/Spell_power\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spell power\">spell power</a>, and have special bonus to melee.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"/Unarmed_Combat\" title=\"Unarmed Combat\">Unarmed Combat</a> is always available. Skill has a strong impact on unarmed combat, but your fists cannot be <a href=\"/Enchant\" title=\"Enchant\">enchanted</a> or <a href=\"/Brand\" title=\"Brand\">branded</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>In addition, certain weapons cut <a href=\"/Hydra\" title=\"Hydra\">hydra</a> heads, including: Long Blades, Axes, two-handed Polearms, and lajatangs. Cutting hydra heads is a bad thing unless the weapon has the <a href=\"/Flaming\" title=\"Flaming\">flaming</a> brand. If you cut a hydra's head, two more will grow back.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapon_Types\">Weapon Types</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Short_Blades\"><a href=\"/Short_Blades\" title=\"Short Blades\">Short Blades</a></span></h3>\n<p>Highest aptitudes: +3 (<a href=\"/Kobold\" title=\"Kobold\">Kobold</a>), +2 (<a href=\"/Merfolk\" title=\"Merfolk\">Merfolk</a>)\n</p><p>Short Blades are best used for stabbers, whether you're using <a href=\"/Hexes\" title=\"Hexes\">Hexes</a>, <a href=\"/Stealth\" title=\"Stealth\">stealth</a>, or <a href=\"/God\" title=\"God\">gods</a> (namely <a href=\"/Uskayaw\" title=\"Uskayaw\">Uskayaw</a>) to stab enemies.\n</p><p>When not stabbing, Short Blades attack fast, but weak. Thus, they benefit most from sources of \"flat\" damage. For example, you have a chance to make an <a href=\"/Auxiliary_attack\" title=\"Auxiliary attack\">auxiliary attack</a> <i>per hit</i>, no matter how strong it is. Short Blades, swinging faster, activate more auxiliary attacks. However, they are hindered most by <a href=\"/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a>, a flat source of damage reduction. Overall, Short Blades have below average damage output.\n</p><p>Note that an early Short Blade of <a href=\"/Venom\" title=\"Venom\">venom</a> or <a href=\"/Electrocution\" title=\"Electrocution\">electrocution</a> can be a boon for the early game. Both venom and elec are flat damage brands, and both daggers and short swords are more likely to have these brands. Even at 0 skill, a dagger of venom can tear monsters before <a href=\"/Lair\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lair\">Lair</a>. (This does not mean you should train Short Blades skill, though.

While minor by the late game, species that start with Claws (<a href=\"/Ghoul\" title=\"Ghoul\">Ghouls</a> and <a href=\"/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">Trolls</a>) benefit a lot from the early boost.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/Shapeshifting\" title=\"Shapeshifting\">Shapeshifting</a> - <a href=\"/Talisman\" title=\"Talisman\">Talismans</a> can greatly improve the damage of Unarmed Combat.</li></ul>\n<p><b>Advantages</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Always available, no matter how bad RNG is.</li>\n<li>Starts at 1.0 attack delay and has a minimum delay of 0.5.</li>\n<li>Can be boosted by <a href=\"/Talisman\" title=\"Talisman\">talismans</a>.</li>\n<li>Stronger damage bonus from skill.</li></ul>\n<p><b>Disadvantages</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>No <a href=\"/Enchant\" title=\"Enchant\">enchantment</a>, <a href=\"/Brand\" title=\"Brand\">brand</a>, or <a href=\"/Artefact\" title=\"Artefact\">artefact</a> properties.</li>\n<li>At low skill, if you don't have a transformation, Unarmed Combat is relatively weak.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ranged_Weapons\">Ranged Weapons</span></h3>\n<p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"/Ranged_Weapons#Strategy\" title=\"Ranged Weapons\">Ranged Weapons#Strategy</a></i>\n</p><p>Highest aptitudes: +3 (<a href=\"/Deep_Elf\" title=\"Deep Elf\">Deep Elf</a>, <a href=\"/Kobold\" title=\"Kobold\">Kobold</a>)\n</p><p>Ranged weapons work quite differently from other weapons. Obviously, they can fire from an entire screen's distance, instead of being limited to melee. They are slowed down by <a href=\"/Encumbrance_rating\" title=\"Encumbrance rating\">armour encumbrance</a>, so heavy armoured characters are hindered (even with high strength).\n</p><p>They all scale with <a href=\"/Dexterity\" title=\"Dexterity\">dexterity</a> rather than strength.\n</p><p><b>Top Weapons</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The strongest one-handed weapon is the <a href=\"/Hand_cannon\" title=\"Hand cannon\">hand cannon</a>.</li>\n<li>The strongest two-handed weapon is the <a href=\"/Triple_crossbow\" title=\"Triple crossbow\">triple crossbow</a>.</li></ul>\n<p><b>Advantages</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Full screen range; multiple \"free\" attacks against melee monsters, able to fight ranged monsters without needing to approach.</li>\n<li>Very common from monsters: \n<ul><li><a href=\"/Centaur_(monster)\" title=\"Centaur (monster)\">Centaurs</a> and <a href=\"/Centaur_warrior\" title=\"Centaur warrior\">centaur warriors</a> nearly always have a <a href=\"/Shortbow\" title=\"Shortbow\">shortbow</a> or <a href=\"/Orcbow\" title=\"Orcbow\">orcbow</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/Kobold_blastminer\" title=\"Kobold blastminer\">Kobold blastminers</a> often carry <a href=\"/Arbalest\" title=\"Arbalest\">arbalests</a> and rarely carry <a href=\"/Hand_cannon\" title=\"Hand cannon\">hand cannons</a>.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><b>Disadvantages</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Most ranged weapons are two-<a href=\"/Hand\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hand\">handed</a>.</li>\n<li>Slowed down significantly by body <a href=\"/Armour_encumbrance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Armour encumbrance\">armour encumbrance</a>.</li>\n<li>Weaker damage output than comparable melee weapons.</li>\n<li>Arbalests, hand cannons, triple crossbows all have a minimum delay of 1.0.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"An_Ingame_Approach\">An Ingame Approach</span></h2>\n<p>While knowing about each weapon type is helpful, most of this page so far has been theory. Who cares if a <a href=\"/Double_sword\" title=\"Double sword\">double sword</a> is technically the best weapon for you - if you don't have one, you don't have one. If you find an amazing <a href=\"/Randart\" title=\"Randart\">randart</a> mace, you shouldn't ignore it just because you are a \"dexterity character\".\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_Game\">Early Game</span></h3>\n<p>The biggest factors for weapons at this stage are the weapon's <a href=\"/Enchant\" title=\"Enchant\">enchantment</a> and <a href=\"/Brand\" title=\"Brand\">brand</a>, and the weapon's attack delay.\n</p>\n<ul><li>If you started with a weapon, you should probably use that weapon type over any <i>plain</i> (+0, no brand) weapons you find on the floor. E.g. if you start with a +0 hand axe, you shouldn't switch to a +0 mace.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>A weapon with high enchantment and a brand can be worth swapping to. If all you have is a +0 hand axe, a +6 flail {flaming, Int+2} is an upgrade worth using. Both the +6 enchant and the flaming brand greatly increase damage. Plus, in this case, you benefit from <a href=\"/Cross-train\" title=\"Cross-train\">cross-training</a>. But, even if it was a +6 <a href=\"/Falchion\" title=\"Falchion\">falchion</a> of flaming (which axes don't cross-train), you might want to consider a swap.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Brands that deal flat damage - namely <a href=\"/Venom\" title=\"Venom\">venom</a> and <a href=\"/Electrocution\" title=\"Electrocution\">electrocution</a> - stand out. Their damage is unaffected by weapon or character strength; Venom is amazing on D:1, but is underwhelming by D:15. Electrocution remains viable for longer, but is still superb for the early Dungeon.\n<ul><li>Thankfully, these brands are weighted to show up on early weapons, such as <a href=\"/Dagger\" title=\"Dagger\">daggers</a>, <a href=\"/Whip\" title=\"Whip\">whips</a>, and <a href=\"/Spear\" title=\"Spear\">spears</a>. These weapons have high accuracy and low base delay, so they are effective even at 0 skill. (Training Short Blades skill for a dagger of venom is <i>not</i> worth it.)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/Distortion\" title=\"Distortion\">Distortion</a> is even better than electrocution, but with a drawback: if you unwield a distortion weapon, you get nasty side effects.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>If you find an endgame tier weapon early, consider using it, at least for the long-term. For example, <a href=\"/Amaemon\" title=\"Amaemon\">Amaemon</a> always wields a <a href=\"/Demon_whip\" title=\"Demon whip\">demon whip</a>, a weapon which is great for an entire 3-rune game. In this case, demon whips don't require a lot of skill, so you can switch to it relatively early.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>A key breakpoint is when you <b>reach 1.0 weapon delay</b>. When you're above 1.0 delay, a 100% speed monster can potentially get a double-turn for every weapon swing you make (i.e. 1.1 may effectively round up to 2). After you reach this point, there exists a major cost for switching weapon types. It's not impossible to switch, especially if you have cross-training, but it becomes less desirable to do so.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>You'll want to keep a ranged weapon around, even without any training. Against a melee enemy, you can switch to the ranged weapon, take a few potshots, then switch back to your primary weapon. You should not fight ranged enemies this way, since an untrained weapon fires slowly.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mid.2FLate_Game\">Mid/Late Game</span></h3>\n<p>If you've finished the <a href=\"/Lair_of_Beasts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lair of Beasts\">Lair of Beasts</a> as a weapon-user, you probably have a \"main\" weapon type. Keep using it unless you find something especially good.\n</p>\n<ul><li>There is a point where, once you've invested enough in a weapon skill, you can win the game with said weapon skill. You could find another weapon with better stats... but switching to it would spend valuable XP. Short of finding something like <a href=\"/Wyrmbane\" title=\"Wyrmbane\">Wyrmbane</a>, the switch probably isn't worth it. This point may occur around 14-16 skill (mindelay for one-handers, 1.0 delay for two-handers), but might be sooner or later depending on the character.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>At this point, you'll often have <a href=\"/Scrolls_of_brand_weapon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scrolls of brand weapon\">scrolls of brand weapon</a> and <a href=\"/Scrolls_of_enchant_weapon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scrolls of enchant weapon\">scrolls of enchant weapon</a>, so brand/enchant matters less. The most important factor, as mentioned above, is current skill investment. Then, it is available weapons and available <a href=\"/Artefact\" title=\"Artefact\">artefacts</a>.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>You should save scrolls of brand weapon / scroll of enchant weapon <i>if you can afford to do so</i>.\n<ul><li>If you can comfortably kill enemies, you should preserve these scrolls for a \"top-tier\" weapon of your class. E.g. a one-handed Axe user should save scrolls for a <a href=\"/Broad_axe\" title=\"Broad axe\">broad axe</a> if possible.</li>\n<li>If you do not expect to comfortably kill enemies, you should spend scrolls to increase immediate survival. For example, tackling the Lair branches with a +0 war axe will likely be a rough time. If you don't have a particularly great character, you might want to spend a few boosting scrolls to get past.</li>\n<li>If you have a lot of scrolls (~3+ brand weapons; 9+ enchant weapons) early on, you can spend them as you please.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Judging_Artefacts\">Judging Artefacts</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/Artefact\" title=\"Artefact\">Artefacts</a> may look slick, have a cool name, and a bunch of perks. But when are they good?\n</p>\n<ul><li>Firstly, look at their enchantment, brand, and base type. A artefact +6 <a href=\"/Trident\" title=\"Trident\">trident</a> of freezing is still a +6 trident of freezing, except that you can't even <a href=\"/Enchant\" title=\"Enchant\">enchant</a> it. Whenever this is good is largely dependent on the gamestate: a novice <a href=\"/Merfolk\" title=\"Merfolk\">Merfolk</a> stuck with a <a href=\"/Spear\" title=\"Spear\">spear</a> will gladly take it, but its all but useless in combat when compared to a <a href=\"/Demon_trident\" title=\"Demon trident\">demon trident</a>.\n<ul><li>As mentioned above, if you've trained significant amounts in another weapon skill, and don't even have cross-training for the artefact, don't consider it. However, in the early game, you won't have significant skill training. Many artefacts - simply due to their high enchantment - will carry you through the early game, and are worth considering. You can swap to the artefact after training, or use it at 0 skill.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Some <a href=\"/Randart#Properties\" title=\"Randart\">properties</a> are dangerous to wield, namely *Slow and *Rage. It's certainly possible to use weapons with them, though you'll have to be aware of their risks. Other negative properties like *Drain and *Corrode are much more tolerable in comparison.</li>\n<li>Small stat modifiers don't matter much; -2 strength is a minimal decrease to damage. However, big modifiers do: +8 strength increases your damage significantly; +10 dexterity will greatly improve <a href=\"/EV\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"EV\">EV</a>. Also, certain characters might have to beware of <a href=\"/Stat_zero\" title=\"Stat zero\">stat zero</a>.</li>\n<li>It might be worth keeping a weapon around if it provides some <a href=\"/Resistances\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Resistances\">resistances</a>, even if you never use it as a weapon. Against a dangerous elemental opponent, you can wield the resistance-giving weapon, then use <a href=\"/Wand\" title=\"Wand\">wands</a>, <a href=\"/Throwing\" title=\"Throwing\">Throwing</a>, and/or <a href=\"/God\" title=\"God\">god</a> abilities to take it out.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Shield_or_Two-Handed.3F\">Shield or Two-Handed?</span></h2>\n<p>Two-handed weapons deal more damage, but shields provide valuable defense. Which should you choose?\n</p>\n<ul><li>Even when counting unblockable attacks, a trained +8 tower shield can block &gt;50% of all attacks you'll encounter in a game. Note that shields can only block <a href=\"/Shields#Blocking\" title=\"Shields\">so many attacks</a> in 1 turn, so they are less effective when fighting multiple opponents.</li>\n<li>Meanwhile, upgrading from a <a href=\"/Double_sword\" title=\"Double sword\">double sword</a> to a <a href=\"/Triple_sword\" title=\"Triple sword\">triple sword</a> provides ~28% more base damage.</li></ul>\n<p>At a glance, taking 30% less attacks and dealing 30% more damage might seem balanced. But in <i>Crawl</i>, raw defense is usually more valuable. The extra defense works when you aren't attacking; defense helps you survive an emergency. So, even when considering the Shields skill investment, and the penalties to EV/attack speed, shields are strong. That being said, two-handed is still somewhat viable, especially if you find a good <a href=\"/Artefact\" title=\"Artefact\">artefact</a>, or have poor aptitude in Shields.\n</p><p>Other things worth noting:\n</p>\n<ul><li>If you haven't found a shield yet, two-handed weapons lose their main disadvantage. While most of the 'big' two-handers are rare and require a lot of skill, there are a few early game two-handers, like <a href=\"/Dire_flail\" title=\"Dire flail\">dire flails</a> and <a href=\"/Halberd\" title=\"Halberd\">halberds</a>.</li>\n<li>If you've invested a lot of Shields skill, stick with one-handed + shields.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/0.29\" title=\"0.29\">0.29</a> <a href=\"/Ranged_Weapons#History\" title=\"Ranged Weapons\">reworked</a> Ranged Weapons and changed Short/Long Blades and Ranged Weapons to scale with Dex.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/0.28\" title=\"0.28\">0.28</a> removed Long Blades' <a href=\"/Riposte\" title=\"Riposte\">riposte</a>.

presents the player and character with a potentially bewildering array of '''[[weapon]] choices'''. However, when all the dust clears and the parade of short swords, demon whips, and clubs has passed by, weapons have a few main properties:\n\n*Damage per turn: How much damage a weapon deals, compared to how much time it takes to swing it.\n*Accuracy & Skill: How often you hit, and relatedly, how fast your [[species]] can learn to use the weapon type effectively.\n*Handedness: One-handed weapons can be wielded with a [[shield]].\n*Special: Most types of weapon have their own unique properties.\n\nIn addition, you must consider various in-game factors, such as \"what weapons are physically available\", \"what skills you have\", and any [[artefact]]s you find. If your desired weapon isn't available, for example, you may have to go off-course.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Damage per turn===\nDamage per turn is simply equal to <code>average damage / weapon delay</code>. \n\n'''Damage:''' A weapon's damage rating (~ maximum damage, rounded up) can be viewed in the '''[[i]]'''nventory. You can also see damage rating by looking up ('''? / i''') a given weapon. For details on how this is calculated, see [[weapon damage]]. Note that, as the damage formula is random and rounds down, weapons with weak attacks are a bit weaker than their damage rating suggests.\n\n'''Weapon delay:''' Weapon delay is how long you swing your weapon. The bigger the delay, the slower you swing. It is equal to:\n\n    Delay = base delay − weapon skill/2\n    IF Unarmed Combat: Delay = base delay - skill/5.4\n\nWeapons have a \"minimum delay\", where skill has no more impact on attack speed (though skill still increases damage/accuracy). This can also be viewed in the inventory. It is usually equal to:\n\n     smaller of: 0.7 OR base delay / 2\n\nWith a few exceptions: [[rapier]]s and [[quick blade]]s are set to 0.5 delay, a few [[Ranged Weapons]] are locked to 1.0 delay. \n\nYour delay is displayed in units of [[decaAut]]s (0.8, 1.1, etc). It is then slowed by a [[shield]], if wearing one. For [[Ranged Weapons]] exclusively, [[body armour]] also slows your attacks down. \n\n===Accuracy & Skill===\n\"Skill\" comprises of three related, but distinct factors. Other than damage, skill also boosts accuracy and weapon speed. In addition, your [[species]] may learn some skills faster than others.\n\n'''Accuracy:''' How likely you are to hit with a weapon. Each weapon has a base accuracy, which is added onto factors from skill, dexterity, and enchantment. See [[to-hit]] for how this is calculated.\n\n'''Base Delay:''' Weapons with a lower base delay are easier to train: they (usually) take less skill to reach mindelay. \n\n'''Species Aptitude:''' How fast your [[species]] can learn a given weapon skill. Higher aptitudes mean it takes less skill XP to level up the skill.\n\nOverall, a weapon with high base delay and low accuracy will be hard to use at low skill. The lower your aptitude, the harder it is to get skill levels.\n\n====Cross-training====\nCertain weapon skills [[cross-train]] with each other. If you train one weapon skill, any cross-trained skills will get 40% of the XP for free.\n\n*[[Short Blades]] and [[Long Blades]] cross-train each other\n*[[Axes]] and [[Staves]] cross-train [[Polearms]] and [[Maces & Flails]]\n*[[Maces & Flails]] and [[Polearms]] cross-train [[Axes]] and [[Staves]]\n\n(Axes and Staves don't cross-train each other, neither do Maces & Flails and Polearms.)\n\nWhile it's impractical to rely on cross-training alone, it does make it easier to switch between weapon types, E.g. if you were training Axes and come across an awesome [[artefact]] trident, it can be easier to use. It can also give you an out against [[hydra]]s.\n\n===Handedness===\nWeapons are either one-handed or two-handed. One-handed weapons can be used with a [[shield]], two-handed weapons can't. \n\nShields provide a significant amount of defense, but come with penalties (slows attack speed, increases spell failure rate). These penalties mitigated by strength and Shields skill. Two-handed weapons, meanwhile, are almost always stronger than their one-handed counterparts. Ultimately, your strength and species' aptitudes should be taken into account.\n\n[[Kobold]]s and [[Spriggan]]s, as small species, have trouble wielding certain weapons. For them, some one-handed weapons are two-handed, some two-handed weapons are unusable. [[Formicid]]s can wield all weapons but [[giant club]]s with one hand.\n\n===Special===\nMost weapon types have certain traits that distinguish them from the others:\n\n'''Damage boosted by dexterity:'''\n*[[Short Blades]] are weak, but give a bonus to [[stab]] damage, and attack quickly.\n*[[Long Blades]] have no special features, but have above average stats.\n*[[Ranged Weapons]] can attack from any distance. However, they are weaker, and are heavily penalized for heavy body armour.\n\n'''Damage boosted by strength:'''\n*[[Maces & Flails]] have no special features, but have above average stats.\n*[[Axes]] have [[cleaving]]: when attacking, you also hit all other adjacent enemies for 70% damage.\n*[[Polearms]] have [[reaching]]: they can attack from two tiles away, and can even attack behind [[allies]].\n*[[Staves]]:\n**Non-magical staves have no special features, but have low base delay relative to their damage output.\n**Magical staves are weak, but enhance your [[spell power]], and have special bonus to melee.\n*[[Unarmed Combat]] is always available. Skill has a strong impact on unarmed combat, but your fists cannot be [[enchant]]ed or [[brand]]ed.\n\nIn addition, certain weapons cut [[hydra]] heads, including: Long Blades, Axes, two-handed Polearms, and lajatangs. Cutting hydra heads is a bad thing unless the weapon has the [[flaming]] brand. If you cut a hydra's head, two more will grow back.\n\n==Weapon Types==\n===[[Short Blades]]===\nHighest aptitudes: +3 ([[Kobold]]), +2 ([[Merfolk]])\n\nShort Blades are best used for stabbers, whether you're using [[Hexes]], [[stealth]], or [[god]]s (namely [[Uskayaw]]) to stab enemies.\n\nWhen not stabbing, Short Blades attack fast, but weak. Thus, they benefit most from sources of \"flat\" damage. For example, you have a chance to make an [[auxiliary attack]] ''per hit'', no matter how strong it is. Short Blades, swinging faster, activate more auxiliary attacks. However, they are hindered most by [[AC]], a flat source of damage reduction. Overall, Short Blades have below average damage output.\n\nNote that an early Short Blade of [[venom]] or [[electrocution]] can be a boon for the early game. Both venom and elec are flat damage brands, and both daggers and short swords are more likely to have these brands. Even at 0 skill, a dagger of venom can tear monsters before [[Lair]]. (This does not mean you should train Short Blades skill, though. It's the brand that's doing most of the work, not the weapon, so no need to train further.) \n\n'''Top Weapons'''\n*If you have good sources of flat damage, [[quick blade]]s are the strongest short blade. Daggers might have a higher stab bonus, but since quick blades attack faster, they get more stabs.\n*[[Rapier]]s are a lot more common than quick blades. Without a major source of flat damage, they have similar or better damage output than quick blades.\n\n'''Advantages'''\n*Bonus [[stab]] damage. [[Dagger]]s get an extra boost.\n*Fastest, most accurate weapons in the game. \n**Somewhat synergizes with flat damage ([[slay]]ing, [[might]] status, [[electrocution]], [[auxiliary attack]]s...)\n**Requires less skill to reach 1.0 delay.\n*Cross-trains with Long Blades, which also use dexterity.\n\n'''Disadvantages'''\n*Low damage without stabbing (even with flat damage)\n**Especially poor against foes with high [[AC]].\n\n===[[Long Blades]]===\nHighest aptitudes: +2 ([[Barachi]], [[Minotaur]], [[Merfolk]])\n\nLong Blades are plain weapons with good stats. They scale with dexterity, so are suited towards [[Dodging]]-reliant characters. They also cross-train with Short Blades. However, you shouldn't ignore an awesome [[artefact]] Long Blade just because you're a \"heavy armour character\".\n\n'''Top Weapons'''\n*The strongest one-handed Long Blades are [[double sword]]s and [[demon blade]]s. Both are roughly equal to each other. Demon blades are ''slightly'' better with flat damage, and double swords ''slightly'' less affected by AC, but the differences are small.\n*The strongest two-handed Long Blade is the [[triple sword]]. \n\n'''Advantages'''\n*Highest damage melee weapon that uses dexterity.\n*Cross-trains with Short Blades, which also use dexterity and boost stab damage.\n<!--*There are a couple good sources of Long Blades:\n**[[Efreet]]s and [[Erica]] always spawn with a [[flaming]] scimitar (Good against [[hydra]]s!).\n**[[Wight]]s and [[list of deep elves|deep elves]] may also come with nice Long Blades.-->\n\n'''Disadvantages'''\n*Characters may prefer a strength-based weapon.\n*Cuts [[hydra]] heads.\n\n===[[Maces & Flails]]===\nHighest aptitudes: +2 ([[Minotaur]]), +1 ([[Barachi]], [[Hill Orc]], [[Tengu]])\n\nMaces & Flails have no special gimmick, but have better stats to make up for it (around the same as Long Blades). Unlike Long Blades, Maces & Flails scale with strength.\n\n'''Top Weapons'''\n*The strongest one-handed weapons are [[eveningstar]]s and [[demon whip]]s. Eveningstars are fairly standard melee weapons. Demon whips are fast weapons, so they benefit more from flat damage effects (See [[#Short Blades]] for more).\n*If you are a large species or [[Formicid]], [[giant spiked club]]s are the strongest two-handed weapons.\n*For other species, [[great mace]]s are the strongest two-handed weapons available.\n\n'''Advantages'''\n*Highest damage melee weapon that uses strength.\n*Cross-trains with Axes & Staves.\n\n'''Disadvantages'''\n*No cleaving or other special abilities.\n*If not a large species or Formicid, the two-handed options are relatively weak.\n\n===[[Axes]]===\nHighest aptitudes: +2 ([[Minotaur]]), +1 ([[Barachi]], [[Hill Orc]], [[Tengu]])\n\nAxes have cleaving - when you attack a monster, every other monster adjacent to you is hit for 70% damage. (The original target is still hit for 100% damage.)\n\nEven with an axe, it's good practice to fight 1v1 or in hallways - this way, you avoid taking damage from multiple monsters. That being said, sometimes you'll be forced to fight multiple surrounding monsters at once. For example, you could be swarmed by fast monsters, or encounter a pack with no nearby hallway. In these cases, cleaving is helpful.\n\n'''Top Weapons'''\n*The strongest one-handed weapon is the [[broad axe]].\n*The strongest two-handed weapon is the [[executioner's axe]].\n\n'''Advantages'''\n*Can cleave to hit multiple enemies.\n*Cross-trains with Polearms and Maces & Flails.\n\n'''Disadvantages'''\n*The game encourages you to take 1v1 fights, where cleaving doesn't help you.\n*Worse stats compared to other weapons.\n*Cuts hydra heads.\n\n===[[Polearms]]===\nHighest aptitudes: +3 ([[Merfolk]]), +2 ([[Minotaur]])\n\nPolearms have [[reaching]] - they can attack from two tiles away, instead of just one. You can attack behind your own [[allies]], but with a 50% chance to fail. Against most enemies, this lets you get one \"extra\" attack off.\n\n[[Spear]]s are the best \"simple\" starting weapons (before considering [[aptitude]]s). While their damage/turn is slightly worse, the reaching makes up for it. Also, spears can attack <= 1.0 delay with just your starting skill.\n\n'''Top Weapons'''\n*The strongest one-handed weapon is the [[demon trident]].\n*The strongest two-handed weapon is the [[bardiche]].\n\n'''Advantages'''\n*Reaching; allows one extra attack in melee.\n*Synergy with [[summon]]s, [[allies]], [[deep water]], etc. - you can attack behind them.\n*Cross-trains with Axes and Maces & Flails.\n\n'''Disadvantages'''\n*Worse stats compared to other weapons.\n*One-handed options can be limited. Until you get demon tridents, the next best weapons are regular [[trident]]s.\n**Small species have no good one-handed options.\n\n===Physical [[Staves]]===\nHighest aptitudes: +2 ([[Minotaur]])\n\n[[Quarterstaff|Quarterstaves]] and [[lajatang]]s are the two non-magical staves available. Both are \"skill friendly\" - they have a low base delay relative to their damage output. However, both of these weapons aren't very common.\n\n'''Advantages'''\n*Lower base delay (good damage/turn at lower skill)\n*Lajatangs can generate with the [[spectral]] and [[speed (brand)|speed]] brands.\n*Cross-trains with Polearms and Maces & Flails.\n\n'''Disadvantages'''\n*No one-handed options.\n*Options in general are limited:\n**Lajatangs are rare.\n**Quarterstaves are good for the early game, but quickly outclassed.\n\n===[[Magical staves|Magical Staves]]===\nMagical staves' main purpose is to boost the [[spell power|power]] of certain spells. They can still be alright melee weapons, though. When using a magical staff in melee, you get a special damage bonus. This bonus scales off your skill in the staff's magic school, as well as [[Evocations]]. Magical staves can't be enchanted or branded.\n\n'''Advantages'''\n*Boosts spellpower.\n*Most magical staves provide a resistance.\n*Can be a decent option if you run out of MP..\n\n'''Disadvantages'''\n*Weak base type that can't be [[enchant]]ed or [[brand]]ed.\n*Most magical staves deal elemental damage, and are subject to enemy resistances.\n*Requires magic skill and [[Evocations]] to be competent, in addition to Staves skill.\n\n==Non-Standard Weapons==\n===[[Unarmed Combat]]===\nHighest aptitudes: +1 ([[Barachi]], [[Ghoul]], [[Hill Orc]], [[Minotaur]])\n\nOf course, you don't have to wield a weapon to kill foes; it's perfectly feasible to beat things to death with your fists. Whether or not it's worthwhile largely depends on your build.\n\nThere are a few quirks with Unarmed Combat. Your fists are not a weapon - it cannot be [[enchant]]ed or [[brand]]ed by [[scroll|normal means]]. Also, Unarmed Combat gets more damage from each point of skill. Otherwise, it acts much like the other forms of melee.\n\nThere are two types of character who particularly like Unarmed Combat:\n*[[Claws]] - Claws provide a bonus to Unarmed Combat damage. While minor by the late game, species that start with Claws ([[Ghoul]]s and [[Troll]]s) benefit a lot from the early boost.\n*[[Shapeshifting]] - [[Talisman]]s can greatly improve the damage of Unarmed Combat.\n\n'''Advantages'''\n*Always available, no matter how bad RNG is.\n*Starts at 1.0 attack delay and has a minimum delay of 0.5.\n*Can be boosted by [[talisman]]s.\n*Stronger damage bonus from skill.\n\n'''Disadvantages'''\n*No [[enchant]]ment, [[brand]], or [[artefact]] properties.\n*At low skill, if you don't have a transformation, Unarmed Combat is relatively weak.\n\n===Ranged Weapons===\n''Main Article: [[Ranged Weapons#Strategy]]''\n\nHighest aptitudes: +3 ([[Deep Elf]], [[Kobold]])\n\nRanged weapons work quite differently from other weapons. Obviously, they can fire from an entire screen's distance, instead of being limited to melee. They are slowed down by [[encumbrance rating|armour encumbrance]], so heavy armoured characters are hindered (even with high strength).\n\nThey all scale with [[dexterity]] rather than strength.\n\n'''Top Weapons'''\n*The strongest one-handed weapon is the [[hand cannon]].\n*The strongest two-handed weapon is the [[triple crossbow]].\n\n'''Advantages'''\n*Full screen range; multiple \"free\" attacks against melee monsters, able to fight ranged monsters without needing to approach.\n*Very common from monsters: \n**[[Centaur (monster)|Centaurs]] and [[centaur warrior]]s nearly always have a [[shortbow]] or [[orcbow]].\n**[[Kobold blastminer]]s often carry [[arbalest]]s and rarely carry [[hand cannon]]s.\n\n'''Disadvantages'''\n*Most ranged weapons are two-[[hand]]ed.\n*Slowed down significantly by body [[armour encumbrance]].\n*Weaker damage output than comparable melee weapons.\n*Arbalests, hand cannons, triple crossbows all have a minimum delay of 1.0.\n\n==An Ingame Approach==\nWhile knowing about each weapon type is helpful, most of this page so far has been theory. Who cares if a [[double sword]] is technically the best weapon for you - if you don't have one, you don't have one. If you find an amazing [[randart]] mace, you shouldn't ignore it just because you are a \"dexterity character\".\n\n===Early Game===\nThe biggest factors for weapons at this stage are the weapon's [[enchant]]ment and [[brand]], and the weapon's attack delay.\n\n*If you started with a weapon, you should probably use that weapon type over any ''plain'' (+0, no brand) weapons you find on the floor. E.g. if you start with a +0 hand axe, you shouldn't switch to a +0 mace.\n\n*A weapon with high enchantment and a brand can be worth swapping to. If all you have is a +0 hand axe, a +6 flail {flaming, Int+2} is an upgrade worth using. Both the +6 enchant and the flaming brand greatly increase damage. Plus, in this case, you benefit from [[cross-train]]ing. But, even if it was a +6 [[falchion]] of flaming (which axes don't cross-train), you might want to consider a swap.\n\n*Brands that deal flat damage - namely [[venom]] and [[electrocution]] - stand out. Their damage is unaffected by weapon or character strength; Venom is amazing on D:1, but is underwhelming by D:15. Electrocution remains viable for longer, but is still superb for the early Dungeon.\n**Thankfully, these brands are weighted to show up on early weapons, such as [[dagger]]s, [[whip]]s, and [[spear]]s. These weapons have high accuracy and low base delay, so they are effective even at 0 skill. (Training Short Blades skill for a dagger of venom is ''not'' worth it.)\n**[[Distortion]] is even better than electrocution, but with a drawback: if you unwield a distortion weapon, you get nasty side effects.\n\n*If you find an endgame tier weapon early, consider using it, at least for the long-term. For example, [[Amaemon]] always wields a [[demon whip]], a weapon which is great for an entire 3-rune game. In this case, demon whips don't require a lot of skill, so you can switch to it relatively early.\n\n*A key breakpoint is when you '''reach 1.0 weapon delay'''. When you're above 1.0 delay, a 100% speed monster can potentially get a double-turn for every weapon swing you make (i.e. 1.1 may effectively round up to 2). After you reach this point, there exists a major cost for switching weapon types. It's not impossible to switch, especially if you have cross-training, but it becomes less desirable to do so.\n\n*You'll want to keep a ranged weapon around, even without any training. Against a melee enemy, you can switch to the ranged weapon, take a few potshots, then switch back to your primary weapon. You should not fight ranged enemies this way, since an untrained weapon fires slowly.\n\n===Mid/Late Game===\nIf you've finished the [[Lair of Beasts]] as a weapon-user, you probably have a \"main\" weapon type. Keep using it unless you find something especially good.\n\n*There is a point where, once you've invested enough in a weapon skill, you can win the game with said weapon skill. You could find another weapon with better stats... but switching to it would spend valuable XP. Short of finding something like [[Wyrmbane]], the switch probably isn't worth it. This point may occur around 14-16 skill (mindelay for one-handers, 1.0 delay for two-handers), but might be sooner or later depending on the character.\n\n*At this point, you'll often have [[scrolls of brand weapon]] and [[scrolls of enchant weapon]], so brand/enchant matters less. The most important factor, as mentioned above, is current skill investment. Then, it is available weapons and available [[artefact]]s.\n\n*You should save scrolls of brand weapon / scroll of enchant weapon ''if you can afford to do so''.\n**If you can comfortably kill enemies, you should preserve these scrolls for a \"top-tier\" weapon of your class. E.g. a one-handed Axe user should save scrolls for a [[broad axe]] if possible.\n**If you do not expect to comfortably kill enemies, you should spend scrolls to increase immediate survival. For example, tackling the Lair branches with a +0 war axe will likely be a rough time. If you don't have a particularly great character, you might want to spend a few boosting scrolls to get past.\n**If you have a lot of scrolls (~3+ brand weapons; 9+ enchant weapons) early on, you can spend them as you please.\n\n==Judging Artefacts==\n[[Artefact]]s may look slick, have a cool name, and a bunch of perks. But when are they good?\n*Firstly, look at their enchantment, brand, and base type. A artefact +6 [[trident]] of freezing is still a +6 trident of freezing, except that you can't even [[enchant]] it. Whenever this is good is largely dependent on the gamestate: a novice [[Merfolk]] stuck with a [[spear]] will gladly take it, but its all but useless in combat when compared to a [[demon trident]].\n**As mentioned above, if you've trained significant amounts in another weapon skill, and don't even have cross-training for the artefact, don't consider it. However, in the early game, you won't have significant skill training. Many artefacts - simply due to their high enchantment - will carry you through the early game, and are worth considering. You can swap to the artefact after training, or use it at 0 skill.\n*Some [[Randart#Properties|properties]] are dangerous to wield, namely *Slow and *Rage. It's certainly possible to use weapons with them, though you'll have to be aware of their risks. Other negative properties like *Drain and *Corrode are much more tolerable in comparison.\n*Small stat modifiers don't matter much; -2 strength is a minimal decrease to damage. However, big modifiers do: +8 strength increases your damage significantly; +10 dexterity will greatly improve [[EV]]. Also, certain characters might have to beware of [[stat zero]].\n*It might be worth keeping a weapon around if it provides some [[resistances]], even if you never use it as a weapon. Against a dangerous elemental opponent, you can wield the resistance-giving weapon, then use [[wand]]s, [[Throwing]], and/or [[god]] abilities to take it out.\n\n==Shield or Two-Handed?==\nTwo-handed weapons deal more damage, but shields provide valuable defense. Which should you choose?\n\n*Even when counting unblockable attacks, a trained +8 tower shield can block >50% of all attacks you'll encounter in a game. Note that shields can only block [[Shields#Blocking|so many attacks]] in 1 turn, so they are less effective when fighting multiple opponents.\n*Meanwhile, upgrading from a [[double sword]] to a [[triple sword]] provides ~28% more base damage.\n\nAt a glance, taking 30% less attacks and dealing 30% more damage might seem balanced. But in ''Crawl'', raw defense is usually more valuable. The extra defense works when you aren't attacking; defense helps you survive an emergency. So, even when considering the Shields skill investment, and the penalties to EV/attack speed, shields are strong. That being said, two-handed is still somewhat viable, especially if you find a good [[artefact]], or have poor aptitude in Shields.\n\nOther things worth noting:\n*If you haven't found a shield yet, two-handed weapons lose their main disadvantage. While most of the 'big' two-handers are rare and require a lot of skill, there are a few early game two-handers, like [[dire flail]]s and [[halberd]]s.\n*If you've invested a lot of Shields skill, stick with one-handed + shields.\n\n==History==\n*[[0.29]] [[Ranged Weapons#History|reworked]] Ranged Weapons and changed Short/Long Blades and Ranged Weapons to scale with Dex.\n*[[0.28]] removed Long Blades' [[riposte]]. The XP costs for high-level skills were reduced, and the base delay of the biggest weapons in the game was also lowered.\n*[[0.27]] increased the penalty for wearing [[shields]], indirectly affecting all one-handed weapons.\n*[[0.24]] reworked throwing. [[Tomahawk]]s as well as [[blowgun]]s/[[needle]]s were replaced with boomerangs and darts. Javelins now had innate [[penetration]].\n*[[0.19]] added riposte for Long Blades.\n*[[0.15]] introduced several new ranged weapons: greatslings, hand crossbows, arbalests, and triple crossbows.\n*[[0.12]] introduced [[cleaving]] for Axes. Prior to 0.12, there were two additional forms of handedness: hand-and-a-half weapons and double weapons. These each received further penalties when wielded with a shield, but were otherwise one-handed weapons.\n*[[0.10]] introduced innate [[reaching]] for Polearms.\n\n{{Guides}}\n{{weapons}}\n\n[[Category:Weapons]]\n[[Category:Strategy]]"}

{"title":"Seraph","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Seraph","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | holy monsters}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Seraphim''' are flying [[holy]] beings, the rugged, upgraded version of [[angel]]s. They have a big [[HP]] pool, can [[summon]] multiple holy beings at once, and share injury with allies. They always generate with a highly-enchanted [[flaming]] [[great sword]], and either [[pearl dragon scales]] or [[fire dragon scales]]. \n\nThey are extremely rare, only appearing once per holy-themed [[Pandemonium]] floor or very rarely in the [[orb run]]. However, they are not [[unique]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Strategy==\n*Obviously, seraphim are more dangerous to [[undead]] and [[Demonspawn]] players. If you're vulnerable to holy, consider skipping holy pan.\n*If a seraph is using [[Injury Bond]], it's highly vulnerable to area-of-effect attacks.\n**Despite the fact that seraphim are immune to fire, [[Ignition]] can deal great damage via Injury Bond's damage sharing (given it has enough allies nearby).\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.16]], seraphim received a new, much more powerful spell list. They also began spawning during the Orb run (albeit rarely).\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Seraphim (and all other holy creatures) would potentially be neutral toward worshipers of [[good gods]]."}

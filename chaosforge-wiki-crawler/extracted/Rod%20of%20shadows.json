{"title":"Rod of shadows","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Rod_of_shadows","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|A rod that weaves creatures from shadows and ethereal matter.}}\n\nEvoking the '''rod of shadows''' summons randomly selected [[shadow creatures]] into existence through the [[Weave Shadows]] spell.\n\nWeave Shadows is similar to [[Shadow Creatures]], but instead of summoning monsters specific to your current [[branch]], it spawns monsters from a [[Dungeon]] or [[Depths]] floor. The higher your spell power, the deeper the floor.\n\n==Strategy==\nAt low levels of Evocations, you'll be summoning [[goblin]]s and [[worm]]s. Don't expect much from this unless you're willing to put in the necessary training.\n\n==History==\n* The rod of shadows was removed along with all other [[rods]] in [[0.20]].\n* Prior to [[0.16]], Weave Shadows could not spawn enemies from the Depths.\n* The rod of shadows was introduced in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Rod]]"}

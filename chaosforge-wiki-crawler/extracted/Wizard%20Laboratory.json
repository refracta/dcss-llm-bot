{"title":"Wizard Laboratory","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wizard_Laboratory","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n{{flavour|In ages past, the most powerful mages — many of whom you may have heard of — would frequently find or construct small realms sealed off from the rest of the world, where they could isolate themselves in the pursuit of ever-greater magical knowledge and power. The mages are long gone, but many of their arcane laboratories still exist, filled with the results of their experiments. Those willing to explore these laboratories may find powerful magical treasure, but be warned: the wizards to whom these labs belonged to deserved their reputations.}}\n\n'''Wizard Laboratories''' (or '''Wizlabs''') are a collection of different [[portal]] levels, most of which are themed around and named after a particular wizard mentioned elsewhere in the game. Each contains a significant amount of loot, as well as unique challenges and enemies found nowhere else in the game. Only one wizard laboratory can generate per game, and not all games are guaranteed to have one. \n\nWizlabs can be found in timed portals around [[the Depths]], [[the Vaults]], [[the Crypt]], and [[the Elven Halls]].\n\n===List of Wizard Laboratories===\n*[[File:Wizard_(monster).png]] '''[[Alistair's Party Mansion]]''' - The party of the century, featuring many a wizard.\n*[[File:Halazid warlock.png]] '''[[Borgnjor's Mausoleum]]''' - A cemetery filled with the undead, who rise as [[lost soul]]s when killed.\n*[[File:Cigotuvis monster.png]] '''[[Cigotuvi's Fleshworks]]''' - Twisting halls full of the results of twisted experiments.

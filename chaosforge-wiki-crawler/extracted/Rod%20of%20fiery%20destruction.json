Like all [[rod]]s, its effectiveness rises with your [[Evocations]] skill. [[Throw Flame]] is a fairly weak single enemy spell, [[Fireball]] creates a powerful, unavoidable 3Ã—3 burst of [[fire]], and [[Bolt of Fire]] shoots a powerful jet of fire that can hit multiple enemies in a row. Although useful, its two most desirable spells have a heavy [[hunger]] cost.\n\n==History==\nRods of fiery destruction were added in [[0.13]].\n\nIn [[0.14]], the rod of fiery destruction was replaced with the [[rod of ignition]]."}

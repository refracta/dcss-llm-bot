It is a cunning pack hunter, running freely with its kin between the realms of waking and dream. The sound of its howl is a dire portent, for it heralds the start of a wild hunt â€“ one cry answered by another and another until voices beyond count seem to fill the air from all directions.}}\n\n<!--monster-bot-end-->\n\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Spirit wolves''' are the strongest [[list of canines|canines]] you can find, and easily the most obnoxious. While they aren't that much beefier than standard wolves, they are as difficult to hit as [[blink frog]]s, and if one should find you it will howl for its pack, causing more spirit wolves to generate continuously just beyond your [[line of sight]]. These spirit wolves, which are worth some experience, will continue to attack you even if you kill the original spirit wolf. The total number of spirit wolves that can be called in a game is finite. When the effect ends, the spirit wolves in your line of sight will continue to attack you, while the ones you can't see will be saved for later encounters. Spirit wolves can be found in the [[Enchanted Forest]].\n\nAbilities: [[Spirit Howl]]\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Keep an eye on the Howl [[status effect]] they inflict you with; even if you finish off all the wolves currently visible, more will continue to show up as long as the status effect remains. Wait it out unless you feel comfortable handling the wolves and any other random opponenets you might stumble upon.\n\n==History==\nSpirit wolves were considered for inclusion in [[0.14]], and for a while could be encountered in [[trunk]].  However, they were removed before that version, and therefore were not included in any stable release."}

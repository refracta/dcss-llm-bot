{"title":"Water elemental","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Water_elemental","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Water elementals''' are animate blobs of water, surging toward their foes and drowning the unwary. Their melee attacks [[engulf]] the victim, which deals [[asphyxiation]] damage over time and [[silence]]s you. Moving away or killing the engulfer ends the effect. Players that are [[unbreathing]] (the [[undead]], [[Gargoyle]], [[Djinn]]) or [[amphibious]] ([[Merfolk]], [[Octopode]], [[Barachim]]) are immune to the effects of engulf.\n\nWater elementals can be found throughout [[the Shoals]] and [[Cocytus]], and in some water-based vaults in [[the Dungeon]] and [[the Depths]]. They can also be summoned by monsters through the [[Summon Water Elementals]] spell. Players can summon them when [[Qazlal]]'s Elemental Force affects [[freezing vapour]]s or rain clouds.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Unless you're immune to engulfing, avoid mindlessly [[tab]]bing through water elementals. Once they've engulfed you, you can't use [[scroll]]s, [[god]] abilities, or spells to escape, which can be deadly if other monsters are around. \n*Their [[electricity]] resistance makes it difficult for [[Air Magic]]-users to take them out, though [[Airstrike]] is a perfectly acceptable method for defeating them.\n*Keep in mind that they move much faster when in water.\n*Water elementals are weak to [[Fire Magic]] or other sources of fire damage. Casting fire spells at a water elemental that is currently standing in water is particularly effective, as the [[steam]] this generates will do even more damage.\n*Water elementals are not [[insubstantial]]; they can be [[constrict]]ed, [[petrified]] by [[clouds]] of calcifying dust, and hit by [[throwing net]]s.\n\n==History==\n*Prior [[0.22]], the Engulf status slowed movement but did not block god abilities.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], water elementals had normal melee attacks."}

Not as folly, but as distraction. Initiates of Ru can open channels to the powers underlying the visible world by renouncing the fetters that bind them here. These sacrifices are not made to Ru, but rather given up freely and permanently. Initiates can redirect would-be attackers and retaliate against their enemies, replenish their health and magic, perform a mighty leap, and unleash a massive wave of power against foes.Ru leads you to gain immense power which initially will cause foes to falter and become stricken with maladies if they harm you. As you make further sacrifices, you will be able to draw on this power to restore your health and magic and make a lightning-fast explosive leap. Exceptional sacrificiants can unleash their power in a massive strike against all their foes.Once you begin worship, Ru will monitor your progress as you explore the dungeon and defeat its inhabitants. Ru will, on judging you ready, offer you three sacrifices which you can make in order to achieve greater power.Ru likes it when you make personal sacrifices. |\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Racial Restrictions](#Racial_Restrictions)\n- [2 Appreciates](#Appreciates)\n- [3 Deprecates](#Deprecates)\n- [4 Given Abilities](#Given_Abilities)\n- [5 Punishments](#Punishments)\n- [6 Strategy](#Strategy)\n  - [6.1 Tips and Tricks](#Tips_and_Tricks)\n- [7 Sacrifices](#Sacrifices)\n- [8 History](#History)\n- [9 References](#References)\n\n## Racial Restrictions\n\n[Demigods](/Demigod \"Demigod\") are prohibited from worshiping Ru (or any other god).\n\n## Appreciates\n\n- Making sacrifices. The amount of piety granted per sacrifice varies depending on the significance of the sacrifice (sacrificing a hand grants much more piety than sacrificing purity by gaining dopiness).\n  - As Ru's piety system is unusual, [monks](/Monk \"Monk\") are offered a near immediate choice of sacrifices upon converting.\n\n## Deprecates\n\n- Nothing. You can't offend Ru, Ru has no penance, and inflicts no wrath for leaving. However, you lose the benefits of worshiping Ru while retaining all the drawbacks of your sacrifices (they are not undone).\n\n* Piety with Ru does not decrease.\n\n## Given Abilities\n\n**[Piety level -](/Piety \"Piety\")**: \"Questioner\"\n\n- **Make Sacrifice** - As you explore and kill, Ru will periodically offer you a batch of 3 sacrifice options, available as in the Abilities menu. Sacrifices will *permanently* handicap your character, but grant you piety. The exact amount of piety received varies depending on how serious the effect is on your character. See the **[Sacrifices](#Sacrifices)** section below for more details.\n  - New sacrifices will be offered periodically, and will refresh faster after you accept one than if you simply let a set of three sit unused. You can reject offered sacrifices, which will result in a new set being offered after a similar delay to accepting one.\n\n**[Piety level \\*](/Piety \"Piety\")**: \"Initiate\"\n\n- **Aura of Power** - Any enemy that attacks you may instead falter or redirect its attack to itself or another target. The chance of this rises linearly with piety, reaching a 10% chance of faltering and 5% chance of redirecting at max piety. (Passive)\n\n**[Piety level \\*\\*](/Piety \"Piety\")**: \"Seeker of Truth\"\n\n- Your Aura of Power is strengthened. Enemies that inflict damage upon you receive various detrimental [status effects](/Status_effect \"Status effect\"). The chance of this rises linearly with piety, reaching 20% at max piety. The specific status effect applied is randomly chosen from the following list: [Corona](/Corona \"Corona\"), [Silence](/Silence \"Silence\"), [Blind](/Blind \"Blind\"), [Slow](/Slow \"Slow\"), or [Paralysis](/Paralysis \"Paralysis\"). The chance of inflicting a more severe status effect rises with damage sustained and falls based on the attacker's [HD](/HD \"HD\").\n\n**[Piety level \\*\\*\\*](/Piety \"Piety\")**: \"Walker of the Path\"\n\n- **Draw Out Power** - When used, you regain [HP](/HP \"HP\") and [MP](/MP \"MP\"), free yourself from nets, webs and constriction, and cure petrification, slow, and confusion. HP = `piety/16 + (piety/20)d6)`, MP = `piety/48 + (piety/40)d4`; that's (10 + 8d6) HP and (3 + 4d4) MP at max piety.[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1) ([Exhaustion](/Exhaustion \"Exhaustion\") for 12-16 turns, moderate [draining](/Draining \"Draining\"): roughly 4% max HP)\n\n**[Piety level \\*\\*\\*\\*](/Piety \"Piety\")**: \"Lifter of the Veil\"\n\n- **Power Leap** - Allows you to leap three tiles and creates a damaging 3x3 explosion wherever you land. Explosion damage scales with piety and experience level.[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2) (5 [MP](/MP \"MP\"), [exhaustion](/Exhaustion \"Exhaustion\") for 18-25 turns)\n\n**[Piety level \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*](/Piety \"Piety\")**: \"Transcendent\"\n\n- **Apocalypse** - Deals heavy damage and random status effects to every enemy within your [line of sight](/Line_of_sight \"Line of sight\"). (8 [MP](/MP \"MP\"), [exhaustion](/Exhaustion \"Exhaustion\") for 30-49 turns, heavy [draining](/Draining \"Draining\"): roughly 13.3% max HP)\n\n* Damage equals `<X>d(piety * (XL + 54) / 584)` (Xd22 at XL27 & max piety),[\\[3\\]](#cite_note-3) where X = (4 to 8), depending on the status inflicted.[\\[4\\]](#cite_note-4) There is 75% to inflict a status: [antimagic](/Antimagic \"Antimagic\"), [paralysis](/Paralysis \"Paralysis\"), [slow](/Slow \"Slow\"). If a monster can be affected by antimagic, there is an equal chance of each, otherwise 50% paralysis and 25% slow. If no status is inflicted, X = 8 instead.\n\n**[Piety level \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*](/Piety \"Piety\")**: \"Drop of Water\"\n\n- No new abilities. Unlike other gods, Ru's piety caps at 160. That means that as soon as you reach \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* piety, you are maxed out. Ru will stop offering sacrifices, though if you leave and rejoin, you'll have to sacrifice again.\n\n## Punishments\n\n|   |                                                                                                                                                  |\n| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n|   | Ru does not punish followers who leave Ru's service; however, their piety will be lost even upon rejoining, and their sacrifices remain forever. |\n\nRu cannot be offended in any way, and will never deliver punishments upon your character. However, all sacrifices made while worshiping Ru are permanent, and the abilities Ru grants are lost upon abandonment.\n\n## Strategy\n\nRu rewards 2 types of sacrifice:\n\n- The \"sacrifice\" of anything that lies outside a character's build. For instance, heavy melee characters won't mind losing Arcana or Stealth.\n- Large sacrifices, which ramp up your piety from the beginning. Losing a hand will impact just about every character, but gives \\*\\* - \\*\\*\\* immediately.\n\nYour sacrifice strategy should be adjusted according to your character, your previous sacrifices, and the amount of runes you're going for. Sacrifice Drink is a much bigger penalty when [torment](/Torment \"Torment\") and [damnation](/Damnation \"Damnation\"), common in the extended game, are bound to activate it. Meanwhile, you can afford to take some smaller sacs if you already have some of Ru's important abilities. Regardless, it's best to not lose your main killing skill, regardless of how much piety you'd gain.\n\nThough it may not feel substantial, Aura of Power will give you a decent edge in fights. It also has the added benefit of aiding in [kiting](/Kiting \"Kiting\") enemies, as the chance for the Aura to distract an enemy occurs on *any* action taken by that enemy (including walking towards you). Draw Out Power is straightforward - instantly regain HP and MP and cure certain debilitating statuses, at the cost of slight draining. Power Leap is a highly versatile tool for both positioning yourself and damaging enemies. Finally, Apocalypse will incapacitate all foes within your line of sight while dealing considerable damage; it can wipe out most ordinary monsters, while the more dangerous ones will be significantly weakened.\n\n### Tips and Tricks\n\n- Wearing an [amulet of faith](/Amulet_of_faith \"Amulet of faith\") does not increase the piety gained per sacrifice. Wearing one hastens the rate at which new sacrifices are offered, while removing one slows down that rate. A max piety Ru worshipper gains nothing from wearing an amulet of faith and loses nothing for removing it.\n- All of Ru's abilities [exhaust](/Exhausted \"Exhausted\") the user for a short while. Choose when to use your abilities wisely.\n- Any sacrifices you take up are permanent. You will never get back that hand, or your dodging skill. Thus, it is rarely a good idea to switch to another god from Ru.\n  - Leaving Ru carries no penalty if you have yet to sacrifice anything. If you are not a [monk](/Monk \"Monk\"), you can worship an early Ru altar until the first set of sacrifices show up (or until you find a desirable god).\n\n## Sacrifices\n\nRu will offer you a randomly selected batch of three sacrifices every so often. Choosing a sacrifice will permanently handicap your character as described, and you will not be able to make a new sacrifice until a new batch is offered. Unlike other gods, Ru's piety maxes at 160 rather than 200, so as soon as you hit \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, you have maximum piety and Ru will no longer offer sacrifices. Note that you start with 15 piety on first worshipping Ru, like most other gods.\n\nWhere a given sacrifice (eg Essence) has more than one row in the table, you will be told before making the sacrifice which specific effect you will receive. Each row in this table can only be taken once, except where indicated otherwise. The list of sacrifices are as follows[\\[5\\]](#cite_note-5)[\\[6\\]](#cite_note-6):\n\n| Sacrifice                | Mutation(s)                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Piety\\*                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Arcana**               | 3 x No \\[magic school] magic    | Permanently lose three randomly selected magic skills and access to all spells in those schools.

The amount of additional piety is `(raw experience points to reach your skill level)/500`. For reference, 500 [skill points](/Skill_point \"Skill point\") (1 additional piety) equals 4 ranks in a skill with an aptitude of 0; see the [Skill](/Skill \"Skill\") article for more details on skill points in regards to skill level.\n\n[Gnolls](/Gnoll \"Gnoll\") don't get any piety bonus from skill, and if you sacrifice a skill, your other skills won't get an increased share of XP.

Some other sacrifices were rebalanced (see [this revision](http://crawl.chaosforge.org/index.php?title=Ru\\&oldid=64204#Sacrifices) for previous values).\n- Prior to [0.28](/0.28 \"0.28\"), Ru's Aura of Power triggered statuses more often (25% at max piety).\n- In [0.27](/0.27 \"0.27\"), Ru's sacrifices were rebalanced. (See [this revision](http://crawl.chaosforge.org/index.php?title=Ru\\&oldid=56863#Sacrifices) for previous values.)\n- Prior to [0.26](/0.26 \"0.26\"), the [drain](/Drain \"Drain\") status lowered skill XP instead of max HP.\n- Prior to [0.19](/0.19 \"0.19\"), Ru's Aura of Power triggered statuses more often (33% at max piety).\n- Ru was added in [0.16](/0.16 \"0.16\").\n- For a time during development, Ru was named Iashol.\n\n## References\n\n1.

As you make further sacrifices, you will be able to draw on this power to restore your health and magic and make a lightning-fast explosive leap. Exceptional sacrificiants can unleash their power in a massive strike against all their foes.\n</p><p>Once you begin worship, Ru will monitor your progress as you explore the dungeon and defeat its inhabitants.

Sacrifice Drink is a much bigger penalty when <a href=\"/Torment\" title=\"Torment\">torment</a> and <a href=\"/Damnation\" title=\"Damnation\">damnation</a>, common in the extended game, are bound to activate it. Meanwhile, you can afford to take some smaller sacs if you already have some of Ru's important abilities. Regardless, it's best to not lose your main killing skill, regardless of how much piety you'd gain.\n</p><p>Though it may not feel substantial, Aura of Power will give you a decent edge in fights. It also has the added benefit of aiding in <a href=\"/Kiting\" title=\"Kiting\">kiting</a> enemies, as the chance for the Aura to distract an enemy occurs on <i>any</i> action taken by that enemy (including walking towards you). Draw Out Power is straightforward - instantly regain HP and MP and cure certain debilitating statuses, at the cost of slight draining. Power Leap is a highly versatile tool for both positioning yourself and damaging enemies. Finally, Apocalypse will incapacitate all foes within your line of sight while dealing considerable damage; it can wipe out most ordinary monsters, while the more dangerous ones will be significantly weakened.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tips_and_Tricks\">Tips and Tricks</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Wearing an <a href=\"/Amulet_of_faith\" title=\"Amulet of faith\">amulet of faith</a> does not increase the piety gained per sacrifice.

Choose when to use your abilities wisely.</li>\n<li>Any sacrifices you take up are permanent. You will never get back that hand, or your dodging skill. Thus, it is rarely a good idea to switch to another god from Ru.\n<ul><li>Leaving Ru carries no penalty if you have yet to sacrifice anything. If you are not a <a href=\"/Monk\" title=\"Monk\">monk</a>, you can worship an early Ru altar until the first set of sacrifices show up (or until you find a desirable god).</li></ul></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sacrifices\">Sacrifices</span></h2>\n<p>Ru will offer you a randomly selected batch of three sacrifices every so often. Choosing a sacrifice will permanently handicap your character as described, and you will not be able to make a new sacrifice until a new batch is offered. Unlike other gods, Ru's piety maxes at 160 rather than 200, so as soon as you hit ******, you have maximum piety and Ru will no longer offer sacrifices. Note that you start with 15 piety on first worshipping Ru, like most other gods.\n</p><p>Where a given sacrifice (eg Essence) has more than one row in the table, you will be told before making the sacrifice which specific effect you will receive.

altar.png]] ''\"Cut away your false body!\"''\n\n{{flavour|Of all the gods, only Ru opposed creation. Not as folly, but as distraction. Initiates of Ru can open channels to the powers underlying the visible world by renouncing the fetters that bind them here. These sacrifices are not made to Ru, but rather given up freely and permanently. Initiates can redirect would-be attackers and retaliate against their enemies, replenish their health and magic, perform a mighty leap, and unleash a massive wave of power against foes.\n\nRu leads you to gain immense power which initially will cause foes to falter and become stricken with maladies if they harm you. As you make further sacrifices, you will be able to draw on this power to restore your health and magic and make a lightning-fast explosive leap. Exceptional sacrificiants can unleash their power in a massive strike against all their foes.\n\nOnce you begin worship, Ru will monitor your progress as you explore the dungeon and defeat its inhabitants. Ru will, on judging you ready, offer you three sacrifices which you can make in order to achieve greater power.\n\nRu likes it when you make personal sacrifices.}}\n\n==Racial Restrictions==\n[[Demigod]]s are prohibited from worshiping Ru (or any other god).\n\n==Appreciates==\n*Making sacrifices. The amount of piety granted per sacrifice varies depending on the significance of the sacrifice (sacrificing a hand grants much more piety than sacrificing purity by gaining dopiness).\n**As Ru's piety system is unusual, [[monk]]s are offered a near immediate choice of sacrifices upon converting.\n\n==Deprecates==\n*Nothing. You can't offend Ru, Ru has no penance, and inflicts no wrath for leaving. However, you lose the benefits of worshiping Ru while retaining all the drawbacks of your sacrifices (they are not undone).\n\n*Piety with Ru does not decrease.\n\n==Given Abilities==\n'''[[Piety|Piety level -]]''': \"Questioner\"\n*'''Make Sacrifice''' - As you explore and kill, Ru will periodically offer you a batch of 3 sacrifice options, available as in the Abilities menu. Sacrifices will ''permanently'' handicap your character, but grant you piety. The exact amount of piety received varies depending on how serious the effect is on your character. See the '''[[#Sacrifices|Sacrifices]]''' section below for more details. \n**New sacrifices will be offered periodically, and will refresh faster after you accept one than if you simply let a set of three sit unused. You can reject offered sacrifices, which will result in a new set being offered after a similar delay to accepting one. \n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level *]]''': \"Initiate\"\n*'''Aura of Power''' - Any enemy that attacks you may instead falter or redirect its attack to itself or another target. The chance of this rises linearly with piety, reaching a 10% chance of faltering and 5% chance of redirecting at max piety. (Passive)\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level **]]''': \"Seeker of Truth\"\n*Your Aura of Power is strengthened. Enemies that inflict damage upon you receive various detrimental [[status effect]]s. The chance of this rises linearly with piety, reaching 20% at max piety. The specific status effect applied is randomly chosen from the following list: [[Corona]], [[Silence]], [[Blind]], [[Slow]], or [[Paralysis]]. The chance of inflicting a more severe status effect rises with damage sustained and falls based on the attacker's [[HD]].\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ***]]''': \"Walker of the Path\"\n*'''Draw Out Power''' - When used, you regain [[HP]] and [[MP]], free yourself from nets, webs and constriction, and cure petrification, slow, and confusion. HP = <code>piety/16 + (piety/20)d6)</code>, MP = <code>piety/48 + (piety/40)d4</code>; that's (10 + 8d6) HP and (3 + 4d4) MP at max piety.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|god-abil.cc|4683}}</ref> ([[Exhaustion]] for 12-16 turns, moderate [[draining]]: roughly 4% max HP)\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ****]]''': \"Lifter of the Veil\"\n*'''Power Leap''' - Allows you to leap three tiles and creates a damaging 3x3 explosion wherever you land. Explosion damage scales with piety and experience level.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|god-abil.cc|4837}}</ref> (5 [[MP]], [[exhaustion]] for 18-25 turns)\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level *****]]''': \"Transcendent\"\n*'''Apocalypse''' - Deals heavy damage and random status effects to every enemy within your [[line of sight]]. (8 [[MP]], [[exhaustion]] for 30-49 turns, heavy [[draining]]: roughly 13.3% max HP)\n:Damage equals <code><X>d(piety * (XL + 54) / 584)</code> (Xd22 at XL27 & max piety),<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|god-abil.cc|4901}}</ref> where X = (4 to 8), depending on the status inflicted.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|god-abil.cc|4869}}<br>Paralysis: X = 4; Antimagic: X = 4; Slow: X = 6; No Effect: X = 8</ref> There is 75% to inflict a status: [[antimagic]], [[paralysis]], [[slow]]. If a monster can be affected by antimagic, there is an equal chance of each, otherwise 50% paralysis and 25% slow. If no status is inflicted, X = 8 instead.\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ******]]''': \"Drop of Water\"\n*No new abilities. Unlike other gods, Ru's piety caps at 160. That means that as soon as you reach ****** piety, you are maxed out. Ru will stop offering sacrifices, though if you leave and rejoin, you'll have to sacrifice again.\n\n==Punishments==\n{{flavour|Ru does not punish followers who leave Ru's service; however, their piety will be lost even upon rejoining, and their sacrifices remain forever.}}\nRu cannot be offended in any way, and will never deliver punishments upon your character. However, all sacrifices made while worshiping Ru are permanent, and the abilities Ru grants are lost upon abandonment.\n\n==Strategy==\nRu rewards 2 types of sacrifice:\n* The \"sacrifice\" of anything that lies outside a character's build. For instance, heavy melee characters won't mind losing Arcana or Stealth.\n* Large sacrifices, which ramp up your piety from the beginning. Losing a hand will impact just about every character, but gives ** - *** immediately.\n\nYour sacrifice strategy should be adjusted according to your character, your previous sacrifices, and the amount of runes you're going for. Sacrifice Drink is a much bigger penalty when [[torment]] and [[damnation]], common in the extended game, are bound to activate it. Meanwhile, you can afford to take some smaller sacs if you already have some of Ru's important abilities. Regardless, it's best to not lose your main killing skill, regardless of how much piety you'd gain.\n\nThough it may not feel substantial, Aura of Power will give you a decent edge in fights. It also has the added benefit of aiding in [[kiting]] enemies, as the chance for the Aura to distract an enemy occurs on ''any'' action taken by that enemy (including walking towards you). Draw Out Power is straightforward - instantly regain HP and MP and cure certain debilitating statuses, at the cost of slight draining. Power Leap is a highly versatile tool for both positioning yourself and damaging enemies. Finally, Apocalypse will incapacitate all foes within your line of sight while dealing considerable damage; it can wipe out most ordinary monsters, while the more dangerous ones will be significantly weakened.\n\n===Tips and Tricks===\n*Wearing an [[amulet of faith]] does not increase the piety gained per sacrifice. Wearing one hastens the rate at which new sacrifices are offered, while removing one slows down that rate. A max piety Ru worshipper gains nothing from wearing an amulet of faith and loses nothing for removing it.\n*All of Ru's abilities [[exhausted|exhaust]] the user for a short while. Choose when to use your abilities wisely.\n*Any sacrifices you take up are permanent. You will never get back that hand, or your dodging skill. Thus, it is rarely a good idea to switch to another god from Ru.\n**Leaving Ru carries no penalty if you have yet to sacrifice anything. If you are not a [[monk]], you can worship an early Ru altar until the first set of sacrifices show up (or until you find a desirable god).\n\n==Sacrifices==\nRu will offer you a randomly selected batch of three sacrifices every so often. Choosing a sacrifice will permanently handicap your character as described, and you will not be able to make a new sacrifice until a new batch is offered. Unlike other gods, Ru's piety maxes at 160 rather than 200, so as soon as you hit ******, you have maximum piety and Ru will no longer offer sacrifices. Note that you start with 15 piety on first worshipping Ru, like most other gods.\n\nWhere a given sacrifice (eg Essence) has more than one row in the table, you will be told before making the sacrifice which specific effect you will receive. Each row in this table can only be taken once, except where indicated otherwise. The list of sacrifices are as follows<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|sacrifice-data.h|1}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|god-abil.cc|4042}}</ref>:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n! style=\"width: 6em\" | Sacrifice \n! Mutation(s) \n! Description \n! style=\"width: 22em;\" | Piety*\n|-\n| '''Arcana'''\n| 3 x No [magic school] magic\n| Permanently lose three randomly selected magic skills and access to all spells in those schools. One school is chosen from each of the following groups:\n*[[Conjurations]]/[[Summonings]]/[[Translocations]]\n*[[Alchemy]]/[[Necromancy]]/[[Hexes]]\n*[[Air Magic]]/[[Earth Magic]]/[[Fire Magic]]/[[Ice Magic]]\n| 25 <br> + piety from skill in affected magic schools \n|-\n| '''Artifice''' \n| Inability to use devices\n| Permanently lose the [[Evocations]] skill. Your character can no longer activate any [[wand]]s or other [[evocable items]], except the [[figurine of a ziggurat]]. This includes evocable invisibility and blink from scarves or artefacts.\n| 55 <br> + piety from Evocations skill <br> - [10 if sacrificed Love]\n|-\n| '''Courage'''\n| Cowardly\n| Suffer a [[slaying]] and [[spellpower]] penalty which scales with the number and strength of opponents in your [[line of sight]]. The severity of this penalty is indicated on the status bar by the '''Horr(-X)''' status, where X is the slaying penalty. Penalties begin when more than one tough monster or a single nasty monster is visible, and becomes more pronounced as more opponents appear.\n| 25 <br>+ [6 per level of Sacrifice Experience]\n|-\n|'''Drink'''\n| Inability to drink after injury\n| Gain [[No Unsafe Potions]] 2. Every time you take damage, you have a 3% chance to lose the ability to [[scroll]]s for 1d(damage) turns (maximum 30 turns).\n| 30 <br>+ [10 if sacrificed Scroll]\n|-\n| '''Durability'''\n| Inability to train armour\n| Permanently lose the [[Armour skill]].\n| 30 <br> + piety from Armour skill <br> + [20 if sacrificed Nimbleness]\n|-\n| '''Essence'''<br>(50% chance) \n| Weak-willed\n| Permanently reduce your [[willpower]] by 40 (equivalent to Will-).\n| 35\n|-\n| '''Essence'''<br>(25% chance)\n| Low MP\n| Permanently lose 10% of your maximum MP. Repeatable.\n| 10 <br>+ half the value of maximum skill out of [[Spellcasting]] and [[Invocations]]/2\n|-\n| '''Essence'''<br>(25% chance)\n| Disrupted magic\n| Permanently suffer a penalty to spellcasting success chance. This adds roughly +4% to spell failure (e.g. 10% fail -> 14% fail). It is somewhat less than +4% if your original failure is below 8%, and somewhat more than +4% if it's above 8%. Repeatable.\n| 20 <br> - 6 * number of stats greater than your [[Intelligence]]<br>+[[Spellcasting]]/2\n|-\n|'''Experience'''\n| Inexperienced\n| Immediately reduces your level by 1, also reducing your max level. This is applied as an offset, meaning you level up as quickly as if you were at your pre-sacrifice level. (This sacrifice can be taken up to 3 times).\n| 35 <br> + 7 per rank of the mutation you already have <br> + [6 if sacrificed Courage] <br> + [10 if you are a [[Demonspawn]]] <br> + [10 if 1st/3rd level and [[Djinni]]]\n|-\n|'''Eye'''\n| Missing an eye\n| Reduces your [[to-hit]] of melee, ranged weapons, and spells by 5.\n| 25\n|-\n|'''Forms'''\n| No forms\n| Permanently lose the ability to voluntarily change form. This affects all [[talisman]]s, [[potion of lignification|potions of lignification]], [[Dithmenos]]' shadow form, and bloodless [[vampire]]s' innate [[bat form]]. It does not affect the bad forms inflicted by enemies' wands of polymorph, or chaos effects.\n\nYou will lose access to the [[Shapeshifting]] skill.\n|7 <br> + piety from Shapeshifting skill\n|-\n|'''Hand'''\n| Missing a hand\n| Permanently lose one hand (or set of hands in the case of [[formicid]]s) and all associated benefits of two-handedness. You can only wield weapons which are one-handed for your [[species]], lose the ability to deliver [[auxiliary attack|offhand punches]], can never wear [[shields]], and lose one [[ring]] slot. \n\nYou'll lose access to the [[Shields skill]]. Small races ([[Kobold]]s and [[Spriggan]]s) also lose access to the [[Staves]] skill.\n| 65 <br> + piety from Shields skill <br> + [piety from Staves skill if you are a small race]\n|-\n|'''Health'''<br>(33% chance)\n| Frail\n| Permanently lose 10% of your maximum HP.\n| 35\n|-\n|'''Health'''<br>(33% chance)\n| Reduced AC\n| Permanently lose 5 AC.\n| 30\n|-\n|'''Health'''<br>(33% chance)\n| Reduced EV\n| Permanently lose 5 EV.\n| 25\n|-\n|'''Love'''\n| Hated by all\n| Permanently make (almost) all [[neutral]], [[peaceful]] or [[allied]] monsters hostile to you. Entities that are proxies for purely magical effects are unaffected: [[orbs of destruction]], [[ball lightning]], [[battlesphere]]s, [[spectral weapon]]s, [[foxfire]]s, and [[fulminant prism]]s.\n\nAll [[Summonings]] spells, as well as [[Animate Dead]], [[Sculpt Simulacrum]], [[Death Channel]] and [[Infestation]] can no longer be cast after this sacrifice. [[Necrotise]] and reactive abilities (like the [[ratskin cloak]]) won't create anything. [[Fire Storm]] will create hostile [[fire vortex|fire vortices]]. [[Wands of charming]] and other ally-creating [[evocable]]s will no longer function.\n\nYou will lose the Summonings skill, and won't be able to worship [[Beogh]], [[Fedhas]], [[Jiyva]], [[Hepliaklqana]], or [[Yredelemnul]] after this sacrifice.\n| 40 <br> + piety from Summonings skill, <br> 17 if sacrificed Summonings magic or Artifice, <br> 1 if sacrificed both Summonings and Artifice\n|-\n| '''Nimbleness'''\n| Inability to train dodging\n| Permanently lose the [[Dodging]] skill.\n| 30 <br> + piety from Dodging skill <br> + [20 if sacrificed Durability] <br> + [28 if your species cannot train Armour]\n|-\n| '''Purity'''<br>(50% chance)\n| Reduced Attributes\n| Permanently reduce your [[strength]], [[intelligence]] or [[dexterity]] by 2. (This sacrifice can be taken up to 2 times per stat.)\n| 16 <br> - 4 * number of stats greater than the chosen stat\n|-\n|'''Purity'''<br>(17% chance)\n| Scream\n| Gain one rank of the [[Scream]] mutation, causing you to occasionally [[shout]] when meeting monsters. (This sacrifice can be taken up to 3 times.)\n| 7, <br> 10 if you already have Scream 1, <br> 14 if you already have Scream 2\n|-\n|'''Purity'''<br>(17% chance)\n| No potion heal\n| Gain one rank of the [[No Potion Heal]] mutation, reducing the benefit of healing potions. (This sacrifice can be taken up to 2 times.)\n| 14 <br> + 7 per rank of the mutation you already have\n|-\n|'''Purity'''<br>(17% chance)\n| Inhibited regeneration\n| Gain the [[Inhibited Regeneration]] mutation, stopping you from regenerating when in line of sight of enemies.\n| 14\n|-\n|'''Resistance'''\n| Temperature sensitive\n| Permanently acquire fire and cold vulnerability (rF- rC-).\n| 50\n|-\n|'''Skill'''\n| Unskilled\n| Reduce all skill aptitudes by 1, retroactively decreasing your skill level in all skills you have already trained. (This sacrifice can be taken up to 3 times.)\n| 30 <br> + 7 per rank of the mutation you already have\n|-\n|'''Stealth'''\n| No stealth\n| Permanently lose the [[Stealth (skill)|Stealth skill]], and set your [[stealth]] score to 0. This makes all monsters notice you on the first turn they spend in your line of sight. This does not mean you produce additional [[noise]], however, so you will not be waking up things beyond your line of sight any more than normal.\n| 15 <bR> + piety from Stealth skill\n|-\n|'''Words'''\n| Inability to read after injury\n| Gain [[No Unsafe Scrolls]] 2. Every time you take damage, you have a 3% chance to lose the ability to [[scroll]]s for 1d(damage) turns (maximum 30 turns).\n| 30 <br> + [10 if sacrificed Drink] <br>+ [15 if you are a [[Mummy]]]\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>The piety count contains square brackets [] where a preset amount of piety is added (or subtracted) when a condition is true.\n\nThe piety granted by sacrifice in this table is the raw piety. This is then fuzzed by a random amount up to the smaller value of plus or minus 10% of the piety value and plus or minus 5 piety, to prevent players from accurately counting piety.\n\nSome sacrifices are worth additional piety based on the amount of skill levels you have in the skill being lost; this accounts for fractional skill levels. The amount of additional piety is <code>(raw experience points to reach your skill level)/500</code>. For reference, 500 [[skill point]]s (1 additional piety) equals 4 ranks in a skill with an aptitude of 0; see the [[Skill]] article for more details on skill points in regards to skill level. \n\n[[Gnoll]]s don't get any piety bonus from skill, and if you sacrifice a skill, your other skills won't get an increased share of XP. [[Djinn]] who sacrifice a magic skill won't get more XP for other magic skills (though Dj still get the piety bonus).\n\nSome sacrifices may conflict with your current mutation set (e.g. Sacrifice Health [HP] gives [[Frail]], which is incompatible with [[Robust]]) or species ([[Vine Stalker]]s already have maximum [[No Potion Heal]]), and will not be given.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], Sacrifice Experience was reduced to 1 XL, from 2. Some other sacrifices were rebalanced (see [http://crawl.chaosforge.org/index.php?title=Ru&oldid=64204#Sacrifices this revision] for previous values).\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Ru's Aura of Power triggered statuses more often (25% at max piety).\n*In [[0.27]], Ru's sacrifices were rebalanced. (See [http://crawl.chaosforge.org/index.php?title=Ru&oldid=56863#Sacrifices this revision] for previous values.)\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the [[drain]] status lowered skill XP instead of max HP.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Ru's Aura of Power triggered statuses more often (33% at max piety).\n*Ru was added in [[0.16]].\n*For a time during development, Ru was named Iashol.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{gods}}"}

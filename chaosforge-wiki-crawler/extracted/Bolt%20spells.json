{"title":"Bolt spells","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bolt_spells","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\nThe '''Bolt spells''' are a series of spells which all function similarly, hitting multiple targets along its line of fire.  Although there is some variance in their damage output and range, they all behave in nearly the same fashion. [[Repel missiles]] is less effective at repelling bolt projectiles.\n\nPlayers no longer have access to any \"traditional\" bolt spell in their spell library, though bolts are still accessible through other ways.\n\n==Player-Castable==\nAlmost all bolt spells have been removed from player libraries, although there are a few spells that create bolts:\n\n*[[Plasma Beam]]\n*[[Shock]]\n*[[Starburst]]\n\n==[[Evocable]]==\n===[[Thunderbolt]]===\n*Available through a [[lightning rod]]\n*Power determined by [[Evocations]]\n*Consecutive zaps increases strength and changes behavior of the bolt\n**Aiming for a different target creates a wide spray that covers the area between the previous bolt and the current bolt\n*Deals [[electricity]] damage; deals less damage when spread over a wide area\n*Range 5\n\n===[[Corrosive Bolt]]===\n*Available to players through a [[wand of acid]], [[Nemelex]]'s [[Vitriol card]], or [[Makhleb]].

Each game can have only one \"bolt\" wand type now.\n*In [[0.28]], Bolt of Magma was made monster and Makhleb only.\n*In [[0.27]], Makhleb's Major Destruction was made explicitly bolt-only.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], most beam spells (except for [[Shock]] and [[Lightning Bolt]]) had their range decreased by 1 for each target they hit.\n*Most bolt spells were removed from player's libraries in the positional magic update of [[0.25]]; [[Bolt of Fire]], [[Bolt of Cold]], [[Bolt of Draining]], and [[Venom Bolt]] were removed.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], the [[wand of lightning]] existed, which cast [[Lightning Bolt]].\n*Prior to [[0.20]], there were special evocable items called [[Rod|rods]]; the [[Rod of inaccuracy]] had a powerful but highly inaccurate bolt spell called [[Bolt of Inaccuracy]], and the [[Rod of ignition]] could fire a special version of Bolt of Fire named [[Explosive Bolt]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], there were [[Wand of fire|wands of fire]], [[Wand of cold|cold]], and [[Wand of draining|draining]], which cast their bolt spells with [[Evocations]]. The [[Rod of destruction]], had a special bolt spell called [[Random Bolt]]. In their place, the [[wand of acid]] gave players access to Corrosive Bolt. \n*[[0.17]] added [[Corrosive Bolt]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], the [[Tome of destruction]] could fire a number of these bolt spells.\n*[[Random Bolt]] was added in [[0.14]].\n*The term 'bolt' did not always refer only to spells which can hit multiple targets in a line. Notably, the spell [[Iron Shot]] went through the names Bolt of Iron and Iron Bolt before being renamed Iron Shot to avoid confusion, and [[Throw Icicle]] was renamed from Ice Bolt for the same reason."}

{"title":"Vault warden","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Vault_warden","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Vault wardens''' are the heads of security in [[the Vaults]]. Along with decent melee attacks, these sentries have the ability to seal shut any number of [[door]]s and [[stair]]s in their [[line of sight]], locking you in with them until the warden is slain or sufficient time has passed. As they usually travel with a sizable band of allies, this can be an extremely dangerous prospect.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Seal Doors will repair any broken doors, then seal them.\n*Vault wardens can be selective about which doors they close. If there are more monsters charging you from the next room over, they'll likely ignore that door while sealing off all the useful escape routes.  Specifically, they won't allow [[tension]] to drop by more than a third when shutting a door.\n*Need to escape but don't think you can survive the warden and his allies? Don't be afraid to [[teleport]]. You may wind up in an equally dangerous scenario, but it's better to chance that than get killed.\n*Be extremely cautious if you see a vault warden upon entering Vaults:5. If they seal shut the six stairways in the center of the floor, you'll be forced to kill it (along with the army guarding the entrance) before you'll be able to leave.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.13]] they were not able to seal stairways, and sealed doors could be affected by [[dig]]ging or [[disintegration]].\n*Vault wardens were added to the game in [[0.12]].\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

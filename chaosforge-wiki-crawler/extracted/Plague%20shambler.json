Their powerful melee attacks inflict both [[sickness]] and [[retching]] in their victims, and upon death, their body spills out a rapidly expanding [[cloud]] of [[miasma]]. They can be found in [[the Crypt]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Particularly slow characters ([[naga]]s in particular) may wish to [[blink]] away as soon as they defeat a plague shambler, or better yet, kill them at range. The miasma will spread faster than you can walk or slither away, and no one wants to rot any more than they absolutely have to.\n\n==History==\nPlague shamblers were added in [[0.13]], replacing [[rotting hulk]]s, and removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

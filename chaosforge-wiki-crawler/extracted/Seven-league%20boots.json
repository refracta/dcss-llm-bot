They allow the wearer to engage in combat in a single step, although it becomes impossible to remain stealthy while taking such strides.}}\n\n[[File:seven-league boots.png]] '''''the +3 pair of seven-league boots'''''\n\n[[Rampaging]] +âˆž (Moving directly towards an enemy places you directly adjacent to them and makes a melee attack.)<br>Cannot [[stab]] [[sleep]]ing targets if you are rampaging\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''seven-league boots'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|1596}}</ref> are a high-risk item. They let you instantly rush up to and strike an enemy from any distance, assuming they are in line with one of the 8 primary directions. On the one hand, you can attack a pesky [[centaur]] or [[deep elf annihilator]] without having to weather ranged attacks during a prolonged charge. On the other hand, you can accidentally rampage into a cluster of enemies and immediately get surrounded, or zip straight past a staircase you were aiming for.\n\nMuch like regular boots of rampaging, learning to zig-zag (travel diagonally in alternating directions) instead of walking straight towards your target will let you approach at normal speed. Unlike normal rampaging, sleeping targets automatically wake up when lunging with the seven-league boots.\n\nThe spell [[Vhi's Electric Charge]] is a good complement to these boots. This spell allows you to charge at enemies at an angle, making it easier to reposition after rampaging at a group.\n\n==History==\n*The seven-league boots were added in [[0.27]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Boots]]"}

Although it contains no [[rune]], it is guaranteed to have several treasure [[vault]]s on the bottom floor, and the entrance to [[the Tomb]] can be found somewhere within. The Enchanted Forest cannot coexist with [[the Crypt]]; if you find one, the other will not exist in your game.\n\n==Layout==\nThe Enchanted Forest is five floors deep, its entrance found on Vaults:2 or 3. Each floor tends to consist of a series of wide and narrow paths through random clumps of [[tree]]s, [[bush]]es, and [[plant]]s, with the occasional pond or river thrown in to break up the monotony. Expect to find a stone vault surrounded by [[list of mummies|mummies]] and containing an entrance to [[the Tomb]] on Forest:2 or 3.\n\n===Forest:5===\nThere are several possible final [[vault]]s on the deepest floor of the Enchanted Forest:\n*Spriggan Village - A portion of the floor will contain a massive village of spriggan-filled, stone-walled square houses. In the rear of the village you'll encounter [[the Enchantress]]. Clearing this out will yield you several treasure vaults.\n*Waterlogged Temple - This massive stone structure will be defended by numerous spriggans, fauns, thorn lotuses, and assorted forest creatures. Beyond the outer moat, dry foyer, and flooded interior, you'll find a large chamber filled primarily with weapons. There's a secret entrance near the back that lets you skip most of the guards, but try not to make too much noise or you'll pull them all down on you. [[Fly]]ing or the ability to swim recommended.\n\n==Useful Info==\nExpect a wide variety of animals (most of the nastier beasts of [[the Lair]] plus some of the less exotic inhabitants of the [[Spider's Nest]]), as well as many [[list of tengu|tengu]], [[list of spriggans|spriggans]], [[list of centaurs|centaurs]], and satyrs. By this point in the game, the wild animals you encounter will be mostly harmless, but the humanoids are much more dangerous: spriggans and satyrs can hit you with very unpleasant [[Hexes]], while tengu casters can simply inflict large amounts of [[Conjurations]] damage. There are also several monsters unique to this branch, ranging from the annoying [[spirit wolves]] to the brutal [[ancient bear]]s. Several of these have dangerous unique abilities, and should be handled with caution until you're familiar with them.\n\nIf you happen to have access to some mid- to high-level [[Fire Magic]], the spell [[Lightning Bolt]], or any equivalent [[wand]]s, you can clear out massive portions of the Enchanted Forest by simply lighting a few [[tree]]s on fire and letting the ensuing inferno do its business. This will make it much harder to find any sort of cover, but ''does'' greatly reduce the threat posed by enemy [[dryad]]s and [[spriggan druid]]s.\n\n[[Fedhas Madash]] worshipers, meanwhile, have a slightly easier time of things. The many plant-type monsters here will be allied to you, giving you occasional reinforcements as you eradicate all animal life in the forest. Unfortunately, this also means they get less experience in this branch than other characters would, and the fact that they don't get to clear out [[the Crypt]] means they miss out on significant amounts of [[piety]].\n\n==Recommendations==\nThe number of [[poison]]ous animals that lurk in the Forest makes poison resistance a good idea, but it's not a requirement by any stretch of the imagination. Much more important is that you have decent [[magic resistance]]; the spriggans and satyrs will torment you with Hexes every time you come across them. As far as elemental resistances go, tengu casters can hit you with almost anything, but [[electricity]] resistance is by far the most critical. [[Cold]] resistance also helps when facing spriggans, as they'll happily hit you with [[Ensorcelled Hibernation]] before [[stabbing]] you in the back.\n\nA source of [[flight]] certainly doesn't hurt; there are enough aquatic enemies in the Enchanted Forest to make melee combat aggravating. Also, [[stasis]] is particularly handy when dealing with [[water nymph]]s; consider swapping in an [[amulet of stasis]] any time one gets close.\n\n==Monsters==\n===Animals===\n*{{monsterlink|Yak}}\n*{{monsterlink|Apis}}\n*{{monsterlink|Dire elephant}}\n*{{monsterlink|Black bear}}\n*{{monsterlink|Grizzly bear}}\n*{{monsterlink|Ancient bear}}\n*{{monsterlink|Wolf}}\n*{{monsterlink|Spirit wolf}}\n*{{monsterlink|Anaconda}}\n*{{monsterlink|Redback}}\n*{{monsterlink|Wolf spider}}\n*{{monsterlink|Giant firefly}}\n*{{monsterlink|Butterfly}}\n*{{monsterlink|Yellow wasp}}\n*{{monsterlink|Red wasp}}\n*{{monsterlink|Wind drake}}\n*{{monsterlink|Giant goldfish}}\n*{{monsterlink|Big fish}}\n*{{monsterlink|Jellyfish}}\n\n===Plants===\n*{{monsterlink|Oklob plant}}\n*{{monsterlink|Treant}}\n*{{monsterlink|Thorn hunter}}\n*{{monsterlink|Thorn lotus}}\n\n===Non-living===\n*{{monsterlink|Water elemental}}\n*{{monsterlink|Elemental wellspring}}\n\n===Humanoids===\n*{{monsterlink|Faun}}\n*{{monsterlink|Satyr}}\n*{{monsterlink|Dryad}}\n*{{monsterlink|Water nymph}}\n*{{monsterlink|Spriggan (monster)|Spriggan}}\n*{{monsterlink|Spriggan rider}}\n*{{monsterlink|Spriggan berserker}}\n*{{monsterlink|Spriggan air mage}}\n*{{monsterlink|Spriggan druid}}\n*{{monsterlink|Spriggan enchanter}}\n*{{monsterlink|Spriggan assassin}}\n*{{monsterlink|Spriggan defender}}\n*{{monsterlink|Iron troll}}\n\n===Uniques===\n*{{monsterlink|The Enchantress}}\n\n==History==\nThe Enchanted Forest branch was never included in a stable release of Crawl. It was intended to be included in [[0.13]] or [[0.14]].  Features designed for it were either removed or distributed throughout the rest of the dungeon (mostly in Swamp/Shoals)."}

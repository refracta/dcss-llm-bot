They have high [[evasion]], [[blink]] constantly, and resist nearly everything. To make matters worse, they are encountered in packs and can be dangerous if they surround you. Wisps are found in the [[Dungeon]], [[The Swamp]], and [[the Abyss]].\n\n[[Wisp Form]] is a [[bad form]] that is similar to the monster.\n\n==Spells==\n\n{{Spellcaster2\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Blink]]\n|flags1={{Magical slot flag}}\n|slot2=[[Static Discharge]]\n|flags2={{Magical slot flag}}\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Melee characters can eventually take them out with standard attack strategies, and heavy armour combined with [[electricity]] resistance greatly reduces the threat they pose. It just requires more patience than usual.\n*Spellcasters should try to use [[Earth Magic]] and non-elemental [[Conjurations]], such as [[Magic Dart]], [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]], or the highly effective and 100% accurate [[Airstrike]]. [[Hailstorm]] will also partially work (and can strike multiple wisps at once). High-level elemental spells can take them out with repeated use, but lesser elemental spells will take too long to be practical.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.26]], insubstantial wisps were replaced with [[will-o-the-wisp]]s. [[Wisp form]] is still in the game, though.\n*In [[0.16]], became more fragile & less numerous, but gained Static Discharge.\n*In [[0.11]], [[AC]] was lowered from 20 to 5."}

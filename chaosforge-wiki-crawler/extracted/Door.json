{"title":"Door","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Door","type":"markdown","data":"***Version [0.28](/0.28 \"0.28\")**: This article **may not be** up to date for the [latest stable release](/0.32 \"0.32\") of Crawl.*\n\n|   |                |\n| - | -------------- |\n|   | A wooden door. |\n\n[![Door.png](/images/3/36/Door.png)](/File:Door.png) **Doors** are [Dungeon](/Dungeon \"Dungeon\") features which are usually used to separate rooms from each other, though they may be found standing in the middle of a room as well. Found in the Dungeon and almost all [branches](/Branches \"Branches\"), they are set into walls and are usually only 1x1 or 2x1 in size (though some [vaults](/Vault \"Vault\") may contain far more massive doors). Walking into a door will open it, while pressing **[C](/C \"C\")** when adjacent to one will close it. If you know that there are [monsters](/Monster \"Monster\") behind a door, leaving it closed will keep them at bay unless they are aware of you and are [capable of opening the door](/Category:Open_doors \"Category:Open doors\") (or can simply [eat the door](/Category:Eats_doors \"Category:Eats doors\")), in which case it will do you little good (as monsters can break the door).\n\nDoors may occasionally [creak](/Noise \"Noise\") when opened or closed, alerting nearby monsters to your presence. This is less of an issue for heavily armoured bruisers than for [stealthy](/Stealth \"Stealth\") sorts, as they tend to wake up everything no matter what. Fortunately, the chance of this happening is 1 in `8 + 4 * Stealth / 3`, so stealthy characters are unlikely to cause it anyway. [Silence](/Silence \"Silence\") also prevents creaky doors.\n\nIf there are any items in the doorway, most of the time, they will be pushed into an adjacent tile when the door is closed. If doing so would push the items into deep water or lava, however, the door will refuse to close.\n\n[![Transparent door.png](/images/2/27/Transparent_door.png)](/File:Transparent_door.png) Some doors are transparent, allowing you to see through them. This is the only difference between them and normal doors; much like transparent walls, closed transparent doors still prevent anything on the other side from affecting you.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Broken Door](#Broken_Door)\n- [2 Runed Door](#Runed_Door)\n- [3 Sealed Door](#Sealed_Door)\n- [4 Tips & Tricks](#Tips_.26_Tricks)\n- [5 History](#History)\n\n## Broken Door\n\n|   |                                                                                                                      |\n| - | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|   | A disappointingly poorly maintained wooden door. It'd take nothing short of magic to get this properly closed again. |\n\n[![Broken door.png](/images/9/93/Broken_door.png)](/File:Broken_door.png) [![Transparent broken door.png](/images/b/b7/Transparent_broken_door.png)](/File:Transparent_broken_door.png) Monsters that are aware of you and are capable of opening doors have a 1 in 5 chance of breaking down doors when opening them (or a 1 in 3 chance if they are [berserk](/Berserk \"Berserk\")).\n\nOnly a [vault warden](/Vault_warden \"Vault warden\")'s [Seal Doors](/Seal_Doors \"Seal Doors\") spell can repair a broken door.\n\n## Runed Door\n\n|   |                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| - | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|   | A door, covered in runic writing. It looks like there is something special behind it — perhaps danger, perhaps treasure. You may break the runes by opening it like any other door. |\n\n[![Runed door.png](/images/c/c1/Runed_door.png)](/File:Runed_door.png) [![Transparent runed door.png](/images/e/ef/Transparent_runed_door.png)](/File:Transparent_runed_door.png) **Runed doors** are only found in special vaults, are indestructible, and are generally used to contain very powerful monsters and especially valuable treasure. Thankfully, only the player can open runed doors, so any monsters behind them are stuck there until you choose to take them on. Avoid opening them unless you're confident that you can handle something significantly [out-of-depth](/Out-of-depth \"Out-of-depth\"). Clearing the rest of the floor first, just to minimize the risk of you running into more trouble as you flee or teleport away, is advisable, and don't forget that you can close the door again if that'll seal away the threat inside!\n\nNote that random teleports and [escape hatches](/Escape_hatch \"Escape hatch\") from adjacent floors may still place you inside areas that are closed off by runed doors. In such a situation, you may wish to immediately teleport again.\n\nSeveral vaults, such as [Crazy Yiuf](/Crazy_Yiuf \"Crazy Yiuf\")'s hut, the entrance to the [Hall of Blades](/Hall_of_Blades \"Hall of Blades\"), or many of the [player ghost](/Player_ghost \"Player ghost\") vaults are guaranteed to have runed doors. Many of these runed doors will be transparent, allowing you to judge whether the treasure inside is worth fighting for, but also allowing whatever's inside to wake up and notice you.\n\n## Sealed Door\n\n|   |                                                                                                         |\n| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|   | A door sealed tightly by arcane runes. It refuses to open for any creature not recognised by its magic. |\n\n[![Sealed door.png](/images/7/72/Sealed_door.png)](/File:Sealed_door.png) [![Transparent sealed door.png](/images/1/14/Transparent_sealed_door.png)](/File:Transparent_sealed_door.png) **Sealed doors** have been shut and locked by a [vault warden](/Vault_warden \"Vault warden\")'s [Seal Doors](/Seal_Doors \"Seal Doors\") spell; this will also push all items, creatures, and players out of the doorway in the process. In order to open the door, you will need to break the seal by waiting for the spell to end, killing the vault warden who cast it, destroying the door outright, or having another monster open it (which is unlikely).\n\n## Tips & Tricks\n\n- Repeatedly closing doors to hold off pursuers capable of opening them will generally only buy you an extra turn or two. If you need to recover, [teleport](/Teleport \"Teleport\"), [blink](/Blink \"Blink\"), or increase your movement speed to make a full escape to a safe area.\n- If you open a door and immediately see out-of-reach enemies capable of [smiting](/Smiting \"Smiting\") you, [tormenting](/Torment \"Torment\") you, blasting you with [damnation](/Damnation \"Damnation\"), or otherwise dealing heavy damage at range, don't retreat! Running gives them the opportunity to attack you as long as you're in their line of sight. If you [close](/C \"C\") the door first, this forces them to come to you, robbing them of several turns they could otherwise spend blasting you, and almost guarantees that you'll get to act against them first. This is effective throughout the entire game, from early threats such as [orc priests](/Orc_priest \"Orc priest\") all the way to late-game [fiends](/Fiend \"Fiend\") and [liches](/Lich \"Lich\").\n  - Alternatively, [shouting](/Shout \"Shout\") near a door may awaken the inhabitants of the room beyond, giving you time to back off and wait for them to open the door for you.\n\n## History\n\n- Prior to [0.28](/0.28 \"0.28\"), doors did not break when opened by monsters; monsters could be held at bay indefinitely (until [random energy](/Random_energy \"Random energy\") gave an extra turn) by repeatedly closing a door as soon as it was opened.\n- [0.23](/0.23 \"0.23\") added transparent doors.\n- Prior to [0.22](/0.22 \"0.22\"), doors could be destroyed by [Lee's Rapid Deconstruction](/Lee%27s_Rapid_Deconstruction \"Lee's Rapid Deconstruction\").\n- Before [0.21](/0.21 \"0.21\"), any [item](/Item \"Item\") in a doorway, big or small, would prevent the door from being closed.\n- Prior to [0.20](/0.20 \"0.20\"), [wands of disintegration](/Wands_of_disintegration \"Wands of disintegration\") and [Orb of Destruction](/Orb_of_Destruction \"Orb of Destruction\") could destroy doors.\n- Prior to [0.17](/0.17 \"0.17\"), the chance of doors creaking was affected by [Dexterity](/Dexterity \"Dexterity\") and [Stealth (skill)](/Stealth_\\(skill\\) \"Stealth (skill)\").\n- Runed doors were added in [0.12](/0.12 \"0.12\"), although vault-defined warning-covered doors had existed for several versions before that. 0.12 also added vault wardens and sealed doors.\n- Prior to [0.12](/0.12 \"0.12\"), there were occasionally secret doors that would only be revealed if you were within line of sight of them and succeeded on a check against your [Traps & Doors](/Traps_%26_Doors \"Traps & Doors\") skill. These were removed, which is why the skill was then renamed to [Traps](/Traps_\\(skill\\) \"Traps (skill)\"). These hidden doors used to be found everywhere, but were limited only to special [vaults](/Vault \"Vault\") in [0.11](/0.11 \"0.11\").\n\n|   |                                                                                                                 |\n| - | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|   | A wooden door, cunningly hidden. It used to be a secret door, but, at least for you, it's not a secret anymore. |\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<meta

wooden door.}}\n\n[[File:Door.png]] '''Doors''' are [[Dungeon]] features which are usually used to separate rooms from each other, though they may be found standing in the middle of a room as well. Found in the Dungeon and almost all [[branches]], they are set into walls and are usually only 1x1 or 2x1 in size (though some [[vault]]s may contain far more massive doors). Walking into a door will open it, while pressing '''[[C]]''' when adjacent to one will close it. If you know that there are [[monster]]s behind a door, leaving it closed will keep them at bay unless they are aware of you and are [[:Category:Open doors|capable of opening the door]] (or can simply [[:Category:Eats doors|eat the door]]), in which case it will do you little good (as monsters can break the door).\n\nDoors may occasionally [[noise|creak]] when opened or closed, alerting nearby monsters to your presence. This is less of an issue for heavily armoured bruisers than for [[stealth]]y sorts, as they tend to wake up everything no matter what. Fortunately, the chance of this happening is 1 in <code>8 + 4 * [[Stealth]] / 3</code>, so stealthy characters are unlikely to cause it anyway. [[Silence]] also prevents creaky doors.\n\nIf there are any items in the doorway, most of the time, they will be pushed into an adjacent tile when the door is closed. If doing so would push the items into deep water or lava, however, the door will refuse to close.\n\n[[File:Transparent door.png]] Some doors are transparent, allowing you to see through them. This is the only difference between them and normal doors; much like transparent walls, closed transparent doors still prevent anything on the other side from affecting you.\n\n==Broken Door==\n{{flavour|A disappointingly poorly maintained wooden door. It'd take nothing short of magic to get this properly closed again.}}\n\n[[File:Broken door.png]] [[File:Transparent broken door.png]] Monsters that are aware of you and are capable of opening doors have a 1 in 5 chance of breaking down doors when opening them (or a 1 in 3 chance if they are [[berserk]]).\n\nOnly a [[vault warden]]'s [[Seal Doors]] spell can repair a broken door.\n\n==Runed Door==\n{{flavour|A door, covered in runic writing. It looks like there is something special behind it — perhaps danger, perhaps treasure. You may break the runes by opening it like any other door.}}\n\n[[File:Runed door.png]] [[File:Transparent runed door.png]] '''Runed doors''' are only found in special vaults, are indestructible, and are generally used to contain very powerful monsters and especially valuable treasure. Thankfully, only the player can open runed doors, so any monsters behind them are stuck there until you choose to take them on. Avoid opening them unless you're confident that you can handle something significantly [[out-of-depth]]. Clearing the rest of the floor first, just to minimize the risk of you running into more trouble as you flee or teleport away, is advisable, and don't forget that you can close the door again if that'll seal away the threat inside!\n\nNote that random teleports and [[escape hatch]]es from adjacent floors may still place you inside areas that are closed off by runed doors. In such a situation, you may wish to immediately teleport again.\n\nSeveral vaults, such as [[Crazy Yiuf]]'s hut, the entrance to the [[Hall of Blades]], or many of the [[player ghost]] vaults are guaranteed to have runed doors. Many of these runed doors will be transparent, allowing you to judge whether the treasure inside is worth fighting for, but also allowing whatever's inside to wake up and notice you.\n\n==Sealed Door==\n{{flavour|A door sealed tightly by arcane runes. It refuses to open for any creature not recognised by its magic.}}\n\n[[File:Sealed door.png]] [[File:Transparent sealed door.png]] '''Sealed doors''' have been shut and locked by a [[vault warden]]'s [[Seal Doors]] spell; this will also push all items, creatures, and players out of the doorway in the process. In order to open the door, you will need to break the seal by waiting for the spell to end, killing the vault warden who cast it, destroying the door outright, or having another monster open it (which is unlikely).\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Repeatedly closing doors to hold off pursuers capable of opening them will generally only buy you an extra turn or two. If you need to recover, [[teleport]], [[blink]], or increase your movement speed to make a full escape to a safe area.\n*If you open a door and immediately see out-of-reach enemies capable of [[smiting]] you, [[torment]]ing you, blasting you with [[damnation]], or otherwise dealing heavy damage at range, don't retreat! Running gives them the opportunity to attack you as long as you're in their line of sight. If you [[c]]lose the door first, this forces them to come to you, robbing them of several turns they could otherwise spend blasting you, and almost guarantees that you'll get to act against them first. This is effective throughout the entire game, from early threats such as [[orc priest]]s all the way to late-game [[fiend]]s and [[lich]]es.\n**Alternatively, [[shout]]ing near a door may awaken the inhabitants of the room beyond, giving you time to back off and wait for them to open the door for you.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], doors did not break when opened by monsters; monsters could be held at bay indefinitely (until [[random energy]] gave an extra turn) by repeatedly closing a door as soon as it was opened.\n*[[0.23]] added transparent doors.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], doors could be destroyed by [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]].\n*Before [[0.21]], any [[item]] in a doorway, big or small, would prevent the door from being closed.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], [[wands of disintegration]] and [[Orb of Destruction]] could destroy doors.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the chance of doors creaking was affected by [[Dexterity]] and [[Stealth (skill)]].\n*Runed doors were added in [[0.12]], although vault-defined warning-covered doors had existed for several versions before that. 0.12 also added vault wardens and sealed doors.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], there were occasionally secret doors that would only be revealed if you were within line of sight of them and succeeded on a check against your [[Traps & Doors]] skill. These were removed, which is why the skill was then renamed to [[Traps (skill)|Traps]]. These hidden doors used to be found everywhere, but were limited only to special [[vault]]s in [[0.11]].\n\n{{flavour|A wooden door, cunningly hidden. It used to be a secret door, but, at least for you, it's not a secret anymore.}}\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

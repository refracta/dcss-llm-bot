{"title":"Kobold brigand","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Kobold_brigand","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|kobolds}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Kobold brigands''' are much like their [[kobold_(monster)|smaller cousins]], only tougher, stronger, and more likely to be found in packs. They may spawn with [[curare]] darts. They can be found in the middle [[Dungeon]] and [[the Sewers]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Low level characters should definitely try to force kobold packs into corridors to keep them from using their [[dart]]s or surrounding you. If you can lure them into melee (and are strong enough in melee to deal with them), this may help you avoid death by [[curare]].\n*Should you encounter one of the kobold vaults in the Dungeon, expect to have to fight through about five or six brigands in addition to a dozen or so of their lesser brethren. Buffing yourself with [[Invocations]] and/or a [[potion]] or two may be a good idea, especially if you're not built for pure melee combat. Fortunately, most such vaults open into a corridor that you can lure them into and thus fight them one at a time.\n**Fragile spellcasters should use any crowd-control spells they have ([[Mephitic Cloud]] or [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] work well). If you need to flee, teleporting away helps avoid the barrage of darts you'll incur by just legging it.\n*You can often trick kobold brigands found in the Sewers into fighting from [[shallow water]]. This greatly reduces their melee combat skills if you're fighting from dry land (or if you're not penalized by fighting in shallow water yourself).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], kobold brigands were known as '''big kobolds'''.\n\n[[Category:Kobold]]"}

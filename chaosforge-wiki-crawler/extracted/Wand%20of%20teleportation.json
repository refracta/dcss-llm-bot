{"title":"Wand of teleportation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wand_of_teleportation","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{item\n |itemtype = Wand\n |name = Wand of teleportation\n |cost = ?\n |weight = 10.0\n}}\n{{flavour|A magical device which causes a creature to be randomly translocated after a short delay.}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nZapping a '''wand of teleportation''' inflicts the user or a target with the {{LightBlue|Tele}} [[status effect]], causing a [[teleport]] in a few turns, 3-5 in normal circumstances. When used against a monster, it must overcome the target's [[magic resistance]] to have any effect. On a success, the target will look \"slightly unstable\".\n\nUsing this wand on a teleporting target will cancel the teleportation.\n\nThe wand can hold a maximum of 9 charges.\n\n==Strategy==\nTeleportation is a good option to get away from bad situations. It's not 100% reliable, but \"anywhere on the dungeon floor\" is likely not where you were.\n\nWands of teleportation are slightly more valuable than [[scrolls of teleportation]], since they can be used while [[silence]]d. Most games will contain enough scrolls to make the wand unnecessary (outside of silence).\n\n==History==\n*Wands of teleportation were removed in [[0.20]]."}

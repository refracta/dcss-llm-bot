It permanently afflicts its wearer with agonising pain, substantially reducing their resilience but rendering them immune to further torments.}}\n[[File:Crown_of_eternal_torment.png]] '''''the +3 crown of Eternal Torment'''''<br>\n\n+3 crown (0 base AC)\n\n[[Torment]] immunity<br>\n[[Negative energy|rN+++]]<br>\n[[See invisible]]<br>\nReduces max [[HP]] by 20%<br>\n[[Curse]]s itself when worn<br>\n[[Evil]]\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''crown of Eternal Torment''' is an extremely situational piece of equipment, granting rN+++ and torment immunity in exchange for a sizable portion of your maximum health. Admittedly, immunity to torment makes certain encounters significantly less terrifying, but that's still a lot of lost durability. Having 4/5 normal health means that all other hostile attacks are effectively dealing 125% more damage than normal, and slows your [[regeneration rate]] by a significant chunk. The item may be useful for taking on [[the Tomb]] and [[Tartarus]], but almost any other branch of the game will be decidedly deadlier if you choose to wear it; most branches don't have sources of torment to begin with, and several of those that do have plenty of other devastating threats, such as [[hellfire]]. Use this artefact at your own risk, and make sure to keep some [[scrolls of remove curse]] on hand so you can remove it when you decide to wear a less dangerous piece of equipment.\n\nOh, and it has [[see invisible]]. That's nice.\n\n==History==\nThe crown of Eternal Torment was briefly considered for [[0.17]] but was ultimately removed before release.\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Headgear]]"}

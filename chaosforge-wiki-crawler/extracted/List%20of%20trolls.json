Although there are several varieties with unique features, they all boast powerful melee prowess and frustratingly rapid [[regeneration]]. Killing them may produce [[troll leather armour]] of varying shades, though all colours work identically.\n\n==Troll Types==\n*{{Brown|T}} [[File:Troll (monster).png]] '''[[Troll (monster)|Troll]]''' - A brute with long claws, slavering fangs, and unnatural regeneration.\n*{{monsterlink|Deep troll}} - Cave-dwellers that hunt in packs and are often led by their more magically-inclined brethren.\n*{{monsterlink|Deep troll earth mage}} - These geomancers use magic to carve tunnels through the Dungeon and their claws to carve through you.\n*{{monsterlink|Deep troll shaman}} - The leaders of deep troll packs, they enhance their allies' [[Haste|speed]] and [[Might|strength]].\n*{{monsterlink|Iron troll}} - The largest, slowest, most powerful member of the troll family.

Projected Noise allows you to stay on a staircase and bring monsters to you. It is recommended to explore a chunk of the level before doing that. Provided that all 3 staircases aren't in the same location, using Projected Noise around the level makes it safer to clear a floor. Can also be used to lure monsters away from a given spot.\n\nProjected Noise can also trivialize the later [[Ziggurat]] floors. One needed only to cast it at the lowest point of the [[Ziggurat]] and run around the upper part to avoid all monsters and gain access to the loot/[[stairs]].\n\n==History==\n* Projected Noise was removed in [[0.11]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

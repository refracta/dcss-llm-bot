It is a one-handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''fustibalus''' is a significantly more powerful option than a [[hunting sling]], requiring slightly more skill and time per shot, but dealing much more damage per hit. Although less devastating than its two-handed [[Bows|bow]] and [[Crossbows|crossbow]] counterparts, they require much less skill to reach min-delay, and a well-enchanted fustibalus can still be an effective and deadly end-game weapon. Base damage is 12 when firing sling bullets. Even so, be aware that it may still have some difficulty taking down [[hell sentinel]]s and other late-game high-[[AC]] opponents.\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Fustibalus.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Fustibalus2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Fustibalus3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]s\n|-\n| '''[[Punk]]''' || [[File:Urand punk.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Fustibali were removed with the [[Slings (skill)|Slings skill]] in [[0.29]].

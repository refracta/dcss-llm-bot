{"title":"Quicksilver dragon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Quicksilver_dragon","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | dragons}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful info==\n'''Quicksilver dragons''' are rare and dangerous [[dragon]]s that move 50% faster than average and breathe irresistible status-dispelling energy bolts. They can be found in [[Vaults]]:5, [[Dis]]:7, a specific [[Snake]]:4 [[vault|layout]], and in or just outside [[the Realm of Zot]].\n\nLike other dragons, killing it may drop [[quicksilver dragon scales]] (33% chance).\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Quicksilver Bolt]] will dispel any [[Potion of cancellation#Affected Status Effects|valid statuses]], which can range from scary to lethal. Unexpectedly losing [[Haste]], [[scroll of teleportation|Tele]], your [[transformation]], etc. can make a dangerous situation ''that'' much worse. Keep note of buffs that [[Potion of cancellation#Unaffected Status Effects|can't be dispelled]], such as [[berserk]] and all [[god|divine]] abilities.\n**While the bolts can't be blocked or resisted, they can be avoided; good [[EV]] and [[repulsion]] can reduce the likelihood of having your buffs dispelled.\n*Quicksilver dragons on Snake:4 are very nasty. At 3d20 damage, their breath really hurts. They are fast, so you can't run normally. But their breath also dispels haste and teleport, so it's difficult to escape. And the \"quicksilver temple\" spawns with ''two'' of them! If you recognize the vault, consider not doing Snake:4 until much later.<!--0.31 (Commit 0240bd9) reduces dragons to 1--> Even for a character in [[Zot]], losing your buffs is a significant threat.\n*Quicksilver dragons are not resistant to [[poison]]. [[Curare]] darts slow them down, making them a lot more manageable. A [[scroll of poison]] can deal significant damage, especially with [[Ignite Poison]].\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], the quicksilver temple layout was added to Snake:4."}

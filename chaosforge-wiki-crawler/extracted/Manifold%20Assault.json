{"title":"Manifold Assault","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Manifold_Assault","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Manifold Assault''' is a level 4 [[Translocations]] spell which allows you to attack multiple targets within line of sight with melee attacks. Each target is hit by 1 attack from your weapon (or fist), with no [[auxiliary attack]]s. This spell is cast in the same amount of time as your weapon's [[attack delay]].\n\nIf you are wielding a [[weapon]], you can hit up to <code>2 + [[spell power|power]]/50</code> targets (max 4),<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-transloc.cc|1285}}</ref> rounded in a weighted manner. If you are using [[Unarmed Combat]], the number of targets is halved. All hostile monsters that are in LOS have an equal chance to be targeted. \n\n[[Warper]]s start with this spell available.\n\n===Restrictions===\nManifold Assault is unable to [[stab]] opponents, while [[cleaving]] and [[reaching]] have no effect. In addition, the following [[unrand]] artefacts do not work at all with this spell:\n<div style=\"column-count:2; width:500px\">\n*{{unrandlink|Sword of Power}}\n*{{unrandlink|Arc Blade}}</div>\n\n==Strategy==\n*This spell takes quite a bit of investment to cast, at least for a heavy armour melee fighter.\n*Manifold Assault thrives when paired with high damage melee attacks, like two-handed weapons and [[Transmutations]] like [[Dragon Form]]. The [[dark maul]] is especially brutal.\n*This spell can be quite MP intensive. Unless you have great MP reserves ([[Djinn]], [[Vehumet]] worshippers, [[TSO]] during [[extended]]...), you probably can't afford to spam it against everything that enters [[LOS]].\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Manifold Assault will be a level 7 spell, and its power cap will be 200. Your attacks will hit twice as many targets per cast and will never miss.}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], the unrands [[Devastator]], [[Sceptre of Torment]], [[Singing Sword]], and [[Mace of Variability]] did not work with this spell.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Manifold Assault was a level 5 spell, with no special behavior towards Unarmed Combat.\n*Manifold Assault was added in [[0.27]].\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''rapier''' is the short blade with the highest base damage. It is a desirable choice for [[stabbing]] and actual melee combat, at least if you have some skill with Short Blades.\n\n==Strategy==\nRapiers are a fairly uncommon weapon. Some early- and mid-game monsters wield them (such as [[Eustachio]], [[Nikola]], and residents of the [[Elven Halls]]). Coupled with a flat-damage brand such as [[electrocution]], [[pain (brand)|pain]], or [[distortion]], and a rapier can be a devastating weapon.\n\nA [[quick blade]] is usually stronger than a rapier, especially when stacked with flat-damage bonuses (like [[slaying]], [[auxiliary attack]]s, and flat-damage brands). However, quick blades are much rarer weapons.\n\n[[Dagger]]s are better at stabbing at all realistic levels of skill. However, using a rapier to stab means not having to waste time switching weapons. Against sleeping monsters, for instance, swapping to the dagger can give the foe enough time to wake up.\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Common\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Rapier1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Rapier2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Rapier3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]\n|-\n| '''[[Captain's cutlass]]''' || [[File:Captain's_cutlass.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Arc blade]]''' || [[File:Arc_blade.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], rapiers had a base damage of 8.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], rapiers had a base damage of 7.\n*Rapiers were added in [[0.16]], replacing [[cutlass]]es.\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Short blades]]"}

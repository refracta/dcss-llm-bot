This stacks with other sources of [[wizardry]], but with diminishing returns.\n\n==Desirability==\nGood for spellcasters, especially in the early game. Wizardry is always better for decreasing failure rate than a [[ring of intelligence]]. For casters, the single biggest jump in power is when a spell goes from \"failure is too high to be used\" to \"failure is low enough to be used\"; wizardry can help reach that.\n\nOnce you can comfortably cast a given spell without wizardry, a ring of intelligence (which also increases [[spell power]]) or a defensive ring will likely be preferable. Wizardry is useless for those who aren't casting any spells to begin with.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], a [[staff of wizardry]] provided a slightly better bonus to wizardry than the ring.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], this ring would not auto-identify.\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

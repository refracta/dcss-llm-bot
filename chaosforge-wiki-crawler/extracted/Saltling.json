{"title":"Saltling","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Saltling","type":"raw","data":"{{version021}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Saltlings''' are small, fast [[list of constructs|constructs]]. Hardly a threat on their own, they tend to appear in groups supporting [[ragged hierophant]]s, [[peacekeeper]]s, and [[servants of whispers]]. They are found almost exclusively in the [[Desolation of Salt]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nLike all constructs, saltlings make no noise when injured. Take advantage of this fact by pulling them away from their groups at the edge of your line of sight. The fewer targets between you and an actual threat you have to deal with, the better.\n\n==History==\nSaltlings were added in [[0.19]]."}

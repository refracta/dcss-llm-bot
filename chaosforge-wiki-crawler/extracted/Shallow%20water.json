{"title":"Shallow water","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shallow_water","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|A pool of cloudy, waist-deep water. It makes movement and combat cumbersome for landlubbers - sometimes dangerous, but never directly fatal.}}\n\n'''Shallow water''' is a common type of terrain throughout the Dungeon and many of its branches (particularly the [[Swamp]] and [[Shoals]]); moving through it is difficult for those who cannot swim.\n\nWhile traveling through shallow water, most creatures have the following penalties:\n*[[Movement]] delay is increased by 6 [[aut]]s.\n*[[Stealth]] score is halved.\n*Melee attacks have a chance to fail (players have a 37.5% chance to fumble their attacks, monsters have a 25% chance). Note that this penalty only applies to ''melee'' combat; ranged attacks, spells, wands, and god abilities are all unaffected.\n*[[Invisible|Invisibility]] has no effect, since water is displaced around your invisible body.\n\nThe penalties of shallow water are negated entirely by [[flying]] above it. [[Amphibious]] species (see below) and [[Size#Large|large]] / [[Size#Hybrid|hybrid]] species ([[Ogre]]s, [[Troll]]s, [[Armataur]]s, [[Naga]]s) will ignore all penalties from shallow water, but they are still revealed if [[invisible]].\n\n==Amphibious==\nSome monsters and [[species]] are either [[amphibious]] or [[aquatic]], which both ignore the penalties of water. Monsters may also have bonuses in water, like increased speed, damage, and accuracy, though the specifics vary by creature.\n\nFor players, grey [[Draconian]]s, [[Barachim]], [[Merfolk]], [[Octopode]]s, and players in [[Ice Form]] are amphibious, ignoring all penalties (except being revealed when [[invisible]]). In addition, certain species get bonuses from water:\n\n* Octopodes gain +50 [[stealth]].\n* Merfolk gain +50 stealth, reduce their movement delay by 4, and gain +25% [[EV]].\n\nOctopodes and Merfolk still gain their water bonuses when [[flying]] over water.\n\n==Monster behavior==\nIntelligent monsters that would suffer penalties from fighting in shallow water will try to avoid doing so if they can help it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], large player species had the movement penalty while walking in shallow water.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], merfolk and octopodes lost their water bonuses when flying.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], wading in shallow water had a randomized speed penalty, which varied from 30% to 100%.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], [[Dexterity|dexterous]] characters were less likely to fumble an attack while standing in shallow water.\n\n[[CATEGORY:Dungeon Features]]"}

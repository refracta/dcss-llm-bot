Those individuals can expect to gain powerful healing abilities, by which they can avoid bloodshed. Elyvilon appreciates exploration of the dungeon. Elyvilon's followers can convert to the Shining One or Zin while keeping some piety.\n\nThe Healer offers followers a number of means to heal themselves from damage and other ill effects. Followers may also attempt to pacify hostile monsters and turn them neutral. Elyvilon may directly intervene to save a follower's life, and if there has been no such intervention recently, is sure to prevent a killing blow against especially pious followers. Elyvilon may also occasionally protect the follower's allies from death.\n\nElyvilon likes it when you explore the world.\n\nElyvilon strongly dislikes it when you use evil magic or items, you attack non-hostile holy beings, you attack neutral beings, you attack allies or you kill non-hostile holy beings.}}\n\n==Racial Restrictions==\n*Like the other [[good god]]s, Elyvilon does not accept [[Demonspawn]] or undead species ([[Ghoul]]s, [[Vampire]]s, or [[Mummies]]) as followers.\n*[[Demigod]]s may not worship Elyvilon (or any other god).\n\n==Appreciates==\n*Exploring the world.\n\n==Deprecates==\n*Inactivity: You lose 1 piety per 700 turns, on average (1/35 chance every 20 turns).\n*Casting any [[Necromancy]] or [[List of spells by flag#Unholy|unholy]] spell. (Penance)\n*Knowingly using an [[evil item]]. (Penance)\n*Attacking allies or neutral beings. (Penance)\n*Attacking or killing non-hostile [[holy]] beings. (Penance)\n*Using a [[talisman of death]]. (Excommunication)\n\n==Given Abilities==\n'''[[Piety|Piety level -]]''': \"Practitioner\"\n*'''Protection from Harm''' - Elyvilon may negate an attack that would otherwise kill you. This can activate even if you're under penance. The chance is piety-dependent and significantly higher than the other good gods, starting from 10% at 0 piety and becoming guaranteed at 6* piety. This will usually trigger a piety-gated timeout, and the lifesaving chance is dramatically reduced during this timeout. See below for more details. (Passive, no cost)\n'''[[Piety|Piety level *]]''': \"Comforter\"\n*'''Purification''' - The following conditions are removed: [[sick]]ness, [[drain]]ing, [[poison]], [[confusion]], [[slow]], and [[petrify]]ing. Restores all [[stats]] to their maximum. This ability can be used while confused. (3 MP, 2-4 Piety)\n'''[[Piety|Piety level **]]''': \"Caregiver\"\n*'''Heal Other''' - The target monster gains <code>2d(10 + Invocations/3) + (Invocations/3) + 8</code> HP. (2 MP, 2-4 Piety)\n\n: Using this ability on a hostile monster may pacify it, earning you the [[XP]] you'd gain for killing it. Every time you attempt this, the game compares your \"healing factor\" against the creature's max HP. If you beat this test, the creature is pacified and leaves via the nearest staircase up. Note that not all monsters can be pacified.\n\n: Healing factor is a random number between 0 and <code>(Invocations + 1)×(HP_healed)/3</code>. HP_healed considers what you ''would have'' healed, even if the monster currently has full HP. I.e., monsters at full HP have the same chance to be pacified as a monster at 1% HP. Healing factor is then multiplied by a number depending on the monster's type.\n\n:{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n! Monster || Factor Multiplier\n|-\n| Animals || ×3\n|-\n| Holy || ×1.5\n|-\n| Other Humanoids || ×1\n|-\n| Undead || ×0.75\n|-\n| Demon || ×0.6\n|-\n| Mindless || ×0 (Impossible)\n|}\n\n:The following chart shows the max HP of monsters you can conceivably pacify, based on your Invocations skill:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n|'''Invocations'''\n|'''Max HP: Human Intelligence'''\n|'''Max HP: Animal Intelligence'''\n|-\n|0||3||9\n|-\n|6||27||81\n|-\n|12||58||175\n|-\n|18||98||294\n|-\n|27||173||518\n|}\n\n\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ***]]''': \"Mender\"\n*'''Heal Self''' - You gain <code>2d(10 + Invocations/3) + (Invocations/3) + 8</code> HP. (2 MP,  3-5 Piety)\n:The following table shows the HP gained, based on your Invocations skill:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n|'''Invocations'''\n|colspan=\"2\"|'''Healing'''\n|-\n| 0||2d10 + 8||10-28\n|-\n| 6||2d12 + 10||12-34\n|-\n|12||2d14 + 12||14-40\n|-\n|18||2d16 + 14||16-46\n|-\n|27||2d19 + 17||19-55\n|}\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ****]]''': \"Pacifist\"\n* No new abilities.\n'''[[Piety|Piety level *****]]''': \"Purifying [Species]\"\n*'''Divine Vigour''' - Increases your max HP and MP by <code>5×(1 + (Invocations/3))</code> percent for <code>40 + (2.5×Invocations)</code> turns. Your current HP/MP are also increased by this percent. This ability can be used while confused. (Costs 6-9 Piety)\n'''[[Piety|Piety level ******]]''': \"Bringer of Life\"\n* Lifesaving becomes guaranteed while not on timeout.\n\n==Punishments==\n{{flavour|Elyvilon forgives followers for abandonment; however, those who later take up the worship of an evil god will be punished. (Kikubaaqudgha, Yredelemnul, Makhleb, Lugonu, Beogh and Dithmenos are evil gods.)\n\nElyvilon is not a god known for wrath. Still, those earning Elyvilon's ire will find the Healer occasionally protecting their foes from death.\n\nElyvilon's wrath lasts for a relatively long duration.}}\n\nElyvilon will only [[divine retribution|punish]] you if you convert to an evil god (Beogh, Dithmenos, Yredelemnul, Lugonu, Kikubaaqugdgha, or Makhleb). Switching to other gods or breaking Elyvilon's conduct will not result in any wrath, and converting to [[Zin]] or [[The Shining One]] will transfer half of your [[piety]] to them.\n\nElyvilon will punish you by sometimes healing hostile monsters about to be killed by you or your allies, though [[List of tentacles|tentacles]] and other hostiles weaker than you will usually not be healed.\n\n==Strategy==\nElyvilon is a relatively simple god. Both Heal Other and Heal Self are valuable \"panic buttons\" - they can bail you out of many bad situations. While Ely's abilities can be considered bland (there's no ability like [[Ru]]'s Apocalypse or [[Lugonu]]'s Corruption), they are still strong in their own right.\n\nElyvilon inflicts no [[divine retribution|wrath]] unless you switch to an [[evil]] god. So if you haven't found a desired god yet, you can worship Ely in the meantime.\n\n===Ability Strategy===\n*Purification can save you from a variety of status effects. For example, [[basilisk]]s are countered by this ability.\n\n*Heal Other is basically an instant-kill attack - if it works against a monster, the monster will stop attacking you (unless you are in the monster's way). You can pacify threats before they even notice you. Due to the healing factor, Heal Other is most effective against animals, such as [[hydra]]s, [[dragon]]s, and [[thorn hunter]]s.\n**Note that pacified monsters are ''not'' friendly. If you are in a monster's way, you'll be attacked. Pacified monsters will walk towards a random staircase, so try and get out of the way of stairs if you can.\n**You ''can'' use Heal Other to restore [[allies]]' HP, but this is generally inefficient. [[Summoner]]s are better off creating a new summon.\n\n*Heal Self is a reusable [[potion of heal wounds]]. Very useful - it can save you from dying on the next turn.\n\n*Divine Vigour is a stat buff. Use it pro-actively before fighting dangerous monsters. It can also be used to restore some HP and MP in a pinch.\n\n===Lifesaving===\nElyvilon's protection from harm has two methods of lifesaving, which function differently. Whenever your health would be reduced to 0, Elyvilon will try to save your life as follows:<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|religion.cc|4137}}</ref>\n*Firstly, the usual good god lifesaving chance is rolled. This chance is the same as the other good gods, and increases linearly from 10% at 0 piety to 26% at 6*. If this chance succeeds, your life is saved with no timeout.\n*Otherwise, if you are not already on a timeout, Elyvilon will save your life with a <code>piety/160</code> chance, triggering a timeout. The timeout lasts until you gain 20-30 piety from exploration.\nWhich one of these choices is chosen is not revealed to the player at any point. The first, general good god lifesaving chance, can still trigger when on timeout. If your life is saved, only the final fatal blow is prevented, and other sources of damage may result in death on the same turn. Thus, this cannot be relied upon when fighting multiple enemies.\n\nThe effect of all of this is that Elyvilon's lifesaving chance steps down significantly with every recent intervention. Some chances are given in the table below, for the piety breakpoints, depending on the number of recent lifesaving interventions. The last row is the absolute minimum the lifesaving chance can ever be, and is the same as the lifesaving chance for the other good gods.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Recent Interventions \\ Piety !!15 (worship)!!30 (*.....)!!50 (**....)!!75 (***...)!!100 (****..)!!120 (*****.)!!160 (******)\n|-\n|0||19.8%||29.3%||41.6%||56.2%||70%||80.5%||100%\n|-\n|1||16.3%||20.2%||24.6%||29.5%||34.3%||38.0%||45.2%\n|-\n|2||14.3%||16.2%||18.5%||21.3%||24.1%||26.4%||31.0%\n|-\n|3||13.1%||14.4%||16.2%||18.7%||21.2%||23.2%||27.3%\n|-\n|∞||11.5%||13%||15%||17.5%||20%||22%||26%\n|}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.32]], the formula for lifesaving chances was tweaked. For the old formula, see [http://crawl.chaosforge.org/index.php?title=Elyvilon&oldid=80532#Lifesaving this revision].\n*Prior to [[0.28]]:\n**Elyvilon' Heal Self was named Greater Healing and unlocked at 4*, with a complementary 1* ability Lesser Healing.\n**Pacifying creatures with Heal Other gave 50% XP compared to a kill. \n**Purification was 3* and slightly more expensive. \n**Worshippers had to call for active Divine Protection to have a greater chance to save their life. The ability forbade attacking, and reduced piety by 20+1d20 if you had a 100% to life save (at 5* piety). \n**[[Frenzied]] monsters were considered \"neutral\" and caused penance if harmed.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the three good gods forbid [[cannibalism]].\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Divine protection always worked at 130 piety, instead of 120 piety (or 5*).\n*Prior to [[0.23]], followers of Elyvilon could pacify [[pandemonium lord]]s and [[player ghost]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], Elyvilon's wrath could [[confusion|confuse]] players, inflict random [[Miscast#Poison_Magic|Poison Magic miscasts]], and reduce the enchantments of any non-artifact weapon in a player's inventory. \n*Prior to [[0.19]], followers of Elyvilon lost piety for letting their allies die.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Elyvilon was unable to pacify insects. Also, it was easier to pacify creatures of the player's genus.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], players could select the [[Healer]] class to begin the game worshiping Elyvilon. Also, Elyvilon offered two pacification abilities, and piety grew through pacifying foes and destroying weapons.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Elyvilon could also pacify insects.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], Elyvilon offered an ability called Restoration, which only restored [[rot]] damage. This was merged into Purification.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], used to grant piety over time (+1 every 240 turns, up to 150), and switching to [[Zin]] or [[TSO]] incurred no wrath.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{gods}}\n[[Category:Good Gods]]"}

{"title":"Shadows","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shadows","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{flavour|It reduces the distance the wearer can be seen at and can see.}}\n\n'''Shadows''' is an [[ego]] found on [[scarves]]. A scarf of shadows reduces your [[LOS]] by 1, in turn reducing the distance you can attack or be attacked at.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Useful when trying to sneakily steal a [[rune of Zot]]. Or to be sneaky in general; less sight means less chances for a monster to wake before you [[stab]] them.\n**[[Kobold]]s have their LOS reduced to 3, which is even tinier.\n*Scarves of shadow are also useful if you struggle with ranged enemies, such as [[centaur]]s. Though a scarf of [[repulsion]] is typically better suited for this task, repulsion has no effect on attacks like an orc priest's [[Smiting]].\n*Characters reliant on ranged attacks might still find the scarf useful, though you'll have less range to blast enemies before they get to you.\n\n==History==\n*Scarves of shadows were added in [[0.26]]. In this version only, scarves of shadows would reduce your [[spellpower]]."}

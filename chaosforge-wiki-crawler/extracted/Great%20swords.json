{"title":"Great swords","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Great_swords","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\nIn pre-DCSS versions of ''Crawl'', there existed a skill for '''Great swords''', as separate from [[long blade]]s.  Initially, it only governed the use of [[great sword]]s, although [[triple sword]]s were in fact added before the skill was removed.\n\n==Usefulness==\nWhile this skill applied to a very limited selection of weapons, one should remember that they were, at the time, the most powerful weapons in the game.  Artefacts were few and far between, and most other weapon types were distinctly worse.  Still, many characters would already have an endgame weapon they were skilled with by the time they stumbled upon a great sword (in earlier versions of Crawl, a well-enchanted mundane weapon served perfectly well as an endgame weapon).\n\nNot too many species had good aptitudes for Great Swords: only [[Kenku]] ([[Tengu]]), [[Hill Orc]]s, [[Hill Dwarf|Hill Dwarves]], and [[Minotaur]]s had sub-100 (\"positive\") aptitudes, while a few others had aptitudes of 100 (i.e. 0 in the current system).\n\n==History==\nThe Great Swords skill was removed in Crawl 3.40, long before DCSS.  Notably, though, it was still present in Linley Henzell's last release of Crawl, namely 3.30.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete skills]]"}

LRD cannot target objects behind transparent walls, nor can it target [[tree]]s.\n\nLRD can also target creatures made from hard or brittle substances. These include:\n*Monsters made of bone: generic [[skeleton (monster)|skeletons]], [[skeletal warrior]]s, [[ancient champion]]s, [[bone dragon]]s, [[revenant]]s, [[flying skull]]s, [[curse skull]]s, [[Murray]] (but ''not'' [[lich]]es, [[ancient lich]]es or [[dread lich]]es)\n*Monsters made of rock and stone: [[earth elemental]]s, [[gargoyle (monster)|gargoyles]], [[rockslime]]s, [[ushabti]]u, [[Vv]], most other [[statue]]s\n*Monsters made of ice: [[ice beast]]s, [[ice statue]]s, [[simulacrum (monster)|simulacra]], [[nargun]]s, [[block of ice|blocks of ice]] (but ''not'' [[ice devil]]s or [[ice fiend]]s)\n*Monsters made of crystal: [[orange crystal statue]]s, [[obsidian statue]]s, [[crystal guardian]]s, [[crystal echidna]]s, [[Roxanne]]\n*Monsters made of metal: [[peacekeeper]]s, [[war gargoyle]]s, [[iron golem]]s, [[iron elemental]]s (but ''not'' [[iron imp]]s, [[rust devil]]s, or [[iron dragon]]s)\n*Miscellaneous hard monsters: [[toenail golem]]s, [[saltling]]s\n*Creatures that are [[petrify]]ing or petrified.\n*Player [[Gargoyle]]s\n*Players in [[Ice Form]] or [[Statue Form]]\n\nAfter a target is selected, LRD creates an explosion centered on the target. The size and damage depends on the target's material. This explosion cannot hit monsters behind a line of walls, but it ''can'' hit monsters out of [[line of sight]] (around a corner, through [[fog]], too far away).\n\n===Damage Formula===\nLRD deals <code>'''N'''d(5 + Power / 5)</code> damage, where N depends on the substance of the material.\n\nUsually, LRD's damage is reduced by [[AC]] 3 times, as a function of \"BEAM_FRAG\" damage.\n*When targeting a monster, the damage done to the target ignores AC completely. Surrounding monsters still get the usual 3x AC reduction, unless it is an ice explosion.\n*If the target is a monster made of ice, the explosion deals \"BEAM_ICE\" damage instead. This explosion only suffers 1x AC reduction, but the damage can be resisted by [[cold resistance]]. The target still takes untyped damage instead of cold damage.\n\n===Radius and Number of Dice===\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" style=\"width:38em;border-bottom:thin solid black;\"|Target\n!align=\"right\" style=\"width:3em;border-bottom:thin solid black;\"|Radius\n!align=\"right\" style=\"width:3em;border-bottom:thin solid black;padding-left:1em;\"|N\n|-\n|[[Toenail golem]]s\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 3\n|-\n|[[Iron golem]]s, [[peacekeeper]]s, and [[war gargoyle]]s\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n|[[Earth elemental]]s, [[saltling]]s, [[ushabti]]u, [[statue]]s, and [[gargoyle]]s\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 3\n|-\n|[[Orange crystal statue]]s, [[obsidian statue]]s, [[Roxanne]], and [[crystal guardian]]s\n|align=\"right\" | 2\n|align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n|Petrifying or petrified monsters\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 3\n|-\n|Icy or skeletal monsters\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 3\n|-\n|[[Dungeon_features#Rock_wall|Rock wall]]s, [[Dungeon_features#Stone_wall|stone wall]]s, [[granite statue]]s\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 3\n|-\n|[[Iron grate]]s\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n|[[Dungeon_features#Metal_wall|Metal wall]]s\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n|[[Dungeon_features#Crystal_wall|Crystal wall]]s\n|align=\"right\" | 2\n|align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n|[[Door]]s, stone arches\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 3\n|-\n|Petrified or petrifying player, [[Statue Form]], [[Ice Form]]\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 3\n|-\n|[[Gargoyle]] player\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 2\n|}\n\n==Strategy==\nLee's Rapid Deconstruction is similar to casting [[Sandblast]], with perfect accuracy, better range, and a 3x3 explosion. It's excellent for wiping out packs of unarmoured or high-[[EV]] opponents, like [[kobold]] vaults or swarms of [[killer bee]]s. Since the damage reduction from [[AC]] is applied 3 times, it is far less effective against high-AC enemies, like [[orc warrior]]s.\n\nOverall, LRD is a moderately viable attack spell throughout most of the game. Against single targets or high AC targets, [[Iron Shot]] is likely better, though that's a higher level spell. \n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*You can use LRD to hit dangerous creatures behind their allies. Either target the walls beside your target, or target a monster that's vulnerable to LRD. For example, you can use a [[necromancer (monster)|necromancer]]'s [[skeleton (monster)|skeleton]]s against it.\n*Because the shrapnel affects everything within range of the targeted object, you can cast LRD on a wall to blast anything lurking on the other side that you don't want in your LOS (e.g. [[oklob plant]]s).\n*While using LRD on a [[petrified]] (or petrifying) enemy will ignore all their AC, the petrified status will reduce ''all'' damage by 50%. It's usually better to target a wall against unpetrified enemy. You can petrify an enemy to hit a group of enemies, or petrify a monster if it's not near a wall.\n*A [[wand of acid]] can be used to lower enemy AC, greatly increasing the effectiveness of LRD.\n\n==Monster Version==\nThe monster version is identical to the player version. While in the presence of monsters that can cast LRD, [[Transmuter]]s should avoid entering [[Ice Form|Ice]] or [[Statue Form]]. Other characters should do everything possible to avoid being [[petrify|petrified]]. As [[Gargoyle]]s are always vulnerable, they should do what they can to avoid these monsters entirely, or failing that, to kill them as quickly as possible.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], LRD could not target indestructible walls.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], LRD had the ability to destroy walls.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], LRD would cause a larger, more damaging explosion when it destroyed a wall or monster. The chance for metal walls to break depended on spell power, and for crystal it was 50% instead of 33%.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], this spell had a chance to instantly destroy skeletal monsters and [[statue]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], LRD could be cast on an unnaturally hard rock wall to damage monsters on the other side. After [[0.10]], monsters will not be damaged if the wall is not capable of being shattered under any circumstances."}

It dealt up to 1d18 physical damage (affected by [[AC]]), but unlike [[Magic Dart]], had only mediocre accuracy and range. Like all [[rod]]-based spells, increasing [[Evocation]]s raised its accuracy and damage.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.13]], the rod of Striking was changed to activate upon making a melee strike, making the Striking spell obsolete.\n\nPrior to [[0.10]], [[Artificer]]s could choose to begin with this rod in place of a wand, but even then its usefulness was limited."}

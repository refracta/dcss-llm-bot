Like [[Unarmed Combat]], throwing weapons deal <code>(weapon base damage) + (Throwing skill)</code> base damage due to skill (as opposed to the usual +2% bonus for regular weapon skills). For example, 10 Throwing would double the base damage of a [[javelin]] (10+10), but the equivalent skill would only increase other weapons by 20%. Note that [[stone]]s get half the usual bonus.\n\nThrowing weapons are of limited quantity. All throwing implements have a chance to [[mulch]] - i.e., be destroyed - when thrown. When this happens, boomerangs, javelins, and large rocks will deal +33% damage. Javelins that mulch will not penetrate.\n\nUnlike proper [[Ranged Weapons]], Throwing is ''not'' affected by [[armour encumbrance]].\n\n==List of Throwing Weapons==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Since ammunition is so limited, you cannot use Throwing weapons for every fight. However, it can be a very powerful support tool.\n\n[[Javelin]]s are a key part of any Throwing specialist's arsenal. Javelins [[penetration|penetrate]] through enemies: they can hit enemies in the backlines, and/or hit multiple enemies at 100% damage. At high skill, javelins can deal massive damage to multiple enemies at once, at full [[LOS]] range.\n\nThrowing implements are more common in [[Shoals]] than [[Swamp]]. If the former branch is in your game, you may want to focus a little more on Throwing.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Even at 0 skill, throwing ''something'' is better than waiting for an enemy to approach. If available, you can throw [[stone]]s, [[boomerang]]s, or [[poisoned]] [[dart]]s at distant targets.\n*Javelins can get the [[silver]] brand, which is highly effective against [[chaotic]] enemies (including [[malmutate]]rs, [[the Royal Jelly]], and [[orbs of fire]]).\n*[[Large]] species ([[Troll]]s and [[Oni]]) are able to throw [[large rock]]s, which are both plentiful and high damage (20 base damage). They have a much greater reason to train Throwing than the regular-size species.\n*[[Throwing net]]s, [[poison]] [[dart]]s, and [[curare]] darts are all useful tools, though they do not benefit much from the actual Throwing skill. More skill will increase their accuracy and throw speed, but not the actual effect. It can still be wise to put a few points into Throwing for the extra bit of accuracy.\n*Even mage characters will often benefit from throwing in the early dungeon. When attacking sleeping monsters, a hit is almost guaranteed even without any skill in throwing. Therefore, dealing the first ranged hit with a throwing (or ranged) weapon instead of a spell is a useful way to conserve mana.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], there was no +33% damage bonus when ammo mulched.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Throwing [[crosstrain]]ed with [[Slings (skill)]]. Also, [[Hunter]]s and [[Arcane Marksmen]] could start with throwables.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], monsters carried significantly more throwing weapons, and throwing weapons were slightly more likely to generate on the floor.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], monsters consumed throwing ammunition. You could pick up throwing weapons that monsters used, and monsters could mulch them.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], there were more [[brand]]s for throwing ammunition. Javelins did not penetrate enemies without the [[penetration]] brand. \n*Prior to [[0.18]], throwing speed worked differently from other weapons. Throwing weapons had a mindelay of 0.5, and were overall faster to throw, but skill had less of an impact on throw speed.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], throwing speed was penalized by [[armour encumbrance]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], ranged & throwing combat was significantly different. In general, Throwing was less viable.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], [[Evaporate]] used the Throwing skill.\n\n'''Added Weapons'''\n*[[0.24]] - [[Boomerang]]s, [[dart]]s\n*[[0.14]] - [[Tomahawk]]s\n*[[0.3]] - Javelins, throwing nets\n\n'''Removed weapons'''\n*[[0.24]] - [[Blowgun]]s & [[needle]]s, [[tomahawk]]s\n*[[0.15]] - [[Dart]]s\n*[[0.14]] - [[Spear]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[club]]s, [[hand axe]]s (which can no longer be thrown)\n\n{{Skills}}\n[[category:Throwing]]\n[[Category:Weapon skills]]"}

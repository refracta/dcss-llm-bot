{"title":"Dark maul","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dark_maul","type":"raw","data":"{{version|030}}\n{{flavour|A large, iron-shod maul specialised for dealing massively powerful blows. Such power comes at a price: the maul's head is so heavy it takes a great length of time to lift it up for another swing.\n\n----\n\n“This caliber should be appropriate.”<br>\n-prince Dajmiech, “Kajko and Kokosz: The Battle with Dajmiech”, Janusz Christa\n}}\n\n[[File:dark maul.png]] '''''the +10 dark maul'''''\n\n+10 maul (modified [[great mace]]: 37 base damage, -2 base accuracy, 24 base delay)<br>\n[[Heavy]] brand\n\n==Desirability==\nA single swing from the '''dark maul'''<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|art-data.txt|1303}}</ref> will crush through virtually any monster's armour for ultra-heavy damage, but even at maximum [[Maces & Flails]] skill, it will still take you 15 or 16 [[aut]]s to attack - over 2x the mindelay of the slowest normal weapons. In practice, every swing (at ''max'' skill) gives a 57.5% to pass your next turn. On the plus side, it has over 2.5x the base damage of [[giant club]]s, which most characters can't use.\n\nIs this trade-off actually worth it? High M&F skill is nearly essential. It reduces the attack delay to a tolerable level, and it also helps with accuracy. Each miss is much more punishing than a standard weapon; even with a +10 enchantment, you may miss often enough that it's a problem. Compared to a well-enchanted [[great mace]], the dark maul checks AC much less, but always risks an enemy double turn, and procs less [[auxiliary attack]]s. Basically, the maul is not a weapon to suddenly switch to Maces & Flails for - have high skill to make full use of the maul, and watch out for the delay.\n\nIt’s important to know when to use the maul and when to put it away for something faster. Try to avoid using the dark maul in open areas or when facing multiple opponents at once, because the high delay makes it impossible to respond quickly to unexpected damage spikes or new enemies entering [[line of sight]].\n\n[[Okawaru]] is a great god for the dark maul. Finesse can ''halve'' the delay of any weapon, making the maul a lot less risky to use, and Heroism helps boost skill levels. [[Manifold Assault]] can make the delay much more manageable, as you're swinging from a distance (not to mention potentially pasting multiple targets per swing).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the dark maul had the [[vorpal]] brand, 52 base damage, and 30 base delay. It was changed to accommodate the [[heavy]] brand.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], the dark maul had only 44 base damage and a meager +6 enchantment level.\n*The dark maul was added in [[0.14]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]"}

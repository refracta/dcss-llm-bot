{"title":"Jiangshi","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Jiangshi","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For a list of all vampires, see [[list of vampires]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Jiangshi''' are blindingly fast [[undead]] monsters with two moderately powerful [[vampiric]] attacks. They can be found in [[the Crypt]], often as members of [[vampire mage]] bands, or summoned by other monsters with the [[Summon Undead]] spell.\n\nAkin to [[sixfirhies]], jiangshi occasionally skip turns. They have a 21/45 (~46.7%) chance to skip a turn, resulting in erratic bursts of movement. Accounting for this, they have an effective move speed of about 16 and action speed of about 9.5. \n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While by no means harmless, jiangshi are simple melee threats. A character entering the Crypt shouldn't have too much trouble against them, unless you have low AC.\n\n==Trivia==\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangshi Jiangshi] (otherwise known as hopping vampires) are taken from Chinese mythology and function much like the western notion of zombies. Covered in mold and stiffened by rigor mortis, they cannot move their legs sufficiently to walk, and thus hop at their prey before draining them of their ''qi''.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], jiangshi could [[see invisible]].\n*Jiangshi were added in [[0.13]]."}

{"title":"Dingnat the Sneak","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dingnat_the_Sneak","type":"raw","data":"{{diary}}\n== Dingnat the Sneak, Spriggan Assassin ==\nDingnat the Sneak, a Spriggan Assassin, entered the Dungeon in search of the Orb of Zot with a deadly dagger and some poisoned needles, one of which was curare-tipped in case he needed to take down an ogre.\n\nAlmost immediately he came upon an elven robe, which was easier to sneak in than his current clothing. Not much farther into the dungeon he came across his first target; a sleeping rat. After four missed shots with his blow gun, he finally poisoned the rat. The vermin charged and Dingnat quickly cut it to pieces with his dagger. The sleeping newt he encountered next was much easier to dispatch with a quick stab from his dagger without so much as waking it.\n\nAfter some more exploring he began encountering kobolds with some frequency, along with an occasional goblin. None of them offered much of a challenge for Dingnat. Before he finished mapping out the first level of the dungeon, Dingnat found a scroll that enchanted his dagger, making it more deadly. He was ready to head down to level 2. Before long he ran into a dead end but a quick search revealed a hidden door. \n\n<gallery>\nImage:Dingnat 01.jpg|Dingnat the Sneak, Spriggan Assassin, begins his journey into the dungeon.\nImage:Dingnat 02.jpg|Dingnat spots his first target.\nImage:Dingnat 03.jpg|Dingnat hits a dead end. \nImage:Dingnat 04.jpg|A quick search reveals a hidden door. \n</gallery>\n\n== Things heat up ==\nA little more sneaking, a little more stabbing, and Dingnat could tell his skills were improving. Along the way he found a ring that improved his dexterity and yet he could not remove it if he tried. He stabbed his way through the second level of the dungeon with no trouble. It wasn't until he began wandering level three that he ran into a problem. His swift speed allowed him to make an escape, peppering gnolls with poisoned needles as he retreated. Eventually, Terence caught up with Dingnat and he, too, was peppered with poisoned needles.\n\nAfter a little more exploring, Dingnat found a mysterious wand. He picked it up and zapped a nearby quokka, who immediately began to follow and protect Dingnat. Unfortunately, the effect soon wore off and Dingnat was forced to brutally murder the poor quokka.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Dingnat 05.jpg|Dingnat achieves level 2.\nImage:Dingnat 06.jpg|Uh oh!\nImage:Dingnat 07.jpg|The gnolls are dead but Terence is ready to fight.\nImage:Dingnat 08.jpg|Dingnat's pet quokka.\n</gallery>\n\n== A new dagger and a close call ==\nOn the next level, Dingnat killed an orc who was carrying a poisoned dagger and quickly looted it. After coming across another orc and a pack of jackals it was clear that this dagger was a good find. That didn't stop Dingnat from having a close call with an approaching hound, who proved to be just as fast as Dingnat, but after quaffing a potion of healing, the hound was vanquished. Shortly after, Dingnat came across another hero. Luckily, she was sleeping. All too easy.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Dingnat 09.jpg|Jackal massacre.\nImage:Dingnat 10.jpg|Close call with a hound.\nImage:Dingnat 11.jpg|Jessica was caught sleeping...\nImage:Dingnat 12.jpg|...and she paid the price.\n</gallery>\n\n== Devotion to Okawaru ==\nMany more creatures died in their sleep as Dingnat made his way deeper into the dungeon until he came across a temple. He decided it was time to devote himself to Okawaru, the god of battle. Dingnat's first offering to Okawaru is an ogre, he must be pleased.\n\nAfter running away from some seriously tough creatures, Dingnat found himself looking at another easy target; sleeping Sigmund... but Sigmund woke up! After Sigmund's first attack it was clear that Dingnat needed to get the hell out of there. He quickly used one of his teleport scrolls and hoped it would kick in soon enough. Luckily, Sigmund was not able to get off another blast of fire before Dingnat vanished.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Dingnat 13.jpg|Praying to Okawaru.\nImage:Dingnat 14.jpg|An ogre makes an excellent first sacrifice.\nImage:Dingnat 15.jpg|Sleeping Sigmund.\nImage:Dingnat 17.jpg|Sigmund is dangerous when he is awake.\n</gallery>\n\n== Battle with Sigmund ==\nDingnat then roamed the dungeon, picking off the more powerful beasts one by one. Eventually, he came upon Sigmund again. This time, he was ready with a potion of resistance and began to pepper Sigmund with poisoned needles. The needles weren't having much of an effect on Sigmund, so Dingnat decided it was time to use the curare-tipped needle to even the odds. He followed up with a few blasts from his wand of frost and Sigmund was nearly dead. Dingnat moved in for the kill with his dagger, but before he could make it Sigmund was dead from poison. Okawaru was very pleased.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Dingnat 18.jpg|Fighting Sigmund with the protection of a potion.\nImage:Dingnat 19.jpg|Delivering a crucial blow.\nImage:Dingnat 20.jpg|Sigmund dies.\nImage:Dingnat 21.jpg|Honoring Okawaru.\n</gallery>\n\n==Author's notes==\nI'm currently playing Dingnat in version 0.4.3 of Dungeon Crawl. I will update the diary with his progress and eventually posts his obituary when he dies.\n\n[[User:SockMonkeh|SockMonkeh]] 01:01, 26 November 2008 (MST)"}

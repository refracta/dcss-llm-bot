{"title":"Cacodemon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cacodemon","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Cacodemons''' are extremely dangerous [[tier-2 demon]]s. They wield a wide variety of debilitating ranged attacks, occasionally [[malmutate|mutate]] the player, and have a powerful, irresistible energy attack. They are found in [[the Abyss]], the [[Hell]]s, and [[Pandemonium]] (particularly in [[Mnoleg]]'s domain), and can be summoned by certain monsters through the [[Summon Greater Demon]] spell.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*A source of [[mutation resistance]] and high [[willpower]] will protect you from most (but not all) of their attacks; kill them quick to avoid an unlucky Malmutate getting through to you.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], cacodemons had [[Slow]] and [[Confuse]] instead of [[Vitrify]]. Also, they had '''Energy Bolt''' instead of [[Bolt of Devastation]], which did not apply [[vulnerability (status effect)|vulnerability]].\n*Prior to [[0.30]], cacodemons had fast regeneration.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], they were tier-1 demons. They also used to be fairly pathetic, as their energy bolt, slow, and confuse spells all used to be the near-worthless [[Call Imp]].\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

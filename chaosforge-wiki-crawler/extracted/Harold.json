{"title":"Harold","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Harold","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Harold the Weathered''' is a [[unique]] human bounty hunter who generates with several [[throwing net]]s, a decent weapon, and moderately heavy [[armour]]. He has high HP and some strong spells which severely limit your ability to escape, but he has no resistances and is only about as strong as an [[orc knight]] in melee.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:7-11\n*The [[Orcish Mines]]:1\n*[[The Lair]]:1-2\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The spell [[Harpoon Shot]] coupled with his [[throwing net]]s can make it extremely difficult to escape Harold, as he will repeatedly pull you towards him and trap you there whilst pummeling you with his competent melee skills.\n*Watch out for his [[Sentinel's Mark]], which will often have an extremely high success rate (about 80%) unless you've found [[willpower]]-enhancing equipment. If he tags you with it, you'll have enemies from all over the entire floor showing up while Harold keeps you pinned down. As a result, it may be best to fight Harold on a cleared floor where there will be no enemies for him to attract.\n**If you run into Harold and aren't ready to fight him, consider escaping to a different floor and coming back through a different staircase to avoid him. Having a good [[Stealth]] score makes this easier as you might escape his notice, but even heavily armored brutes can generally manage to get away as long as he stays right at the edge of your line of sight.\n*Harold can't see invisible, so feel free to quaff a potion and then hack away. Any other methods of buffing yourself (such as [[might]], [[haste]], [[berserk]], etc.) work as well.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.22]], Harold generated later (D:10-12, Lair:1-4 and Orc:1), had worse armour and weapons, and had the spells [[Bolt of Fire]] and [[Blink]] instead of [[Harpoon Shot]] and [[Sentinel's Mark]].\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

{"title":"Slaying","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Slaying","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n'''Slaying''' ('''Slay''') is a property that increases your [[accuracy]] and [[damage]] in melee and ranged combat. It doesn't affect [[spell]]s, [[wand]]s, or anything else. It is functionally identical to weapon [[enchant]]ment, but affects unarmed attacks and [[auxiliary attacks]] as well.\n\n==Mechanics==\nIn short, +1 slaying adds +1 to both accuracy roll and damage roll. Slaying is identical to weapon [[enchant]]ment, except it also affects auxiliary attacks.\n\n===Accuracy===\nSlaying bonuses add to the player's [[to-hit]] number. \n\nA player's total to-hit is compared to [[EV]] to determine a hit. Therefore, slaying is not a flat increase to % to hit, but an increase in accuracy on average.\n\n===Damage===\nSlaying bonuses add to the damage roll of a weapon, unarmed combat, and auxiliary attacks. The player gets a damage bonus of <code>uniform(enchant + slaying)</code> (that is, a roll from 0 to <enchant + slaying>). Slaying is not impacted by [[skill]] or [[strength]], but it ''is'' affected by [[brand]]s like [[freezing]] and [[flaming]].\n\n==Sources==\nThere are a number of sources of slaying bonuses:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|player.cc|3494}}</ref>\n\n*A [[ring of slaying]].\n*[[Artefact]]s may provide a bonus or penalty, displayed as {Slay Â±X}.\n*The spell [[Fugue of the Fallen]] provides a variable amount of slaying, increasing by 1 for every monster killed.\n*The [[Wu Jian Council]]'s Heavenly Storm provides a variable slay and [[EV]] bonus, starting with 5 and increasing by 1 for every martial attack you perform.\n*[[Gloves]] with [[hurling]] ego provide a +4 slaying bonus to [[Throwing]] weapons.\n\nAnd sources of negative slaying:\n*[[Ru#Sacrifices|Sacrifice Courage]]'s Horrified condition.\n\nThere are also a number of slaying-like effects:\n*The [[Might]] status gives a flat +1d10 bonus to melee damage. This is added as a separate effect from slay/enchantment. For example, having Might and +10 slay (1d10 + 1d11 - 1) would be more consistent damage-wise than +20 slay (1d21 - 1) would be, even if the average increase in damage is roughly the same. It doesn't increase to-hit.\n*Gloves with the [[Infusion]] ego give +4 to the damage bonus of only melee attacks (not auxiliary or ranged attacks), at the cost of 1 MP per strike. They don't increase to-hit.\n*[[Corrosion]] lowers damage bonus and AC by 4 per rank of corrosion. It doesn't lower to-hit.\n*[[Ru]]'s Sacrifice Eye functions like a -5 to-hit malus, though it affects magic too, and doesn't lower damage.\n\n==Strategy==\nMelee and ranged characters will want as much slaying as they can afford. Slaying is relatively better for quicker weapons, as its damage is independent from weapon base damage. Be rational about it: a +2 slaying bonus does not make a -1 randart [[leather armour]] a worthwhile proposition on your [[Mi]][[Be]].\n \n[[Strength]] adds 2.5% damage from a weapon's (base damage * skill multiplier). For the purposes of damage only, 1 strength equals 1 slay when damage is 40 after accounting for skill, but before accounting for strength. The higher the pre-strength damage, the better strength is. However, slaying also increases your [[to-hit]], while strength does not. Also, if you have aux attacks, slay becomes better. Aux attacks have low base damage, so the slay bonus is proportionally better than strength for auxes.\n\nSlaying doesn't affect spells, except for spells that attack with your weapon, so it's not important for most casters.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.15]], there were separate slaying bonuses for accuracy and damage. Bonuses were shown in the form ''+x, +y'', where ''x'' was the accuracy bonus, and ''y'' was the damage bonus\n*Prior to [[0.10]], slaying bonuses for damage were added to the weapon's base damage, meaning that they would be increased by having high weapon/[[Fighting]] skill.  When this was changed, slaying bonuses were generally increased to compensate.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

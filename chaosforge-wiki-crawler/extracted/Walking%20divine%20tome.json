{"title":"Walking divine tome","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Walking_divine_tome","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Walking divine tomes''' conjure living [[Smite]]s. [[Walking tomes]] are most often seen in [[the Depths]] and the wizlab, [[Tukima's Studio]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n* Divine tomes may not be as strong as [[walking crystal tome|crystal tomes]] or [[walking frostbound tome|frostbound tomes]], but Smite ignores [[AC]] and [[EV]] entirely.\n* Living spells work similarly to the player [[Foxfire]] spell. It creates a living spell entity, which must have a direct path to a hostile target. If you are in melee range with a tome in a corridor, most of the living spells will be unable to hit you. But unlike the foxfire spell, living spells can spawn behind the player (radius-2 of the walking tome), so a corridor is not foolproof.\n** You can attack a living spell, which will destroy it before it gets the chance to cast itself. Most types of AOE attacks can destroy a few spells while damaging the tome in the process.\n* [[Silence]] works on walking tomes, preventing them from creating living spells.\n\n==History==\n* Prior to [[0.30]], walking tomes could use Conjure Living Spells when [[silence]]d.\n* Walking tomes were added in [[0.28]]."}

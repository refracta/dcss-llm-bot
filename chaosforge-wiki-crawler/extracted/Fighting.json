{"title":"Fighting","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fighting","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Fighting skill increases your accuracy and damage in physical combat, and also increases your maximum health.}}\n'''Fighting''' is a generic combat skill. In addition to providing bonuses to melee and ranged combat, it increases your maximum [[hit points]].\n\n{{skill_aptitudes}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n===Combat===\nEvery attack you make (melee or ranged) gains the following bonuses from your Fighting skill:\n*'''[[Accuracy]]:''' Add <code>1d(Fighting + 1)</code>\n*'''Base Damage:''' Multiplied by <code>1 + 1d(Fighting/30)</code>\n\nThis is a smaller bonus than you get from training your weapon skill, especially since Fighting does not reduce [[weapon speed|weapon delay]]. However, the benefits from the two skills stack, making it worthwhile to train both.\n\n===HP Gain===\nThe ''base'' extra HP provided by Fighting is equal to:\n\n XP level × Fighting / 14 + (3 × Fighting + 1) / 2\n\nYour base HP is modified by your [[species]], [[mutation]]s, and/or [[transformation]]s, then rounded down to an integer. In the end, the final adjustment amounts to a gain of about 2.2% more HP per level of Fighting.\n\n==Strategy==\nFighting skill is useful for ''any'' character - even casters will want to train a significant amount of Fighting by the late game. This is because the HP bonus is so valuable; unlike [[AC]] and [[EV]], no attack can completely ignore your HP.\n\nWhile low HP species like [[Felid]] and [[Spriggan]] might get less HP from Fighting, this does not make Fighting useless. For these species, the HP can help prevent one-shot deaths.\n\n===HP Bonus Examples===\n*A level 5 Human with a Fighting skill of 5.0 receives a bonus of (5 × 5) / 14 + (3 × 5 + 1) / 2 = 1.79 + 8 = '''9 HP'''.\n*A level 15 Human with a Fighting skill of 12.5 receives a bonus of (15 × 12.5) / 14 + (3 × 12.5 + 1) / 2 = 13.39 + 19.25 = '''32 HP'''.\n*A level 27 Human with a Fighting skill of 27.0 receives a bonus of (27 × 27) / 14 + (3 × 27 + 1) / 2 = 52.07 + 41 = '''93 HP'''.\n*A level 27 Felid with a Fighting skill of 27.0 receives a bonus of ((27 × 27) / 14 + (3 × 27 + 1) / 2) × 0.6 = '''55 HP'''.\n*A level 27 Ogre with Robust 3, Rugged Brown Scales 3, and a Fighting skill of 27.0 receives a bonus of ((27 × 27) / 14 + (3 × 27 + 1) / 2) × 1.67 = '''155 HP'''.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the formula for extra HP from fighting was <code>(XP level × Fighting) / 8</code>.\n\n[[Category:Skills]]\n\n{{Skills}}"}

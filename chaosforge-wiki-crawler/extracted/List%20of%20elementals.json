{"title":"List of elementals","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_elementals","type":"raw","data":"{{version027}}\n\n'''Elementals''' are lumps of primal substance, such as earth or fire, inhabited by animating spirits. They are technically [[nonliving]], and usually only appear when summoned by another creature, though they may be found in the [[Elven Halls]] or in areas with a large concentration of their associated element. Although unintelligent and mostly incapable of ranged attacks, they tend to deal heavy elemental damage in melee, are entirely immune to any effect that needs to overcome [[willpower]], ignore damage from [[poison]] or [[negative energy]], and most have their own unique traits.\n\nYou can use [[Qazlal]]'s Elemental Force invocation to summon your own elementals based on what types of [[cloud]]s are around you.\n\n==Elemental Types==\n{{monsterlink|Air elemental}} - Swift, furious embodiments of the wind that can launch stunning jolts of electricity.\n\n{{monsterlink|Earth elemental}} - Slow and stocky, these brutes pound their opponents to paste... if they can catch up with them.\n\n{{monsterlink|Fire elemental}} - An aggressive fire spirit which leaves flame [[cloud]]s in its wake, and whose attacks engulf its victims in fire.\n\n{{monsterlink|Water elemental}} - Amorphous liquid horrors, water elementals batter their opponents while simultaneously drowning them.\n\n{{monsterlink|Elemental wellspring}} - A mass of water that issues forth both torrents of water and water elementals.\n\n{{monsterlink|Iron elemental}} - Far deadlier than an earth elemental, iron elementals are sturdier, slower, and capable of launching deadly iron projectiles at their foes. Luckily, they appear only in [[Dungeon Sprint]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], evoking a [[phial of floods]] would summon one or more friendly water elementals.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], all four elemental evocable items could summon friendly elementals.\n*In [[0.15]], the [[Summon Elemental]] player spell was removed.\n*In [[0.13]], the elemental evocable items were reworked.\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

They can be found in [[the Depths]], [[the Vaults]], and occasionally in [[Gehenna]] and lower parts of [[the Dungeon]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Fire resistance is recommended, but you should still be careful of them in melee. Even with rF+++, a giant hitting you with a [[great sword]] is going to cause some serious physical damage.\n*Fire giants usually spawn with lightly enchanted [[great sword]]s of flaming."}

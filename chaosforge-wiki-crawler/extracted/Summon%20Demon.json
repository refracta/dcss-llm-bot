Such demons are manageable individually, but the variety of possible summons can cause issues if you leave the summoner to their own devices. Certain demons may also be more problematic than others ([[chaos]]-[[brand]]ed attacks from [[chaos spawn]], [[Malmutate]] from [[neqoxec]]s, heavy [[cold]] damage from [[ice devil]]s, etc).\n\nAs with any summoning spell, the best way to get rid of the summons is by killing the summoner (though [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]] will do in a pinch).\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n{{Spell\n|name=Summon Demon\n|level=5\n|school1={{Summonings}}\n|school2=\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Summonings]]\n</div>\n|castingnoise=4\n|spellnoise=0\n|power cap=200\n|range=Self\n|flags=Unholy, Selfench, Mons Abjure\n|summons limit=3\n}}\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Summon Demon was castable by players.

{"title":"Maud","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Maud","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Maud the Forgotten''' is a [[unique]] melee fighter whose only notable trait is a tendency toward wielding powerful weapons. She can also spawn in (enchanted) heavy armour, with a wand, ring and potion.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:10-14\n*[[The Lair]]:3-8\n*The [[Orcish Mines]]:2-4\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nMaud is a spell-less warrior, so attack her from afar. She is not very dangerous in melee either; she has decent damage and a good weapon, but is only normal speed with poor [[AC]] and [[EV]]. Check her weapon to see if it's any good; demon weaponry is often very useful in the mid-game, especially if it's nicely branded.\n\nThe whole situation may change drastically if her armour gives her resistance against your primary source of damage (say, fire resistance versus your fire spells), the wand happens to be one of acid, the ring allowing her to go invisible and the potion being one of might, haste or berserk rage.\n\n==Trivia==\nMaud is a reference to the [[scroll of amnesia]] found in [http://www.nethack.org/ NetHack], a competing roguelike. When the [[scroll]] is read, in addition to causing maprot and ID-rot, it produces messages referring to Maud, the name itself being a reference to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maud_%28poem%29 Alfred Tennyson poem] of the same name.\n\n==History==\nMaud was removed in [[0.19]]\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

{"title":"Freezing Cloud","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Freezing_Cloud","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}{{AttackSpell\n|name=Freezing Cloud\n|formula = 0\n|maxdmg = 0\n|maxsp = 200\n|range = 5\n|target = Smite\n|special = '''Cloud damage''': (2d16)/2 + 5 ([[cold]]) <br> '''Cloud duration''': 3d(Power/4)}}\n\n'''Freezing Cloud''' is a level 5 [[Conjurations]]/[[Air Magic]]/[[Ice Magic]] spell which creates a mass of damaging [[freezing vapour]]s.\n\n==Useful Info==\nCreates 8 to 10 clouds of [[freezing vapour]] around a [[smite-targeted]] tile (range 5). This spell uses \"flood fill\": casting it on an open space will create a perfect 3x3 square (if you get 9 clouds), but using it in a corridor will spread the same 9 clouds throughout the corridor. For the purposes of flood fill, existing clouds are considered as solid objects. Clouds can spill out of [[line of sight]], though they will dissipate instantly.\n\nFreezing vapours deal <code>(2d16)/2 + 5</code> (6-21) [[cold]] damage per turn, ignoring [[EV]] but not [[AC]]. Spellpower does not increase damage of clouds, it only increases the duration.\n\nClouds cannot replace other clouds. You are unable to target or affect a tile that already has another cloud on it. Creatures inside another cloud will be safe from Freezing Cloud (unless they willingly step into it).\n\nAny player-created cloud will vanish immediately when outside their line of sight.\n\n==Strategy==\nA powerful and MP-efficient spell, great if you can get it by the [[Lair]] and/or its branches. Many enemies in the Lair itself, [[Snake]], and [[Swamp]] are cold-blooded, while clouds ignore the high [[EV]] of many enemies in [[Spider]]. It still performs well in later branches ([[Vaults]], [[Elven Halls|Elf]]), and can slow [[list of draconians|draconians]] in [[Zot]]. Also, it is smite-targeted, meaning you can use clouds to snipe pesky [[boggart]]s and the like.\n\nKnowledge of enemy AI can be useful with this spell. Enemies with high HP and high [[HD]] will walk right through the clouds (if you place clouds in the shortest path). Enemies with low HP will tend to avoid entering the clouds, which you can use to your advantage. However, if an enemy is already in a harmful cloud, it won't try to avoid stepping into another cloud. \n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Be careful using it in hallways, as it can easily hit you if you cast it at too short a range.\n*Also be careful when using this spell around [[allies]]. Unless your allies are immune to cold ([[Summon Ice Beast]], namely), the clouds will either harm them or get in their way.\n*The mass of icy mist around an enemy can prevent them from hitting you with [[fire]]-based magic and attacks. [[Fire dragon]]s and [[orbs of fire]], for instance, will waste their attacks dispersing the clouds in front of them, saving you from taking the hit.\n*All clouds prevent other clouds from being placed on their tile. Assuming you have rC++ or so, spawning ice clouds on your own tile is a good defensive mechanism against a number of cloud-spawning enemies, like [[red draconian]]s or [[apocalypse crab]]s.\n*If you happen to know a sleeping enemy is around a corner, you can hit them before they enter your line of sight by casting the spell at a tile adjacent to the foe. The enemy will take damage and wake up, but won't automatically know you're there. They will instead wander around, potentially giving you a chance at another attack before they start retaliating.\n*All worshippers of [[Qazlal]] are immune to their own clouds, making this spell much more safe and versatile.\n\n==Monster Version==\nThe monster version of this spell functions similarly to the player version.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==Gallery==\n[[File:Cloud flood fill.png|thumb|left|300px|\"Flood fill\" treats clouds as solid objects.]]\n<div style=\"clear:left></div>\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], this spell was a level 6 Conjurations/Air Magic/Ice Magic spell.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], freezing vapours would dissipate faster when over [[lava]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], player-created clouds did not dissipate instantly when out of [[LOS]], only *4 faster.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], cloud durations were not affected by being out of LOS."}

It is a two handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Battleaxes''' are large, powerful, and two handed axes. Though an [[executioner's axe]] is stronger, battleaxes are much more common, and require less skill to wield effectively.\n\n==Strategy==\nBattleaxes are a fairly decent weapon throughout the midgame. If you're skilled in Axes and haven't found a shield yet, then a battleaxe is almost a no-brainer. With a shield, the choice is less clear. Regardless, a [[brand]]ed battleaxe can be a strong weapon.\n\nThey are usually first encountered in the hands of [[orc warrior]]s; exploration of the [[Orcish Mines]] will likely turn up a decent one. The [[unique]] [[berserker]] [[Rupert]] occasionally generates with one as well. Like all axes, this weapon allows the player to [[cleave]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Battle axe1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Battle axe2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Battle axe3.png]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || [[Unrandart]] Battleaxes\n|-\n| '''[[Wrath of Trog]]''' || [[File:New wrath of trog.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.12]], battleaxes had 17 base damage and no [[cleaving]].\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Axes]]"}

{"title":"Brigand","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Brigand","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|A Brigand is a shady character who is especially good at killing, using daggers or darts. They start with a dagger, a robe and cloak, poisoned darts, and a few deadly and rare curare darts.}}\n'''Brigands''' are operatives who specialize in stealth and the killing of unsuspecting victims. They start with the tools to silently and quickly take down the living.\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Troll]], [[Demonspawn]], [[Spriggan]], [[Vine Stalker]], and [[Vampire]] are the recommended races if you pick a Brigand background.\n\n==Racial restrictions==\n[[Felid]]s are forbidden from becoming Brigands because they cannot throw darts. A Felid Brigand would start with the same items as a [[Monk]].\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+2 [[dagger]]\n*+0 [[robe]]\n*+0 [[cloak]]\n*9 [[poison]]ed [[dart]]s\n*3 [[curare]] darts\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Fighting]]: 2\n*[[Short Blades]]: 2\n*[[Throwing]]: 2\n*[[Dodging]]: 1\n*[[Stealth]]: 4\n\nChoosing Brigand adds 3 to your starting [[Strength]], 3 to your starting [[Intelligence]] and 6 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nBrigands are a good general starting background for stealthy types; the enchanted dagger handles early-game monsters fairly well, while the curare and poisoned darts are excellent for taking down tougher targets.\n\nDon't underestimate the power of [[curare]]. Curare deals a fair amount of damage on impact, then poisons and [[slow]]s the enemy. Almost all early-game threats up to [[Lair]] will be greatly weakened by these darts. Of course, this assumes that you ''hit'' the dart. A few points into [[Throwing]] skill will increase your accuracy.\n\nSince you start with 3 curare darts, and there's a 1 in 6 chance that they [[mulch]] (break) after fired, you'll have 18 shots on average. You can [[kite]] enemies in order to conserve them. Throw the curare dart, then back away and throw regular poisoned darts afterward, slowly whittling their HP down.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], most backgrounds were buffed; Brigands gained an extra poison and curare [[dart]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Brigands were called '''Assassins'''.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], Assassins began with a [[blowgun]] and their respective [[needle]]s of poison and curare.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the starting dagger had an enchantment of +2, +2.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Assassins began with [[potions of poison]] identified, and had 50 [[gold]].\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

They are nearly immune to all elemental damage but are susceptible to physical damage, non-elemental [[Conjurations]], or [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]]/[[Shatter]]; their slow speed also makes them easy to kite. Crystal golems are very rare, generally only appearing as guardians in certain [[vault]]s.\n\n===Variant Crystal Golem===\nYou may encounter several '''crystal guardians''' while exploring certain vaults, along with [[orange crystal statue]]s. Unlike normal crystal golems, these hulks are capable of casting [[Bolt of Fire]] and [[Bolt of Cold]]. Be aware that the vaults they inhabit are made of green crystal [[wall]]s, so they ''can'' [[multizap]] you if you stand in the wrong place. Bring appropriate resistances, lure them out one at a time, and prepare for a nasty battle.\n\n{{flavour|This crystal golem is so ensorcelled that it is immune to nearly any magic itself, and it can also shoot powerful beams of fire and cold at any trespassers.}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Hitting a golem with [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] creates a large blast of powerful crystal shards, useful for taking out crowds.\n*[[Bolt of Inaccuracy]] is also quite effective, though it'll probably take several shots to bring a golem down.\n*Kiting them works nicely, as almost any character can outrun them with ease.\n\n==History==\nCrystal golems were replaced with [[crystal guardian]]s in [[0.14]].\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

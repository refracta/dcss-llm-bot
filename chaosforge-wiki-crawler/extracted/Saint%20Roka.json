{"title":"Saint Roka","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Saint_Roka","type":"raw","data":"{{version|024}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Saint Roka the Messiah''' is a [[unique]] [[orc warlord]] of [[Beogh]] who leads a band of fellow [[list of orcs|orcs]] on a crusade for their [[god]]. Saint Roka is a very powerful melee fighter, usually found wielding a powerful two-handed weapon and wearing a heavily enchanted set of [[plate armour]], but they are also a threat at range due to their [[smiting]] and the [[crossbow]] they occasionally spawn with.\n\nSaint Roka allows [[Hill Orc]]s to convert to Beogh, like an [[orc priest]] would.\n\n==Location==\n*The [[Orcish Mines]]: 2\n*The [[Elven Halls]]:2-3\n*[[The Snake Pit]]:2-4\n*[[The Vaults]]\n*[[The Crypt]]\n*[[The Depths]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you ever start finding orcs \"where they shouldn't be\" (e.g. the [[Snake Pit]]), and you've ruled out [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]]s, be prepared for a Saint Roka encounter.\n*If Saint Roka lacks a crossbow, their [[smite]] hurts a lot less than their glaive, so tackling them from range is generally the less dangerous prospect.\n*Facing Saint Roka's entire cohort at once is often suicidal. Don't be afraid to show up, blast a few orcish minions, and then flee to safety.\n*Especially pious followers of [[Beogh]] may be able to convert Saint Roka to their cause, giving them an incredibly powerful permanent ally.\n*As strong as they are, Saint Roka can't [[see invisible]] (nor can their minions, barring an [[orc sorcerer]] or [[orc high priest]]). Using [[invisibility]] can help you either get a leg up in combat or escape in relative safety.\n\n==History==\n*Saint Roka was male before version [[0.24]].\n\n[[Category:Orc]]"}

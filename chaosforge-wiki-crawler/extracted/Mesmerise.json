{"title":"Mesmerise","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mesmerise","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Makes a targeted creature unwilling to move away from the caster. Leaving the caster's line of sight will end the effect.}}\n\n'''Mesmerise''' is a status and monster-only spell which causes you to find the caster irresistibly fascinating. If the spell beats your [[willpower]], you are unable to move away from the caster, and become unable to [[berserk]]. You can still attack, make non-movement actions, and \"uncontrolled\" movement (e.g. the [[Blink]] spell) as normal. Mesermise does not require line of fire to affect you.\n\n==Methods for Breaking Mesmerisation==\nYou can end the mesmerise status in the following ways:\n*Killing the source of the mesmerisation.\n*Losing [[line of sight]] to the caster ([[steam]] and [[scrolls of fog]] work well for this, as does walking behind any opaque wall)\n*Uncontrolled [[blink]]ing or [[teleport]]ing beyond the caster's line of sight. A [[scroll of blinking]] does not work for getting away. But you can blink closer to the monster mesmerising you, which might be useful when the caster is hiding behind other enemies.\n\nThe following methods only work if the source of mesmerisation is not the [[obsidian axe]]:\n*[[Polymorph]]ing the source of mesmerisation.\n*Disabling the source of mesmerisation ([[confusion]], [[petrification]], [[fear]], etc.).\n*Having enough time pass without the caster renewing the effect. Note that if you are currently mesmerised by a particular monster, you will always fail to resist any attempt at mesmerisation from that monster.\n*Reading a [[scroll of silence]] or casting [[Silence]], provided the source of mesmerisation is within your silence radius.\n\n==Sources==\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nThe spells [[Siren Song]] and [[Avatar Song]] can also mesmerise you, cast by the following monsters:\n*{{monsterlink|Merfolk siren}} \n*{{monsterlink|Merfolk avatar}}\n\nIn addition, the [[obsidian axe]] causes you to be mesmerised against any enemy in LOS.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], you could unwield the [[obsidian axe]] to get rid of all mesmerisation, including from spells.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], you could break out of mesmerisation by creating a [[noise]] of 20 loudness or higher, such as by reading a [[scroll of noise]], casting [[Lightning Bolt]], or evoking a [[wand of lightning]]. \n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

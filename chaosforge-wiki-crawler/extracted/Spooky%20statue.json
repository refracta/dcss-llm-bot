Unlike some [[statue]]s, they are not vulnerable to [[wands of disintegration]]. They can be found in certain endings of [[the Crypt]], usually behind a small lake and guarding a small cache of treasure.\n\n<!--spl-bot-begin-->\n==Spells==\n\n{{Spellcaster\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Haunt]]\n|slot2=''none''\n|slot3=''none''\n|slot4=''none''\n|slot5=''none''\n|slot6=''none''\n}}\n\n{{clear}}\n<!--spl-bot-end-->\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*An [[amulet of warding]] can help protect you from the summoned undead while you smash the statue to pieces.\n*They can't see you (and thus can't haunt you) if you're [[invisible]]. However, stepping into the water near them immediately makes you visible again. Fly over it while invisible to render these guys harmless.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.13]] they were replaced with patrolling [[curse skull]]s.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

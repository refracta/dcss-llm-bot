{"title":"Jelly","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Jelly","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | jellies}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Jellies''' are moderately weak creatures with [[acid]] damage. Their physical damage might be puny, but each hit can deal an extra 4d3 \"[[acid|acid splash]]\". Attacking a jelly in melee also causes an acid splash. Getting hit by acid, in turn, causes [[Corrosion]] - a stackable debuff that lowers [[AC]] and [[slaying]]. They can be found in early-mid [[Dungeon]], and in certain jelly-themed [[vault]]s.\n\nFollowers of [[Jiyva]] will have a frustrating time with jellies. Jiyva will constantly spawn jellies, who will eat items lying on the dungeon floor. They will devour anything except for [[artefact]] items and [[evocable|miscellaneous evocables]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks== \n*Their damage output is deceptive; all [[acid]]ic attacks deal an extra 4d3 damage against players. If at all possible, you should fight jellies from range to avoid their acid.\n*Wearing a [[ring of resist corrosion]] or another source of rCorr will greatly reduce the chance of corrosion, as well as the damage you take.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], jellies would eat items on the ground that the player had not seen, even if the player was not worshiping Jiyva. Also, they couldn't eat [[stone]]s and [[large rock]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], jellies could eat items on the ground that the player had seen.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], jellies were notorious for permanently weakening weapons and armour used in combat against them. The [[corrosion]] overhaul changed this.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], jellies would not split no matter how many items they consumed.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], jellies were more durable and hit harder, but only had speed 9."}

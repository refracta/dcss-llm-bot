{"title":"Death","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Death","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Death''' is a common ailment in ''Dungeon Crawl'', and almost invariably lethal.\n\nLike most roguelikes, death in ''Crawl'' is permanent - unless you are playing a [[Felid]] with extra lives, or are in [[explore mode]]. When your character dies, your save file is deleted and the character is moved to the [[morgue]]. A bones file is created for the floor (if eligible), and a [[player ghost]] may be generated in order to antagonize you in later games.\n\nThe only way to die is to drop below 1 HP from damage. Sources of damage include monsters, self-injury, and lingering effects like [[poison]].\n\nHere's an example of a quick death by monster damage...\n\n<pre>\nThe goblin hits you with a club.\nYou die...\n\n          18 Bob the Skirmisher (level 21, -2/15 HPs)\n             Began as a Human Fighter on Sept 14, 2007.\n             Slain by a goblin \n             ... wielding a +0 club (5 damage)\n             ... on level 1 of the Dungeon.\n</pre>\n\n...and here's one by falling down stairs.\n\n<pre>\nIn your confused state, you trip and fall down the stairs.\nOuch!  That really hurt!\nYou die...\n\n         122 Len the Firebug (level 4, 0/20 HPs)\n             Began as a Fire Elementalist on Oct 1, 2007.\n             Died by falling of an stair\n             ... on level 3 of the Dungeon.\n</pre>\n\n==History==\nCrawl historically had a few other ways of dying, like falling into [[lava]]. See the [[Instadeath]] article for more details.\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

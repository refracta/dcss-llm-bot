Press '''f''' or '''Enter''' to fire.\n**Pressing '''.''' after selecting a target will stop the attack on the tile specified.\n*'''[[f]]''': As '''v''', but works with any ranged item.\n**Pressing '''Q''' after will let you swap the item fired.\n*'''[[F]]''': Like '''f''', but you select the item to fire first.\n*'''[[Q]]''': [[Quiver]] an action, for use for most other commands.\n*'''[[Tab]]''': If wielding a launcher, attack the nearest monster with the quivered ammo, moving if necessary.\n*'''Shift-[[Tab]]''' or '''[[p]]''': Attack the nearest monster with the quivered ammo, without moving.\n\nThese commands can also be used for actions not traditionally called \"ranged combat\", such as [[spell]]s and [[abilities]].\n\n==Requisites==\nThe player is not always able to do ranged attacks:\n*[[Felid]]s are unable to use ranged weapons.\n*Any transformation that makes you unable to wield weapons: [[Spider Form]], [[Ice Form]], [[Blade Hands]], [[Dragon Form]], [[Pig Form]], [[Wisp Form]], [[Fungus form]], and [[Bat Form]].\n*Being entangled by a net or a [[web]].\n*Being [[berserk]].\n\nMonsters must have the [[:Category:Weapons armour|Weapons armour flag]] or the Use starting equipment flag in order to use ranged weapons.

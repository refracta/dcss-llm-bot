{"title":"Draining","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Draining","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n'''Draining''' is an effect that withers its victim, reducing their power. Its exact effect varies depending on whether the target is a monster or the player character.\n\n==Effect==\n===Player===\nThe Drained status temporarily reduces the player's maximum [[HP]], dependent on the amount of draining. It can stack until you have 1 max HP left. Draining won't wear off over time, but it can be cured as you gain [[XP]]. The drain status does not reduce the amount of XP you get.\n\n[[Elyvilon]]'s Purification cures all draining.\n\n===Monster===\nThe Drained status temporarily reduces monster [[hit dice]], which lowers their [[spell power]], melee [[accuracy]], [[willpower]], and a few other things. This effect can stack. For monsters, draining will wear off over time.\n\n==Sources==\nThe following sources derive from negative energy, and can be resisted by [[Life Protection]] (rNeg):\n*The titular [[draining (brand)|draining weapon brand]].\n*[[:Category:Drain experience flavour|Melee attacks]] of [[necrophage]]s, [[wight]]s, and some other monsters.\n*Certain types of [[negative energy]] damage, like [[Bolt of Draining]] and [[Necromancy|necromantic]] miscasts.\n*[[Death curse]]s from a [[list of mummies|mummy]].\n*[[Kikubaaqudgha]]'s wrath.\n\nThe following sources are unrelated to negative energy:\n*Removing an [[artefact]] with the ^Drain property.\n*Remaining airborne above lethal terrain after your temporary [[flight]] has expired.\n*Evoking an item with the [[Invisibility (ego)|invisibility]] ego (regardless of success).\n*Casting [[Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot]]\n*Using [[Formicid]]'s digging ability.\n*[[Ru]]'s divine abilities.\n*[[Hell's mystical force]].\n\n==Resistance==\nAny draining that is derived from [[negative energy]] is resisted by negative energy resistance. Monsters that are [[demonic]], [[undead]], [[nonliving]], or have one level of rN+ are immune to negative energy, thus immune to any sort of draining the player can inflict. For players, rN+ reduces draining by 50% / 75% / 100% for 1 / 2 / 3 levels, respectively.\n\nAnything unrelated to negative energy cannot be resisted by any means. [[Elyvilon]]'s Purification still works, however.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Late-game characters that have had the misfortune to be heavily drained may wish to seek out a relatively non-threatening side branch (such as the [[Elven Halls]]) in order to recover some of their health. Of course, gaining more experience in a challenging branch tends to remove the draining more quickly.\n*Against monsters, drain can be an effective debuff. Attacking over and over with a draining weapon will stack the status, greatly hindering the enemy. Draining weapons are ineffective against demonic/undead/nonliving foes, however.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the [[Zot clock]] inflicted drain instead of permanently reducing your maximum HP.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the Zot clock did not drain you or check draining.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], plant-holiness monsters were innately immune to negative energy (thus, immune to draining as well).\n*Prior to [[0.26]], draining temporarily reduced a player's [[skills]] instead of their maximum HP.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], negative resistance lowered draining and negative damage by 33/66/100% as your resistance increased.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], draining monsters would permanently reduce their [[HD]], making them slightly less dangerous, reducing their [[XP]] value, and eventually killing them outright if they hit 0 HD.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], getting drained would damage your character's experience, potentially forcing you down a level. This was permanent and was immediately lethal if you were ever reduced below 0 XP, but you could simply gain more experience to make up for it. This version of draining had no impact on your skills."}

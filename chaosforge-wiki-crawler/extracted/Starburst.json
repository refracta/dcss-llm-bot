It is powerful enough to set [[tree]]s on fire.\n\n==Strategy==\nStarburst is a strong AOE spell. It's valuable when surrounded, since it targets every space around you (and hits much further). Compared to [[Fireball]], Starburst deals more damage at most reasonable power levels, but has a chance to miss.\n\nIf a monster isn't on a direct line of fire, try backing up. Since monsters try to take the shortest path to you, when you back up, they'll eventually line up with Starburst's attack pattern. See [[#Gallery|Gallery]] for a demonstration.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Be careful around crystal [[wall]]s when using Starburst. As the bolts always travel in straight lines in all 8 directions, it's easy to accidentally bounce multiple bolts back at yourself.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"300px\" heights=\"300px\" class=\"left\" mode=\"nolines\">\nStarburst1.png|Monsters try to take one of the shortest paths at any one moment.\nStarburst2.png|So, when backing up, monsters will move themselves into a linear direction.\n</gallery>\n\n==History==\n*Starburst replaced the player version of the [[Bolt of Fire]] spell in [[0.25]], replacing the ability to target specific foes in favor of an 8-directional blast."}

It summons <code>1d(1 + [[HD]]/5)</code> monsters or groups fitting to the area that you are in. The duration of the summoned creatures is inversely dependent on their [[hit dice]], so weaker creatures will last longer. Monsters normally generated with equipment are given summoned versions of their weapons and armour which disappear with them. \n\nSummoned bands (such as a group of orcs) only count as one creature in regards to the summoning cap of 4.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Spell\n|name=Shadow Creatures\n|level=6\n|school1={{Summonings}}\n|school2=\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n* [[Book of Dreams]]\n* [[Book of Summonings]] \n</div>\n|castingnoise=4\n|spellnoise=0\n}}\n{{flavour|Creates replicas of creatures native to the caster's current location, weaving them from shadows and threads of Abyssal matter.

{"title":"Spriggan (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spriggan_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''This page is about the basic spriggan monster. For the player race, see [[spriggan]]. For a list of all monstrous spriggans, see [[list of spriggans]].''\n{{monster info|spriggan}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Spriggans''' are tiny guardians of the few forested areas found in the [[dungeon]] and its [[branch]]es. They are weak in melee combat, but move very quickly and often poison their foes at range or attack them with naturalistic magic.\n\n===Variant Spriggan===\nYou may encounter a '''spriggan hatter''' in a certain [[vault]]; this is no different from a standard spriggan. It is always found guarding a pile of hats and a spriggan corpse.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Spriggans are usually found late enough in the dungeon that they pose little threat in melee unless you allow them to surround you (which they will do at the first opportunity). The bigger threat usually lies in being heavily poisoned or torn apart by the magic of their druids. Pack [[poison resistance]] and be prepared to run, [[teleport]], or [[blink]] out of the forest if one of them casts [[Awaken Forest]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]] and the removal of food, the spriggan hatter was a '''spriggan baker'''.\n*Monstrous spriggans were added in [[0.7]]\n\n[[Category:Spriggan]]"}

{"title":"Shield of Resistance","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shield_of_Resistance","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''This page refers to the [[artefact]], not to be confused with a mundane [[shield]] bearing a [[resistance (ego)|resistance ego]].\n{{flavour|A bronze shield, looking almost exactly like a tortoise's shell. It was built by the adherents of an obscure minor faith, who imbued it with the power of their god. As the god is said to, this shield protects against sword and sling, frost and flame.}}\n[[File:Shield_of_resistance.png]] '''''the +2 shield of Resistance'''''\n\n+2 [[kite shield]]\n\n[[Fire resistance|rF++]]<br>\n[[Cold resistance|rC++]]<br>\n+80 [[willpower]] (Will++)\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''shield of Resistance'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|945}}</ref> is a wonderful item for almost any character, bearing two resistances and a healthy dose of willpower. Any character who can use a kite shield should at least consider using it.\n\nIf you already have all 3 properties covered (say, with the [[hat of the Alchemist]]), you may prefer a different shield. Also, those with high Shields skill may prefer a +8 [[tower shield]] for its non-elemental defense. Otherwise, you're unlikely to find a better shield than this.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the shield of Resistance only provided one rank each of fire, cold, and magic resistance.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], this unrand had a +5 enchantment.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Shields]]"}

{"title":"Dire elephant","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dire_elephant","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nA [[dire elephant]] is a much stronger version of an [[elephant]]. Like their smaller cousins, their melee attacks may push you back a tile, but their damage output is significantly higher.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Dire elephants have significant damage output, and they're much more resistant to magic than regular elephants, but they aren't that much more durable otherwise. Any kind of strong [[Conjurations]] or [[Summonings]] magic will suffice, and pure melee characters can usually take them on one-on-one by the time they're encountered.\n*Dire elephants are not resistant to [[poison]], so you can [[kite]] them using spells like [[Poisonous Vapours]] or [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]]. [[Curare]]-tipped [[darts]] are effective for slowing them down.\n*If you have trouble killing them, try lowering their [[AC]] with a [[wand of acid]].\n**Similarly, a [[scroll of vulnerability]] can help make them more susceptible to [[hexes]] or [[wand of paralysis|wands of paralysis]].\n*Be aware that several dire elephants may appear in one of [[The Lair]]'s endings, where characters will generally be less well-equipped to deal with them.\n\n==History==\n*Dire elephants were added in [[0.7]]."}

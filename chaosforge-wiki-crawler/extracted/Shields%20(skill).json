{"title":"Shields (skill)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shields_(skill)","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''This page is about the skill. For general information see [[Shields]].''\n\nThe '''Shields''' skill denotes how effective your character is at blocking melee or ranged attacks with [[shields]]. A higher Shields skill raises your [[SH]] score and decreases the penalties to your [[EV]], [[spell success|spellcasting]], and [[attack speed]]. At 27 skill, all penalties will be removed.\n\n{{skill aptitudes|Shields}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nShields skill will:\n* Give a bonus to [[SH]] from physical [[shield]]s. Bonus equals <code>2.5% * (Base_SH) + 0.19</code> SH per level.\n* Reduce [[Shield#Penalties|shield encumbrance penalties]] at a linear rate. At 0 skill, you'll get 100% penalties. At 27 skill, you'll get 0% penalties.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], the first 3 levels of Shields gave an extra +0.19 SH/level. (The extra SH from these levels is now given by default.)\n*Prior to [[0.28]], shield penalty formulas were different, completely negated at certain Shields skill thresholds. The skill also reduced the shield [[accuracy]] penalty.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], [[the Shining One]]'s Divine Shield benefited from Shields skill.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], you had to be wearing a shield to train the skill.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], [[Condensation Shield]] spell was affected by Shields skill.\n*Prior to [[0.7]], wearing shields didn't reduce [[attack speed]].\n\n{{Skills}}\n\n[[Category:Shields]]\n[[Category:Skills]]"}

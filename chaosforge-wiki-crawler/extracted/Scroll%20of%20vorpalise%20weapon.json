{"title":"Scroll of vorpalise weapon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Scroll_of_vorpalise_weapon","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n''For the current version of this scroll, see [[scroll of brand weapon]].''\n{{item\n |itemtype=Scroll\n |name=Scroll of vorpalise weapon\n |appearance=different\n |cost=200\n |weight=2.0\n}}\n\n{{flavour|This scroll enchants the wielded weapon so as to make it more effective at inflicting harm on its wielder's enemies. Using it on a weapon already affected by some kind of permanent branding is not advised. On the other hand, the scroll can make permanent the temporary branding of weapons obtained from some spells.\n\nBrands that are closely tied to one of the gods (Trog, Lugonu, Kikubaaquadgha, the Shining One) cannot be affixed this way. Xom, on the other hand, wouldn't let such an opportunity for fun go to waste.}}\n\n'''Scrolls of vorpalise weapon''' permanently give non-[[brand]]ed, non-[[artifact]] [[weapon]]s the [[vorpal]] brand. This will increases the damage output of any given attack by 0-25% (12.5% on average). While there are more powerful brands out there, nothing resists this extra damage and it's better than wielding an unbranded weapon. The displayed brand name changes depending on the kind of weapon involved:\n\n*[[Axes]] - '''Chopping'''\n*[[Short Blades]] - '''Slicing'''\n*[[Polearms]] - '''Piercing'''\n*[[Maces & Flails]], [[Staves]] - '''Crushing'''\n*[[Long Blades]] - '''Slashing'''\n*[[Short Blades]] - '''Stabbing'''\n*[[Ranged weapons]] - '''Velocity'''\n\nAlternatively, you can use this scroll to make some temporary brands permanent. This works for the [[flaming]], [[freezing]], [[draining (brand)|draining]], [[venom]], [[chaos]] and [[electrocution]] brands.  The first four can be acquired through reasonably common spells; the last two are more obscure, only appearing through [[card]]s and [[Xom]] effects.\n\nVorpalising a previously unbranded weapon carries no risk. However, if you are making a temporary brand permanent, you will always trigger a significant attack of the same brand (on your square only). ''Early players and those with low [[HP]] should thus refrain from use.''\n*Flame/Flaming: [[Scroll of immolation]] effect\n*Frost/Freezing: [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]]\n*Draining: [[Draining|Drain]] attack\n*Venom: [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]]\n*Electrocution: [[Electricity]] attack\n*Chaos: [[Chaos]]-branded explosion\n\nAttempting to affix unfixable brands also results in similar effects, some quite severe, with no benefit:\n*[[pain (brand)|Pain]]: [[Torment]]\n*[[Distortion]]: [[Translocations]] [[miscast]] (possibly including [[banishment]])\n*[[Antimagic]]: Drains all your MP\n*[[Holy wrath]]: Blasts you with [[cleansing flame]]\n\n==Trivia==\n{{crawlquote|''\"Your'' [weapon] ''gives off a brilliant flash of light!\"''}}\nThe quote displayed when the scroll is read is an homage to the father of all rogue-likes, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game) Rogue]. There is an extremely rare scroll in Rogue that allows you to vorpalise your weapon with a random slaying brand, and, when read, your weapon gives off a flash of intense white light.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.13]] the scroll of vorpalize weapon was replaced with the [[scroll of brand weapon]]."}

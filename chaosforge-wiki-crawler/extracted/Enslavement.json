Higher [[spell power]] increases both the chance of charming the enemy and the duration of the effect.\n\n==Strategy==\n*It's easy to undervalue this spell. Although it ''is'' ineffective against magic-immune monsters and may take multiple castings to stick on highly resistant foes, its effect amounts to one monster being immediately defeated plus an equally powerful un-[[Abjuration|abjurable]] monster being brought into existence on your side. Once you get a good idea of which monsters are susceptible, you can find valid, helpful targets in almost every part of the game.\n*The most obvious use for this is to charm one enemy (usually the hulking brute with low [[magic resistance]]) and then '''[[t]]'''ell it to attack his friend (the tiny caster hiding in the background). Alternatively, charming a pursuing enemy and [[t]]elling it to \"Wait here\" can give you time to escape. This can be used to leave a dangerous monster on a higher level while you continue onwards.\n*Don't worry about using Enslavement when you worship [[Elyvilon]]; there is no [[piety]] loss if your charmed enemies die (unless you're the killer).\n*Monsters that hate your current god will always be repulsed:\n**[[Evil]] or [[unholy]] monsters hate [[good gods]].\n**Corporeal [[undead]] and monsters that can cast [[List_of_spells_by_flag#Corpse_violating|corpse violating]] spells hate [[Fedhas Madash]].\n**[[Holy]] monsters hate [[evil gods]].\n**Unclean and [[chaotic]] monsters hate [[Zin]].\n**[[:Category:Actual_spells|Spellcasters]] hate [[Trog]].\n*You can get a similar effect through a [[wand of enslavement]], though its low maximum spell power limits its usefulness.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.17]] this spell was removed.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

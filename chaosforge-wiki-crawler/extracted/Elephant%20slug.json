Engaging them in melee can very often be a lethal mistake. Fortunately, they move at less than half the average character's speed.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*So long as you have room to maneuver and no other monsters attack you, [[kiting]] them is easy.\n*They have 20 [[HD]]. Don't [[polymorph]] them unless you're looking for [[out-of-depth]] trouble.\n\n==History==\n*Elephant slugs were removed in [[0.15]]. They can still be encountered as [[derived undead]] in [[the Crypt]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

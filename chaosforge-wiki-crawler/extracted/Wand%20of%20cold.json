{"title":"Wand of cold","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wand_of_cold","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{item\n |itemtype = Wand\n |name = Wand of cold\n |cost = ?\n}}\n{{flavour|A magical device which throws great [[Bolt of Cold|bolts of cold]].}}\n\n== Player use ==\nAs usual for wands, the beam from a '''wand of cold''' zapped by the player has a power rating of (30 + 2d([[Evocations]] skill)). It can hold at most 15 charges.\n\n== Monster use ==\nAs with any other wand, the bolt of cold projected by a wand of cold in the hands of a monster uses a power rating of (30 + (monster hit dice)). This gives it a typical damage output of 3d11 when used by low-level monsters and 3d12 when used by mid-to-high level monsters, and the player needs EV 19 to have a 50% chance of evading the beam without Repel or Deflect Missiles in force.\n\n== Tips and tricks ==\nAs a tier-1 attack wand, wands of cold provide a powerful backup attack.\n\nMelee characters should save them for non-cold-resistant opponents that are unusually dangerous to engage in melee, such as hydras, acidic monsters, and (at low levels) things like wraiths and wights.\n\nFire Magic users should use them as a backup or alternate attack against dangerous opponents that resist fire.\n\n==History==\nWands of cold were removed in [[0.18]]."}

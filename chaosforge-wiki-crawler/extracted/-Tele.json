{"title":"-Tele","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/-Tele","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|You are prevented from teleporting or blinking.}}\n\n'''-Tele''' is a property and [[status effect]] which prevents you from either [[teleport]]ing or [[blink]]ing by any means. \n\n==Useful Info==\n-Tele blocks any movement considered a \"[[teleport]]\" or \"[[blink]]\", as well as [[Blinkbolt]] and [[Vhi's Electric Charge]].\n\nIt does ''not'' prevent the following:\n*[[Passage of Golubria]]\n*[[Transporter]]s\n*[[Banishment]]\n*[[Abyss]] shifts\n*[[God]] abilities that are not considered \"teleports\" or \"blinks\". You can still use [[Dithmenos]]' Shadow Step, [[Hepliaklqana]]'s Transference on yourself, and [[Uskayaw]]'s Grand Finale.\n\n==Sources==\n-Tele can be obtained from:\n*The [[Dimension Anchor]] monster spell\n*[[Miscast]]ing a [[Translocations]] spell (called '''Stuck''')\n*Wearing an [[artefact]] with the -Tele property\n*[[Tree Form]]\n*[[Formicid]]s have -Tele as a property of their [[stasis]]\n\nYou can drink a [[potion of cancellation]] to end the temporary -Tele status, but it won't let you teleport if you have a -Tele artefact.\n\n==Strategy==\nHaving -Tele is naturally dangerous, since [[scrolls of blinking]] and [[scrolls of teleportation]] are some of the best escape options in the game. Losing these options can outright kill you in the worst case.\n\nHowever, -Tele artefacts have a small niche. If you have -Tele, you cannot be affected by the teleport [[sourceless malevolence]] effect. Therefore, you may wish to explore the final floor of a branch (namely [[Elven Halls|Elf:3]] and [[Zot:5]]) with -Tele, to avoid being teleported into the end [[vault]]. In any case, you may want to take off the -Tele item before tackling the end vault.\n\n==See Also==\n* [[-Blink]] - status which prevents the [[Blink]] spell and [[evocable]] ability, but not any other type of blink.\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

{"title":"Extended game","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Extended_game","type":"raw","data":"''For the long defunct spell, see [[Extension]].''\n\nThe '''extended game''' ('''15 rune game''', or simply '''extended''') comprises of the dungeon [[branch]]es outside the scope of an ordinary [[ascension]]. \n\nTo win the game, you only need 3 of the 15 possible [[runes of Zot]]. Most players go to the two easier [[Lair]] branches, then one (or more) of [[Abyss]], [[Slime Pits|Slime]], or [[Vaults]]. The other rune branches are considered the \"post game\", i.e., the extended game. They are designed to be difficult even for [[XL]] 27 characters, and most likely harder than the other options. Grabbing all 15 runes can be done for [[score]], [[tournament]] points,  bragging rights, etc.\n\n==Branches==\n'''Pan:'''\n*[[File:Pandemonium entry.png]] '''[[Pandemonium]]'''\n\n'''Hell:'''\n*[[File:Hell entry.png]] '''[[The Vestibule of Hell]]'''\n**[[File:Cocytus entry.png]] '''[[Cocytus]]''' \n**[[File:Gehenna entry.png]] '''[[Gehenna]]''' \n**[[File:Tartarus entry.png]] '''[[Tartarus]]'''\n**[[File:Dis entry.png]] '''[[The Iron City of Dis]]'''\n\n'''Tomb:'''\n*[[File:Crypt entry.png]] '''[[The Crypt]]'''\n*[[File:Tomb entry.png]] '''[[The Tomb]]'''\n\nThe scope of the \"extended game\" can depend on player preference. Most notably, the [[Crypt]] and [[Vestibule of Hell]] are reasonable to clear even if you don't plan on doing the rest of extended. This can change depending on character build (e.g. [[Qazlal]] worshippers have extreme difficulty in [[the Abyss]]).\n\n==Strategy==\nThe extended branches are meant to be challenging, or at least risky, even after clearing the [[Realm of Zot]]. For maximum safety, complete Zot:1-4 and any leftover rune branches first.\n\nAs you progress through the extended game, you'll find yourself with a surplus of XP. Characters can afford to invest into basically anything, since their \"main\" skills will be maxed or nearly maxed out. This is also a good time to change your [[god]], if at all - most characters are able to handle [[divine retribution]] from most gods at this point. Abyss and Crypt are good places to shrug off the godly wrath.\n\nMost of extended is filled with two threats: [[torment]] and [[damnation]]. Torment directly halves your current health, and resisting it is difficult if you're not already [[undead]]. Damnation, mostly found in Pan and Hell, ignores [[AC]], [[EV]], and [[SH]]; players can never gain a resistance to it.\n\nFor more specialized information, see each branches' specific page."}

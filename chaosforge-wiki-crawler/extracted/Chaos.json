Each attack produces a random effect, many of which imitate other brands.\n\n==Possible effects==\nChaos-branded attacks randomly choose a useful effect from the following list. For example, the flaming brand cannot be chosen if the defender is fire-immune, and vampiricism cannot be chosen if the attacker is at full health. If a useless effect is chosen, it is re-rolled. These effects do not check [[willpower]].<ref>{{source ref|0.31|attack.cc|590}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.31|attack.cc|780}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

There's a 10.5% chance of a good special effect, and a 7.3% chance of a potentially dangerous special effect.\n\nAdditionally, each strike with the chaos brand has a 1% chance to apply the [[reaping]] effect to its damage.<ref>{{source ref|0.31|attack.cc|910}}</ref> This may result in raising slain enemies as allied [[zombie]]s, depending on the total reaping damage.\n\n[[God]]s will disapprove of any effects you might call that offend them ([[evil]] effects for the [[good god]]s, haste for [[Cheibriados]]). [[Zin]] abhors chaos, regardless of its effect.\n\n==Occurrence==\nChaos is a rare brand from a [[scroll of brand weapon]]; this is the only way for [[ranged weapon]]s to receive this brand. Chaos weapons may be gifted by [[Xom]] (though not necessarily to the player), and various Xom altar [[vault]]s have chaotic weapons. [[Crazy Yiuf]] always wields a [[quarterstaff]] of chaos, and [[Psyche]] often has a dagger of chaos.\n\n==Strategy==\nChaos is a fickle mistress. When you're using chaos, it can [[slow]] or [[petrify]] your enemies, essentially killing them... or it can [[haste]] and [[frenzy]] them, turning them into much greater threats. While chaos is more likely to help you (the attacker), given enough time, you'll eventually end up 'misfiring'. In the early game, chaos is especially risky, since you'll be unlikely to handle the worst effects from it. However, even in the late game, hasting monsters is no joke; you'll often want a more reliable brand. \n\nIf you do decide to use chaos, you should prefer weapons with fast attack speed (such as [[quick blade]]s and [[demon whip]]s). These weapons inflict chaos effects, which are usually good, more often. It can also be nice on [[Ranged Weapons]], because if you buff an enemy, you'll have space to react.\n\nMonster with chaos, in turn, may put you to [[sleep]], briefly [[paralyse]] you, [[berserk]] you, etc., leading to potentially fatal situations. Great care should be taken against enemies with chaos attacks.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], [[distortion]] was a possible brand choice for chaos, meaning that chaos attacks could cause banishment. Chaos-inflicted paralysis could last multiple turns, and confusion checked willpower. Weakness, corrosion, vulnerability, vitrification, sleep, and ensnaring were not possible, whereas chaos attacks could turn monsters into [[shapeshifter]]s or grant [[agility]]. Berserk was replaced with frenzy in the list of effects in this version. Also, chaos attacks could clone monsters (including their equipment) instead of creating durably summoned copies.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], chaos attacks could make the target [[invisible]] instead of giving resistance to elements.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], chaos could inflict random [[miscast effect]]s instead of the might and agility effects.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], there was a rare chance of healing the target.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], invalid effects could still be rolled with reduced probability.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], ranged weapon ammo could have brands, including the chaos brand.\n*Between [[0.16]] and [[0.18]], the chaos brand could move nearby stairs.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], weapons of chaos could [[shaft]] or [[polymorph]] the attacker. Also, gods would forgive the player for disliked effects produced by chaos effects.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{brands}}\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

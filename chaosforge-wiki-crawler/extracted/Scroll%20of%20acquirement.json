The items offered will often be a good match for the reader's skills; and if nothing recommends itself, the reader can always choose a heap of gold.}}\n\nWhen read, a '''scroll of acquirement''' generates three [[acquirement]]s and a sum of [[gold]] for you to choose from. \n\n==Useful Info==\nA scroll of acquirement gives 3 options, chosen from the following categories: [[weapon]], [[armour]] (including [[shield]]s), book ([[spellbook]] or [[manual]]), [[jewellery]], [[magical staff]], [[talisman]]. Categories cannot repeat. There is a 4th option for 200 - 1400 [[gold]].<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|acquire.cc|1258}}</ref> These options are displayed for you to choose. The selected item is then generated on the floor.\n\n[[Felid]]s will always get a book, jewellery, and talisman (plus gold), as they cannot use weapons, any type of armour, or magical staves.\n\nThe scroll can be cancelled with '''Esc''' at any time; the scroll will not be consumed (even if read blindly) and its options will persist.\n\n===Acquirement Mechanics===\nThe items themselves are affected by a number of different factors:\n*They are biased towards items that match your skills. For instance, a character who has heavily invested in [[Maces & Flails]] is fairly likely to receive a weapon in that category. Similarly, a caster with high [[Fire Magic]] is more likely to get Fire spells from a book.\n*They are biased against items that you have already seen, the logic there being that if you have seen it, you're probably either using it or have decided it isn't useful. This usually includes items in shops, but those which are far too expensive for your character to buy at present are excluded from being \"seen.\"\n*The item is guaranteed to be usable. This means that you will be able to equip it, and using it will not incur penance with your current deity. For example, worshippers of [[good god]]s won't be given a [[draining]] weapon. Note that these guarantees are fairly minimal: acquirement may well give your heavy [[Armour]]-based [[Mountain Dwarf]] a robe (although it will be biased against doing so if you have invested in the Armour skill).\n\n==Strategy==\nAlthough unreliable, scrolls of acquirement are capable of producing gear that will carry you through to the end of the game in safety. \nWhile waiting for acquirements can give marginally better gear, waiting to use them is generally unwise. The increased chance of survival ''now'' is always more worthwhile than the slight chance of a better acquirement later.\n\nNote that acquirements are ''not'' directly affected by your current depth or location. However, the bias against items you have already seen means that later acquirements do tend to give out rarer items, as the common ones have already been seen.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], [[talisman]]s were not available as an acquirement option.\n*Prior to its removal in [[0.26]], you could acquire [[food]] as a 5th option.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], acquirement allowed you to choose to get an item from one of 8 categories (weapons, armour, jewellery, books, staves, evocables, food, or gold), but you did not know the specific item. Also, the maximum amount of gold you could get was higher.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], you could acquire [[wand]]s and miscellaneous [[evocable]]s separately.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], you could acquire ammo.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Acquirement]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

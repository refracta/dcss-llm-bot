{"title":"Draconian breath attacks","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Draconian_breath_attacks","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\nWhen a [[Draconian]] reaches level 7, they receive a colour. Every colour (except grey) gets an associated '''draconian breath attack'''. Using any of these attacks has a cooldown of <code>1 + 1d10 + 1d(30 - [[XL]])</code> turns. \n\nWhile in [[Dragon Form]], Draconians keep their breath (or lack thereof) instead of getting Breathe Fire.\n\n==Breathe Fire==\n{{flavour|Breathe a blast of fire at a targeted monster, leaving a cloud of flames at the endpoint.}}\n[[File:Breathe Fire.png]] Red Draconians receive '''Breathe Fire''', which fires a bolt of flame, and leaves a flame [[cloud]]. This can be used to place a single cloud of fire at a desired location (by aiming at a floor tile with [.]).\n\n==Breathe Frost==\n{{flavour|Exhales a blast of frost that may knock back targets.}}\n[[File:Breathe Frost.png]] White Draconians receive '''Breathe Frost''', which allows you to bellow forth a bolt of frost which ignores [[AC]] and knocks back creatures.\n\n==Breathe Noxious Fumes==\n{{flavour|Breathes a blast of noxious fumes at a targeted creature.}}\n[[File:Breathe Mephitic.png]] Green Draconians receive '''Breathe Noxious Fumes''', which spews noxious fume [[cloud]]s. These clouds, like [[Mephitic Cloud]], may confuse creatures that lack [[poison resistance]].\n\n<div id=\"spitacid\"></div>\n==Breathe Acid==\n{{flavour|Spit acid at a targeted monster, covering it in corrosive slime for a short time. It may also splash onto other nearby creatures on impact.}}\n[[File:Spit Acid.png]] Yellow Draconians receive '''Breathe Acid''', which spits a corrosive glob at an enemy, inflicting the [[Corrosion]] status (-8 AC temporarily). Unlike the other breath attacks, this targets a single enemy, though it can splash to enemies adjacent to your target.\n\n==Breathe Lightning==\n{{flavour|Releases a great discharge of electricity, causing an uncontrollable lightning storm. It partially bypasses armour.}}\n[[File:Breathe Lightning.png]] Black Draconians receive '''Breathe Lightning''', which blasts uncontrollable lightning around you. Specifically, it will cast [[Shock]], [[Lightning Bolt]], or [[Orb of Electrocution]] multiple times in random directions. If orbs of electrocution explode nearby, it can damage the user.\n\n==Breathe Steam==\n{{flavour|Breathes a jet of steam at a targeted location, which will scald any creatures it hits and will also obscure vision.}}\n[[File:Breathe Steam.png]] Pale Draconians receive '''Breathe Steam''', which creates a bank of [[steam]] clouds. Steam can be used to block [[line of sight]], and will deal damage to non-fire resistant enemies.\n\n<div id=\"breatheenergy\"></div>\n==Breathe Dispelling Energy==\n{{flavour|Breathes a bolt of dispelling energy at a targeted creature, possibly removing some of its enchantments.}}\n[[File:Breathe Energy.png]] Purple Draconians receive '''Breathe Dispelling Energy'''. Like a [[wand of quicksilver]], it removes any [[dispel]]lable statuses if it hits. Ignores AC.\n\n==Monster Version==\n[[List of dragons|Monstrous dragons]] and [[list of draconians|draconians]] are capable of identical breath attacks which are also determined by their associated element, though there are some exceptions:\n*Monstrous green Draconians and [[swamp dragon]]s have Breathe Poison instead of Breathe Noxious Fumes.\n*Monstrous black Draconians and [[storm dragon]]s breathe regular [[Lightning Bolt]]s in place of the uncontrollable havoc player black draconians create.\n*The [[unique]] draconian [[Tiamat]] can breathe whichever breath attack matches her current color.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Draconian breath attacks will be reworked for players:}}\n**Breath attacks will be able to store 3 charges and have an XP based recharge system. Draconians will get 2 charges when they reach XL 7.\n**Breath attacks will no longer have a cooldown.\n**Breath attacks will not affect the user, and they are intended to scale better in the late game.\n**All breaths are adjusted with some being overhauled:\n***Red Draconians will get '''Combustion Breath''', which targets a line and causes a [[Fireball]]-like explosion to strike every target in that line.\n***Green Draconians will still have '''Novious Breath''', which will have longer-lasting clouds and an XL-based chance to spawn additional clouds along the sides of the beam.\n***Pale Draconians will still have '''Steam Breath''', which will deal more initial damage. The density and duration of steam clouds will improve with XL.\n***Yellow Draconians will get '''Caustic Breath''', which is a penetrating acid bolt that leaves acidic fog clouds on all unoccupied spaces it passes over.\n***Black Draconians will get '''Galvanic Breath''', which is a projectile that does electricity damage to all targets connected to what it hits.\n***White Draconians will get '''Glacial Breath''', which is a penetrating beam of cold that turns anything it kills into blocks of ice.\n***Purple Draconians will get '''Nullifying Breath''', which is a projectile that explodes in a radius of 2 and dispels magical effects on all targets caught in the explosion. It will also apply antimagic.\n***Grey Draconians will get '''Mud Breath''', which is a projectile that knocks targets back and leaves mud around its destination.\n*Prior to [[0.31]], purple Draconians could use quicksilver breath on themselves to dispel status effects.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], pale Draconian's steam breath had a cooldown twice as short.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], white Draconian's breath could only knock back [[flying]] opponents.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], there were mottled Draconians, who had a breath that splashed [[Sticky Flame]]. It could only be used on adjacent enemies, but it could splash onto other monsters around it. Also, yellow Draconians did not have the splash effect, and Draconian [[player ghost]]s could breath bolts of [[negative energy]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Spit Acid could cause [[bleeding]].\n\n[[Category:Abilities]]"}

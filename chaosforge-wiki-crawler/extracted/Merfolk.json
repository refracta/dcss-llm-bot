{"title":"Merfolk","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Merfolk","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''This page is about the player [[species]]. For the monster, see [[Merfolk (monster)]]. For a list of all merfolk monsters, see [[List of merfolk]].''\n{{flavour|The Merfolk are a hybrid species of half-human, half-fish that typically live in the oceans and rivers, seldom venturing toward land. However, Merfolk aren't as limited on land as some myths suggest; their tails will quickly reform into legs once they leave the water (and, likewise, their legs will quickly reform into a tail should they ever enter water). They tend to be surprisingly nimble on land as well as in the water. Experts at swimming, they need not fear drowning and move very quickly through water.\n\nThe Merfolk have developed their martial arts strongly on thrusting and grappling, since those are the most efficient ways to fight underwater. They therefore prefer polearms and short swords above all other weapons, though they can also use longer swords quite well.\n\nAs spellcasters, they tend to be quite good in specific areas. Their mystical relationship with water makes it easier for them to use poison and ice magic, which use water occasionally as a material component. The legendary water magic of the Merfolk was lost in ancient times, but some of that affinity still remains. The instability of their own morphogenic matrix has made them very accomplished transmuters, but most other magic seems foreign to them.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*'''Nimble Swimmer 2:''' Merfolk are [[amphibious]], meaning they can enter [[deep water]] and are immune to [[Engulf]] and [[drowning]] damage. When on/over water, they gain -4 aut [[movement delay]], +50 [[stealth]], and +25% [[EV]] (min +2).\n*'''Mertail:''' When on/over water, Merfolk gain an [[auxiliary attack|auxiliary tail slap]] (damage = 6). Their [[boots]] meld into them and stop functioning, however.\n\nMerfolk have a base [[Strength]] of 8, [[Intelligence]] of 7 and [[Dexterity]] of 9 (before Background modifiers).\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Warriors:''' [[Gladiator]]\n*'''Zealots:''' [[Berserker]]\n*'''Adventurers:''' [[Shapeshifter]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Summoner]], [[Ice Elementalist]], [[Alchemist]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 to a random [[stat]] every 5th level.\n*Average [[HP]] and [[MP]].\n*+3 [[willpower]] per level.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Beginner}}\n\nMerfolk are a fairly straightforward species due to their well-defined strengths. Their movement speed and EV bonus in water can also come in handy, particularly in water-themed [[vault]]s, the [[Shoals]], the [[Swamp]], and parts of the [[Abyss]].\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Merfolk}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], merfolk had aptitudes of +4 Polearms and +1 Long Blades.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the [[evasion]] bonus for swimming merfolk was capped at +9 EV.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], merfolk were immune to the [[mesmerise|mesmerisation]] attempts of [[mermaid]]s and [[siren]]s.\n*Merfolk's unstable nature persists not only across space, but apparently across time as well. In very old versions of the game, cursed boots would prevent them from swimming, as would wearing heavier armour. On the flip side, they used to have above-average HP, and [[spear]]s would be replaced by [[trident]]s in their starting inventory, generally making their game even easier.\n\n[[Category:Merfolk]] \n\n{{species}}"}

{"title":"Borgnjor's Revivification","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Borgnjor%27s_Revivification","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n[[Borgnjor's Revivification]] is a level 8 [[Necromancy]] spell which restores your HP to full, but reduces your max HP in the process.\n\n==Useful Info==\nReduces your max HP, then sets your current HP to the new maximum. Spellpower may reduce the HP loss. When cast, the game makes nine checks with an <code>8 / pow</code> chance of failure. Lost max HP equals <code>failed checks + 6</code> % of your previous maximum. Therefore, you are guaranteed to lose 6% - 15% of your max HP, average <code>6 + (72/pow)</code> %.\n\nThis spell will have no effect if you are already at max HP or if you have less than 20 max HP. The [[undead]], including Alive [[vampire]]s and those in [[lich form]], cannot cast this spell. Casting it while under the effect of [[Death's Door]] works, but ends the status and [[paralysis|paralyses]] you for 2-5 turns. ([[Formicid]]s are still immune to this paralysis)\n\n==Strategy==\nOne of the best emergency spells in the game. The permanent HP cost may be intimidating, but if your options are to cast or die, then it should be obvious what to do. Most situations in the game can be solved with the help of a full HP heal. The biggest thing you have to be aware of is [[silence]], which prevents casting any spell. Also, don't rely on a 1% failure chance. Unless you are at 0% failure, try to cast this spell ''before'' you are one turn away from dying.\n\nAs a level 8 spell, it's expensive to train. If you aren't already invested into Necromancy, then Revivification is usually too expensive for a 3 rune game. Luckily, the [[extended]] game has infinite XP, so you can potentially get any spell you want.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*The spell cannot be cast while in [[Death Form]]. You could use your [[a]]bility to end the transformation, but it takes '''5 turns''' to do so.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], casting this spell while under Death's Door would paralyse for 2-7 turns.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], casting this spell while under Death's Door would paralyse the player for 5-9 turns and confuse them for 10-19 turns.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], any race could avoid paralysis by wearing the now-removed [[amulet of stasis]], allowing them to safely cast Borgnjor's while under Death's Door.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Borgnjor's Revivification only reduced the caster's max HP between 2 to 11 percent.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], it was a level 7 spell."}

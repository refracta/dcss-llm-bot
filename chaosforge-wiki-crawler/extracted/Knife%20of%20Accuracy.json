{"title":"Knife of Accuracy","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Knife_of_Accuracy","type":"raw","data":"{{Obsolete}}\n{{flavour|It is almost unerringly accurate.}}\n[[File:Knife_of_accuracy.png]] '''''the +27,-1 knife of Accuracy'''''<br>\n\n+27, -1 [[dagger]]\n\n==Desirability==\nTrue to its name, the '''knife of Accuracy''' is almost unerringly accurate... but almost entirely useless. Accuracy is not needed for [[stabbing]], and that is all that a dagger, particularly one with a -1 to-damage enchantment, is good for. Even at the very beginning, you'll likely have better results with a perfectly ordinary [[short sword]]. You could conceivably use this to quickly take out [[rakshasa]] illusions, or throw it at a [[giant spore]], but that just amounts to it being ''almost'' as good as a [[wand of magic darts]] with one range or one charge.\n\n==History==\n*The knife of Accuracy was removed in [[0.13]], along with seperate enchantments for accuracy and damage. [[Sniper]] would gain truly perfect accuracy (without enchant) five versions later, in [[0.18]].\n*Prior to [[0.9]], the knife of Accuracy was a proper [[knife]] (instead of a [[dagger]]).\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Short blades]]\n[[Category:Obsolete items]]"}

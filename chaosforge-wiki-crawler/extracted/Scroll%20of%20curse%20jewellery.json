They do not generate naturally, but Ashenzari-worshipers can produce them by praying over a [[scroll of remove curse]].\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.18]], Ashenzari's ability to create these scrolls was removed in favor of the more straightforward \"curse item\" ability.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], scrolls of curse jewellery would be naturally generated as loot, just like any other [[scroll]]."}

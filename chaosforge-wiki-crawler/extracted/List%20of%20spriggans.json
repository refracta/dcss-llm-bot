For the player race, see [[spriggan]].''\n\nThe '''spriggans''' are the diminutive guardians of the few forested areas found in the [[Dungeon]] and its [[branch]]es. They are fairly fragile, but have exceptional speed and evasion and often poison their foes at range or attack them with naturalistic magic.\n\n==Spriggan Types==\n{{monsterlink|Spriggan}} - Lightly-armed but swift opponents who may use branded [[short blade]]s and [[buckler]]s.\n\n{{monsterlink|Spriggan druid}} - Spellcasters who can call forth beasts as reinforcements and can even awaken the trees themselves.\n\n{{monsterlink|Spriggan rider}} - Spriggan soldiers mounted on [[hornet]]s, they often wield [[spear]]s and occasionally [[dart]]s.\n\n{{monsterlink|Spriggan berserker}}- Tiny worshipers of [[Trog]] with lightning-quick attacks and the ability to call in raging reinforcements.\n\n{{monsterlink|Spriggan air mage}}- Diminutive masters of [[Air Magic]] who are nearly untouchable with ranged weapons.\n\n{{monsterlink|Spriggan defender}}- The elite guardians of the spriggan people, they are exceedingly nimble and very well-equipped.\n\n===Unique Spriggans===\n{{monsterlink|Agnes}}- A hard-hitting spriggan [[lajatang]]-wielder who moves quickly and can take a punch or two.\n\n{{monsterlink|The Enchantress}}- The ruler of the spriggans, she wields powerful [[Hexes]] and has a curious suit of [[faerie dragon scales]] along with frustratingly high [[ev]]asion.\n\n==History==\n*Monstrous spriggans were added in [[0.7]].\n\n[[Category:Spriggan]]\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

Spent 8 turns putting it on.  AC up to 4!\n* T104: First kill, a rat.\n* T119: First sacrifice, a giant bat.\n* T154: Axes to Level 4\n* T3xx: Kobold almost took me out; killed it and rested.\n* T424: a knobbly jade ring.  I'll try it.\n* T425: no obvious effect, but I'll keep it on in case it's some sort of awesome smiting ring.\n* T576: Tried a THRE LOJ OSICK scroll (had 3).  Nothing appeared to happen.  Either charging or remove curse, then, or fear.\n* T577: Tried ZIKOAL EZOHIO (had 2 by now). Identify! And my ring is a ring of life protection.  Not too useful early game but no reason to take it off.\n* T890: Done exploring.\n* T927: Went downstairs.\n===D:2===\n* Rat and Ijyb right away! Yikes! I back around a corner from Ijyb.  Kill a rat while waiting and reach level 2.  Ijyb shows up; after a few misses, I berserk.\n* T955: Ijyb dead. Drops nothing. Bleah.\n* T1134: After a fight with a goblin, giant bat, and kobold, acquire Trog's Hand ability.  Also got to level 3 in there somewhere.\n* T1148: Dodging to level 3!\n* T1275: Pair of gauntlets on previous turn; I'll wear.  Also got a glowing sling.\n* T1278: ID'd sling as +2,+0, no other bonuses.  \"meh\".  Also, done exploring... but only found 2 staircases, so should come back.\n* T1298: Went downstairs.\n===D:3===\n* found... a disco hall? wtf?\n* hit teleport trap, will have to find way back.\n* T:1468: Found upstairs back to D:2.\n===D:2 revisited===\n* Tried reading a scroll; it's Teleport.\n* What the... Jessica AND sigmund?\n* T:1622: Killed Jessica after berserking and killing sigmund.\n* T:1740: Jessica dropped a (use-tested) +2 robe of magic resistance! Awesome!\n* T:1741: And scroll of ID says Sigmund's scythe is of protection! Woot!  Given I have only 5 AC without the scythe, I'll use it for a while.\n* Went back down.\n===D:3 part 2: Electric Boogaloo===\n* T:198x: found a second scroll of some type, forget which, it's fog though upon use.\n* T:2020: With berserk, killed the ghost of Vesto the Skirmisher, a weakling DSCK of Lugonu.\n* T:2069: Looked back at disco-ish area, found an altar.  It's Xom.  That explains a lot.\n* T:2515: Found a Kiku altar.\n* T:2774: Found one of my scrolls was detect curses (through use).\n* T:2778: None of the glowing weapons I found have brands of awesomeness, so I'll stick with my protection scythe.\n* T:2969: have explored all except part of Xom's disco hall.\n* T:3028: Went downstairs.\n===D:4===\n* T:3029: saved.  \n* T:3029: And I'm back!\n* T:3046: Found a long ivory wand.\n* T:3103: After zapping at a jackal twice with no effect, tried on myself, it's healing.\n* T:3216: Found temple stairs.\n* Went to temple, looked around a bit, came back.\n* T:3296: Detected curses.  Had an ego-elven short sword I hadn't tried out, it's vampiric.\n* T:3301: Ate bread ration, wielded elven vampiric short sword.\n* T:3375: Got poisoned by a giant ant.  Tried wand of healing, which didn't cure the poison.  Tried random potions, got poison first, but next was healing.  Best ID of poison potion ever.\n* T:3549: found a wand shop.  Entered. Bought frost and enslavement wands.\n* T:3639: Gained Brothers in Arms.\n* T:40xx: Done exploring.  Went down to D:5, swarmed by orcs, came back up and killed an ant that followed.  Then went down via other stairs.\n===D:5===\n* T:4094: fell through shaft to D:8.  Going back up now...\n* T:4197: on D:6, found Blork the orc with a wand.  Took two hits, couldn't have taken a third, escaped up stairs.  Ran into orc horde, ran up stairs again, back to the stairs I went to D:5 via the second time.\n* T:4549: After another orc horde battle, decided to switch to plate mail instead of the +2 MR robe.  My vamp short sword is +3,+1.\n* T:4729: Quaff-ID'd a potion of mutation.  got:\n** Protected by bone plates (AC +2, Dex -1)\n** Flexible-but-weak muscles (Dex +1, Str -1)\n** Partially covered in metallic scales (AC +3, Dex -2)\n** Total: AC +5, Dex -2, Str -1, I'll take it!\n* T:4783: Found an armor shop with two randarts! Particularly interesting is the +1 plate mail of the Amoeba (rN+ EV+2 Str+3).  Need 950 gold, though, and have... 33.  I'll come back later.\n* T:4857: Have 6 of a scroll, so I try it, nothing happens. Probably remove curse then; I'll inscribe it.\n* Done exploring.\n===D:6===\n* Found stairs that didn't leave me back near blork.  Did find an imp, and a couple wands that look interesting.\n* T:5374: Found a dwarven cloak of darkness.  Neato!\n* T:5870: Killed Blork with wands.\n* T:6034: Went downstairs.\n===D:7 and 8===\n* Found an armor shop on D:7. Forget what else happened.\n** Said armor shop had a couple randarts, one good, but I couldn't afford anything.\n* On D:8, found the entrance to the orcish mines; ran back up.\n===D:9===\n* Found a centaur behind a bush; took it out with wand of fireball, then wand of frosted away the cloud of flame.\n* took out imp, hungry ghost, and phantom, and found stairs to Lair; did not go down.\n* Found stairs to Lair\n* Finished exploring level, taking out stuff like a hippogriff in the process\n* went to lair\n===Lair===\n*Lured up some monster, killed it\n*Went down, got surrounded by rats and a frog, went back up, read scroll of immolation killing all the rats, then killed the frog\n*Saved on D:9, restored, rested, went back down\n*Surrounded again, went up, killed them one at a time\n*T:9337: went back down, lured up some blink frogs\n*T:9382: used trog's hand, used brothers in arms, died.\n*Final score: 3270, new personal best by far!\n===Lessons learned===\n*Blink frogs are pretty buff\n*Activate trog's hand and brothers in arms *before* entering lair, then berserk once you're there\n*Turn off individual-weapons skills so as to train only fighting skill, since you don't know early on what weapons you'll be using the most\n\n\n\n==Game 33 -- MiBe==\nMorgue file: [http://crawl.akrasiac.org/rawdata/PsyMar/morgue-PsyMar-20100426-145040.txt]\n===D:1-2===\n*Not much happened on D:1\n*on D:2: \n**Identified potions of healing (had 2), berserk rage, agility, and invisibility\n**Identified scrolls of blinking, curse weapon, enchant weapon I, identify, random uselessness, and teleportation\n**Also have a scroll that was {tried on item} that I tried on armor, so that's recharging\n**scroll-ID'd a ring of poison resistance (yay!)\n**scroll-ID'd and wielded a +1,+0 dagger of distortion, which should be fun\n===D:3===\n*The dagger of distortion is, indeed, fun\n*quaff-ID'd restore abilities and poison (which didn't affect me per the resistance ring)\n*read a scroll, nothing happened\n*quaff-ID'd paralysis, nothing killed me, yay\n*quaff-ID'd brilliance\n*Space warps horribly around the orc wizard! and killed it! yay!\n*Got, and turned off, stealth skill\n*found Okawaru altar, but I'm with Trog, so not now thanks\n*Got to level 5 by end of level, can now withstand the potential 43 damage from distortion unwield\n===D:4===\n*Got my first banishment of an enemy, against a kobold.

Barely.  Had to zap healing wand at myself, and use the retreat-to-regen-mana strategy.  Managed to use the stairs, though, so at least I could retreat towards the known.\n*Went down another staircase to D:2.\n*Tried reading scrolls against a newt; first was ID.  Id'd my ring (see invis), then my other two unknown scrolls (enchant weapon I and fear.)\n*Found a runed mace; determined it uncursed (via detect curse scroll); wielded it, because why not, it might be good.\n*Quaff-ID'd paralysis.

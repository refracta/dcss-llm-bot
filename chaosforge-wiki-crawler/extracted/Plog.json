{"title":"Plog","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Plog","type":"raw","data":"{{version027}}\n'''Plog''' is the fallback name if Crawl's name generator creates a name that is too short, i.e. under 4 characters<ref>{{source ref|0.27.1|item-name.cc|2313}}</ref>. It can appear as a name for [[randart]]s, [[Pan lord]]s, and [[shop]]keepers, along with a few other more specialized randomly-named things. It has no particular significance; also, it is not a misspelling of ''Ploog'', as it appeared in the code long before either [[Development team|dpeg or jpeg]] was involved in the project. It does not indicate anything about the object/creature so named. However, it will appear with much higher frequency than any other random name.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

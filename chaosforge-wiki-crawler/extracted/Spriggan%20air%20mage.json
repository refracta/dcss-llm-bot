{"title":"Spriggan air mage","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spriggan_air_mage","type":"raw","data":"{{version|030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Spriggan air mages''' are [[spriggan (monster)|spriggan]] spell casters who have mastered various forms of [[Air Magic]]. They have a powerful [[electricity]] damage spell as well as [[Airstrike]], making them dangerous to characters without electricity resistance or low [[AC]]. They are also notable for having a permanent [[Repel Missiles]] enchantment in effect, protecting them from most ranged attacks. \n\nThey can be found in the bands of spriggans roaming [[the Swamp]], forests of the deeper [[Lair]], [[the Depths]] and in certain vaults, as well as accompanying [[the Enchantress]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*When encountering bands of spriggans, always keep an eye out for these opponents. If they can see you, they are capable of hitting you for fairly heavy damage with perfect accuracy, and it is nearly impossible to outrun them on foot. Carelessness around these foes can be extremely deadly, particularly when several other significant threats are attacking you at the same time.\n*Fighting them in an enclosed area reduces the damage of Airstrike, but keep a gap or metal [[wall]] behind you to avoid suffering a [[multizap]].\n*If you aren't a melee fighter, try using unavoidable magic to take them down. [[Fireball]], [[Freezing Cloud]], [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]], or your own Airstrike will all suffice.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], spriggan air mages had a permanent [[Deflect Missiles]] effect instead of [[Repel Missiles]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], spriggan air mages knew [[Control Winds]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], spriggan air mages knew [[Haste]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], spriggan air mages knew [[Shock]] instead of Haste.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], spriggan air mages knew [[Swiftness]] in place of Control Winds.\n\n[[Category:Spriggan]]"}

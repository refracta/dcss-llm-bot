{"title":"Undead","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Undead","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\nThe '''undead''' are once-living creatures from beyond the grave, now preying on the living or serving the dark will of [[Necromancer]]s, unholy [[Priest]]s, and certain [[Evil#Evil_gods|evil gods]]. Examples of undead include [[skeleton (monster)|skeleton]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[vampire (monster)|vampire]]s, [[wraith]]s, [[ghost]]s, [[ghoul (monster)|ghoul]]s, and [[mummy (monster)|mummies]]. They are common monsters in the [[Dungeon]], and certain branches ([[Ossuary|Ossuaries]], [[The Crypt]], and [[The Tomb]]) are populated almost exclusively by undead. Note that [[demon]]s and [[Demon#Demonic_creatures|demonic]] creatures are ''not'' undead, despite occasionally looking the part (like [[hellwing]]s or [[reaper]]s).\n\nAll undead are considered [[evil]], and many [[god]]s award [[piety]] for destroying them. Naturally, [[Yredelemnul]] and [[Kikubaaqudgha]] instead reward their vile worshipers with power over the undead.\n\nSeveral undead [[species]] are available to players, offering an unusual style of play. Undead characters are somewhat weaker on average than the living races, but their innate resistances can often compensate for their disadvantages. Having died once already, they leave behind no [[player ghost|ghosts]] to plague future adventurers.\n\n==Undead Traits==\nAll undead beings (including player undead) share several immunities and vulnerabilities. They have immunity to [[poison]], at least one rank of [[cold resistance]], immunity to [[negative energy]], immunity to [[torment]], and they are not susceptible to [[mutations]] (they lose [[stat]]s instead). However, they are vulnerable to the [[Dispel Undead]] spell and weapons of [[holy wrath]] (which they also cannot wield) and take more damage than living characters from [[holy]] attacks.\n\nTheir undying nature means they cannot go [[berserk]] or fall a[[sleep]]. Also, many spells simply will not function for them, including most of the self-altering [[Transmutations]] ([[Beastly Appendage]], [[Spider Form]], [[Ice Form]], [[Blade Hands]], [[Statue Form]], [[Dragon Form]], [[Storm Form]], and [[Necromutation]]) along with [[Sublimation of Blood]], [[Death's Door]], and [[Borgnjor's Revivification]].\n\nBeing considered evil, the undead may not worship the [[good god]]s ([[The Shining One]], [[Zin]], [[Elyvilon]]).\n\nThese are only the traits that all undead share. A particular undead being will have additional powers, intrinsics, and vulnerabilities peculiar to its species.\n\n==Playable Undead==\nThese species of undead are available for player characters:\n* '''[[Mummy]]''' - Embalmed figures that are especially attuned to [[Necromancy]]. However, they cannot drink [[potion]]s, and their dry, bandaged bodies are quite flammable.\n* '''[[Ghoul]]''' - Undying beings that are quite strong, though somewhat unskilled and dim-witted. They do not heal naturally in the presence of enemies, but can regain stamina by slaying their foes.\n* '''[[Vampire]]''' - Stealthy undead that may freely switch between their natural undead state and a partially-living one; they heal quickly and can use transformative spells while alive, but lose access to most of their undead powers (though they never lose their undead weaknesses). Unlike the other two undead species, vampires are susceptible to mutations.\n\nOther species may temporarily become undead by casting the [[Necromutation]] spell, gaining the standard undead resistances and vulnerabilities, but losing the ability to drink potions like mummies.\n\n==Undead Monsters==\n===[[Derived undead]]===\nThese monsters are made from other creatures, so their stats and abilities depend largely on what they were in life. They make up the bulk of an average [[Necromancer]]'s entourage, though their low intelligence and lack of regeneration present a challenge different from the use of [[summon]]ed creatures. Unfortunately, many methods of creating undead servants are inherently unstable, so most player-created undead will eventually decay; undead granted by [[Yredelemnul]]'s power won't decay over time, but will still fall apart should their creator leave for a different floor of the Dungeon.\n\n[[File:Zombie human.png]] '''[[Zombie]]''' - Shambling, reanimated corpses that are slower, but often more durable, than their living counterparts.\n\n[[File:Skeleton medium humanoid.png]] '''[[Skeleton (monster)|Skeleton]]''' - Weaker than zombies, but easier to animate, skeletons are a fallback if a necromancer has used a creature's flesh for other purposes.\n\n[[File:Simulacrum small humanoid.png]] '''[[Simulacrum (monster)|Simulacrum]]''' - Replicas of creatures made from ice. They are fragile and vulnerable to [[fire]], but can deal brutal [[cold]] damage in melee.\n\n[[File:Spectral small humanoid.png]] '''[[Spectral thing]]''' - A disembodied soul bound into a Necromancer's service. While weaker than some other types of undead, they retain their original speed and can recover from injuries.\n\n===Abominations===\nAbominations are haphazard combinations of body parts with [[demonic]] traits, which are partially randomized.\n\n{{monsterlink|Small abomination}}- Small abominations tend to be fast and fairly strong, but aren't particularly hard to destroy.\n\n{{monsterlink|Large abomination}}- Significantly stronger than their smaller brethren, but slower.\n\n===Ghosts and Wraiths===\nThese are [[insubstantial]] forms of undead, many of which have unusual abilities.\n\n{{monsterlink|Phantom}}- Phantasms that appear early on. They are evasive, and can drag their opponents with them when they [[blink]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Wraith}}- Spectral forms that drain speed from their foes.\n\n{{monsterlink|Freezing wraith}}- Icy phantasms that freeze their foes with but a touch.\n\n{{monsterlink|Shadow}}- Shadowy apparitions that can turn [[invisible]], allowing them to strike at the weak spots of hapless adventurers. \n\n{{monsterlink|Phantasmal warrior}}- Spirits of deceased warriors whose attacks cut at flesh and [[willpower]] alike.\n\n{{monsterlink|Shadow wraith}}- Invisible ghosts whose attacks slow down blundering passersby.\n\n{{monsterlink|Drowned soul}}- The souls of those lured to their deaths by a [[merfolk avatar]], commanded to share their fate with the living.\n\n{{monsterlink|Eidolon}}- Dread apparitions that radiate unearthly [[fear]], preventing their foes from approaching as they bombard them with negative energies.\n\n{{monsterlink|Silent spectre}}- Feared by spellcasters, these spirits are surrounded by a vast [[aura]] of [[silence]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Flayed ghost}}- Hideous phantasms capable of inflicting illusory wounds that temporarily reduce the health of their victims.\n\n{{monsterlink|Putrid mouth}}- [[Miasma]]-spewing maws that roam the damned wastes of [[Tartarus]], wailing and gnashing their teeth.\n\n===Ghouls===\nThese undead horrors are animated by esoteric magics to spread death and decay. While they do leave corpses, they are too rotten to be raised as full zombies.\n\n{{monsterlink|Necrophage}}- Rotting cadavers that wander in search of the living. Their touch [[drain|withers]] their foes.\n\n{{monsterlink|Bloated husk}}- Wandering corpses made buoyant with [[swamp]] gas.

They possess chilling magic and an icy touch.\n\n{{Red|n}} [[File:Ghoul (monster).png]] '''[[Ghoul (monster)|Ghoul]]''' - Both strong and tough, these undead horrors tear apart and devour anything that crosses their path.\n\n{{monsterlink|Searing wretch}}- Incendiary undead that wander the blasted wastes of [[Gehenna]]. Their claws can sear away their targets' [[fire resistance]].\n\n===Liches===\nThese are magicians who have chosen undeath in order to prolong their existence. Since becoming a lich requires considerable arcane power, these are some of the most dangerous types of undead you can come across.\n\n{{monsterlink|Stoker}}- Former mortals sentenced to undeath in [[Gehenna]]; they may summon [[creeping inferno]]es to blast intruders with [[Fire Storm|storms of flames]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Halazid warlock}}- Undying servants of forgotten gods, halazid warlocks can sacrifice their allies to create explosions of negative energy.\n\n{{monsterlink|Lich}}- Powerful undead mages capable of casting a wide variety of spells.\n\n{{monsterlink|Ancient lich}}- A long-lived lich that has achieved mastery over offensive magic. Their spells are hideously powerful.\n\n{{monsterlink|Dread lich}}- A lich that has instead made pacts with powerful [[demon]]s and may call upon them at will.\n\n===Mummies===\n{{flavour|I see Egypt and the Egyptians - I see the pyramids and obelisks;<br>\nI look on chisel'd histories, songs, philosophies, cut in slabs<br>\nof sand-stone, or on granite-blocks;<br>\nI see at Memphis mummy-pits, containing mummies, embalm'd, swathed<br>\nin linen cloth, lying there many centuries;<br>\nI look on the fall'n Theban, the large-ball'd eyes, the side-drooping<br>\nneck, the hands folded across the breast.<br>\n-Walt Whitman, Salut au Mond}}\n\nFound mostly in the [[Ossuary]] and [[The Tomb]].

However, it can merge into other abominations to form larger creations.

{"title":"Sigil of Binding","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sigil_of_Binding","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n'''Sigil of Binding''' is a level 3 [[Hexes]] spell which creates sigil [[trap]]s, which when stepped on, stop movement for a short time.\n\n[[Hexslinger]]s start with this spell in their libraries.\n\n==Useful Info==\nCreates two sigils randomly within 2 tiles of the caster. They are considered [[trap]]s, so they can only be placed on floor tiles; they cannot be placed on [[door]]s (even when open), [[shop]]s, [[water]], other traps, etc. You cannot cast this spell if one or more sigils are already active.\n\nWhen a creature, including the player, steps on a sigil, they cannot move for a short time. After a monster is trapped, they gain a [[Sprint]] effect (-0.3 [[decaAut]] [[movement delay]]) for a time afterwards. If a monster has Sprint, even from a source other than this spell, it is immune to Sigil of Binding. Players do not get the Sprint effect, but the player's [[allies]] still get it.\n\nAgainst monsters, the binding lasts for <code>4 + power/12 - [[HD]]/4</code> to <code>7 + power/8 - HD/4</code> turns. The Sprint effect lasts twice as long as the binding. Against players, the binding lasts for 3 to 6 turns.\n\nThe sigils themselves last for <code>5 + pow/4</code> to <code>8 + pow/2</code> turns. You get a warning two turns before the sigils expire.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Casting this spell in a hallway can be dangerous, since the sigils can block the path behind you.\n*Monsters make no effort to ignore stepping on a sigil, so knowledge of monster AI can be useful. \n**Note that monsters generally take the shortest path to the player.\n\n==History==\n*Sigil of Binding was introduced in [[0.31]]."}

This is regardless of dietary preferences, with the one exception being that pure carnivores ([[ghoul]]s, [[kobold]]s, and anything else with the [[Carnivore]] 3 [[mutation]]) receive no benefit from them whatsoever. Unlike other [[potion]]s, potions of porridge are always identified on sight.\n\nPotions of porridge are rare, but [[spriggan]]s start with one instead of a [[bread ration]].\n\n{{crawlquote|That potion was really gluggy!}}\n\n==History==\nPotions of porridge were removed in [[0.16]].\n\nPrior to [[0.14]], potions of porridge were not identified on sight, but could be guessed at because they would always be described as \"gluggy white\" or \"gluggy brown\" potions. Also, they only gave 6,000 nutrition (though all potions gave a base 40 nutrition at the time, making it add up to the same benefit).\n\n[[Category:Comestible]]"}

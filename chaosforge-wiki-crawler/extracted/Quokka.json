They can be found on the first few floors of [[the Dungeon]], and are the best result from [[Summon Small Mammal]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Quokkas are one of the more dangerous enemies you can find on D:1. As they are fast, quokkas occasionally move twice for every player turn. Don't be afraid to use your [[background]]'s starting consumable if combat goes poorly.\n*Outside of D:1-2, quokkas are unlikely to be a serious threat.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], quokkas could not spawn on D:1.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], quokkas had speed 10."}

It is stackable, but the benefits decline with multiple rings (ie, an additional 24% for the second ring, an additional 15% for the third). The resultant hunger rate is always rounded down. Thus, for most races, who hunger at a rate of 3 nutrition/turn, one ring of sustenance will reduce that rate to 1 nutrition/turn.\n\n new_hunger_rate = old_hunger_rate Ã— (6/10)^(#_of_rings_of_sustenance)\n\nRings of sustenance cannot reduce satiation costs below 1 per turn. They are [[cursed]] 2% of the time.\n\n==Strategy==\nMany players malign these rings, as they provide no benefit other than reducing food consumption, and there is usually enough food available for even a 15-[[rune]] [[ascension]]. However, they can actually serve several purposes:\n*They are useful for low-strength races because they reduce the amount of food one has to carry around.  In particular, this can allow a low-strength player to carry more useful items (such as [[potions of heal wounds]] or multiple attack [[wands]]) in corpseless branches such as [[Pandemonium]] or [[the Abyss]].\n*The reduced hunger rate can allow a player to cast spells earlier than the hunger cost would normally let them, since they will be consuming less food overall.\n*These rings can be a godsend (pun intended) for those whose god takes sacrifices: [[Trog]], [[Okawaru]], [[Makhleb]], and to a lesser extent [[Nemelex]] and [[Fedhas]]. Since you won't have to chop up every other corpse you come upon for food, you will gain piety considerably more quickly.\n*High-hunger races such as [[troll]]s will find these rings very useful in general.\n*The temporary wearing of one during long intra-dungeon journeys through empty levels or branches is a particularly frugal way to conserve permafood. \n\n===As compared to an amulet of the gourmand===\nAn [[amulet of the gourmand]] fulfills many of the same roles as a ring of sustenance, and many players would argue that it is a better item. It definitely has distinct advantages and disadvantages when compared to a ring of sustenance.\n\nIts advantages are:\n*It is generally superior in corpse-filled branches. Being able to gorge yourself on every passing centaur usually proves superior to simply having hunger reduced by 2/3. In particular, it is better for mitigating spell hunger, as long as there are creatures nearby.\n*Properly used, an amulet of the gourmand should allow you to gain piety with a blood god even more quickly than a ring of sustenance.\n\nHowever, in some ways a ring of sustenance is superior:\n*An amulet of the gourmand must be actively used (by eating corpses) to provide any benefit, whereas the effect of a ring of sustenance is entirely passive. At the very least this makes the amulet more tedious to use; for many players, it can mean less overall benefit.\n*The amulet is of no help in corpseless branches.\n*The amulet slot may be more valuable in certain situations. For example, an [[amulet of resist mutation]] is extremely useful while exploring the [[Slime Pits]].\n\n==History==\nRings of sustenance were retired in [[0.15]].\n\nIn older versions, rings of sustenance merely reduced food consumption by 2/turn, to a minimum of 1. This made these rings less useful to high-metabolism characters, since their food consumption would be proportionally reduced much less.\n\n[[Category:Ring]]\n[[Category:Hunger]]"}

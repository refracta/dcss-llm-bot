{"title":"Summon Ice Beast","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summon_Ice_Beast","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Summon Ice Beast''' is a level 3 [[Ice Magic|Ice]]/[[Summonings|Summoning]] spell which summons an [[ice beast]] to attack your foes.\n\n[[Ice Elementalist]]s start with this spell in their spell library.\n\n==Useful Info==\nA single [[ice beast]] is summoned.\n\nHigher [[spell power]] increases the ice beast's [[HD]], which increases HP, accuracy, and the strength of the freezing attack. Ice beast HD equals <code>3 + <power> / 13</code>, randomly rounded.<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|spl-summoning.cc|208}}</ref>\n\nDuration of the summon is around 27 turns; it does not depend on spellpower.\n\nThere is a summon cap of 1 ice beast; casting the spell again will cause the old summon to very quickly time out.\n\n==Strategy==\nIce Beasts are effective for the early- and mid- game, with decent stats overall. Their [[cold]] attacks work great in [[the Lair]]; since many Lair enemies are [[cold-blooded]], ice beasts have a chance to [[slow]] them. As bonuses, ice beasts are naturally [[poison resistance|rPois]], and do not trigger the bloodzerk of [[skyshark]]s.\n\nFor Ice Magic users, it's an easily available summon, valuable because it is a summon (MP-efficient, takes hits, blocks line of fire). For Summonings users, it's another summon, allowing them to have more allies out at once.\n\n==Monster Version==\nThe monster version of the spell creates standard ice beasts without altered hit dice. The summon also has longer duration, around 81 turns.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], this spell was a level 4 Ice/Summoning spell. Also, the summon's [[duration class]] depended on power, ranging from 2 (around 18 turns) to 4 (around 36 turns). The formula was <code>2 + (1d<power> - 1) / 4</code> (capped at 4).\n*In [[0.30]], Ice Elementalists start with this spell again.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], this spell had a summon cap of three.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], [[Ice Elementalist]]s and [[Summoner]]s started with this spell.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], this spell was level 5.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

{"title":"Amulet of clarity","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Amulet_of_clarity","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{item\n |itemtype=Jewellery\n |name=Amulet of clarity\n}}\n\n{{Flavour|This amulet protects its wearer from some forms of mental confusion, including being berserked against one's will.}}\n\nThe '''amulet of clarity''' grants the [[clarity]] intrinsic, protecting its wearer from unintentional [[berserk]]ing, being [[mesmerised]], and most forms of [[confusion]]. This protection has limits, however; it cannot stop confusion caused by a [[god]]'s [[divine retribution]], and equipping it while confused will not cure it.\n\n==Strategy==\nAs most of the things this amulet protects against are also blocked by high [[magic resistance]], other amulets are usually better. However, it is good to wear in a number of situations:\n*It is highly valuable for [[mummies]], who have absolutely no means of curing confusion. This is particularly true in [[Hell]], where one of the the ever-present Hell effects is MR-bypassing confusion.\n*It is good to wear for melee characters who have [[berserkitis]] and cannot afford to go berserk.\n*In a similar vein, it makes unrands such as [[Bloodbane]] and in particular the [[Sword of Jihad]] far more usable.\n*It is a good option against particularly nasty or OOD uniques capable of confusing you, such as [[Rupert]].\n\n==History==\n* The amulet of clarity was removed in [[0.18]]. [[Clarity]] is still available through mutation, [[Ashenzari]] worship, and certain artefacts.\n\n{{amulets}}\n\n[[Category:Amulets]]"}

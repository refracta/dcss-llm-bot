{"title":"Raiju","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Raiju","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | canines}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Raiju''' are unnatural canines which attack their prey in swarms, biting them or transforming into bolts of living [[electricity]] at will. They can be found naturally in the [[Abyss]]. If you find one elsewhere, it's either a vault or a [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They might not hit very hard individually, but a full pack of raiju can pile tons of electricity damage on you very quickly. Don't hesitate to quaff a [[potion of resistance]] if you find yourself surrounded with no other source of [[electricity#Electricity Resistance|rElec]].\n*The terrain of the Abyss changes constantly, as do the positions of the bolting raiju, making movement decisions somewhat arbitrary. If possible, however, stand in such a way that the raiju won't be getting [[multizap]]s on you.\n\n==Trivia==\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiju RaijÅ«], or \"lightning beast,\" is a legendary creature from Japanese mythology which serves Raijin, Shinto god of lightning. Capable of assuming the shape of a cat, fox, weasel, wolf, or ball of lightning, it is generally tame, but dashes about during storms wreaking havoc on anything it touches.\n\n==History==\nRaiju were added in [[0.14]]."}

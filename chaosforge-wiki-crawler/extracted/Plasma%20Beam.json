This spell fires two inaccurate bolts - a [[fire]] bolt, and an [[electricity]] bolt - directed at the furthest enemy in range.\n\n==Useful Info==\nFires two penetrating bolts at the furthest enemy in [[line of sight]]. If there are multiple enemies at the same distance, the target is randomly chosen. Both bolts will always be aimed at the same target.\n\nBolts follow the same trajectory as any regular projectile. It's treated as if you aimed directly at the intended target, so there will always be one (and only one) possible path per target. You can view possible paths by targeting this spell.\n\nThe electric bolt will ignore 1/2 of the target's [[AC]], as a property of <code>BEAM_ELEC</code> damage. The fire bolt is fully affected by AC. This means that Plasma Beam, as a whole, is impacted x1.5 by AC than usual.\n\n==Strategy==\nAwkward schooling, but a powerful spell. At 50 [[spellpower]], this spell deals 2 x 1d41 damage (avg. 42). [[Bombard]], another level 6 spell, would deal 9d5 (avg. 27) to a single target. While Bombard has multiple advantages (more [[to-hit|accurate]], quieter, can be aimed, irresistible damage, checks AC only once), this spell isn't weak by any means. As this spell is [[noise|loud]], beware of enemies you'll attract.\n\nWith clever maneuvering to funnel enemies through hallways and bottlenecks, the spell's quirk of attacking its farthest enemy becomes a powerful advantage, as you are also striking all interposed enemies.\n\n[[staff|Staves]] of fire and air greatly enhance the spell's destructive power. The [[Elemental Staff]], because it enhances ''both'' schools, has twice the beneficial effect and should be highly prized.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"400px\" heights=\"400px\" class=\"left\" mode=\"nolines\">\nPlasma beam targeting.png|thumb|left|Plasma Beam will always take the '''leftmost''' path.<br>(It is always aimed directly at the target)\n</gallery>\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Plasma Beam's range depended on your [[spell power]] (3 at 0 power, 10 at 200 power).\n*Plasma Beam was added in [[0.30]]."}

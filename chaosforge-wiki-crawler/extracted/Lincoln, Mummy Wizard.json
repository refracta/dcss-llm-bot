{"title":"Lincoln, Mummy Wizard","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lincoln,_Mummy_Wizard","type":"markdown","data":"*This page is a [Diary of a Crawler](/Category:Diary_of_a_Crawler \"Category:Diary of a Crawler\"), the journal of an individual character. This page probably contains spoilers.*\n\nI'm playing as Lincoln, the Mummy Wizard. Started off with the Book of Minor Magic (summ), instead of either of the other two. Feel free to leave commentary; I've never beaten the game, so I'll be unsure of what to expect further down the line.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Dungeon:1](#Dungeon:1)\n- [2 Dungeon:2](#Dungeon:2)\n- [3 Dungeon:3](#Dungeon:3)\n- [4 Dungeon:4](#Dungeon:4)\n\n## Dungeon:1\n\nIt's pretty easy to run through this with Summon Small Mammals and Magic Dart. The Mummy is slow to learn, but a combination of delay tactics with the Summon and Dart shots keep the level simple. I looked around for a weapon to train a bit, and found an uncursed runed orcish vampiric falchion. Pretty good bit of luck on D:1 for me, so I'm taking this as a good sign for the character. I stuck around for a while, training up my Spellcasting, Conjuration, and Summonings to 3, 3, and 2, respectively. Went ahead and memorized Mephitic Cloud, too. The character is at level 5 when he decides to delve down the the 2nd level...\n\n## Dungeon:2\n\nSo I spent a fair bit of time upstairs with preparations, and D:2 is going smoothly. In fact, I'm barely using my spells, as I train to get a little bit of EXP worked into my long blade; it still doesn't register as a skill yet, but it's pretty accurate and the vampiric ability is helpful for a Mummy. As I continue through the level, I find myself in a poor situation...walked in right between Terence and Sigmund. Crud.\n\nThere's a Giant Bat harassing me too, but I simply ignored him...A Mephitic Cloud shot confuses the two NPCs, and I ran over to kill Terence. Finished him off fairly quickly, but Sigmund has overcome his confusion and is firing fire blasts at me. I shoot off another Mephitic cloud and a Magic Dart or two, then run upstairs as he fires magic at my back...got up there with 4 HP remaining. A short rest later, I went back down, and used Mephitic Cloud/Summon Mammal delay tactics to keep him confused and distracted while I popped in and whacked away with the falchion. Sigmund goes down. :)\n\nI'm feeling pretty confident now, and I've got 100+ exp in my Pool that needs using, so I'm turning off Dodge/Stealth for a bit while I try to go find a trap to disable. After doing that, I've got D:2 cleared, and have reached Lvl 6. A little annoyed, as I only found 1 trap to disable and I still have a bit of EXP to spend, but oh well...maybe next stage!\n\n## Dungeon:3\n\nI'm being very cautious as I enter this part of the dungeon. Went ahead and used up 2 ID scrolls...revealed a ring of Life Protection (no effect,) a ring of levitation, and a ring of ice. Ring of Ice might be useful if I find an Ice Beast, just to up my current Cold defense a bit more, but otherwise this is all useless for me ATM...checked my scrolls out too, and I've got 3 scrolls of Enchant Weapon II. Now if only I knew if it would be worth keeping this sword and enchanting it!\n\nI've been luring monsters back up into D:2 and away from their comrades to dispatch them in singles so far. I pulled a runed orcish chainmail from one of them. At some point, once I start to get my Long Blade skill working, I might want to have some reasonable armor. As I continue my search of D:3, I've come upon a book - excitedly, I ID'd it, but it was just a Book of Minor Magic (flame.) Still, this could potentially be helpful - I'm now about as decked out as I could be should I come across an Ice Beast! I just don't know if I want to spare the magic levels...\n\nContinuing along, I've run into Jack Bauer, an old ghost of a Hill Orc Priest...he's not noticed me, so I'm going to try my best to avoid him. I really hate fighting Priests of Beogh. As I moved on, using a combination of Mephitic Cloud for the confusion and my falchion for the kill, the dungeon was finally cleared - all except for that darned ghost.\n\nNow, while I search for opponents to give myself a little more EXP before I leave, I'm left to wonder if this is smart. If I run into that ghost, and he sees me, I could have a difficult fight on my hands. I'm not sure if I'd make the stairs in time. Sure enough, as I'm resting there, the ghost appears...after exchanging a few quick blows, I run for the stairs. I've made it, and the encounter has made up my mind. It's time to go find another stairwell and skip back down to D:4.\n\n## Dungeon:4\n\nAs soon as I drop down into D:4, I see the ghost of X, a Chaos Knight. I simply sat my turns, watching him walk by...and just as it looked like he would miss me, he turned. I fired a few darts at him, and then Jessica appeared! It didn't take me long to get back upstairs with that kind of incentive.\n\nDown another flight, and there's nothing here. Phew. I picked up an uncursed glowing blowgun earlier, and as I delve through this stage of the dungeon, a local kobold stops by to donate me all of his poisoned needles. Thanks!\n\nI found Jessica again, but this time she just wasn't paying attention. One Mephitic Cloud and a couple falchion swipes later, I stood on her corpse and admired her robe. Glowing, but I think I'll stick with what I've got on for now. Feeling better about my chances, I turn around and promptly run into X...yipes! I run over to the nearby stairs, and then take a stand. Summoning several rats and bats, I leave the combat to them and go stand at a distance to watch. It appears that this Chaos Knight can poison his opponents; I'm starting to feel like maybe I should leave well enough alone.\n\nNonetheless, I feel confident, and am determined to fight. I've been sacrificing countless small mammals to this ghost, but he just keeps coming. Eventually, through heavy mammal spam, he goes under. I let out a sigh of relief, but there's no time for relief - I immediately come upon 3 gnolls. A Mephitic Cloud distracts two of them, but the third gives chase, and I run for my life. I circle around an obstacle, but when I come back around, one of the earlier Gnolls is blocking my path! I'm out of MP, so I have no choice but to try to cut him down...I quickly do so, bringing myself down to 12 HP and gaining Long Blades skill in the process, and then break for the stairs...but just as I try to ascend them, I am cut down for those 12 HP. Game Over.\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\"/>\n<title>Lincoln, Mummy Wizard -

playing as Lincoln, the Mummy Wizard. Started off with the Book of Minor Magic (summ), instead of either of the other two. Feel free to leave commentary; I've never beaten the game, so I'll be unsure of what to expect further down the line.\n\n==Dungeon:1==\nIt's pretty easy to run through this with Summon Small Mammals and Magic Dart. The Mummy is slow to learn, but a combination of delay tactics with the Summon and Dart shots keep the level simple. I looked around for a weapon to train a bit, and found an uncursed runed orcish vampiric falchion. Pretty good bit of luck on D:1 for me, so I'm taking this as a good sign for the character. \nI stuck around for a while, training up my Spellcasting, Conjuration, and Summonings to 3, 3, and 2, respectively. Went ahead and memorized Mephitic Cloud, too. The character is at level 5 when he decides to delve down the the 2nd level...\n\n==Dungeon:2==\nSo I spent a fair bit of time upstairs with preparations, and D:2 is going smoothly. In fact, I'm barely using my spells, as I train to get a little bit of EXP worked into my long blade; it still doesn't register as a skill yet, but it's pretty accurate and the vampiric ability is helpful for a Mummy. As I continue through the level, I find myself in a poor situation...walked in right between Terence and Sigmund. Crud. \n\nThere's a Giant Bat harassing me too, but I simply ignored him...A Mephitic Cloud shot confuses the two NPCs, and I ran over to kill Terence. Finished him off fairly quickly, but Sigmund has overcome his confusion and is firing fire blasts at me. I shoot off another Mephitic cloud and a Magic Dart or two, then run upstairs as he fires magic at my back...got up there with 4 HP remaining. A short rest later, I went back down, and used Mephitic Cloud/Summon Mammal delay tactics to keep him confused and distracted while I popped in and whacked away with the falchion. Sigmund goes down. :) \n\nI'm feeling pretty confident now, and I've got 100+ exp in my Pool that needs using, so I'm turning off Dodge/Stealth for a bit while I try to go find a trap to disable. After doing that, I've got D:2 cleared, and have reached Lvl 6. A little annoyed, as I only found 1 trap to disable and I still have a bit of EXP to spend, but oh well...maybe next stage!\n\n==Dungeon:3==\nI'm being very cautious as I enter this part of the dungeon. Went ahead and used up 2 ID scrolls...revealed a ring of Life Protection (no effect,) a ring of levitation, and a ring of ice. Ring of Ice might be useful if I find an Ice Beast, just to up my current Cold defense a bit more, but otherwise this is all useless for me ATM...checked my scrolls out too, and I've got 3 scrolls of Enchant Weapon II. Now if only I knew if it would be worth keeping this sword and enchanting it!\n\nI've been luring monsters back up into D:2 and away from their comrades to dispatch them in singles so far. I pulled a runed orcish chainmail from one of them. At some point, once I start to get my Long Blade skill working, I might want to have some reasonable armor. As I continue my search of D:3, I've come upon a book - excitedly, I ID'd it, but it was just a Book of Minor Magic (flame.) Still, this could potentially be helpful - I'm now about as decked out as I could be should I come across an Ice Beast! I just don't know if I want to spare the magic levels...\n\nContinuing along, I've run into Jack Bauer, an old ghost of a Hill Orc Priest...he's not noticed me, so I'm going to try my best to avoid him. I really hate fighting Priests of Beogh. As I moved on, using a combination of Mephitic Cloud for the confusion and my falchion for the kill, the dungeon was finally cleared - all except for that darned ghost. \n\nNow, while I search for opponents to give myself a little more EXP before I leave, I'm left to wonder if this is smart. If I run into that ghost, and he sees me, I could have a difficult fight on my hands. I'm not sure if I'd make the stairs in time. Sure enough, as I'm resting there, the ghost appears...after exchanging a few quick blows, I run for the stairs. I've made it, and the encounter has made up my mind. It's time to go find another stairwell and skip back down to D:4.\n\n==Dungeon:4==\nAs soon as I drop down into D:4, I see the ghost of X, a Chaos Knight. I simply sat my turns, watching him walk by...and just as it looked like he would miss me, he turned. I fired a few darts at him, and then Jessica appeared! It didn't take me long to get back upstairs with that kind of incentive.\n\nDown another flight, and there's nothing here. Phew. I picked up an uncursed glowing blowgun earlier, and as I delve through this stage of the dungeon, a local kobold stops by to donate me all of his poisoned needles. Thanks!\n\nI found Jessica again, but this time she just wasn't paying attention. One Mephitic Cloud and a couple falchion swipes later, I stood on her corpse and admired her robe. Glowing, but I think I'll stick with what I've got on for now. Feeling better about my chances, I turn around and promptly run into X...yipes! I run over to the nearby stairs, and then take a stand. Summoning several rats and bats, I leave the combat to them and go stand at a distance to watch. It appears that this Chaos Knight can poison his opponents; I'm starting to feel like maybe I should leave well enough alone.\n\nNonetheless, I feel confident, and am determined to fight. I've been sacrificing countless small mammals to this ghost, but he just keeps coming. Eventually, through heavy mammal spam, he goes under. I let out a sigh of relief, but there's no time for relief - I immediately come upon 3 gnolls. A Mephitic Cloud distracts two of them, but the third gives chase, and I run for my life. I circle around an obstacle, but when I come back around, one of the earlier Gnolls is blocking my path! I'm out of MP, so I have no choice but to try to cut him down...I quickly do so, bringing myself down to 12 HP and gaining Long Blades skill in the process, and then break for the stairs...but just as I try to ascend them, I am cut down for those 12 HP. Game Over."}

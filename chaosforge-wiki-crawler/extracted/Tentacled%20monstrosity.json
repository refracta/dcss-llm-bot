{"title":"Tentacled monstrosity","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tentacled_monstrosity","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Tentacled monstrosities''' are enormous, deadly [[demonic]] monsters which seek out invaders to crush. They have exceptional amounts of [[HP]], resist almost all elemental damage, and can [[constrict]] you in combat to deal heavy amounts of damage. Characters without superlative AC will take a heavy beating if they face a tentacled monstrosity in melee for too long. They can be found in [[the Depths]], the bottom floor of [[the Vaults]] and [[the Swamp]], [[the Realm of Zot]], and [[Mnoleg]]'s domain.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Remember that constriction partially ignores your AC. If you're playing a fragile character and find one getting too close to you for comfort, do whatever it takes to get away. It doesn't take long to turn a [[deep elf]] to paste.\n*Constriction greatly reduces your [[evasion]], making that [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear|crystal spear]] much more likely to hit you.\n*Fortunately, tentacled monstrosities qualify as [[demon]]s, making weapons of [[holy wrath]] excellent for cutting them down to size.\n*Tentacled monstrosities have no ranged attacks whatsoever. If you can boost your movement speed to above average, you can kite them to death in relative safety.\n*Trying to use [[stairs]] next to a tentacled monstrosity is a bad idea. They will often constrict you as you go down, making you waste a turn and locking you in place.\n*You can summon your own tentacled monstrosities with the [[Summon Horrible Things]] spell (up to 2 at a time at very high [[spell power]]).\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|tentacled monstrosities will no longer spawn in [[the Vaults]].}}\n*Prior to [[0.28]], tentacled monstrosities (like all [[demonic]] monsters) could not go [[berserk]]."}

{"title":"Shadowghast","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shadowghast","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''This page is about the [[List of monsters|monster]]. For the card, see [[Shadow card]]''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Shadows''' are [[undead]] creatures which can briefly become [[invisible]]. They can be found in the middle floors of the [[Dungeon]]\n\nWhen a shadow is invisible and not [[backlit]], it gains a boost to movement speed (14.2 [[Movement#Monster Speed|speed]]). Also, if the target cannot [[see invisible]], an invisible shadow deals 2.5x damage, never misses, and reveals itself.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Shadows are fast-moving enemies that can deal extreme amounts of damage (35 dmg/hit), who also go invisible. Very strong for the places they apppear in.\n*Being able to negate their invisibility is an obvious benefit. If you don't have see invisible already, pop on a [[ring of see invisible]] (if you have one).\n**Note that shadows are immune to [[Sticky Flame]] (they are [[insubstantial]]) and aren't revealed from [[shallow water]] (they fly).\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|shadows will be renamed to '''shadowghasts'''.}}\n*Prior to [[0.19]], players would summon [[neutral]] shadows when wielding a [[lantern of shadows]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], shadows were unable to go invisible, and damaged your [[strength]] when they attacked."}

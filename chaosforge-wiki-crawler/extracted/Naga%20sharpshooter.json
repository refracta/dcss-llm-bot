{"title":"Naga sharpshooter","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Naga_sharpshooter","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | nagas}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Naga sharpshooters''' are infuriating back-line attackers which pelt you with [[smite-targeted]] arrows from the back lines. They can be found in the [[Snake Pit]], often with other [[list of nagas|nagas]] or as part of [[Vashnia]]'s sniper band.\n\nNaga sharpshooters have the [[:Category:Archer flag|Archer flag]], dealing up to 12 extra damage with ranged weapons.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Due to the bonuses from weapon and Archer flag, naga sharpshooters can deal surprisingly high damage at range. With a +0 [[arbalest]], a sharpshooter can deal 45 damage/shot. That's a ''lot'' when 3-4 sharpshooters are on the screen. If you have multiple sharpshooters in [[LOS]], strongly consider repositioning. Judicious use of corners can help tremendously.\n*Unlike [[list of centaurs|centaurs]], sharpshooters won't stop firing their bows when you're in melee range. Also, thanks to [[Portal Projectile]], their shots are often [[smite-targeted]] - hiding behind other monsters won't help.\n*Like other nagas, sharpshooters are slow, so consider retreating if things get hairy. Due to the ranged attacks, try to retreat sooner rather than later.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], monsters had hidden weapon penalties (they attacked slower).\n*Naga sharpshooters were added in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Naga]]"}

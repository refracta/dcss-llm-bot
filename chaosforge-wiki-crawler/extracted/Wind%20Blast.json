This inflicts no damage, but can make maneuvering around a battle or standing your ground in a safe choke point extremely difficult. It cannot force its victim to enter [[deep water]] or [[lava]].\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the spell could push [[flying]] targets further away.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], a similar effect was available to the player via the [[fan of gales]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

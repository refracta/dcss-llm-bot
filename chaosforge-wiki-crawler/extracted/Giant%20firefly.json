Apart from that, they are mostly harmless, though lightly armoured low-level characters may wish to be careful when confronting them en masse. They can be found alone or in packs in [[the Swamp]], certain [[Lair]] [[vault]]s, and in the company of [[list of spriggans|spriggans]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nNone needed. Kill off more dangerous opponents before worrying about them.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.13]], they were far less common, and were unable to signal others.\n\nGiant fireflies were added in [[0.7]] and removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

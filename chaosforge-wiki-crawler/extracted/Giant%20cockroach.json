{"title":"Giant cockroach","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Giant_cockroach","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Giant cockroaches''' are common pests found all throughout the early [[Dungeon]]. They are faster than the average character, but only pose a threat to low level characters on the brink of death.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Their AC can pose a problem for characters with weak starting attacks, particularly those with low-power L1 spells. Don't be afraid to beat them with an unskilled melee weapon if your spells are repeatedly doing no damage.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], giant cockroaches could [[cling]] onto walls in order to travel through adjacent water.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], chunks of giant cockroach meat were contaminated."}

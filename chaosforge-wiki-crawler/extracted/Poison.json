{"title":"Poison","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Poison","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''This page is about the effect. For the removed spell school and skill, see [[Poison Magic]].''\n\n'''Poison''' is one of the most common elemental forces you will encounter as you explore the [[Dungeon]]. It is most often encountered in the form of stings and bites of poisonous monsters, though it can also be inflicted through spells or venom.\n\n==Useful Info==\nGenerally, being poisoned means gaining the Poison [[status effect]]. Its duration and damage per turn depends on its severity. Poison can be stacked; multiple instances of poison will increase the severity. For players, severity is displayed by the colour of the word \"Pois\" (going from yellow -> light red -> red). For monsters, you can view severity by e'''x'''amining it. In tiles mode, monster poison is represented by green drops (\"extremely poisoned\" = 3 drops = max poison).\n\nIn addition, some spells, like [[Sting]], [[Poisonous Cloud]], and [[Poison Arrow]], deal poison ''impact'' damage. This is the same as any regular form of damage, but is resisted by poison resistance.\n\nWhile even low-level characters can usually survive mild poisoning, severe cases can deal tremendous amounts of damage over time. In any case, it is almost always best to rest and avoid combat until the poison has run its course, perhaps on a cleared floor to avoid wandering monsters.\n\nPoison will continue to damage monsters outside [[line of sight]], however, it won't do anything to monsters on a different floor.\n\n==Sources==\nPlayers (and monsters) can apply poison via the following methods:\n\n*Certain forms of [[Alchemy]] magic\n*[[Venom]]-branded melee weapons\n*[[Staff of alchemy]] or [[Staff of Olgreb]]\n*[[Poisoned]] and [[curare]]-tipped [[dart]]s\n*[[Naga]]s have an innate [[Spit Poison]] ability.\n\n===Poison Types===\nIn addition to [[venom]]-branded weapons, monsters can have innate poisonous attacks. There are two types: normal and strong poison. Both have a 1/3 chance to trigger on each hit.\n\n*Normal poison will poison the player for a random amount between 2 and 4 times the monster's [[HD]]\n*Strong poison will instead poison for 3.67-6.5 times the monster's HD\n\nVenom-branded weapons work differently. For monsters, venom has a 75% chance to add 6-13 poison damage, plus a random amount ranging from 0 to 1.5x physical damage done. For players, it inflicts <code>1 + (4 + 1d8 + 1d<1.5 * dam>)/7</code> \"stacks\" of poison to the enemy.\n\n==Poison Resistance==\nPlayers and monsters can have a single level of poison resistance (rPois+) or complete immunity (rPoisâˆž, represented in the code as rPois+++). rPois+ doesn't stack, so an [[Octopode]] can't wear 3 rings to gain immunity.\n\nPoison resistance grants the following:\n*66% (2/3) chance to prevent the poison status from most sources.\n*66% chance to block the slow effect of [[curare]], the slow/paralysis of [[hornet]]s, and hostile [[Alistair's Intoxication]].\n*-66% poison impact damage.\n*Full immunity to [[Clouds#Poison|poisonous clouds]], [[Mercury Vapours]]' poison, and [[Mephitic Cloud]].\nIn addition, rPois monsters (not players) are fully immune to [[curare]]. For most effects, poison resistance does ''not'' reduce the amount of poison status directly, only the chance that you get poisoned. \n\nPoison immune creatures can't be poisoned and do not take poison impact damage. \n\nNote that [[Sting]], [[Poison Arrow]], and [[Eringya's Noxious Bog]] deal 70% poison impact and 30% physical damage, so even poison immune creatures will take some damage from these spells. Poison resistant creatures take a total of 53% damage from these spells.\n\n===Poison Vulnerability===\nSome monsters (particularly insects and spiders) are vulnerable to poison, taking twice as much damage from poison attacks, and doubling the amount of poisoning received. You can also gain vulnerability from the [[Virulence]] spell.\n\nAny amount of rPois+ will negate vulnerability, causing you to take regular damage from poison. Poison immunity, of course, prevents poison vulnerability from doing anything.\n\n===Sources of resistance===\nYou can acquire poison resistance from a number of sources:\n*[[Good mutations#Poison Resistance|Poison Resistance]] [[mutation]]\n*[[Good mutations#Slimy Green Scales|Slimy Green Scales]] 3\n*[[Swamp dragon scales]]\n*[[Gold dragon scales]]\n*Armour of [[ego|poison resistance]]\n*[[Staff of poison]]\n*[[Ring of poison resistance]]\n*[[Tiamat]]'s [[dragonskin cloak]] (50% chance per attack)\n*[[Randart]]s\n*[[Potion of resistance]]\n*[[Tree form]] from a [[potion of lignification]]\n*[[Dragon Form]]\n*Being a [[naga]] or green [[draconian]]\n\nAdditionally, there are a few ways to become totally immune:\n*Being an undead race ([[mummy]], [[ghoul]], or bloodless [[vampire]]), [[gargoyle]], or [[djinni]]\n*Players in [[Death Form]], [[Statue Form]], or [[Storm Form]] are immune to poison while in one of those forms. Poison won't count down during these transformations, however, so if you transform while poisoned you'll be just as poisoned when they end.\n*Wielding the [[Staff of Olgreb]]. Unlike the transformations above, the poison status will count down (harmlessly) while you wield it.\n*[[Zin]]'s Vitalisation ability. Poison counts down harmlessly.\n\nSome things other than resistance can help against poison as well:\n*[[Healing]] yourself through other means will ''not'' cure the condition, but may give you the HP you need to wait it out.\n\n==Curing Poison==\nCharacters that lack poison resistance can still avoid the worst of its effects by curing the condition before it runs its course. The following options are available:\n*[[Quaff]]ing a [[potion of curing]].\n*[[Elyvilon]]'s Purification ability\n\n==Poisoned Condition==\nPoison attacks frequently result in a monster or player having the \"poisoned\" [[condition]]. While poisoned, a creature will take an amount of damage proportional to the degree to which it is poisoned. Each dose of poison \"stacks\" with previous ones, increasing the eventual damage. Different damage formulas are used for players and monsters:\n\n===Player Formula===\n*For players, poisoning has a predetermined total damage, and will deal a portion of that damage each turn. The more poisoned you are, the more damage per turn this will do and the longer it will last. The total amount of damage it will eventually do is displayed as a yellow-highlighted section of the health bar.\n\n*If you worship [[Cheibriados]] (any piety level, not under penance), poisoning will only do 2/3rds as much damage per [[aut]], but will last 1.5 times as long. This effectively spreads the damage out over a longer time, which gives you more time to regenerate health.\n\n===Monster Formula===\nMonster poison is measured by the number of \"stacks\" of poison it has. Each source of poison will inflict one or multiple stacks. There is a maximum of 4 stacks,<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|mon-ench.h|8}}</ref> after which a monster is \"as sick as possible\".\n\nDamage per turn is determined by the number of stacks of poison a monster has: <ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|mon-ench.cc|1549}}</ref>\n\n*If stacks = 4, base damage is 1. Otherwise, base damage is 0.\n*There is a 50% chance of an additional <code>1d(stacks + 1)</code> damage.\n*If the monster is vulnerable to poison, there is an additional <code>2d(stacks) - 1</code> damage.\n\nThis damage is then modified by poison vulnerability (but not resistance).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Poison damage per 1.0 turn (monsters)\n|-\n! rowspan=2| # Stacks \n! width=\"100pt\" colspan=2| Normal\n!\n! width=\"100pt\" colspan=2| Vulnerable\n! rowspan=2| Description\n|-\n!Dmg.!!Avg.!! !!Dmg.!!Avg.\n|-\n|1 \n| 0-2 || 0.75 \n!\n| 1-3 || 1.75\n| Poisoned\n|-\n|2 \n| 0-3 || 1 \n! \n| 1-6 || 3\n| Very poisoned\n|-\n| 3 \n| 0-4 || 1.25\n!\n|| 1-9 || 4.25\n| Very poisoned\n|-\n|4 \n| 1-6 || 2.5\n! \n| 2-13 || 6.5 \n| Extremely poisoned\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], poison damaged players much more slowly. Overall damage was the same, but damage/turn was weaker.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], monsters with poison resistance were immune to the poison status effect, except from the [[staff of poison]] and [[Poison Arrow]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], poison resistance allowed you to eat poisoned [[chunk]]s, which have been replaced by inedible chunks.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], poison's damage over time was randomized instead of being a fixed value.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], [[Statue Form]] only granted one level of poison resistance.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==See Also==\n[[:Category:Poison resistance|List of poison resistant monsters]]\n\n[[:Category:Poison vulnerability|List of poison vulnerable monsters]]\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]\n[[Category:Threats]]"}

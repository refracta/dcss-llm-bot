{"title":"Bullfrog","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bullfrog","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n''For a list of all amphibians, see [[List of reptiles and amphibians]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Bullfrogs''' are fast-moving [[list of reptiles and amphibians|amphibians]] that have meager offensive abilities, but which can be a threat to very low-level characters. They are usually found in the early-mid [[Dungeon]] and [[the Lair]], but can appear as [[out-of-depth]] foes very early, or at the end of the [[Sewers]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nA bullfrog's speed makes escaping them difficult, particularly when they're encountered in water. If you know you can't outrun them to a [[stair]]case or [[door]] that you can close, spend your actions hitting them with [[throwing]] weapons or [[wand]]s. Simply running won't accomplish anything.\n\nIn the Sewers, a [[wand of flame]] will create [[steam]] clouds above [[water]], which should be enough to handle the bullfrogs there. Any other wand can work, as well.\n\n==History==\nPrior to version [[0.19]], bullfrogs were known as '''giant frogs'''."}

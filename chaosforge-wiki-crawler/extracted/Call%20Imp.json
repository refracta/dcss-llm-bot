{"title":"Call Imp","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Call_Imp","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Call Imp''' is a level 2 [[Summonings|Summoning]] spell which summons a cerulean imp.\n\n[[Hedge Wizard]]s and [[Summoner]]s start with this spell in their spell library.\n\n==Useful Info==\nSummons a single [[cerulean imp]]. It will be holding a [[spear]], with an [[enchant]]ment of <code>pow/10 - 4</code> (rounded down).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-summoning.cc|916}}</ref> The spear will never be [[brand]]ed.\n\nHigher spell power increases the spear enchantment. It does not increase the summon's [[HD]].\n\nDuration of the summon is around 27 turns; it does not depend on spell power.\n\nThere is a summon cap of 1 imp; casting the spell again will cause the old summon to very quickly time out.\n\n==Strategy==\nImps are cheap to create, and they can help deal with many early game fights. Thanks to their [[polearm]], cerulean imps can attack from behind their caster (or other summons). This makes imps useful, even if you have otherwise stronger summons like [[Call Canine Familiar]].\n\n==Monster Version==\nThe monster version works similarly to the player version, though Natasha can summon up to 3 imps at once.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], the summon [[duration class]] ranged from 2 (around 18 turns) to 6 (around 171 turns). The formula was <code>2 + 1d(pow)/5</code> duration class (capped at 6).\n*Prior to [[0.30]], this spell would summon a [[crimson imp]], [[white imp]], [[iron imp]], or [[shadow imp]]. It also had a power cap of 100.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], this spell had a summon cap of 3.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the type of an imp varied with spellpower. Higher spell power increased the probability of getting a shadow or iron imp and decreased the chance of summoning a crimson imp.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], summoned [[shadow imp]]s could give you permanent undead allies by casting [[Animate Dead]], allowing characters without [[Necromancy]] to create undead armies.\n*Prior to [[0.7]], Call Imp was a level 3 spell. Also, it could not summon iron imps.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

This game appears to be going better though, so I might as well\nstart writing a diary to absolutely guarantee a horrible death as soon\nas possible.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I've ascended Nethack and SlashEM characters quite a bit. I stopped counting after 20, then just kind of stopped playing several years ago and now don't remember exactly. Whether this makes me better or worse at Crawl (which I have just discovered), I'm not sure.\n\nI have my early-stage Transmuter game fairly well sorted - memorise\nFulsome Distillation first up, wander around D:1 beating up goblins and\nbats until reaching XL2, then learn Sticks to Snakes and Evaporate to\ngive me some ability to survive running into anything just a little bit\nhairy.\n\nThe major discovery for me this time around was ''victory dancing''.\nRuthlessly gaming Transmutation (mostly via Sticks to Snakes, collecting\nclubs and quarterstaves) made a huge difference to the next bit: having\na reliable Spider Form. Mostly the next bit was pretty cruisy,\nexcept for tough enemies that were either poison- or confusion-\nresistant (or both), like player ghosts. Then the spider legs came in\nhandy again for the running away :)\n\nHad a major stroke of luck finding an artifact ring with Int bonuses,\npushing up the success rate of spells, which became a cycle of positive\nreinforcement that soon had Transmutation on the right side of 10.\n\nFound the Ecumenical Temple (annoyingly surrounded by steam clouds!) and\nconverted to Cheibriados. Converted one's robe to Ponderous in order to\nmake everything faster than me, and it was time to start (very slowly)\nbuilding up. Each point of piety rank snowballed into more\nponderousness, more piety... and suddenly I was feeling pretty\nbulletproof.\n\n''Ice Form!'' Nothing was standing in the way for long in the Lair. Until it\ndid... had my first Near Death Experience getting overrun in a Spider\nNest near the bottom of the Lair, somehow escaping with a couple of HP\nand scrolls of blinking.\n\nBy the way, how awesome are scrolls of Blinking?\n\nRealised my hoarding of !oC/!oP was completely unnecessary. Between the\nHive and the Orcish Mines, I was never going to run out. So amused\nmyself with Evaporate rather a lot.\n\nHad trained Invocations up a bit now (Bend Time on empty squares) and\nSlouched my way through the Hive in about eight seconds flat. Couldn't\nfigure out the way into the alleged Wasp Vault.\n\nSpeaking of Slouch... how do people deal with Unseen Horros any other\nway? I can never go back.\n\nAt this point there was a bit of an oversupply of options. Lots of\nspellbooks were starting to turn up, and caused me to make some less-\nthan-excellent spell choices (Ignite Poison, I'm talking to you).\nBy the time I found the Volume of Shapeshifting And The Mountain and\nrealised what I wanted to do with my life, it was a bit too late.\nFortunately one of them contained the forget spell... can't wait until\nI'm level 16 and have enough spell levels spare to learn it and get\nrid of Ensorcelled Hibernation and friends.\n\nAnother option is that I've found a nice randart bow with SInv, Reaping\nand sundry bonuses. And I *have* been getting annoyed with meleeing\nmonsters to near death then having them turn round and easily outrun my\nPonderous ass. Hmm. Maybe it's time for archery practice.\n\nAt the bottom of the Snake Pit, heeding the warnings of its scariness\nbut curious, I meet Kirke and her hogs. She lasts about two seconds,\nand I'm disappointed that none of her little piggies leaves me any\nbacon. Then around the very next corner is Norris...\n\nEven poisoned and being run through the Blade Hands Moulinex a whole\nbunch of times, he seems to take a *long* time to go down. But go down\nhe does, casting spells the whole time. Suddenly I have a *lot* of XP\nto victory dance with, and the sneaking suspicion I may have gotten\naway with something.\n\nUnfortunately, hiking back up to my stash to do some sorting sees all\nthat XP go to Unarmed Combat, so I guess we'll never know. Back down,\nand the Naga Mages and Greater Naga are indeed tough. My improvised\ndefences of Ice Form and swapping out one of my randart rings for a\n=oPResist seem to be holding out, but stair dancing ensues. Fortunately\nthey keep hasting themselves and bringing Slouch into play, or it would\nbe more of a bastard. At least one of them has dropped a Robe of\nReistance (now poetically named the Robe of the Mountain).\n\nAbout the worst thing that happens is a Greater Naga teleporting me\nback into the main room as I'm running for the stairs, but that's what\nscrolls of teleportation are for. Which is great because by the time it\nkicks in, I'm in bad shape due to all the poison arrows.\n\nEventually see off a few more and grab the Rune, but fighting the\nspellcasting nagas is less fun than it looks like and I retreat back\nupstairs to juggle my spells around. Feeling Earthy, I pick up Dig and\nLee's Rapid Deconstruction to see what they're like.\n\n(a bit later)\n\n''Near Death #2'': Azrael kicks the stuffing out of me. My blink doesn't\nget me far enough and for some reason my teleoprts keep failing. I can't\nteleport him away either, and he seems unimpressed by my little Step\nFrom Time technique... eventually a teleport works when I'm down to 2hp.\nCrikey. Maybe it's time to go see about some of those other branches...\n\nThe Shoals sure are pretty. The tides are interesting. Krakens are\nhilarious! Sirens, not so much.\n\nI realise that making things Ponderous straight away ensures you can't\nlater enchant them. Hmm.\n\nLee's Rapid Deconstruction annoys me with its lack of both damage, and\nwall destruction. I think it might have to go.\n\nRun into Louise on Shoals:3. She hasn't noticed me yet (I've been letting Stealth build up and this happens a lot), so I tiptoe back\nand peep into the Slime Pits. Straight away mobbed by Slime Creatures\nand get a good beating, so that doesn't look so crash hot... back to the\nDungeon.\n\nThis time I'm ready for Azrael with better fire resistance and ambush\nhim in a tunnel. He still scorches me up pretty good but goes down.\n\nLee's Deconstruction actually pretty good when you get the hang of it.\n\nD:19 brings the entrance to the Vaults. Crap. Mara.\n\nD:21 has the entrance to the Vestibule of Hell. Jolly good.\n\nIt also has Boris. Who, because I am Ponderous, nails me with a pair of Orbs of\nDestruction that I can't run from (I'm out of Blink scrolls). So much for that game, though it was\nmy best by far.\n\nEpilogue: What should I have done differently? I may have wasted a turn looking at Boris and not immediately teleporting away, but my feeling was that he killed me in two turns, which wasn't enough time for the instability to take effect.\n\nShould I not have been that deep in the Dungeon yet? Basically my only other options were the Slime Pits, or taking on Louise in the lower Shoals. Mara sounds like he's just as bad as Boris, and was blocking my access to the Vaults by lurking right at the entrance. I was a bit stuck.\n\n''Other lessons learned:''\n\n1. Pick a spellcasting idea and stick to it. I didn't help myself dicking around with Enchantments and Fire Magic and whatnot and never getting good at anything.\n\n2. Don't stress too much about permafood. Food is actually pretty plentiful in the middle game, just eat it and don't panic trying to find corpses. The same goes for hoarding masses of potions.\n\n3. Dig is absurdly useful."}

Its attributes and breath attacks vary based on where you encounter it, though all versions are able to [[Summon Dragon|summon powerful]] [[list of dragons|dragons]].\n\n==Variations==\n*{{monsterlink|Serpent of Hell (Gehenna)}}\n*{{monsterlink|Serpent of Hell (Cocytus)}}\n*{{monsterlink|Serpent of Hell (Tartarus)}}\n*{{monsterlink|Serpent of Hell (Dis)}}\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|the Cocytus, Gehenna, and Dis Serpents will get new breath attacks. Also, the Cocytus and Gehenna Serpents will get more health, while Dis Serpent's defenses will be slightly nerfed.}}\n*In [[0.16]] the Serpent of Hell received a considerable buff, gaining two extra heads each capable of breathing/attacking individually as well as [[Summon Dragon]].\n*In ancient versions of ''Crawl'', the Serpent of Hell did not appear as a unique monster, but rather as a generic dragon that could be found en masse guarding the lowest level of [[Gehenna]]. While they may have had fewer [[HP]], the fact they could appear in considerable numbers made them more dangerous than the single monster ever was: facing multiple 20-HD hellfire-breathing dragons at a time was often a quick death."}

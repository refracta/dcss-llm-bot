He was so punctilious and strict in the management of his household, in small matters as well as in those of great importance, that he put his baker in irons for serving him with one kind of bread and his guests with another...\"<br>-Suetonius, _De Vita Caesarium, Divus Iulius_. 110 CE.}}\n\n'''Rations''' are the source of permafood in ''Crawl''; they do not rot away over time and can be eaten by all races except [[vampire]]s and [[mummy|mummies]]. They restore 3,400 nutrition for most species, less for carnivores and herbivores since these races only eat part of the ration.\n\nAll species except vampires and mummies start with a ration in their inventory. Due to their increased metabolism, [[troll]]s start with two.\n\nRations are displayed by randomised food tiles on the floor, ranging from bread and meat to different types of fruit and even pizza.\n\n==Strategy==\nMost characters will have no problem with running out of rations. Worshippers of [[Gozag]] are likely to run out at some point since it turns all corpses to gold, at which point they should call a food shop to replenish their supply of rations. Characters which are casting high-level spells very frequently may run low on food if they don't have sufficient [[intelligence]] and [[spellcasting]] skill to negate [[spell hunger]], and should be particularly careful of over-using these spells in areas with few edible corpses, such as [[the Snake Pit]], [[the Spider's Nest]], and [[the Swamp]]. \n\n[[Spriggan]]s should be especially careful with over-using higher level spells, since they cannot eat chunks at all. In this case it may become necessary to [[scroll of acquirement|acquire]] food or purchase from food shops to avoid starvation.\n\nTrolls, with their greatly increased metabolism, may run low on rations if they spend extended periods of time in areas with few edible corpses, especially if they make use of abilities with significant hunger costs like [[berserk]]ing.\n\n==Nutrition==\n*Normal species: 3,400\n*[[Carnivore]]s: 1,900\n*[[Herbivore]]s: 1,900\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.26]], [[food]] and [[hunger]] were removed.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], some of [[Fedhas]]'s abilities consumed rations when used.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], there were four different types of permafood: [[bread ration|bread]], [[meat ration|meat]], [[royal jellies]] and [[fruit]], which gave different amounts of satiation and were differentiated based on herbivore/carnivore mutations.\n\n[[Category:Comestible]]"}

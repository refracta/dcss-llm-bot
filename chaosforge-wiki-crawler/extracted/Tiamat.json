{"title":"Tiamat","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tiamat","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | draconians}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n[[Tiamat]] is a [[unique]] [[list of draconians|draconian]] who sometimes appears in the [[Realm of Zot]]. One of the strongest uniques before [[extended]], she is a draconian who constantly changes color, giving her access to any of the draconian breath weapons (and the matching resistance). She always wears the [[dragonskin cloak]], and comes with a very large retinue of draconians.\n\n==Location==\n*The [[Realm of Zot]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Strategy==\nBe prepared for a long, dangerous, and difficult fight if you chose to take on Tiamat. With high HP and extreme [[HD]], it's difficult to kill her quickly. She changes colour often, allowing for a variety of breath attacks (see the [[Draconian]] page for each kind). Her melee is no slouch, either.\n\nIf you do decide to take on Tiamat, make sure to clear her entourage first.\n*Melee/ranged fighters should have great defenses ([[AC]], [[EV]], [[SH]]). Most characters will want to buff up; [[Might]] and [[Haste]] are easy. [[Berserk]] is dangerous; since she has such good defenses, it's likely that berserk will run out before she dies. \n*Magic users often have a tough time killing her before running out of [[MP]]. A [[potion of brilliance]] can alleviate that issue, but Tiamat is still a tough foe. She can gain elemental resistances (from colour and cloak), which can make it difficult if you rely on an elemental spell. However, these resistances aren't regular, so you can wait them out.\n\nIf nothing else, remember that you don't have to kill everything in Crawl. Tiamat is a 10-speed enemy, so under normal circumstances, you can run away. If you do decide to fight, be prepared to run if things go badly. Her breath weapons can do a lot of damage, and [[teleport]]s are delayed in Zot.\n\nAn easy (and often deadly) mistake is to simply not notice her until it's too late. She's very recognizable in Tiles mode, but console players can make the mistake. Tiamat's habit of constantly changing colors means that she isn't a unique color, and thus does not visually stand out from the draconian band that invariably surrounds her.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Pay attention to what's near Tiamat. [[Draconian shifter]]s can teleport her (and 7 other draconians) directly adjacent to you. A [[moth of wrath]] can berserk Tiamat, which you really don't want.\n*Like other draconians, Tiamat is [[cold-blooded]]. She can get rC+ from colour or the dragonskin cloak. Otherwise, she can be slowed by [[cold]] attacks.\n*Tiamat only has moderate EV, so spells such as [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] or [[Bombard]] are effective. But her high health means that most casters will need some method of restoring MP to last long enough to kill her.\n*Don't forget about any other items you may have picked up:\n**[[Throwing net]]s will pin Tiamat down for several turns, giving you time to flee or deal some serious [[stab]]bing damage.\n**A [[phantom mirror]] creates a clone for a few turns; a friendly version of Tiamat is one of the strongest allies you can ask for.\n**A [[scroll of vulnerability]] can make it reasonable to [[paralyse]], polymorph, or otherwise hex her. Just beware the usual risks of this scroll.\n\n==Trivia==\nIn Babylonian mythology, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiamat Tiamat] is a goddess considered to be the monstrous embodiment of primordial chaos. Although there are no early precedents for it, some sources (including Dungeons & Dragons) identify her with images of a sea serpent or dragon.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], Tiamat got a much more impressive tile. Previously, she blended into other draconians.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], Tiamat wore [[gold dragon armour]], granting her phenomenal AC. As player [[Draconian]]s lost the body armour slot in this version, her armour was replaced with the [[dragonskin cloak]]."}

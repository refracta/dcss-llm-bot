{"title":"Nessos","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Nessos","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | centaurs}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Nessos the Markscentaur''' is a [[unique]] [[centaur (monster)|centaur]] generated with a [[longbow]] of [[flame]] and [[barding]]. In addition to the longbow's flaming, Nessos' shots are always [[poisoned]]. Wielding the longbow yourself won't give you the poison effect.\n\nDue to the [[:Category:Archer flag|archer flag]], Nessos deals up to 12 extra damage with ranged weapons.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:12-15\n*The [[Orcish Mines]]:2\n*The [[Lair]]:3-5\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Without fire and/or poison resistance, Nessos is a very dangerous opponent - especially when hasted. A hasted Nessos can fire 2-3 times per turn, dealing <code>38 + weapon [[enchant]] + flame + venom</code> damage per shot. Even with both resistances, this centaur can be tough to pin down.\n*Nessos has almost no willpower, so [[Hexes]] and hex [[wand]]s are extremely effective. In particular, a [[wand of polymorph]] will likely turn them into a form that can't use weapons, and [[Tukima's Dance]] gets rid of the bow entirely. With only 9 HD, [[Mephitic Cloud]] and other HD checks can also work.\n*Like other centaurs, Nessos won't fire when in melee with the player - this greatly reduces their threat level. However, as Nessos has [[Blink Range]] spell, staying in melee can be difficult.\n**A [[potion of attraction]] pulls enemies into melee, allowing you to counter Blink Range. Watch out for the usual risks of attraction, though. A [[killhole]] (if you can make one) is more effective and doesn't come with as many risks.\n*Going [[berserk]] is not recommended, as Nessos will just [[Blink]] away from you and fill you with arrows as your berserk runs out. Other buffs, such as a haste of your own, still work fine.\n*Having some form of [[Repel Missiles#Player sources|Repel Missiles]] and/or [[Reflection]] can be very useful here.\n\n==Trivia==\nNessos is a reference to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nessus_(mythology) Nessus], an evil centaur that Heracles killed with a hydra-poisoned arrow after it attempted to rape his wife. It managed to kill Heracles in the process, however, by convincing his wife that Nessus' now-corrosive blood would make Heracles forever faithful to her if she would spread it on his clothing.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Nessos did base 16 damage with weapons (not including the archer flag), but didn't have a kick attack. This change was to compensate for the removal of hidden weapon penalties in this version.\n*Nessos was male before version [[0.24]]."}

Everything about it reeks of malign influences... but it's hard to avoid thinking that it would look better with a ring on it.}}\n\n[[File:Macabre_finger_necklace.png]] '''''the macabre finger necklace'''''\n\n[[Negative energy|rN+]]<br>\n+1 [[ring]] slot<br>\n[[Evil]]\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''macabre finger necklace'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|1296}}</ref> replaces the [[amulet]] slot with rN+ and a 3rd ring slot, which can be a good deal. For example, if you'd wear an [[amulet of reflection]], consider wearing the finger necklace and a [[ring of evasion]] instead. You'll lose [[reflection]] itself, but the ring offers better defensive stats. This amulet really shines when you already have 2 great [[artefact]] rings, and need resistances (or want to wear a 3rd great ring). \n\nYou can't remove this amulet without removing the third ring. If your third ring is [[cursed]] by [[Ashenzari]], you will not be able to remove the macabre finger necklace.\n\nThis item is considered evil, so the [[good god]]s forbid its use.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], the macabre finger necklace was not considered [[evil]].\n*In [[0.18]], the [[warding]] ego was removed from amulets, leaving the macabre finger necklace as just an extra ring slot with rN+.\n*The macabre finger necklace was added in [[0.14]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Amulets]]"}

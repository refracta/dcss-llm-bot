{"title":"Reflection","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Reflection","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|You reflect any successfully blocked ranged attacks back towards the attacker.}}\n\n'''Reflection''' is an [[ego]] that can be found on [[shields]] and [[amulet]]s. It reflects all successfully [[Shields#Blocking|blocked]] projectiles, both physical and magical, back in the direction they originated. An [[amulet of reflection]] grants +5 [[SH]], though shields of reflection don't give any more SH than their mundane counterparts.\n\nKeep in mind that you must ''block'' the attack in order it to be reflected. Some spells can't be blocked - while you can reflect a devastating [[crystal spear]] or [[orb of destruction]], you can't deflect an [[Airstrike]], [[Bolt of Fire]], or [[javelin]]. For a list of what can and can't be blocked, see [[Shields#Effect|Shields]]. And since you must succeed your SH roll to actually block, reflection works best at high levels of SH.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Reflection is strong against enemies with blockable projectile attacks, such as [[centaur (monster)|centaurs]] and [[yaktaur]]s, or spellcasters with spells like [[Iron Shot]]. Monsters tend to deal high damage compared to their HP, so a few reflected shots should kill them. Unlike in ''NetHack'', reflection isn't vital for survival.\n**An amulet of reflection can be good for the +5 SH alone. This amulet gives added defense, without the added complexities of [[amulet of guardian spirit|guardian spirit]] or [[amulet of the acrobat|acrobat]]. The reflection property itself can be treated like a bonus.\n**A shield of reflection is at least better than a mundane shield of the same type. Due to the rarity of shields with an [[ego]], a shield of reflection can end up being your best shield, where you might as well use it.\n*The reflected attack can miss and may strike unintended targets.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Warlock's Mirror]], an [[unrand]] buckler that can also reflect enchantments and piercing attacks.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the [[brooch of Shielding]] carried the reflection ego.\n*The [[amulet of reflection]] was added in [[0.18]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the game treated the reflected attack as an attack initiated by the player. If you followed a god who prohibited certain attacks, you would invoke penance for these unintentional reflected attacks.\n\n[[Category:egos]]"}

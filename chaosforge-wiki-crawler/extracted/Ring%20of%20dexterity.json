{"title":"Ring of dexterity","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ring_of_dexterity","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{item\n |itemtype = Jewellery\n |name = Ring of dexterity\n |cost = ?\n}}\n{{flavour|A ring that increases the dexterity of its wearer.}}\n\nA '''+6 ring of dexterity''' increases the [[dexterity]] of the wearer.\n\n==Desirability==\nThe more [[Dodging]] skill you have, and the less [[encumbrance rating|encumbering]] your body armour, the more you gain out of the dexterity stat. Dexterity also boosts [[shields]] and certain weapon's damage ([[Short Blades]], [[Long Blades]], [[Ranged Weapons]]).\n\nA [[Hill Orc]] in [[plate armour]] will prefer a [[ring of evasion]], but a Dodging-based fighter will appreciate dexterity for the general stat boosts. Dex boosts damage, EV, and gives a small boost to SH and stealth -- that's a lot for certain characters. Even then, don't be afraid to swap in a resistance as needed.\n\n===EV Gain===\nExamples of +6 dexterity on EV gain:\n*[[Robe]], 10 Dodging skill, normal [[size]]: +2.4 EV\n*Robe, 16.7 Dodging skill, normal size: +4 EV\n*[[Plate armour]] (15 strength), 6.7 Dodging skill, normal size: +1 EV\nThe effect of dexterity is linear, so it doesn't matter how much Dex you had before wearing this ring. This analysis ignores the effect of shields and weapons. So, even if a [[ring of evasion]] would give more EV, you may prefer this ring instead.\n\nSince dexterity scales with Dodging skill itself, a ring of dexterity becomes stronger as you progress through the game. 10 Dodging may be high for an XL 10 character, but an endgame character can afford to max out the skill.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], you could find rings of dexterity with a -4 enchantment; such rings were always [[curse]]d. Also, there were stepdowns to both evasion and dexterity, which made dexterity less viable as an overall stat.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], typical enchantment values ranged from 2 to 6 (positive and negative).\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

{"title":"Wight","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wight","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Wights''' are [[undead]] monsters armed with powerful weapons and capable of [[draining]] you when they land hits in melee. They aren't very durable and only wear [[robe]]s as armour, but they come in packs of three or four and their draining attacks can quickly diminish characters careless enough to get surrounded. They are found in the early-to-mid [[Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Unlike most other humanoid monsters you've seen, wights don't shout when they notice you. If you come across a band that's resting, you can lure them away one at a time to fight them in relative safety.\n*Fighting them from a distance will negate their ability to drain you, so fast characters should definitely kite them. Even if kiting's not an option, try to soften them up before engaging in melee, and try to engage them one at a time.\n*If you have [[negative energy]] resistance, use it. It'll decrease both their damage output and their XP drain.\n*Their weapons are often [[enchant]]ed and/or [[brand]]ed, so melee characters that can defeat them will often find a weapon upgrade.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], wight items had a higher-than-average (33.33%) chance of being cursed. A monster's weapon enchantment also did not apply in battle, which affected wights the most."}

They boast powerful [[Necromancy]] along with an extremely dangerous ability to reflect damage back at you. Like all deep dwarves, they do not regenerate health naturally.\n\n<!--spl-bot-begin-->\n==Spells==\n\n{{Spellcaster\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Agony]]\n|slot2=[[Dispel Undead]] (3d19)\n|slot3=[[Mirror Damage]]\n|slot4=[[Animate Dead]]\n|slot5=[[Haunt]]\n|slot6=[[Mirror Damage]]\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n<!--spl-bot-end-->\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Living characters facing unborn deep dwarves should definitely bring at least one rank of [[life protection]] to negate Agony. Undead characters can rely on summoned hordes to block the line of fire necessary for Dispel Undead to hit you. [[Abjuration]] can exorcise whatever horrible things Haunt surrounds you with. In the end, though, Mirror Damage is still the most dangerous spell they possess.\n*As with the [[deep dwarf death knight]], when an unborn deep dwarf \"kneels in prayer and is bathed in unholy energy,\" that means it has activated Mirror Damage. In the console game, its glyph will change from a steady white {{White|q}} to an alternating purple {{Magenta|q}} and grey {{LightGrey|q}}. You can also see if mirror damage is active by e'''[[x]]'''amining the dwarf to see if it is \"reflecting injuries.\" The spell lasts approximately 20 turns.\n*When an unborn deep dwarf is reflecting damage, do not hit it with any big [[Conjurations]]. Even if it isn't reflecting damage, don't use any massive multi-turn spells like [[Ice Storm]], [[Fire Storm]], or [[Tornado]], as it may turn on reflection halfway through the spell. Instead, snipe at it while it is not reflecting, or use summons to take it out.\n*Deep dwarf [[ziggurat]] levels are especially dangerous due to unborn dwarves; they can reflect damage back even when offscreen, making the usual ziggurat strategies extremely dangerous.\n\n==History==\nUnborn deep dwarves were replaced with [[unborn]] in [[0.13]].\n\n[[Category:Dwarf]]\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

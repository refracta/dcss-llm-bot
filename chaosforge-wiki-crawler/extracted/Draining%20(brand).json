This deals an additional one-quarter of any damage that pierces defenders' armour as well as a flat 2-4 damage, and also weakens them slightly. A truly terrible weapon...}}\n\nThe '''draining''' [[brand]] adds a [[draining]] effect to weapons. \n\nEach attack from a draining weapon has a 50% chance of doing all of the following:\n*Adds an average of roughly +25% [[negative energy]] damage (0 - 50%) to attacks, applied after [[AC]] and all damage factors (including [[slaying]]).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|attack.cc|840}}<br>Specifically, if you dealt damage, draining adds <code>(1d<damage_dealt>/2) + 0.5</code> negative energy damage, rounded down (thus, this bonus is slightly larger than 25%). Then, the extra 2-4 damage is added.</ref>\n*Deal an additional 2-4 negative energy damage on top of that.\n*Inflicts 20-30 turns of the the [[Draining#Monster|Drained]] status. This decreases monster [[HD]], thus reducing their [[willpower]], [[spell power]], and [[accuracy]]. Further hits can refresh this status, but won't increase the duration beyond 30 turns.\n:Against players, the draining status will temporarily reduce your maximum HP. This can be cured by gaining XP.\n\nMonsters with any sort of [[negative energy resistance|rN+]], including [[demon]]s and [[undead]], are immune to draining entirely. Players with rN+++ are immune, and players with rN+ resist the effect.\n\n==Strategy==\nDraining is a very useful brand in areas with living or plant opponents. While it usually deals less damage than [[flaming]] or [[freezing]], the Drained status is great at debuffing monsters.\n\nHowever, this brand is of little use in places filled with demons, undead, and non-living foes. By the time you reach [[Zot]] or [[extended]], consider [[scroll of brand weapon|rebranding]] a draining weapon, or using a different weapon entirely.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Since the drain status lowers HD, higher HD monsters could switch places with drained monsters, pushing them back and wasting turns.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], draining could not be obtained on [[Ranged Weapons]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], drained players had their skills reduced instead of their maximum HP.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], draining weapons would permanently lower monster HD, which also slightly lowered the experience and piety rewards for killing them.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], draining weapons used against the player had no impact on your skills. Instead, it permanently reduced your experience, potentially causing you to lose experience levels.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{brands}}\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

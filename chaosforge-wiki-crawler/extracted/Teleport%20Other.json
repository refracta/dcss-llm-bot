{"title":"Teleport Other","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Teleport_Other","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Teleport Other''' is a level 3 [[Translocations]] spell which causes a monster to randomly [[teleport]] after 3-5 turns, which certain areas may delay. High [[willpower]] defends against it, and there is no way to control where the target will land. As the name implies, you cannot target yourself with it.\n\n[[Warper]]s start with this spell in their libraries.\n\n==Strategy==\nTeleport is a powerful effect in theory, as monsters are very likely to teleport a large distance away. However, the flaw with Teleport Other is that it checks [[willpower]], so the spell often struggles with low success rates. Investing more into Translocations, a spell school that doesn't directly kill enemies, can be a difficult task. And many monsters simply have too much willpower to reasonably hex. Even if the teleport works, the monster can potentially be warped into your retreat path or even teleport right where it started.\n\nOverall, a strong but ultimately unreliable effect, which isn't a great trait for an escape spell.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|monsters affected from this spell will always teleport out of LOS.}}\n*Prior to [[0.28]], this spell had a power cap of 200.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the [[naga mage]] and [[nagaraja]] could cast this spell.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], [[hellwing]]s could cast this spell.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], the spell worked less often."}

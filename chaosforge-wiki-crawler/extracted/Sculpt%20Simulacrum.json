{"title":"Sculpt Simulacrum","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sculpt_Simulacrum","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n'''Sculpt Simulacrum''' is a level 6 [[Ice]]/[[Alchemy]] spell which creates multiple [[simulacra]] - frail, icy copies - from an adjacent monster. The simulacra take a few turns to form.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen used against a [[natural]], [[demonic]], or [[holy]] monster, it creates 2-3 [[blocks of ice]]. There is a <code>power/200</code> chance to create 3 blocks, otherwise it creates 2.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|spl-summoning.cc|2910}}</ref> These blocks of ice will turn into a [[simulacrum]] of the monster after a short delay. The first block of ice takes 3-5 turns to become a simulacrum.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|spl-summoning.cc|2914}}</ref> Each block of ice thereafter takes 1-3 turns longer than the previous. If destroyed by an attack, no simulacra is created.\n\nSimulacra are [[derived undead]]; their stats depend on which monster you cast Sculpt Simulacrum on. Generally, they are frail, but with strong [[cold]] attacks.\n\nSimulacrum last for about 27 turns; spell power does not increase duration.\n\nThere is a cap of 5 simulacra. If this cap is reached, the oldest simulacra will be destroyed whenever a new one is formed.\n\nThis is not a [[Necromancy]] spell, so [[Gozag]] and [[Yredelemnul]] worshippers can use it without issue. However, the [[good god]]s still forbid its use.\n\n==Strategy==\nSimulacra are glass cannons - strong but frail. The following are especially good/bad targets for Sculpt Simulacrum:\n*Monsters with multiple attacks. Since each attack gets its own - very large - cold damage boost, having multiple attacks is obviously powerful. [[Hydra]]s, [[entropy weaver]]s, and [[ettin]]s are all fair game, assuming you can survive melee combat against them. [[The Lernaean hydra]] as a simulacrum can deal over 1000 damage per turn, but standing next to Lerny is too dangerous for most characters.\n*Monsters with [[constriction]] ([[list of reptiles and amphibians|snakes]], [[tentacled monstrosities]]). Their simulacra can also constrict foes, making them good allies.\n*Conversely, avoid targeting physically deficient mages (such as [[occultist]]s and magical [[list of deep elves|deep elves]]), as you'll spend 6 MP to create pathetic simulacra.\n\nAlso, since simulacra deal cold damage, avoid using Sculpt Simulacrum if most/all monsters in a group are heavily resistant to cold.\n\n==History==\n*Sculpt Simulacrum was added in [[0.31]], replacing the [[Simulacrum (spell)|Simulacrum]] spell.\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

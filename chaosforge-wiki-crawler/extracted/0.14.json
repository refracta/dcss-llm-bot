Stat regeneration and the third level of the mutation are unchanged.\n\n- Fast/slow movement mutations no longer occur randomly.\n\n- Recommended backgrounds and species have been adjusted; in particular, backgrounds can recommend species that don't necessarily recommend that background and vice versa (e.g. CK -> Tr may be recommended whereas Tr -> CK is not).\n\n- [Poison](/Poison \"Poison\") damage is now deterministic.\n\n- The antennae mutation gives invisible monster indicators for every invisible enemy in LOS.\n\n- [Merfolk](/Merfolk \"Merfolk\") can now be mesmerised by mermaids and sirens.\n\n- [Artificers](/Artificer \"Artificer\"), [Wanderers](/Wanderer \"Wanderer\"), [Assassins](/Assassin \"Assassin\"), and [Venom Mages](/Venom_Mage \"Venom Mage\") no longer start with knowledge of [potions](/Potion \"Potion\") and [scrolls](/Scroll \"Scroll\") they don't possess.\n\n- [Fighters](/Fighter \"Fighter\") and [Gladiators](/Gladiator \"Gladiator\") start with higher-tier weapons.\n\n- Fighers start with a [potion of might](/Potion_of_might \"Potion of might\").\n\n- Demonspawn icemail now restores all at once, instead of gradually, and is not disrupted by casting fire spells.\n\n## Monsters\n\n- [Guardian serpents](/Guardian_serpent \"Guardian serpent\") no longer have [Teleport Other](/Teleport_Other \"Teleport Other\");

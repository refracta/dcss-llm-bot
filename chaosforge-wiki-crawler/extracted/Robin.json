{"title":"Robin","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Robin","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Robin''' is a [[unique]] [[hobgoblin]] who wanders the early floors of the dungeon, accompanied by a massive band of [[goblin]] and [[hobgoblin]] followers. Although none of them are particularly powerful individually, Robin will hurl their goblins at you, swarming you with opponents who can then be inspired, allowing them to deal significant amounts of damage. Robin always spawns with a [[helmet]] and an [[animal skin]].\n\n==Location==\n*[[Dungeon]]:2-4\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Robin alone isn't a big threat - it's being surrounded by [[might]]ed goblins that's lethal. If you can lure Robin around a corner or use a dead end to restrict the number of enemies that can reach you at once, you can avoid an embarrassing gobliny death. [[Stair dancing]] can be used to split the pack.\n*Robin's band does not have [[:Category:Herd_flag|herd]] behavior, so they'll separate over time. If the goblins are awake, you can [[wait]] a couple hundred turns, preferably on top of a [[stair]]case). This causes most of the pack to wander off. From there, you can lure one or two monsters at a time, slowly pruning them out.\n*If you see a mass of goblins and hobgoblins, this unique is most likely around.\n\n==Trivia==\nRobin is able to throw [[Ijyb]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Robin's base damage was 5.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], Robin was considered female.\n*Robin was added in [[0.16]].\n\n[[Category:Goblin]]"}

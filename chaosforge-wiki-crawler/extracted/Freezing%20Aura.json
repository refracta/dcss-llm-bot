It will not affect weapons which are otherwise subject to special enchantments.}}\n'''Freezing Aura''' is a level 2 [[Charms]]/[[Ice Magic]] spell which temporarily adds the [[freezing]] [[brand]] to any unbranded, non-[[artefact]] weapon you currently wield. When cast on a melee weapon, this increases your damage output significantly, especially against targets vulnerable to [[ice]] such as [[crimson imp]]s. It also occasionally causes [[cold-blooded]] foes you strike to be [[slow]]ed. When cast on a ranged weapon, it will deal no additional damage, but will deal 100% cold damage, making the weapon significantly better against vulnerable foes but much worse against cold resistant ones. Unwielding the weapon will end the spell early.\n\n==History==\nFreezing Aura was removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

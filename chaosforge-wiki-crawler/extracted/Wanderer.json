They start the game with a random assortment of skills, items, and maybe spells.}}\nThe '''Wanderer''' is an adventurer who has tried multiple professions without devoting to any particular discipline. The items in a wanderer's starting inventory heavily correlate with their starting skills.  \n\n==Preferred Species==\nIf you feel you must play a Wanderer, the game recommends you play as a [[Human]], [[Mountain Dwarf]], [[Gnoll]], [[Barachi]], [[Merfolk]], [[Draconian]] or [[Demonspawn]].\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nWanderers start with 1 \"good\" item set, 2 \"decent\" item sets, and 1 consumable (50% for a \"good consumable\"; 50% for a \"decent consumable\").<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|ng-wanderer.cc|854}}</ref>\n\nEach item set is named after, and represents, a given skill. They are chosen randomly, based off your [[species]]' aptitudes. The higher the skill aptitude, the more likely you are to get a set of that skill. You will always receive 1 decent offensive set and 1 decent defensive set. The good set has a 1/3 chance to be a defensive set; otherwise it will be an offensive set. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Possible equipment types\n|-\n! Offensive item sets !! Decent !! Good\n|-\n|Weapon skills except Staves || [[Short sword]], [[falchion]], [[mace]], [[hand axe]], [[spear]], [[sling]] || +2 'decent' weapon (2/3 chance)<br>[[Rapier]], [[long sword]], [[flail]], [[war axe]], [[trident]], [[shortbow]] (1/3 chance)\n|-\n|Staves || ''not possible'' || [[Quarterstaff]]\n|-\n|Unarmed Combat || 1 decent consumable || 2 good consumables\n|-\n|Spellcasting || 2 spells of a random school, totalling 4 levels || 4 random spells (max. level 3) including a level 1 spell\n|-\n|Spell schools || 2 spells of that school, totalling 4 levels || 3 spells of that school (max. level 4) including a level 1 spell\n|-\n!

You also cannot be given items for more than one of armour, dodging and stealth; instead, an extra decent consumable will be given.\n\nThen, the following adjustments are made:\n*If no weapon is given, start with a [[club]] or [[dagger]].\n*If no body armour is given, start with a [[leather armour]] (if starting strength > intelligence) or a robe (otherwise).\n*Bucklers are replaced with [[kite shield]]s for large species.\n*Javelins are replaced with [[large rock]]s for large species and twice the number of [[boomerang]]s for small species.\n\nGetting an item set of a skill does not guarantee you have any training in said skill, although it does make it significantly more likely.\n\n===Consumables===\nAs mentioned above, Wanderers start with at least 1 consumable (and possibly more, depending on your item sets).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Type !! Possible consumables\n|-\n|Decent|| [[Scroll of teleportation]], [[scroll of fog]], [[scroll of vulnerability]], [[scroll of silence]], [[potion of curing]], [[potion of lignification]], [[potion of attraction]], [[potion of mutation]]\n|-\n|Good|| [[Scroll of fear]], [[scroll of butterflies]] or [[scroll of summoning]], [[scroll of blinking]], [[potion of heal wounds]], [[potion of haste]], [[potion of berserk rage]], [[potion of might]], [[potion of brilliance]], [[potion of invisibility]]\n|}\n\nConsumables are guaranteed to be usable, e.g. [[Mummies]] won't get potions. However, these are not guaranteed to be useful, so a character with no spells can get a potion of brilliance.\n\n==Starting Stats==\nWanderers receive 12 stat points distributed at random when they start the game. These stats tend to correlate with your skills and gear. But it is possible for a Wanderer to start with little more than a robe and a few spells in their spell library, yet still have an [[Intelligence]] of 10. This does not affect racial modifiers, of course; a DEWn still has a higher intelligence than a TrWn on average.\n\n==Starting Skills==\nA total of 10 skill levels (subsequently adjusted by aptitudes) are given out as follows:\n* If you were given any spells at all, you will always be given at least 1 [[Spellcasting]] skill to ensure you have at least 1 spell level at the start of the game.\n* Then, you get 2 levels of your good skill, and 1 level each of your decent skills.\n* All other skill levels are chosen randomly, up to a maximum of 5 skill levels in a given skill, but weighted heavily towards the skill for your good item set, and moderately towards the skills for your decent item sets. [[Fighting]], [[Armour]], [[Dodging]], [[Stealth]], [[Throwing]], [[Spellcasting]], [[Evocations]], [[Invocations]], and [[Shapeshifting]] can all also receive skill levels, each with relatively low weights.\n\n==Strategy==\nWanderer is a random start, but some general tips apply to almost anyone. You should focus on finding one thing - whether from your start or from the floor - that can reliably kill monsters. Try to figure out how useful an item is for the short- and medium- term. A +2 [[dagger]] may be pretty decent for D:1, but probably isn't worth training. \n\nThere is the possibility for some awful Wn starts, such as: a +0 club, +2 leather armour, the spells [[Apportation]] + [[Gell's Gravitas]], and 2 [[potions of attraction]]. Thus, this is not the best background for winstreaks. However, this kind of start is unlikely.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.32]], Wanderers gained the ability to start with talismans, and several other skills' starting equipment was rebalanced. \n*In [[0.29]], Wanderers gained an extra consumable (potion or scroll); most other backgrounds were buffed.\n*In [[0.28]], Wanderer's gear pool was updated. Skill, gear, and attributes were made generally smarter and closer towards a character's aptitude.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], Wanderers could start with a [[wand of confusion]] instead of a [[wand of paralysis]].\n*In [[0.16]], Wanderers start with a randart spellbook instead of starting with a level one spell memorized. They also have a chance to spawn with a [[box of beasts]] or an elemental evoker instead of a wand. The starting equipment your character receives is also recorded in the game log.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Wanderers began with [[scrolls of teleportation]] recognised.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\nAlso see: {{source ref|0.30.1|ng-wanderer.cc|1}}\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

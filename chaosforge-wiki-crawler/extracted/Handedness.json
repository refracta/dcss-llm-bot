{"title":"Handedness","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Handedness","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\nEach weapon has a particular '''handedness''', which determines how well you can wield it based on your [[size]], and whether or not you can use a [[shield]].\n\n==Weapon Handedness==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Shields provide [[SH]], in exchange for a penalty to EV, attack speed, and spellcasting. They also disable the offhand punch [[auxiliary attack]]. [[Octopode]]s have an offhand slap that can be done even if holding a shield.\n\nWith the exception of [[Felid]], anyone can wear a shield, though with varying extents. [[Formicid]]s have four strong arms, so (except for both [[giant club]]s) can wield a two-handed weapon and a shield. Everyone else, including the 8-tentacled [[Octopode]], are limited to one-handers.\n*[[Spriggan]]s and [[Kobold]]s are more encumbered by a shield, and can not wear [[tower shield]]s. Spriggans can't use [[kite shield]]s, either.\n*[[Ogre]]s and [[Troll]]s find bucklers too small for them, though have reduced shield penalties.\n*[[Naga]]s, [[Palentonga]]s, and [[Formicid]]s have no shield restrictions, but also find shields easier to wield.\n\n==Rings==\n[[Ru]]'s Sacrifice Hand disables a [[ring]] slot, in addition to the loss of two-handed weapons, shields, and the offhand punch.\n\nWhile [[Formicid]]s have 4 arms, two of them are oddly shaped; they have two \"hand-pairs\", so have two ring slots. Under Sacrifice Hand, they lose the shield slot and offhand punch but can stil wield two-handed weapons.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.18]] throwing delays followed the throwing skill dependency improvements like other weapons. Before this thrown missiles used the unarmed combat skill and were not impacted by wearing a shield.\n*In the [[0.14|0.14.2]] bug fix release transformations no longer allow the character to wield too-large weapons.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], there were two additional types of handedness: 1.5-handed (which could be used with a shield but suffered larger-than-normal penalties) and double-handed (which had even worse penalties, plus cut the weapon's base damage in half).\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]\n[[Category:Weapons]]"}

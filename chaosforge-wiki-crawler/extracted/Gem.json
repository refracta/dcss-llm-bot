Within its confines, it is utterly useless.\n\nZot hoards these gems jealously, and will spitefully smash them soon after an adventurer enters the branch of the Dungeon in which they rest. Still, a very quick-moving adventurer might seize one first and keep its precious shards. Zot cannot track gems outside their home branches, so with truly astonishing speed, it might be possible to abscond with one still intact... but such a feat is difficult to credit, and likely pointless besides.\n\nOnce the Orb of Zot is taken, Zot will be unable to smash any gems.}}\n\n'''Gems''' are treasure items found at the end of most [[branch]]es, which do nothing but add to your [[score]]. They expire after a certain amount of [[turn|time]] spent in the branch. You can see collected and available gems by typing '''}!''' keys.\n\n==Useful Info==\nEach found gem adds 100,000 points to your [[score]] (10,000 points for [[YASD|non-winning games]]). They have no other purpose. They do not take up inventory space.\n\nEach gem has its own timer. Like the [[Zot clock]], the timer ticks down as you spend time in the gem's corresponding dungeon branch. The timer continues to run whether you have the gem or not. After it runs out, [[Zot]] destroys the gem. If the gem hasn't been found yet, it is permanently lost. If the gem has been found, it is still \"destroyed\", but you get to keep the score bonus.\n\nThe length of the gem timer depends on the branch where it originates from:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable sortable\"\n! Branch !! Gem Time ([[decaAut]])\n|-\n|[[Dungeon]] || 9000\n|-\n|[[Lair]] || 3750\n|-\n|[[Snake Pit]] /<br>[[Spider's Nest]] || 2400\n|-\n|[[Shoals]] /<br>[[Swamp]] || 1800\n|-\n|[[Slime Pits]] || 600\n|-\n|[[Elven Halls]] || 1800\n|-\n|[[Vaults]] || 3750\n|-\n|[[Crypt]] || 1800\n|-\n|[[Tomb]] || 1800\n|-\n|[[Depths]] || 3000\n|-\n|[[Realm of Zot]] || 1000\n|}\n\nObtaining the [[Orb of Zot]] disables the gem timer permanently.\n\n===Location===\nGems are found in, or near, the \"end vault\" of a branch:\n*In rune branches, gems can be found in the rune vault. \n*In Elven Halls and Crypt, gems appear in loot piles of the end vault. \n*The Dungeon's and Depths' gems are located on the final floor, near entrances to the Depths and Realm of Zot, respectively.\n*The Realm of Zot's gem can be easy to miss: it's not near the Orb, but in the small room ''before'' the lungs.\n\n==Strategy==\n''Main article: [[Speedrun]]''\n\nGems are purely for bragging rights; if you only care about winning, don't bother.\n\nThat being said, if your goal is to collect all the gems, you basically need to [[Speed_running#Low_Turn_Count|turn count speedrun]]. See that page for more tips.\n\n==List of Gems==\n\n*[[File:Dungeon_found_whole.png]] '''Smoky''' gem ([[The Dungeon]]): 9,000 decaAut\n:{{flavour|Swirls of dark smoke seem to lurk in the depths of this gem. Countless dark deeds were done in the Dungeon even before Zot seized and remade it, and their dreadful residue now taints every hint of beauty trapped within its confines.}}\n*[[File:Elf_found_whole.png]] '''Shimmering''' gem ([[Elven Halls]]): 1,800 decaAut\n:{{flavour|Unearthly energies gently flow along the surface of this gem, guided by the archmage who first built the Elven Halls. Countless generations of elves flocked to learn from her, but her foremost pursuit was always the perfection of this piece of art.}}\n*[[File:Lair_found_whole.png]] '''Earthy''' gem ([[The Lair]]): 3,750 decaAut\n:{{flavour|Deep within this gem, flowing leaves and swaying branches seem to lurk. And here, a bone picked clean - there, a predator's eyes, staring hungrily out..?}}\n\n*[[File:Swamp_found_whole.png]] '''Mossy''' gem ([[The Swamp]]): 1,800 decaAut\n:{{flavour|Though it drips with mud and muck, still a peculiar dignity attaches itself to this gem. The people of the Swamp, who first carried this stone, struggled against insurmountable odds. They failed, but there is much to admire even in the ruin of their efforts.}}\n*[[File:Shoals_found_whole.png]] '''Azure''' gem ([[The Shoals]]): 1,800 decaAut\n:{{flavour|As clear and blue as a cloudless sky or a depthless sea, this gem holds its secrets locked within impenetrable depths.}}\n*[[File:Snake_found_whole.png]] '''Jade''' gem ([[Snake Pit]]): 2,400 decaAut\n:{{flavour|Sigils of fire burn deep within this gem, symbol of the eternal compact between naga and salamander. Their bond is that of the poison which scourges the impure and the flame which burns away impurity.}}\n*[[File:Spider_found_whole.png]] '''Milky-white''' gem ([[Spider's Nest]]): 2,400 decaAut\n:{{flavour|Smooth as a spider's silk, white as the eyes of some crawling thing which has lived too long in the dark, this gem buzzes with a fearful potential. Still, to a certain eye, it possesses a strange allure...}}\n\n*[[File:Slime_found_whole.png]] '''Starry''' gem ([[The Slime Pits]]): 600 decaAut\n:{{flavour|Odd lights twinkle within the depths of this gem. From what strange stuff is it made, and from what distant land did it travel?}}\n*[[File:Vaults_found_whole.png]] '''Shining''' gem ([[The Vaults]]): 3,750 decaAut\n:{{flavour|Many are the treasures of the Ironbound Order, but none older nor more precious than this steel-shining gem. The Vaults were first forged to hold it, and none who gazed within its depths could fault the choice.}}\n*[[File:Crypt_found_whole.png]] '''Ivory''' gem ([[The Crypt]]): 1,800 decaAut\n:{{flavour|Countless spirits swirl around this gem, shrouding it in a bone-deep chill. Unwelcome in the Good gods' afterlife, they find here a heaven of their own.}}\n*[[File:Tomb_found_whole.png]] '''Sanguine''' gem ([[The Tomb]]): 1,800 decaAut\n:{{flavour|They who smote down Death herself and buried themselves in a Tomb of their own making were not shy of their ambitions. Fain to seize upon baubles and overweening proud, their Lord journeyed into their eternal unrest with this gem upon their breast.}}\n*[[File:Depths_found_whole.png]] '''Midnight''' gem ([[The Depths]]): 3,750 decaAut\n:{{flavour|The stoneborn brought forth this gem from the uttermost depths of the earth as a gift and a warning: beware Zot! That it lies now within Zot's power is a sure proof of the perversity of mortals and fate alike.}}\n*[[File:Zot_found_whole.png]] '''Prismatic''' gem ([[The Realm of Zot]]): 1,000 decaAut\n:{{flavour|Shining with every colour of the rainbow and a few others besides, some consider this gem 'a bit tacky'. Preposterous!}}\n\n==Settings==\nIf you want to have the remaining time for gems on the status line, add this to your [[rcfile]]:\n\n always_show_gems = true\n\nThe following option enables the display of remaining time even for collected gems:\n\n more_gem_info = true\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], gems were added.  Initially, [[the Orcish Mines]] branch was supposed to have the glittering gem, but it was cut before the release.\n\n<!-- the duration of gems is defined in item-prop.cc; todo: add the link somewhere on this page\n==References==\n<references />\n-->\n\n[[Category:Items]]\n[[Category:Strategy]]"}

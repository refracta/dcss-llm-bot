{"title":"Terence","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Terence","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Terence the Incautious''' is a fairly weak [[unique]] [[human (monster)|human]] fighter, likely one of the first uniques you will encounter and much less deadly than [[Sigmund]]. He occasionally generates with a [[wand]], and has a 1% chance of spawning with [[Throatcutter]].\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:2-3\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Like most things in ''Crawl'', try not to be overconfident. For a character arriving on D:2, a few bad damage rolls can spell death. If you decide to fight, make sure to have full HP first. \n*Thankfully, [[Throatcutter]]'s instant kill effect does not affect the player.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], Terence became a much greater threat to new characters, as [[pillar dancing]] no longer works.\n*In [[0.28]], Terence gained a small chance to spawn with Throatcutter.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

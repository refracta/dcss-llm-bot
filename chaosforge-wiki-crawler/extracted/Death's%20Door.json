{"title":"Death's Door","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Death%27s_Door","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Death's Door''' is a level 9 [[Necromancy]] spell which protects the caster from almost all harm for a while, at the cost of being left with very little [[HP]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen cast, Death's Door gives you the '''DDoor''' status. Your health is immediately reduced to <code>power/10</code> HP (max. 20), but you are rendered immune to all damage. It also prevents all forms of healing, except for [[Borgnjor's Revivification]]. Casting that will heal you, immediately end DDoor, then [[paralyse]] you for 2-5 turns. ([[Formicid]]s are still immune to this paralysis.)\n\nDeath's Door lasts for 16-[[27]] turns; duration depends on spell power and is randomized. After it runs out, it gives you the -DDoor status for 1-3 turns, preventing you from recasting the spell as it wears off. You can't recast the spell as it's active.\n\n[[Undead]] characters, including Alive [[Vampire]]s and those in [[Death Form]], are unable to use Death's Door. Conversely, you are unable to use Necromutation, [[Sublimation of Blood]], go [[berserk]], or spend HP (such as for [[Djinni]] spellcasting) as long as the invulnerability lasts.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe best escape spell in the game. Casting Death's Door, then using your [[scrolls of blinking]], [[scroll of teleportation|teleportation]], [[potion of haste|haste]], [[god]] abilities, spells etc., will bail you out of almost every situation you can cast spells in. You might not even need to use consumables. The biggest threat is [[silence]], which prevents casting any spell. Things that prevent you from escaping in 16 turns - such as [[No Unsafe Scrolls|-Scroll]] and being in crowded areas (like [[the Tomb]]) - can also doom you. Also, since it's a level 9 spell, it'll likely have a 1% failure rate.\n\nThis spell has a cooldown of 1d3 turns, which is short, all things considered. While you should never rely on being able to recast this spell, remember that it ''is'' an option. Also remember that you can use [[Borgnjor's Revivification]], which is usually a better option.\n\nAs a level 9 support spell, Death's Door is usually too expensive for a 3 rune game. Otherwise, it's a great spell in [[extended]]. While it may put you under penance from the [[good god]]s, their penance is easy to work off.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Remember that Death's Door costs 9 MP to cast. If you need to use other spells to live, make sure you don't run out of MP in the process. Otherwise, you could be delaying your fate.\n*You get one warning before the DDoor status runs out, when ~5 turns are left:\n{{crawlquote|Your time is quickly running out!}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Death's Door was a level 8 [[Charms]]/[[Necromancy]] spell.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], [[Kikubaaqudgha]] worshippers were left with piety/15 extra HP and some monsters were able to cast it.\n*Prior to [[0.7]], being healed in any way while using Death's Door caused [[confusion]]."}

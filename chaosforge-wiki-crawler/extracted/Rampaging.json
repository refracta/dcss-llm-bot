When the wearer moves directly towards an enemy (i.e. the enemy is positioned in one of the 8 directions from the wearer), they move one additional space without taking any additional time. If the wearer is only one space away from their target, they move next to the target and immediately make a melee attack.\n\n[[Cheibriados]] disapproves of the Rampaging ego; attempting to use this ego anyway as a Cheibriadite will quickly sap your piety. (Cheibriados doesn't mind Armataur rampaging.)\n\nArmataurs regenerate MP (and HP, starting from XL7) faster after making a rampage move. See the [[Armataur#Heal on Rampage|Armataur]] article for more information.\n\n==Strategy==\nRampaging will reduce the number of attacks you take while moving towards ranged enemies, which can make it useful for melee characters. In the event you find yourself with a horde in front of you and a weak enemy in another direction, these boots can aid you in your escape if you move towards them.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Stabbers can get guaranteed stabs against foes 1 empty square away.\n*Be cautious if you move towards an enemy in fog of war; you will uncover twice as many squares with each step, and may find yourself in a much more dangerous situation than you anticipated.\n*Be mindful if you're trying to approach a [[staircase]]. If you want to move at normal speed, try zig-zagging, or moving in alternating diagonal directions.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Seven-league boots]] - Features a more extreme version of rampaging\n\n==History==\nRampaging was added in [[0.26]], replacing the [[running]] ego on boots.\n\n[[Category:Movement]]\n[[Category:Egos]]"}

For the force that pursues you throughout your adventure, see [[Zot clock]]. For the mythical wizard said to have created the [[Orb of Zot]], see [[Zot (mythical wizard)]].''\n{{flavour|The Realm of Zot is a region of the dungeon that is so terrifying, so full of madness, frenzy and lunacy, that it has been locked securely against random trespassers. Only the most demented adventurers would dare gather the required keys, break the seal and penetrate deeper â€” all in the vain hope for a fabled artefact no one has ever laid eyes on before.\n\nThe entrance to this branch can be found on level 4 of the Depths.\n\nThis branch can only be entered while carrying at least 3 runes of Zot.\n\nThis branch is 5 levels deep.}}\n\n[[File:Zot entry.png]] '''The Realm of Zot''' is the final [[branch]] in the game. It houses the goal of your quest, the legendary [[Orb of Zot]], but its ferocious guardians won't let you just walk in and take it without a fight...\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe Realm of Zot is 5 floors deep. A single [[rune lock|locked]] gateway to Zot be found on the 4th floor of [[the Depths]]. To enter, you will need at least three [[runes of Zot]], acquired by clearing other branches.\n\nThe mere proximity of the Orb warps space throughout the Realm, interfering with teleportation: [[scrolls of teleportation]] are delayed to 8-14 turns (5-9 turns longer than normal).\n\nVisiting and clearing the Realm of Zot can be done long before you decide you've collected enough runes and are ready to win the game, and doing so will likely provide you with useful items and a significant amount of [[experience]]. It isn't until you actually pick up the Orb itself that the game enters its final stage. Read the [[Orb of Zot]] article for details on the Orb, the ascension run, and winning the game.\n\n==Layout==\nThe layout of the Realm of Zot is occasionally similar to the [[Elven Halls]] (a series of small and large rooms interconnected by narrow corridors), though each floor has a high chance of being a massive, floor-wide [[vault]] with wide hallways and a generally symmetrical layout.\n\n===Zot:5===\nThe [[Zot:5|final floor]] houses the [[Orb of Zot]]. The \"[[Zot:5#Map|Hall of Zot]]\" has a similar layout in every game, and is defended by some of the most dangerous monsters in the game. [[Teleport]]ing is a much less reliable panic button here than it is elsewhere.\n\n==Recommendations==\nThe first four floors of the Realm of Zot can be cleared as soon as you've acquired 3 [[runes of Zot]] and reached the entrance on Depths:4, but doing so without preparations for its many threats can be extremely costly:\n*The [[list of draconians|bands of draconians]] you encounter have a wide variety of abilities at their disposal; engaging an entire band at once will give them time to [[corrode]] you, blast you with [[damnation]] or powerful [[Conjurations]], lock down your ability to teleport away, or simply beat you to death. Whenever possible, try to break up the band and take them out one or two at a time, and if possible change your resistances to match the threats you face at the moment. Also, be aware that draconians lack [[see invisible]]; an invisible player has a significant advantage when facing them.\n*Due to the rock and stone [[wall]]s of Zot and their ability to [[multizap]], electric golems can inflict staggering amounts of [[electricity]] damage very quickly. While it isn't necessary to keep up electricity resistance at all times, be ready to have it as soon as an electric golem appears. As they are fairly rare, a few [[potions of resistance]] should be sufficient. This also applies to storm dragons, but they're significantly more survivable without it.\n*Most of the time, [[Killer Klown]]s aren't too dangerous. However, their pies can inflict extremely dangerous random effects. In particular, silence and -Potion will greatly limit your escape options.\n*[[Curse toe]]s are one of the only sources of [[torment]] in Zot, and charging in to face one will rapidly deplete your [[HP]] and force you to fight your way through a horde of nasty fungal foes. Lure them into range around a corner to take away their biggest advantage, and don't waste time on their summons if you have the chance to attack the toe.\n*By far the most dangerous opponents in Zot are the [[orbs of fire]]. These opponents can do tremendous amounts of [[fire]] damage very rapidly, and will pile [[bad mutations]] on you if you don't have [[mutation resistance]]. On top of that, they are extremely durable. Unless you are extremely confident in your skills, don't explore Zot without a bare minimum of rF+, and avoid actually fighting orbs of fire without rF++ or better.\n\nThe fifth and final floor of the Realm of Zot is taken up almost entirely by the sprawling Orb chamber. See the [[Zot:5]] article for details on how to handle the Orb chamber and its guardians.\n\n==Monsters==\n===Common monsters===\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{Brown|d}} [[File:Draconian (monster).png]] '''[[List of draconians|Draconians]] || {{monsterlink|Moth of wrath}} || {{monsterlink|Ghost moth}} || {{monsterlink|Death cob}} \n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Shadow dragon}} || {{monsterlink|Golden dragon}} || {{monsterlink|Quicksilver dragon}} ||  {{monsterlink|Storm dragon}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Tentacled monstrosity}} ||  {{monsterlink|Curse toe}} ||  {{monsterlink|Orb guardian}} || {{monsterlink|Electric golem}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Protean progenitor}}\n|}\n\n===Dangerous monsters===\n{{monsterlink|Killer Klown}}\n\n{{monsterlink|Ancient lich}}\n\n{{monsterlink|Dread lich}}\n\n{{monsterlink|Orb of fire}}\n\n===Uniques===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Grunn}}\n| {{monsterlink|Josephina}}\n| {{monsterlink|Parghit}}\n| {{monsterlink|Tiamat}}\n| {{monsterlink|Vv}}\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], the Realm of Zot hindered the spell [[Passage of Golubria]].\n*Prior to [[0.28]], classed draconians could have varying colours, and Zot's entrance was on [[Depths]]:5.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], [[ancient lich]]es had 5 spell sets, making covering all resistances somewhat more necessary. [[Dread lich]]es were introduced to summon and inflict paralysis in their stead.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], scrolls of blinking and the removed [[Controlled Blink]] spell could not be controlled when in Zot or holding the [[Orb of Zot]]. Also, Passage of Golubria was uncastable, instead of behaving less predictably.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], scrolls of blinking behaved normally on a Zot level.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the translocations restrictions of the [[Orb of Zot]] did not apply to the entire Realm of Zot.\n*Before the removal of [[teleport control]] in [[0.17]], [[teleport control]] was disabled on Zot:5\n*Prior to [[0.14]] (and the introduction of [[the Depths]]), the entrance to the Realm of Zot was found on Dungeon:27.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], floor layouts in Zot were never full-floor [[vault]]s, and narrow corridors were much more common.\n\n{{branches}}"}

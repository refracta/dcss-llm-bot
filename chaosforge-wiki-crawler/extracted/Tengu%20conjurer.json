{"title":"Tengu conjurer","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tengu_conjurer","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | tengu}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Tengu conjurers''' are hostile [[list of tengu|birdmen]] that know attack spells. They spawn in the late [[Dungeon]] and early [[Depths]], often with [[tengu warrior]]s.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Tengu conjurers are swift-moving, fairly strong monsters. A big threat if spawned [[out-of-depth]] (before D:13 or so).\n*Lightning Bolt can [[doublezap]], so try not to stand in front of walls.\n*They have low [[will]] and [[HD]], so [[Mephitic Cloud]], [[Hexes]], hex [[wand]]s, etc. are good at disabling them.\n*The battlespheres can be destroyed very easily, if it happens to be next to you.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], tengu conjurers had fast movement speed but were less likely to cast Battlesphere.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], tengu conjurers could have one of four possible spell sets:\n**[[Force Lance]] (3d11), [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere]], and [[Blink]]\n**[[Mephitic Cloud]], [[Venom Bolt]] (3d12), [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere]], and [[Blink]]\n**[[Shock]] (d12), [[Lightning Bolt]] (3d14), [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere]], and [[Blink]]\n**[[Throw Flame]] (3d7), [[Bolt of Magma]] (3d15), [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere]], and [[Blink]]\n*Prior to [[0.25]], their pure Conjurations spell set had [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]].\n*Tengu conjurers were added in [[0.12]]."}

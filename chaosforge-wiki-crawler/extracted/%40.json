{"title":"@","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/@","type":"raw","data":"==Command==\n*Pressing '''@''' will display character status, displaying short statements of the following:\n**A description of [[transformation]]s and/or [[transmutations]], if any (e.g. \"You are a tree.\", \"You have grown temporary horns.\", etc.)\n**Your [[attack speed]], in deca[[Aut]]s, rounded to the nearest aut.\n**A general assessment of [[movement speed]].\n**Your base [[Strength]], [[Intelligence]], and [[Dexterity]], if your stats are being increased or reduced by your equipment or mutations\n\nThe character status command pairs well with the '''[[%]]''' command. Although it provides a less quantified summary of information, it may be more intelligible to newer players and those generally less versed in Dungeon Crawl-specific jargon.\n\nIf you want to view the specific numbers which give rise the descriptions, you'll have to enter [[wizard mode]].\n\n==Symbol==\nThe '''@''' symbol in console mode represents the player character. It also represents human [[unique]]s, such as [[Sigmund]], [[Erica]], or [[Donald]].\n\nOutside the game, the '''@''' symbol is sometimes associated with roguelikes, including ''Dungeon Crawl''.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.27]], the '''@''' command only gave rough estimates of your attack speed.\n\n{{alphabet}}\n\n\n[[Category:Commands]]\n[[Category:Symbols]]"}

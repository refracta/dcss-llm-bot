{"title":"Chuck Norris","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Chuck_Norris","type":"raw","data":"{{diary}}\n\nI am playing as a Demonspawn Chaos Knight on Stone Soup version 5.0.  I choose this combination because it best describes Chuck Norris (except maybe a Troll Monk).\n\nI will start by saying that I am not a very good Crawler.  The farthest I ever got was level 5 of the Snake Pits (where I was killed by some Orc Saint person).\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n== Dungeon Level 1 ==\n\n\"Blood and Souls for Makhleb\", Chuck said.  He wondered, \"Can I roundhouse kick people in this game?\"  Chuck ran around axing everything that moved to death.  \"This is just like real life\", he thought, \"except I can't roundhouse kick people (sob).\"  He managed to level up!  He also gained the ability to gain power from killing.\n\n\n== Dungeon Level 2 ==\n\nChuck got some +2 boots and a +2,+4 axe.  \"Wow\", he thought.  As he ran around he found Sigmund.  He managed to lose Sigmund after running in circles.  When Chuck leveled up to 3 Blue Scales grew up and covered his entire body.  Now Chuck has AC +9 and EV +9. Chuck turned a corner, ran into, and killed Sigmund.  \"HA HA HA.\", Chuck laughed, \"I can defeat anything.\"\n\n\n== Dungeon Level 3 ==\n\nChuck immediately ran into a centaur.  DOWN THE STAIRS!!!\n\n== Dungeon Level 4 ==\n\nChuck quaffed all the potions in his inventory.  First he was slowed, the poisoned, healed, and then he gain strength.  After leveling up to 6, Chuck returned to level 3 and killed the centaur.\n\n== Dungeon Level 3 ==\n\nA cursed ring of magical power and a cursed ring of tellaportation.  Oh well, Chuck will just have to wait for a scroll to uncurse it.  Chuck can now harness Maklheb's minor destruction.\n\n== Dungeon Level 5 ==\n\n\"Gah!!!,\" Chuck exclaimed after exploring half of the level.  His ring teleported him right next to two orc priests, an orc warrior, Edmund, and 3 orcs!!! He quaffed a potion and it was a potion of decay.\n\n\nOh well... This wasn't the best player ever...\nMaybe next time."}

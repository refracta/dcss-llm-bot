They are more difficult to kill than [[frilled lizard]]s, and move faster than most players, making retreat difficult.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*As a fast enemy, leopard geckos are inherently dangerous. If you get bad combat RNG, you are unable to [[pillar dance]] to reset the fight. So if you find a sleeping gecko on D:1, try to avoid waking it up (at least until you've leveled up).\n*Leopard geckos are one of the stronger D:1 enemies, but by the time you reach D:3, they shouldn't be much of a threat.\n\n==History==\n*Leopard geckos were removed in [[0.27]]. They were replaced by [[quokka]]s, which have similar stats.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], leopard geckos could [[cling]] to walls, allowing them to cross obstacles like water so long as there was a wall to travel along.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], they were called giant geckos."}

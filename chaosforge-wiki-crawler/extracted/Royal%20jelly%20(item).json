A lump of the magical substance produced by giant bees to be fed to their queens.}}\n\nA '''royal jelly''' is a universally-appealing [[food]] item which provides 2,000 [[nutrition]] regardless of the consumer's [[Herbivore]] or [[Carnivore]] mutations. Although not quite so potent as a [[bread ration]] or [[meat ration]], they can often be found in bulk when raiding [[killer bee]] [[vault]]s. Royal jelly takes 20 aut to consume, making it faster than eating rations or chunks when in peril.\n\n==History==\n*Royal jellies were removed in [[0.21]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], royal jellies were much more powerful, granting 5,000 nutrition ''and'' functioning as a [[potion of restore abilities]]. It was reduced in power to match that of the now-obsolete [[honeycomb]]."}

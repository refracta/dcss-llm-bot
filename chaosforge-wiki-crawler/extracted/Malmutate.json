It cannot affect artificial beings, and the undead will decompose if affected.}}\n'''Malmutate''' is a monster-only spell which attempts to mutate its target.\n\n==Effect==\n\n===Against players===\nIf Malmutate is used on a player, there is an 80% chance that it will cause a [[bad mutation]], and a 20% chance it will cause a [[random mutation]]. [[Willpower]] is useless against this, but [[mutation resistance]] functions normally. These mutations are permanent until removed.\n\nUndead players cannot mutate, but will decompose and take [[stat drain]], which can be cured by gaining XP.\n\n===Against monsters===\nWhen used on a monster, the victim gets the '''misshapen and mutated''' enchantment, with the following effects:\n* -8 [[AC]]\n* -25% [[HD]] \n\nHD has an effect on monster [[accuracy]], [[willpower]], and spell damage, so the HD reduction also lowers these.\n\n[[Undead]] and [[nonliving]] monsters are immune to this status. [[Abomination]]s change their tile, and ([[very ugly thing|very]]) [[ugly thing]]s will change their colour, but are otherwise unaffected by the status.\n\n==Monster Spell==\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nThe following monster may inflict Malmutate on a melee attack (25% chance):\n*{{monsterlink|Mnoleg}}\n\n==Player Sources==\nPlayers can inflict the misshapen and mutated status on monsters via the following sources:\n\n* [[Irradiate]]\n* [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]]\n* [[Plutonium sword]]'s melee attacks\n* [[Flux talisman|Flux form]]'s third unarmed attack on a monster\n* [[Lugonu]]'s Banishment ability (if the target resists banishment)\n* The [[warlock's mirror]] can reflect Malmutate - you'll avoid malmutation, and the monster is mutated instead.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe best method of dealing with Malmutate is to minimize the turns where you can be hit by it. It requires line of fire to hit you:\n* Any method of restricting [[line of sight]] will prevent line of fire. A [[scroll of fog]] will let melee characters get close to a malmutator. Ducking behind a corner will do the same.\n* [[Lesser Beckoning]] or [[Vhi's Electric Charge]] can be used by melee character to approach the enemy, without spending as many turns in line of fire.\n* You can hide behind other monsters or use [[summon]]s to block enemy fire; even [[Fulminant Prism]] can block LoF. Then, you can use piercing attacks, such as bolt [[wand]]s or [[javelin]]s, or [[smite-targeted]] attacks, like [[Airstrike]], to attack through blocking monsters.\n\nFortunately, neqoxecs and shining eyes are fairly fragile. Cacodemons, while difficult opponents, are manageable enough if you're ready to explore areas where they are common (the deep [[Abyss]], [[Hell]], or [[Pandemonium]]). Orbs of fire are so incredibly dangerous that it's already worth hitting them with everything you have.\n\nIf you ''do'' end up taking some mutations, it's usually not immediately lethal. The ones to watch out for mid-combat are [[Berserk (mutation)|berserkitis]] and [[No Unsafe Scrolls]] / [[No Unsafe Potions]], which can restrict your options for escaping. If you have any [[potions of mutation]] saved up, those have a decent chance of fixing your problems (though they might leave you with a set of new ones).\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*[[Mutation resistance]] protects against mutation, but sources are rare, and complete immunity is even rarer. You can get full immunity via [[Mutation Resistance (mutation)|Mutation Resistance 3]] (as a level 3 mutation, is rare), being [[undead]] (species, or the very high level spell, [[Necromutation]]), or by worshipping Zin at ****** piety.\n*All malmutators are [[chaotic]], and thus vulnerable to [[silver]]. Silver javelins are particularly effective.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Corrupting Pulse]] inflicts temporary but always bad mutations.\n\n==History==\nThis spell was added in [[0.12]], replacing the monster version of [[Polymorph Other]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

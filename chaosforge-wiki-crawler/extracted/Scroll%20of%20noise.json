At 25 intensity, this is more than twice as loud as [[Shout|shouting]] by pressing '''[[t]]'''.\n\n==Strategy==\n*If you haven't identified scrolls of noise yet, be wary of read-identifying scrolls near unexplored areas, especially away from [[stairs]]. If one of your scrolls happens to be a scroll of noise, there's no telling what sort of things you'll wake up.\n*If you utilize shouting in your play style to draw monsters to you (e.g. ambushing, hit & run with stairs, verifying an area is cleared of monsters, etc.), a scroll of noise is not entirely useless to you, as its greater [[noise]] will draw monsters from further away. Keep that in mind as you run across them.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Noise]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.20]], scrolls of noise could be used to snap yourself out of [[mesmerize|mesmerization]] or [[fear]].\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

{"title":"Corrupt Body","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Corrupt_Body","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{Flavour|Instills a corruption within a target, temporarily mutating their body in an adverse fashion. It cannot affect artificial beings, and the undead will decompose if affected.}}\n\n'''Corrupt Body''' is a monster-only spell which temporarily inflicts [[bad mutation]]s on its target, much like those caused by [[wretched star]]s. [[Mutation]] resistance prevents these as normal, and you can recover from them by gaining sufficient [[experience]]. [[Undead]] characters take [[stat]] damage instead of mutating, which can lead to rapid debilitation if you lack mutation resistance and fail to kill the spell's source quickly.\n\nThe following monsters can cast Corrupt Body:\n*{{monsterlink|Corrupter}}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.19]], this spell was removed.\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

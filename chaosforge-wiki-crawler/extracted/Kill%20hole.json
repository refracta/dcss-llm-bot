{"title":"Kill hole","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Kill_hole","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\nA '''kill hole''' ('''murder hole''') is a type of [[wall]] formation that only allows one monster into your [[line of sight]] at a time. Since most monsters can't do anything when outside your sight, killholes are an improvement over a regular corridor. In a hallway, an [[orc priest]] might [[smite]] you from behind other orcs. But in a killhole, it is unable to see you, and thus unable to attack.\n\nKill holes may occasionally form naturally, but most mentions of them refer to the creation of artificial kill holes with a [[formicid]]'s digging ability or a [[wand of digging]].\n\n==Explanation==\nIn short, a killhole is the intersection of 2 diagonal lines ('V', '^', '<', or '>' shaped). Cardinal directions do not work - see below for a demonstration.\n\n<gallery widths=\"400px\" heights=\"400px\" class=\"left\" mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Killhole.png| X's show the current [[line of sight]] radius.<br>Left: Not a killhole; priest can attack from 2 tiles away<br>Right: Killhole, priest forced in melee.\n</gallery>\n\n==Natural Examples==\n #########\n ####.####\n ###.#.###\n ##.###@## <--stand on\n ..#####g#    the @\n ##.###g##\n ###.#g###\n ####g####\n ####.####\nThis is an example of a naturally formed kill hole you might see in the [[Dungeon]] or [[Elven Halls|Elf]]. Do note that it allows monsters to come from behind. While these gnolls are unlikely to find the other entrance, other monsters may hear the [[noise]] and approach from the west.\n\n .######\n ..YY#..\n .YY+@.# <--stand on\n ..#####    the @\n #######\nAnother example, this time of something you might see in a semi-common layout of the Lair. In this example, a [[door]] (the + between yaks and player) is blocking enemies through. If an enemy can open doors, this kill hole won't function correctly. Also, like the previous example, creatures may still show up from the east to attack you from behind.\n\n==Creating a kill hole==\nTo make your own kill hole, you'll need a section of rock wall, and a way to [[dig]] through it ([[wand of digging]], [[Formicid]] ability). Ideally, this wall won't have any empty space behind it - you can open a whole new can of worms. The edges of the floor are usually safe, but if you're too close to the edge of the map, you might run into the indestructible border walls.\n\nWhile [[Shatter]] ''can'' destroy walls - even stone / metal walls - it lacks precision. You might get lucky and make a kill hole, or you might just break the entire wall down, and either way, you'll be making an incredible amount of [[noise]].\n\nA perfect kill hole (one which only ever allows one enemy into your LOS) looks something like this:\n ####\n .#@#\n #.##\n ####\n\nFormicids can dig walls one at a time, so making this configuration would be trivial. In contrast, a [[wand of digging]] will always dig multiple tiles in a direction. It can still make a perfectly functional killhole, though there'll be a space behind you.\n\nTo begin, find a suitable patch of rock wall:\n #############\n .############\n ..###########\n ...##########\n ..@##########\n ...*######### <-- Dig pointing at\n ...##########     the asterisk\n ...##########\n ..###########\n .############\n #############\n\nNow, take a couple steps into your new tunnel, then dig diagonally in the other direction:\n #############\n .############\n ..###########\n ...##########\n ...##########\n ....#*####### <-- Dig pointing at\n ...#@########     the asterisk\n ...##.#######\n ..####.######\n .######.#####\n ########.####\n\nStand just inside the entrance to the second tunnel, and congratulations, you've got a kill hole!\n ##########.##\n .########.###\n ..######.####\n ...####.#####\n ...###.######\n ....#@#######\n ...#.########\n ...##.#######\n ..####.######\n .######.#####\n ########.####\n\nHaving that bit of extra space has a few minor downsides. Enemies with [[blink]] can end up behind you. Hostile summoners can summon monsters in that space, and things like [[trample]] can push you back. Otherwise, it works just like the \"perfect\" killhole as mentioned above.\n\n==Strategy==\nKillholes are best used when you ''know'' there's a crowd of monsters, where at least some have abilities that ignore line of fire. [[Smiting]], [[Damnation]], and [[Torment]] are all good examples. If you alert a number of monsters with these abilities while exploring, you may wish to create a killhole.\n\nIf you know there is a [[vault]] with such monsters, you may want to pre-emptively dig a killhole. Examples of good places include [[Orcish Mines|Orc]]:2, [[Elven Halls|Elf]]:3 (though watch for [[deep elf elementalist]]s), and [[Zot]]:5. Then, you can stay in the hole, and [[shout]] to lure monsters into it.\n\nKillholes are not infallible. The following can make one ineffective:\n\n*You must be able to fight whatever's approaching, or have a way to escape from the killhole (e.g. have a pre-dug path back to nearby stairs).\n*If there is space behind you, a monster can [[Blink]] behind you, push you back with [[trample]] / knockback, or summon things behind you. [[Draconian shifter]]s can also use [[Blink Other]].\n*The [[Dig]] and [[Awaken Earth]] spells are some of the few things that monsters can use outside of your LOS. [[Deep elf elementalist]]s, [[deep troll earth mage]]s, [[cacodemon]]s, or any monster with their own wand of digging can bust through.\n\nIn addition, killholes are unnecessary if enemies don't have ranged attacks. When fighting a pack of melee enemies, you can dig an ordinary hallway, which saves a charge of your wand of digging.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Kill holes prevent monsters from seeing you, but they also prevent you from seeing monsters. Try to pay attention to any messages that mention noises coming from behind whatever you're fighting, as that might announce the presence of a monster you hadn't known about when you retreated. Formicids have yet another advantage, as their [[antennae]] can sense monsters.\n*Always make sure you have an escape plan. Even with the advantage of facing your enemies one at a time, you may get unlucky and end up overwhelmed and backed into a corner. Alternatively, something far more dangerous than the enemies you were fighting might be attracted by the noise and suddenly appear with little to no warning. A [[scroll of teleportation]] is perfect for escaping -- just be sure to leave enough time for it to kick in.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.22]], [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] could destroy walls, possibly enabling the creation of kill holes in stone, crystal, or metal structures. With a bit of luck, it was possible to make a kill hole even in [[Tomb]]:3.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], [[wands of disintegration]] could be used to remove one tile of rock wall at a time, giving all characters access to formicid-level precision in making kill holes.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], players had access to the [[Dig]] spell.\n\n[[Category:Strategy]]"}

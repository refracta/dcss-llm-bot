They can be found almost anywhere, but are extremely common in [[the Lair]], [[the Swamp]], and [[the Shoals]]. Ranged attacks and single-target [[beam]]-type spells cannot pass through them.\n\nIf a plant is damaged, it will begin to wither, dying automatically once 3-5 turns have passed.\n\n[[File:Plant.png]] [[File:Plant 02.png]] [[File:Plant 03.png]] [[File:Plant 04.png]] [[File:Plant 05.png]] [[File:Plant 06.png]] [[File:Plant 07.png]] [[File:Plant 08.png]] [[File:Plant 09.png]] [[File:Plant 10.png]] [[File:Plant 11.png]]\n\n===Variant Plants===\nThere are several alternate versions of plants. Although they have different names and appearances, they have identical stats.\n\n[[File:Plant crypt.png]] '''Withered plants''' are a common sight on [[undead]]-themed floors and near some [[Yredelemnul]] [[altar]]s.\n{{flavour|A plant whose life has been drained away, but with its physical form still intact. It looks like it died many centuries ago.}}\n\n[[File:Demonic plant.png]] '''Demonic plants''' are found in a few demon-themed vaults, most notably the [[Lugonu]]-corrupted [[Ecumenical Temple]].\n{{flavour|A demonic mockery of a plant, covered with mysterious appendages and writhing tentacles. It appears to be harmless.}}\n\n[[File:Petrified plant.png]] '''Petrified plants''' can be found near [[catoblepas]] dens in [[Lair]]:6.\n{{flavour|An ordinary plant that has been turned to stone.}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Worshipers of [[Fedhas Madash]] have a very different relationship with plants than all other characters. They can step and fire through them as though their tiles were empty. With more piety, they can summon plant allies and transform dungeon [[wall]]s into plants.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], all plants lost their [[negative energy resistance|negative energy immunity]] (except for withered plants).\n*Prior to [[0.26]], plants didn't wither when damaged; getting past them required either worshiping Fedhas or destroying them entirely. They were much easier to kill, however.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], followers of Fedhas Madash could grow ordinary plants into [[oklob plant]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], plants were frequently used as targets of unidentified weapons, as one could identify weapon enchantments by repeatedly hitting monsters. In [[0.11]], skill-based enchantment identification was changed to be instantaneous, making them little more than obstacles to non-Fedhas worshipers.\n*Prior to [[0.9]]'s XP system-overhaul, plants made excellent targets for victory dancing.\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:Plant holiness]]"}

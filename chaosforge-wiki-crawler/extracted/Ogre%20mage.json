{"title":"Ogre mage","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ogre_mage","type":"raw","data":"{{version027}}\n''This page is about the monster. For the removed player species, see [[Ogre-Mage]].'' {{list of|ogres}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ogre magi''' are every bit as strong as regular [[ogre (monster)|ogres]], but possess magic on par with much more magically attuned species. They lead packs of ogres and [[two-headed ogre]]s, hasting them or pelting you with powerful [[Conjurations]] from a distance. Depending on which spell set they generate, they may even be able to paralyse players with low [[willpower]]. They can be found in the later portions of [[the Dungeon]] and the [[Orcish Mines]], and all throughout [[the Depths]] and [[the Vaults]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*By the time you encounter ogre magi, their mundane allies shouldn't pose that much threat. While you'll want to avoid letting half a dozen hasted ogres beat on you with giant spiked clubs, you should still focus on taking the mage out as quickly as possible. They don't have too much spell power behind their spells, but paralysis and Bolt of Magma are never laughing matters.\n*If you know [[Mephitic Cloud]], repeated castings will allow you to confuse the ogre band, causing them to kill each other for you. Even so, if you have access to spells that deal heavy damage to multiple enemies, these will get the job done much faster and more reliably.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], ogre magi could have one of three possible spell sets:\n**[[Lightning Bolt]] (3d17), [[Haste Other]], [[Slow]], [[Paralyze]], and [[Haste]]\n**[[Venom Bolt]] (3d15), [[Haste Other]], [[Confuse]], [[Slow]], and [[Invisibility]]\n**[[Bolt of Fire]] (3d18), [[Bolt of Cold]] (3d18), [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] (3d28), [[Haste Other]], and [[Blink]]\n*Prior to [[0.19]], they could cast [[Banishment]], [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]], [[Minor Healing]], [[Sting]], [[Throw Flame]], [[Fireball]], and [[Teleport Other]]. Also, ogre magi had five spell sets instead of three.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], ogre magi could cast [[Teleport Self]]."}

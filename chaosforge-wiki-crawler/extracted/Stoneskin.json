It does not work with most [[form]] spells; only [[Beastly Appendage]], [[Blade Hands]], and Statue Form work with Stoneskin. The [[undead]] ([[Ghoul]]s, [[Mummies]], [[Vampires]] below [[food|Full]]) can't use this spell.\n\n==Strategy==\nA weaker version of [[Ozocubu's Armour]], without encumbrance restrictions, that doesn't melt against [[fire]]. If you can cast Stoneskin (but not Ozocubu's), it's generally worth using - either during exploration or at the start of most fights.\n\nNote that Stoneskin will not notify you when its duration is almost over. Should you be in the middle of a pitched battle, consider casting it again when you have a spare turn to guarantee you maintain your AC bonus until the end of the fight.\n\n==History==\n* Stoneskin was removed in [[0.18]].\n* Prior to [[0.17]], the effects of this spell were boosted while in Statue Form, using the formula 3 + ((11 * spell power)/100) (Max +14).\n* Prior to [[0.15]], this spell's AC bonus was dependent on your Earth Magic skill, not your spell power, using the following formula:\n{{crawlquote|'''AC Bonus:''' 2 + (Earth Magic/5)<br>'''Max:''' +7 at 25 Earth Magic<br>'''w/ Statue Form: '''3 + ((9 * Earth Magic)/20)<br>'''Max:''' +12 at 27 Earth Magic}}"}

{"title":"Grasping Roots","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Grasping_Roots","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Calls giant grasping roots from deep underground that hold and constrict their victim. The roots will retreat if the victim breaks free or if the caller moves out of view.}}\n\n'''Grasping Roots''' is monster-only spell which inflicts [[constriction]] to a [[smite-targeted]] foe. Constriction deals damage every turn, prevents movement or use of stairs, and gives [[blink]]s a chance to fail. You can break out by attempting to move. Targets flying above or swimming in [[deep water]] or [[lava]] are immune.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nPlayers and monsters can get an analogous effect with a [[wand of roots]]. The wand constricts in a 3x3 area, but is not smite-targeted.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to 0.23, this spell prevented [[flight]], reduced [[EV]] (by the same amount as constriction), and increased movement delay by 0.3 [[decaAut]]s.\n*Grasping Roots was added in [[0.14]]."}

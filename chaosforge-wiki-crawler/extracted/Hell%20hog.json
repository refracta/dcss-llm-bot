{"title":"Hell hog","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hell_hog","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Hell hogs''' are fast and irritating [[demonic]] beasts that constantly spit [[Fireball]] at you. They appear in large bands in the depths of [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], and [[Gehenna]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Hell hogs are relatively weak for the areas they spawn in. Still, if you lack [[fire resistance]], don't underestimate them. Hell hogs usually run in packs, where each hell hog can launch a 3d20 Fireball every turn. If you don't resist fire, this damage can add up really quickly. Area-of-effect attacks or a tight corridor are useful here.\n**Hell hogs have no qualms about blowing themselves or other monsters up with Fireballs.\n**[[Ignition]] and [[Fireball]] are totally useless against them. [[Fire Storm]], however, still does enough irresistible damage to one or two-shot them at decent power.\n**With rF+ and decent AC, you won't take much damage, but you should still try to deal with them quickly. Their Fireballs are [[loud]], so hell hogs can attract other (likely harder) enemies.\n\n== History ==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], hell hogs only had rF++.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], hell hogs had [[Sticky Flame]] instead of [[Fireball]]."}

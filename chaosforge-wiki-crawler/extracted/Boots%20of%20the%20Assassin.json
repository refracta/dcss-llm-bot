{"title":"Boots of the Assassin","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Boots_of_the_Assassin","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|A pair of soft boots, specially designed by the Assassin's Guild, that allow the wearer to sense potential victims nearby. They also allow the wearer to easily find vulnerabilities when attacking unaware opponents, allowing effective stabbing attacks with any weapon.}}\n\n[[File:Boots_of_the_assassin.png]] '''''the +2 pair of boots of the Assassin'''''\n\n+2 [[boots]]\n\n+100 [[Stealth]]<br>\nAll weapons count as [[short blades]] for purposes of determining stabbing bonuses<br>\nDetect Monsters: Similar to the [[Ashenzari]] ability or [[Antennae]] 3 mutation.\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''boots of the Assassin''' are a definite boon to stabbers, as the monster detection and massive stealth boost make it even easier to reach sleeping opponents and land that lethal hit. They are also amazingly useful for other melee characters so long as you have some means of generating stabbing opportunities: the short blade-grade stabbing multipliers can be massive, and the much higher base damage of heavier weapons can lead to extremely potent blows. A reliable source of [[invisibility]] or [[confusion]], the [[Dazzling Spray]] spell, or distracting allies are all excellent ways to land stabs even if you're wearing noisy armour, though raising your Stealth skill will still significantly improve your stabbing performance.\n\nCasters and ranged fighters certainly don't suffer for wearing these, but they may find a pair of boots of [[running]] preferable.\n\n==History==\n*[[0.25]] refactored these boots into the [[Hood of the Assassin]].\n*In [[0.15]] the stealth bonus was increased from 80 to 100.\n*The current form of the boots of the Assassin were added in [[0.14]]. However, prior to [[0.13]], there was a very different version of them: +2 boots which granted +80 stealth, +3 [[dexterity]], and allowed you to evoke [[invisibility]].\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Boots]]"}

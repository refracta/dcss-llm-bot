{"title":"Manual","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Manual","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For the instruction manual for Crawl itself, see [https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/docs/crawl_manual.rst this file].\n{{item-noicon\n |itemtype = Book\n |name = Manual of [Skill]\n |cost =\n |weight = 7.0\n}}\n{{flavour|A valuable book which allows one to learn a certain skill faster.}}\n[[file:Manual 1.png]] [[file:Manual 2.png]]\n\n'''Manuals''' are rare [[book]]s which boost a skill by providing a +4 bonus to the skill's [[aptitude]], effectively doubling your XP gain. You can study multiple manuals of different skills, but multiples of the same skill are used one at a time. Each manual generates with 2000-3000 [[skill point]]s of XP; once consumed, the manual is destroyed.\n\n==Strategy==\nManuals are essentially \"free\" bonus experience: as long as you train the skill with a manual, you get double XP. Unless you've hit the skill cap (level 27), you cannot waste them - you always get the full amount. Since manuals don't have a time limit, you can take as long as you want before actually training the skill.\n\nDon't be compelled to train a skill ''just'' because you have the manual:\n*Even if you have a manual, your character might not benefit from certain skills. A character committed to melee & heavy armour is unlikely to find a manual of [[Stealth (skill)|Stealth]] useful, for instance.\n*You don't have to train the manual right away - other skills may be more ''immediately'' important than the manual's skill. E.g. a caster may want to get their spells to a reasonable failure rate before training [[Dodging]].\n\nStill, manuals can be very nice to have. They can encourage you to train skills you otherwise wouldn't have trained, or boost the skills you were already training.\n\n===Settings===\nUsers of manuals may want to add this to their [[rcfile]]:\n force_more_message = finished your manual\nThis will alert you when your manual's skill aptitude bonus has run out and allow you to readjust your training priorities should you desire.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], manuals took up inventory slots.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], you could only study one manual at a time, and you would activate or deactivate them by '''r'''eading them.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], manuals functioned very differently because the skill system was very different. They would allow you to assign stored up experience from your experience pool to a specific skill without actually using that skill, and would crumble to dust after sufficient uses."}

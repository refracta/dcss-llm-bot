They cannot move and have no attacks to speak of, but they are nearly invulnerable and surrounded by an endless windstorm effect, similar to the [[Tornado]] spell. At the far end of the vault is a single item of [[acquirement]] quality, but getting past them can take a ridiculous amount of firepower.\n\nIf you step into the tornado, expect to be swirled about uncontrollably, taking a fair amount of damage every turn. The only way to exit the tornado is to step onto an empty square - if you find yourself lucky enough to be at its edge. Thankfully, you can also [[blink]] or [[teleport]] out.\n\nThey can also be found near [[Qazlal]] shrines, safely locked away behind stone walls.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The tornado is completely predictable. If you don't make any movement while you are being transported, leaving the tornado is a very easy task.\n*While characters under the effect of Tornado are immune to enemy Tornadoes, this windstorm will still affect you normally.\n\n[[File:Qazlal_obelisk.png|thumb|Shrine of Qazlal featuring a diamond obelisk]]\n\n[[Category:Vault-only monsters]]"}

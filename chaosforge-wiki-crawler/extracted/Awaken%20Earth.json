The elementals count as [[summon]]s and are worth no experience, but the walls are permanently removed. This can quickly turn a defensive chokepoint into a death trap, as even once you've dealt with the elementals or their creator, other dangerous creatures have new ways to reach you. \n\nLike [[Dig]], Awaken Earth can be used outside the player's [[LOS]]. However, monsters generally won't cast it unless they know your location (if it saw you before, if you get [[mark]]ed, or if you make a [[noise]]).\n\nThe following monsters cast this spell:\n*{{monsterlink|Deep elf elementalist}}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], Awaken Earth was removed.\n*In [[0.18]], Awaken Earth was introduced.\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

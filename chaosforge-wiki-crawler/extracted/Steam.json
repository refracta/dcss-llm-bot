{"title":"Steam","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Steam","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Steam''' is one of the least common elemental forces you will encounter as you explore the [[Dungeon]]. Unlike most elements, it is very difficult for most characters to have access to steam, and few monsters are even capable of it.\n\n==Steam Clouds==\nSteam [[cloud]]s are created when beams of [[fire]] travel over [[water]], or when beams of [[cold]] travel over [[lava]]. Examples of fiery beams include the [[wand of flame]], [[Flame Wave]], and [[Fireball]]. The player cannot create any ice projectiles, but monsters like [[frost giant]]s can use [[Throw Frost]] or [[Bolt of Cold]]. They are also created by the [[Steam Ball]] spell.\n\nSteam clouds deal [[#Steam Damage|steam damage]]. In addition, they are [[Cloud#Opaque|opaque]]; having 2 or more steam clouds in a given direction will block [[line of sight]].\n\n==Steam Damage==\nSteam damage is one of the rarest elements in the game. It appears from the following sources:\n*steam clouds\n*the [[Steam Ball]] spell\n\n==Resistance==\nSteam resistance (rSteam) prevents steam clouds from doing any damage, and reduces the impact damage from Steam Ball by -66%. \n\nThe following sources provide dedicated steam resistance:\n*[[steam dragon scales]]\n*[[Dragonskin cloak]]\n*being a pale [[draconian]]\n\nIn addition, having any amount of [[fire resistance]] (rF+ or higher) grants steam resistance. You must actually have rF+, so [[Mummies]] with a [[ring of fire]] won't get steam resistance.\n\n===Vulnerability===\nAny amount of fire vulnerability also gives steam vulnerability, which increases all steam damage by +50%.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], there were 3 levels of rSteam. Having any amount of rSteam gave immunity to steam clouds; having more levels only reduced impact damage from steam-related spells.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], [[fire]] vulnerability did not give you steam vulnerability.\n\n==See Also==\n[[:Category:Steam resistance|List of steam resistant monsters]]\n\n[[Category:Threats]]"}

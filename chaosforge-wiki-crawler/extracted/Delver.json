{"title":"Delver","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Delver","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|Delvers have, through some mishap, found themselves several floors below the surface of the dungeon. They're equipped with a wide variety of magical escape tools, and are well advised to use them to travel to earlier dungeon floors as quickly as possible.}}\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Gnoll]], [[Felid]], [[Spriggan]], [[Kobold]], and [[Vampire]] are the recommended species if you pick a Delver Background.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[weapon of choice]] ([[hand axe]], [[spear]], [[short sword]], [[falchion]], [[mace]], or [[unarmed]])\n*+0 [[leather armour]]\n*[[Scroll of fog]]\n*[[Scroll of fear]]\n*[[Scroll of revelation]]\n*[[Potion of haste]]\n*[[Wand of digging]] with 3 charges\n\nDelvers start on Floor 5 of the [[Dungeon]], always on top of a downstair. \n\nWhile in the Dungeon proper, Delvers cannot be [[shaft]]ed by the [[malevolent force]]. (This is because they are already considered \"shafted\", and you can only be hit with 1 shaft effect per dungeon branch).\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nAdjusted for your species' aptitudes:\n*[[Fighting]]: 3\n*Chosen Weapon's Skill: 2\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Stealth]]: 5\n\nChoosing Delver adds 4 to your starting [[Strength]], 2 to your starting [[Intelligence]], and 6 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nDelvers are bound to luck; a stray [[orc priest]] or [[centaur (monster)|centaur]] noticing you can end your game instantly. Thankfully, you start with high [[Stealth]] to (hopefully) avoid said encounters; playing as a naturally stealthy species like a [[Spriggan]] or [[Gnoll]] boosts Stealth even higher. Use your starting equipment wisely: \n*A [[scroll of fear]] can scare away just about any living monster in sight reliably.\n*A [[scroll of fog]] blocks [[line of sight]], preventing ranged monsters from attacking you until they are in sight again.\n*A [[scroll of revelation]] can let you scout a floor for escape routes or potentially dangerous [[vault]]s.\n*A [[potion of haste]] gives you the speed to run away from foes, including fast ones like [[adder]]s. Haste also gives you a noticeable combat boost.\n*The [[wand of digging]] can help in getting to a stair safely, most useful in conjunction with magic mapping.\n\nAttempting [[stab]]s on dangerous monsters is as likely to go poor as it is to provide a massive starting advantage. Trying to skewer a [[water moccasin]] may rocket you to level 4 instantly, or oneshot you. If playing for consistency, it is preferable to use upstairs whenever possible, and arrive in D:1 taking out \"safe\" monsters.\n\nOne strategy, albeit unreliable, is to use your magic mapping in order to find an altar or the [[Temple]] early. This may be considered start [[scumming]], but gives you a competent god as soon as D:1. For example, the [https://crawl.xtahua.com/crawl/morgue/Sapher/morgue-Sapher-20220331-131952.txt former lowest turncount game] used Delver in order to enter the Temple on turn 21.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Delvers did not have any special immunity to shafts.\n*Delvers were added in [[0.26]].\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

{"title":"Drowned soul","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Drowned_soul","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Drowned souls''' are fragile summoned [[undead]] creatures which seek out the living and attempt to drown them, inflicting modest [[asphyxiation]] damage and destroying themselves in the process. They normally only appear when summoned by [[merfolk avatar]]s.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Species that are [[amphibious]] ([[Barachi]], [[Merfolk]], [[Octopode]]) or otherwise [[unbreathing]] ([[undead]], [[Djinni]], [[Gargoyle]]s) cannot be damaged by drowned souls, so have little to fear.\n*Don't waste time targeting them; the avatar will simply summon more souls, likely faster than you can kill them off. Do what you can to kill the avatar, which instantly banishes all drowned souls.\n**Merfolk avatars will usually flee to deep water if you try to approach them. This makes melee more difficult.\n\n==History==\n*Drowned souls were added in [[0.14]]."}

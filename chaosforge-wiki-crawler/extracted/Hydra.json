{"title":"Hydra","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hydra","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''For a list of all reptiles, see [[list of reptiles and amphibians]].''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n[[Hydra]]s are notoriously dangerous melee monsters found most often in [[the Lair]] and [[the Swamp]]. They begin life with 4-8 heads, with each head giving an extra attack. [[HD]], [[XP]], and [[willpower]] are not affected by head count. While hydras cannot [[fly]], they can swim quickly through water.\n\nIf a melee attack considered \"Slashing\" does at least 4 damage, it will cut off the hydra's head. Usually, slashing a head off will cause the hydra to heal and grow two more (a net gain of 1 head). The following weapons will cut off hydra heads: [[Axes]], [[Long Blades]], 2-handed [[Polearms]], [[lajatang]]s, and [[Unarmed Combat]] with the [[Claws]] 3 [[mutation]]. All other weapons and all other forms of damage will not cut hydra heads. However, if a slashing weapon has the [[flaming]] brand, then the hydra's head will be cauterized; this prevents the regrowth / healing (resulting in a net loss of 1 head). \n\nA hydra can have a maximum of 20 heads. A hydra will die instantly if its last head is cut off. If a hydra dies this way, its [[corpse]] and any [[derived undead]] will have 1 head. [[Zombie]], [[skeleton]], and [[simulacra]] hydras will not regrow heads, even if a slashing weapon does not have flaming. A [[spectral thing|spectral]] hydra cannot have its heads cut off.\n\nIf a hydra kills an enemy, its remaining heads can attack other targets within reach.\n\nWhile exploring the bottom floor of the Swamp, beware [[the Lernaean hydra]] -- this [[unique]] hydra has [[27]] heads and is much more lethal than normal.\n\n==Strategy==\nHydras are 100% speed, melee only animals that can't open [[door]]s or [[see invisible]], though they do swim quickly. Unless the hydra's camping a branch entrance, there's water around, or you move slower than average, you can simply retreat, and enter from a different stair.\n\nEven if you ''are'' skilled with a [[flaming]] edged weapon, hydras are strong combatants. An adventurer first venturing into Lair is unlikely to win a fair fight. Remember that you don't have to kill everything in Crawl!  You can go down a different staircase, escape with a [[scroll of teleport]], or take a detour to another branch.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Hydras max out at 20 heads, at which point they get 20 individual melee attacks per turn. Don't let this happen.\n*They have [[poison resistance]], so [[poison]], [[curare]], and [[Mephitic Cloud]] won't work.\n*Hydras are [[cold-blooded]], so [[cold]] damage (either from a weapon of [[freezing]] or [[Ice Magic]]) has a chance to slow them down. Edged freezing weapons are not recommended, however, as heads will still grow back.\n*Spellcasters tend to have an easier time. Hydras have 0 AC and minimal EV, meaning that a few solid ranged attacks are likely to kill it. These characters will have trouble if the hydra gets into melee range, though. To avoid this, use the [[Blink]] spell, an escape item, or run away.\n:Most level 3+ [[Conjurations]] can kill a hydra in 3-6 hits. Summoners can use [[Summon Blazeheart Golem]] to explode. Hexers will have a tougher time, due to the hydra's above-average [[willpower]], but a [[scroll of vulnerability]] can work.\n\n===Alternatives to Edged Weapons===\nFlaming edged weapons permanently weaken hydras and deal extra damage. But you might not have a flaming weapon you're skilled with, or maybe you're a weaponless [[Troll]].  In that case, there are some other options:\n*Use a non-edged weapon of the same skill. [[Polearms]] have [[trident]]s and [[demon trident]]s; [[lajatang]] users can use a [[quarterstaff]]. Unless you have great stats, make sure you're skilled in the weapon. Cross-trained blunt weapons aren't ideal, but may work.\n*A [[potion of lignification]] gives great AC and Unarmed damage, without cutting heads - perfect for [[Troll]]s. Other species can enter Tree Form in a pinch.\n*Even characters with only slashing weapons can use certain [[Invocations]]:\n**[[Makhleb]]: Greater Servants or multiple lesser servants can easily kill hydras.\n**[[Beogh]]: [[Smite]] works, but incurs a heavy [[piety]] cost.\n**[[Elyvilon]]: Hydras are natural beasts and can be pacified easily.\n**[[Lugonu]]: With high Invocations, you may be able to [[banish]] hydras to [[the Abyss]].\n**[[Qazlal]]: Blasting hydras with Upheaval works, though it chews through piety.\n**[[Trog]]: Summoning one or two ogres to pound them to a pulp is viable. High [[HD]] trolls can usually win a fight, even though they cut hydra heads.\n*Failing that, ranged weaponry can work well. Other than [[launcher]]s, the following are easily accessible:\n**Attack [[wand]]s: Even at low [[Evocations]], a [[wand of iceblast]] or [[wand of acid]] can usually kill a hydra in 2-5 hits. This is a safe course of action for most characters. \n**[[Throwing]]: [[Javelin]]s are strong, but even [[boomerang]]s with some Throwing skill can deal good damage. [[Troll]]s and [[Ogre]]s have access to [[large rock]]s, which are incredibly powerful, but their high delay makes them risky to use up close. [[Okawaru]] buffs and boomerangs are enough to take out a hydra.\n*A [[tin of tremorstones]] works well with some Evocations training, due to a hydra's low AC. A [[phantom mirror]] uses a hydra's high damage against it, though is not reliable (the original hydra can win the fight).\n\nThe following methods do ''not'' work:\n*[[wand of polymorph|Polymorph]]: Hydras have high HD, and often turn into even tougher monsters. [[Storm dragon]]s are a particularly common result.\n*Low-skill Ranged Weapons: Hydras regenerate quickly; any method which relies on whittling down its HP over time will likely fail.\n*[[Escaping_from_(and_avoiding)_trouble#Leading_them_up|Stair dancing]]: Climbing up or down stairs next to a hydra will give it a few free hits, which is possibly all it needs to kill you.\n*Berserk With an Edged Weapon: While you may be able to deal more damage than the hydra can heal per hit, its damage output will be growing, and ending your berserk slowed and wounded next to an even stronger hydra than you started with is not ideal.\n*[[Haste]], when in the Swamp: Hydras' speed advantage in water will mean you probably cannot outrun them.\n\n==Undead Hydras==\nHydra corpses that are raised as [[zombie]]s, [[skeleton (monster)|skeletons]], or [[simulacrum (monster)|simulacra]] will have the same number of heads as the corpse. Zero-headed corpses will be raised with one head. In any case, you can slice their heads off, but they will never grow back regardless of brand. Note that hydra simulacra can have horrifyingly high damage output if you lack cold resistance (+13-38 cold damage ''per head''). [[Spectral thing|Spectral]] hydras will have the same number of heads as the hydra when it died, but these can't be cut off.\n\nAny of these undead hydras can be found as enemies throughout the dungeon, especially in the pestilence ending of [[the Swamp]]. Beware of the [[The Lernaean hydra|27-headed]] hydra zombie!\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], [[Blade Hands]] chopped hydra heads.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the now-obsolete [[wand of scattershot]] was particularly effective in killing them, as hydras have 0 AC.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], the [[Captain's Cutlass]] dealt slicing damage and chopped hydra heads.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], [[vorpal]] weapons that did 1-3 damage (instead of >=4 like usual) would chop hydra heads.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], short swords and rapiers dealt slashing damage and could remove heads.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], hydras were not [[cold-blooded]] creatures, except [[the Lernaean hydra]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hydra Form]]\n\n[[Category:Featured_Article]]"}

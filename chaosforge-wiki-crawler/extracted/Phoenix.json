Indeed it is a great rarity, even in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of the people of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the old phoenix dies. Its size and appearance, if it is like the pictures, are as follow:- The plumage is partly red, partly golden, while the general make and size are almost exactly that of the eagle. They tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and there buries the body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms a ball of myrrh as big as he finds that he can carry; then he hollows out the ball, and puts his parent inside, after which he covers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then of exactly the same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt, plastered over as I have said, and deposits it in the temple of the Sun. Such is the story they tell of the doings of this bird.”<br>\n-Herodotus, _Histories_, II, 73. ca. 440 B.C.<br>\ntrans. George Rawlinson, 1858.}}\n<!--monster-bot-end-->\n{{list of | holy monsters}}\n\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Phoenixes''' are [[holy]] winged creatures wreathed in flames that radiate a three-tile halo [[aura]]. Upon death, phoenixes will always leave a [[corpse]]; if left alone for too long (between '''X''' and '''Y''' turns), this corpse will self-resurrect at full health. Destroying the corpse through butchery, blood sacrifice, or [[Necromancy]] is necessary to truly kill a phoenix (in fact, you only get [[XP]] when the corpse is destroyed). Like most holy creatures, they are extremely rare, being found only in holy-themed [[Pandemonium]] and [[Ziggurat]] floors, as well as the occasional bird-themed [[Dungeon]] vault.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Don't kill a phoenix over [[deep water]]. Unless you are a [[merfolk]], [[octopode]], or grey [[draconian]], you won't be able to reach the corpse and it will get a free resurrection.\n*Worshipping a [[good god]] ([[Zin]], [[the Shining One]], or [[Elyvilon]]) may cause it to calm down and become neutral towards you.\n\n==History==\nPhoenixes were removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

{"title":"Gloorx Vloq","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Gloorx_Vloq","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Gloorx Vloq''' is a [[unique]] [[Pandemonium lord]], a master of [[Necromancy]] and guardian of the dark [[rune]] of Zot. They are twice as fast as most characters, and often accompanied by [[executioner]]s and [[curse skull]]s.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Gloorx may have less HP than some other Pan lords, but to many characters, is the most dangerous. They are twice as fast as the standard character, hits hard in melee, and and has an extraordinarily nasty spell set. [[Haste]], [[poison]] resistance, and max [[negative energy]] resistance are strongly recommended. Be very careful, and have a means of escape ready.\n** [[Lich Form]] is helpful, if you can cast it, though lich characters should beware of Dispel Undead. A mass of [[summon]]s can help block Dispel Undead.\n** A [[potion of lignification]] + [[scroll of fog]] combination can work great, if you're careful. Tree Form confers immunity to torment, rPois, some natural AC, and it is immune to Dispel Undead. A scroll of fog creates fog clouds, preventing [[miasma]] from being placed (clouds cannot replace existing clouds). All you'll have to worry about is the high damage in melee - and the squad of executioners.\n*Gloorx resists [[electricity]], but has no resistance to [[fire]] and only partial [[cold]] resistance, so most elemental spells work well. Even Air Magic works - [[Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling]] ignores resistances and [[Chain Lightning]] ignores half resistance.\n*[[Stab]]bers who manage to sneak up can usually kill in a single hit, but if that fails, its EV is low enough that [[throwing net]]s work very well.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.18]], Gloorx Vloq had the [[Black Mark]] spell.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Gloorx Vloq had [[Bolt of Draining]] instead of its unique [[Summon Executioners]] spell. \n*Prior to [[0.13]], Gloorx Vloq cast [[Invisibility]] as an emergency spell."}

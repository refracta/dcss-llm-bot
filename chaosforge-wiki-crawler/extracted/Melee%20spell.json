{"title":"Melee spell","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Melee_spell","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\nThe '''Melee spell''', referred to by the knowledge bots simply as \"melee\", is a fake spell used to make some particularly dangerous casters simply use their melee attacks instead of casting. In this sense it is somewhat similar to [[Cantrip]], except unlike that spell it does not cause a monster to waste a turn doing nothing; instead, the monster just uses its (usually less dangerous) melee attacks, or, if not in melee range, moves towards the player.\n\nThe melee spell is also the spell used by the [[rod of striking]].\n\n==History==\nThe melee spell was completely removed in [[0.16]] with the removal of the rod of striking.\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

{"title":"Rune lock","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Rune_lock","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\nA '''rune lock''' is a barrier that prevents you from traversing a branch before you have a sufficient number of the [[runes of Zot]]. Two rune locks currently exist in ''Crawl'':\n\n*In order to exit the [[the Vaults]], you must have 1 rune. Any rune, even runes obtained outside the Vaults, can bypass this lock. If you enter the Vaults with no runes, you must get one (either from the Vaults itself, the [[Tomb]] inside, or from the [[Abyss]]) before you can go back to the Dungeon normally. Note that [[Ignis]]' Rising Flame ability will bypass the rune lock.\n*The entrance to [[the Realm of Zot]] requires 3 runes to unlock. This serves as the main barrier preventing the player from simply descending as deep as possible and reaching the Orb.\n\n==Rune Availability==\n*All runes are available as the first rune. However, it is highly recommended to get the first rune from one of the two Lair branches ([[Snake Pit]]/[[Spider's Nest]] and [[Swamp]]/[[Shoals]]). Obtaining the second rune is generally best done in the other Lair branch from the list above. \n**Followers of [[Jiyva]] can trivially acquire the rune from the [[Slime Pits]] once they have accumulated sufficient [[piety]], but others will likely wish to wait until later. \n*The third and final rune for opening the Realm of Zot is best obtained from either the Vaults, the Slime Pits, or the [[Abyss]].\n*All runes found in the [[Hell]]s, [[Pandemonium]], and [[Tomb]] are considered part of the optional [[extended game]] and are mainly used to improve the final [[score]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], you needed a rune to ''enter'' [[the Vaults]]. This rune lock has been moved to ''exiting'' the Vaults.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], you needed 2 runes to enter a [[ziggurat]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], you needed 3 runes to enter a ziggurat.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], you did not need a rune to enter the Vaults.\n**Although the concept of a rune lock to the Vaults had been debated since very early versions of ''Crawl'', it was only implemented after the [[0.13]] tournament, in which acquiring a rune before D:14 was an optional challenge conduct. \n\n::Without a rune lock, players have much less of a reason to enter the Lair Branch endings. They could explore Dungeon, both Lair Branch: 1-4s, and Vaults: 1-4 before entering a branch end. So by the time the player entered their first rune vault, they'd be overlevelled (thus, removing the challenge from obtaining your first rune).\n*A rune lock requiring 3 runes has always existed for [[the Realm of Zot]].\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

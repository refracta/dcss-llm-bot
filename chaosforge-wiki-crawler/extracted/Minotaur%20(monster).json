{"title":"Minotaur (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Minotaur_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n''This page is about the monster. For the player species, see [[Minotaur]].''\n{{monster info|minotaur}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Minotaurs''' are moderately powerful creatures which serve as the final challenge of every [[Gauntlet]]: they guard the exit -- and the pile of treasure left behind by the last few adventurers foolish enough to challenge them. They are armed and heavily armoured, carry a stack of deadly [[javelin]]s, and can counter melee attacks with vicious headbutts, making them dangerous opponents at any range. They do appear sometimes outside of a Gauntlet in [[the Depths]] and [[the Vaults]], or in a rare [[vault]] in the Shoals.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Even though they are a \"boss\"-like monster, Minotaurs can not see [[invisible]].\n*Be sure to examine them before the fight to know just how heavy a hitter they're going to be. A bare-handed minotaur is much less of a threat than one wielding an artefact [[executioner's axe]].\n*Their javelins hit hard, which makes ranged combat a risky proposition for lightly armoured characters. Invisibility or a [[scarf]] of repulsion can help tilt the odds back in your favor. Alternatively, some maps may allow you to run and hide between shots until you've exhausted their ammo supply, then blast them with impunity.\n**[[Demonspawn]], [[Transmuter]]s, and heavily mutated characters beware, as minotaurs frequently carry [[silver]] javelins. They will hurt. A ''lot''.\n*You do not have to kill the minotaur. You can sneak or [[scroll of blinking|blink]] past, grab the loot, and run.\n*Don't hesitate to use up resources on this fight. Minotaurs have been the death of many a promising character, and it's a lot easier to replace that [[potion of might]] than it is to start over.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.23]], the minotaur branch was the [[Labyrinth]] instead of the Gauntlet.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], minotaurs had no armour, no javelins, and significantly less [[MR]], making them much less of a threat.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], minotaurs appearing naturally outside of labyrinths didn't come with equipment."}

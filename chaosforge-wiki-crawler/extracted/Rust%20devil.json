{"title":"Rust devil","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Rust_devil","type":"raw","data":"{{version017}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Rust devils''' are [[Tier-4 demon|tier-4]] [[demon]]s with multiple resistances and moderately powerful physical attacks. Although less intimidating than most demons, their real strength lies in the fact that their attacks inflict [[corrosion]], significantly hampering your ability to take down foes quickly or endure further strikes. They are a common sight in [[the Iron City of Dis]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Corrosion resistance will certainly help prevent them from inflicting corrosion upon you, but may not be that necessary. They are weak enough that most well-prepared characters will be able to take them out long before they land a corroding hit. Just be wary of letting them engage you while you're distracted with another foe; [[Hell]] is not the sort of place that gives you time to repair your equipment between fights.\n\n==History==\nRust devils were added in [[0.16]], replacing [[iron devil]]s."}

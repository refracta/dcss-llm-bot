It is a two handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Dire flails''' have respectable damage and attack quickly, though they require two hands to wield.\n\n==Strategy==\nA good early game weapon for Maces & Flails users, since it's good at low skill. Despite being two-handed, they attack faster (and harder) than both [[mace]]s and [[flail]]s, meaning it takes less skill to reach a \"reasonable\" [[attack speed]].\n\nIf you are a Maces & Flails user who hasn't found a [[shield]] yet, there's little reason ''not'' to use a dire flail. Even if you have found a shield, a dire flail can remain competitive at low weapon skill. At high skill (around 14-16 skill), it is generally outclassed by either [[morningstar]] + [[shield]] or a [[great mace]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Dire flail\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Dire flail1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Dire flail2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Dire flail3.png]]\n|}\n\n{{weapons}}\n\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

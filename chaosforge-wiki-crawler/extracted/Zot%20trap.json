You may find yourself thrown into the Abyss, contaminated with enormous amounts of wild magic, have mighty fiends summoned against you, or the like. Hostile monsters may trigger this trap themselves to invoke its effects against you, but your allies will avoid stepping on it.}}\n\n[[File:Zot trap.png]] A '''Zot trap''' is a magical [[trap]] which produces a random nasty effect, ranging from simple explosions to things such as [[banishment]] or [[greater demon]]s.\n\nZot traps are only found on the lower levels of the Depths, and in the later [[branch]]es.\n\n==Effects==\nZot traps have their own list of magical effects to choose from:<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|traps.cc|405}}</ref>\n* Evil magic (total 66% chance):\n** 1-5 point [[Stat]] drain (16.7% chance)\n** 7000 - 20000 [[Magic contamination]] (yellow to light red) (16.7% chance)\n** [[Paralysis]] for 2-5 turns (4.2% chance)\n** Lose all [[MP]] (8.3% chance)\n** [[Petrify]] (4.2% chance)\n** [[Scroll of vulnerability|Weak-]][[will]]ed for 0-19 turns (16.7% chance)\n* Summons (total 33% chance):\n** [[Word of Recall]] 2-4 enemies (12.5% chance)\n** [[Durably summoned]] [[greater demon]] (12.5% chance)\n** [[Malign Gateway]] (4.2% chance)\n** [[Twister]], summoned for roughly 10-14 turns (4.2% chance)\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*It is not necessary to step onto a Zot trap to be affected by it. If a monster in your [[LOS]] steps on a Zot trap, it may \"invoke the power of Zot\" against you. Although it's not always an option, consider [[exclusion|excluding]] Zot traps you find to guarantee you won't accidentally wander close enough to one for an unfortunate monster to stumble across it. It's unlikely, but can make life miserable when it happens.\n*If you find a Zot trap while walking down a 1-tile wide hallway, it may be worthwhile to use a [[wand of digging]] or an appropriate spell to give yourself a means of stepping around the trap. Failing that, a random [[Blink]] (only if you are adjacent to the trap), [[scroll of blinking]], or [[Passage of Golubria]] can get you past without an issue. Only trigger a Zot trap if whatever is on the other side is truly worth subjecting yourself to its effects, and equip as many purely defensive items as you can first.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Zot traps had a wider array of possible effects, including various elemental explosions, [[banishment]], [[rot]], [[malmutate|malmutation]], [[draining]], [[confusion]]/[[slow]]/[[distortion]], losing [[wand]] charges, and [[silence]]. Less powerful monsters were among those that could be summoned, and all monsters summoned by Zot traps were durably summoned.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], ''you'' unintentionally stepping on Zot traps was more common, as they could be hidden before you stepped on their tile (like all traps).\n*In [[0.14]], it was possible to be strongly poisoned by a Zot trap.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Zot traps simply chose random magical [[miscast effect]]s, and so had a much greater chance of being completely harmless.\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Traps]]"}

{"title":"Murray","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Murray","type":"raw","data":"{{version024}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Murray the Demonic Talking Skull''' is an [[unique]] [[curse skull]], capable of both movement and physical attacks and requiring significantly more damage than normal to destroy. He can only be found in the [[Vestibule of Hell]] (25% chance per game), and is placed using the vault syntax for that map rather than using the unique placement system.\n\nMurray is also found in [[Dungeon Sprint]]: [[The Violet Keep of Menkaure]]. He appears immediately before the player grabs the [[Orb of Zot]], blocking the player's path out as unfriendly demons spawn nearby.\n\n==Location==\n*The [[Vestibule of Hell]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nHe's much tougher than a regular curse skull, but [[Dispel Undead]] and [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] are still very effective. His movement and melee attacks may work to your advantage. In melee, he may bite you instead of summoning or tormenting; regular curse skulls never have that option. Still, be sure to have an escape plan, as he is about as difficult to kill as a [[royal mummy]] but cannot be [[silence]]d, and you'll be dealing with the other threats of the Vestibule at the same time.\n\n==Trivia==\nMurray is a reference to a talking skull of the same name from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island_(series) Monkey Island game series]."}

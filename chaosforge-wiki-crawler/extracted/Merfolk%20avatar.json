{"title":"Merfolk avatar","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Merfolk_avatar","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of|merfolk}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nA '''merfolk avatar''' is similar to a [[merfolk siren]], but more insidious. Like sirens, they will attempt to [[mesmerise]] you shortly after noticing you. Unlike sirens, however, they summon [[drowned soul]]s to kill you, and retreat from those who try to approach. They are occasionally found throughout [[the Shoals]].\n\nMerfolk avatars have a special A.I. - they'll move backwards if it detects you are trying to go closer, and move closer if you attempt to retreat.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*High [[willpower]] will let you ignore the singing effect. The spell can also be broken early by killing or confusing the siren, as well as through a number of other methods. See the [[mesmerise]] page for a full list.\n**Although random [[blink]]s and [[teleport]]s can also break mesmerism if you manage to leave LOS, you cannot willingly make ''controlled'' blinks away.\n*Drowned souls aren't very durable, but there are a lot of them and they won't stop coming until the avatar is dead. Focus on killing her quickly, and all her souls will dissipate.\n*For melee-focused characters, if you have a means of [[fly]]ing and [[potion of haste|hasting]] yourself, then you can just chase down the avatar and take her out up close. This poses significant dangers, of course, as you'll be taking significant amounts of [[asphyxiation]] damage from her drowned souls as you rush in. If possible, use ranged attacks instead to take her out more quickly.\n*[[Unbreathing]] species (undead, [[Gargoyle]]s, and grey [[Draconian]]s) have little to fear from the drowned souls. Focus on other, more immediate threats first.\n\n==History==\nMerfolk avatars were introduced in [[0.16]], freeing up the monster name [[siren]], which [[mermaid]]s were then renamed to."}

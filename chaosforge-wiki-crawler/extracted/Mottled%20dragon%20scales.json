Although it does not provide its wearer with as much protection as the armour made from the scales of some larger dragons, it is somewhat lighter and less encumbering. It is also remarkably smooth, letting sticky flames flow off it like water.}}\n\n'''Mottled dragon scales''' is a decent armour choice for [[stealth]]y or [[spellcasting]] characters, providing decent [[AC]] and [[GDR]] in exchange for a very small [[encumbrance rating]], as well as protecting the user from [[Sticky Flame]].\n\nUnsurprisingly, you can get this armour by slaying a [[mottled dragon]]. It takes 5 turns to wear or remove.\n\n==Desirability==\nThe encumbrance rating on this armour is so small that even characters with a terrible [[Armour skill]] aptitude (such as [[spriggan]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[troll]]s, or [[deep elves]]) can easily overcome it. Unfortunately, it is rarely found lying around, and its special resistance to [[Sticky Flame]] is not very useful. \n\nSome players will prefer the extra AC this armour gives, while others may find that a useful property (such as that from [[robe of the Archmagi]], [[troll leather armour]], or even just a [[leather armour]] of [[fire resistance]]) is more useful. Ultimately, it depends on your play style and what other equipment you have found.\n\nMottled Dragon Scales is the lightest Armour that does not permit casting of [[Ozocubu's Armour]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Armour''' || [[File:Mottled dragon armour.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Faerie dragon armour]]''' || [[File:Faerie dragon armour.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n[[Acid dragon scales]] replaced mottled dragon scales in [[0.20]].\n\nIn [[0.19]], mottled dragon armour was renamed to mottled dragon scales.\n\nPrior to [[0.15]], sticky flame was notorious for destroying [[scroll]]s in your inventory, making rSticky significantly more desirable.\n\nPrior to [[0.14]], its encumbrance rating was 4, making it compatible with [[Ozocubu's Armour]].\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Body armour]]\n[[Category:Dragon armour]]"}

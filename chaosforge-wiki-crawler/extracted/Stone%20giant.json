{"title":"Stone giant","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Stone_giant","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | giants}}\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Stone giants''' are massive, powerful humanoids who hurl powerful [[large rock]]s at range and hit moderately hard in melee. They appear throughout [[the Vaults]] and [[the Depths]], and occasionally in late [[Dungeon]] and the [[Orcish Mines]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Stone giants can deal up to 65 damage per turn (before [[GDR]]), every turn, at range. If a stone giant is camping the entrance to Orc, consider skipping the branch for a while.\n*Like many other ranged monsters, stone giants stop throwing large rocks once in melee with the player. Their melee isn't ''weak'', but getting hit by large rocks hurts more than their melee attacks.\n*Stone giants don't have any resistances to speak of, and they cannot see [[invisible]]. [[Curare]] slows them down, while [[repulsion]] helps defend against large rocks.\n**Despite their name and appearance, stone giants are not vulnerable to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], stone giants (like all monsters) threw large rocks slowly. They'd also start with a limited number of rocks; once they've been tossed, they'd be just like any melee enemy."}

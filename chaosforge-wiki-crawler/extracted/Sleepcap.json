{"title":"Sleepcap","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Sleepcap","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Sleepcaps''' are early [[Dungeon]] monsters, appearing on D:4-8. Their melee attacks have a 50% chance to put the opponent to [[sleep]] if any damage is dealt. [[Unbreathing]] creatures are immune to sleep-inducing spores.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Sleep is threatening to any character vulnerable to it. Being put to sleep gives monsters a free turn to hit you, during which your [[EV]] is reduced to 0, and you take 2.5x melee damage. When it gets the sleep effect, the sleepcap alone can deal up to 32 damage per round.\n**If you are immune to sleep ([[Undead]], [[Gargoyle]], [[Djinni]], have [[clarity]], or during [[berserk]]) or are unbreathing ([[Ice Form]]), then you have much less to fear.\n\n==History==\n*Sleepcaps were added in [[0.30]]."}

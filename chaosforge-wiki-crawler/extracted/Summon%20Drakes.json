{"title":"Summon Drakes","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summon_Drakes","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n{{Flavour|Summons multiple drakes, komodo dragons, and lindwurms.}}\n\n'''Summon Drakes''' is a monster-only spell which summons several of the following creatures into existence<ref>{{source ref|0.25.0|mon-cast.cc|4144}}</ref>:\n\n*{{monsterlink|Swamp drake}}, 16.7%\n*{{monsterlink|Komodo dragon}}, 16.7%\n*{{monsterlink|Wind drake}}, 16.7%\n*{{monsterlink|Rime drake}}, 20%\n*{{monsterlink|Death drake}}, 20%\n*{{monsterlink|Lindwurm}}, 10%\n\nIt is one of the more threatening spells in the game due to its ability to create [[miasma]]-spewing [[death drake]]s that will swiftly [[slow]], [[poison]], and [[rot]] you. Fortunately, it only appears in the spell lists of [[draconian stormcaller]]s, and the rest of the monsters the spell can summon are minor threats compared to the regular enemies encountered around the [[Realm of Zot]].\n\nAs a general rule, try to kill off the stormcaller first in any encounter to keep things simple. If you are swarmed and cannot kill the caller, use whatever means necessary to escape ([[teleport]] is not a bad idea on Zot:1-4, but on Zot:5 you'll usually want to resort to running away while increasing your movement speed as much as possible). Attempting to wade your way through hordes of drakes while slowed, rotting, and possibly poisoned is simply never worth the trouble.\n\nRot resistance renders miasma harmless, but gaining said resistance is quite difficult. [[Zin]]'s Vitalisation ability will protect you from the status effects but not the damage, while having [[Statue Form]], [[Necromutation]], or [[Dithmenos]]'s [[Shadow Form]] active provides complete protection. Other than that, you have to be [[undead]] ([[Ghoul]], [[Mummy]], bloodless [[Vampire]]), a [[Gargoyle]], or a [[Vine Stalker]]. Make sure your other resistances are up to snuff, too -- the various drakes might be less dangerous than the dragons that roam Zot, but their breath weapons can still deal respectable damage if you don't resist them.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.18]], the spell had a 10% chance to summon a \"standard\" dragon, from a [[steam dragon]] to [[storm dragon]] and [[shadow dragon]]. Also, [[Fire drake]]s were replaced by [[rime drake]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], it did not summon [[wind drake]]s.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

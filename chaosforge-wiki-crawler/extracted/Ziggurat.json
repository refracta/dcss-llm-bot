Beware, for a ziggurat is not a place for the faint of heart: even the bravest and most skilled adventurers have met their ends in one. While a portal to safety will be present on every level, once left, a ziggurat cannot be re-entered.\n\nOne ziggurat is guaranteed in the Depths. Tales tell of an magical item found at the bottom of each ziggurat, granting access to a new ziggurat in turn. Such an item is also said to be found at the bottom of the Tomb of the Ancients. Each time a ziggurat is conquered by exiting it from the final floor, subsequent ziggurats will become increasingly dangerous and lucrative.\n\n----\n\n“Captain: Take off every ‘zig’!!<br>\nCaptain: For great justice.”<br>\n-Zero Wing}}\n\n'''Ziggurats''' are the most dangerous, unpredictable, and lucrative [[branch]]es in the game. A ziggurat has 27 oval- or cross-shaped floors, each increasing in size, monster count, and treasure. \n\n==Useful Info==\nThere are 2 ways to enter a ziggurat:\n*One ziggurat portal is guaranteed to generate somewhere in [[the Depths]].\n*A [[figurine of a ziggurat]] can be found in [[Tomb]]:3, and at the end of any subsequent ziggurat.\n\nZiggurat portals do not expire over time. Once one has left a ziggurat, the portal turns into an empty arch and may not be reentered. Any new portal encountered or created leads to the first floor of a fresh ziggurat. Summoned creatures cannot follow the player through a ziggurat portal or stairway.\n\nIf you successfully complete a ziggurat (exit from the 27th floor), all subsequent ziggurats become more difficult (more monsters, more loot), up to the 13th (some monster sets will continue to get more difficult forever). Also, clearing a ziggurat stops the [[Zot clock]] for the rest of the game.\n\n==Layout==\nEach floor has a number of monsters of a particular theme. The 1st floor may contain 2-3 monsters, the last floors will contain hundreds. Most are based around [[branch]]es (e.g. [[Shoals]] or [[Elven Halls|Elf]] floors), though some are ad-hoc. Deeper floors will have a greater ratio of powerful monsters to weak ones, and can generate all monsters awake and wandering (0% chance for Zig:1-4, 100% chance for Zig 25-27).\n\nEach floor may also contain a central clump of dungeon features known as pillars. Most of them are cosmetic, but some can contain foes ranging from [[crimson imp]]s to [[royal mummy|royal mummies]]. There are always 4 identical pillars generated in each \"corner\" of a ziggurat floor (actual contents may vary, but they are always the same type of feature). There is a small chance for a [[Zot trap]] pillar to generate.\n\nThe entrance to each floor closes as soon as you walk through; the only way out is at the opposite end of the floor. Except on the final floor, there are always 2 staircases down, and 1 portal out. On the final floor, there's 2 portals out.\n\nTo compensate, ziggurats contain large amounts of treasure, including armour, jewellery, valuable potions (many of which are [[potions of experience]]), manuals, and many other wonderful things. Note that items can spawn on the exit portals/stairs, so don't forget about them.\n\n==Monster Themes==\nUnless mentioned otherwise, the chance for any given set is (approx.) 4.39% for Zig:1-13 and 4.26% for Zig:14-27.\n\nEnemies listed in ''italics'' have [[Symbol of Torment]] or other dangerous abilities, such as [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]], or the high burst damage of a [[juggernaut]].\n===Branches===\nLair, Shoals, and the [[Hells]] all have 50% of the normal chance to spawn.

If you need certain items, like [[potions of mutation]] or [[spellbook]]s, dipping into a ziggurat can be a good option. You could come across a nasty [[pan lord]] on the first floor, so it's recommended to have consumables ([[scrolls of blinking]], [[potions of haste]], etc.) if you want to enter.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Ziggurats only get harder if the previous one is fully completed, and you get 2 chances to enter a fresh Zig. So if you exit the 1st Zig from level 26 or before, you'll get a 2nd Zig at the same difficulty.\n\n==Completion Strategies==\n''Main article: [[Mega-Zig]]''\n\nPreparation is similar to [[Pandemonium]], but harder. For a reasonable amount of safety, the following is ''highly'' recommended:\n*XL 27 and very high skills.\n*Decent (~40+) [[AC]] and [[EV]].\n*As many resistances as possible; at least something like rCorr, rElec, rPois, rC+, and rF++. You should strive for rN+++, especially if you're susceptible to [[torment]].\n\nThe following are recommended, if not essential:\n*[[Scrolls of fog]] to block enemy sight, and [[scrolls of blinking]] to escape.\n*[[Potions of curing]] to cure confusion (especially if you use an [[orb]] of [[energy]]), potions of heal wounds to recover lost HP, potions of might/brilliance/haste to enhance your battle prowess, and potions of magic to recover MP in a pinch.\n*[[Blink]] and [[Passage of Golubria]] at 1% failure, to avoid getting surrounded, create some distances from powerful enemies, or just escape.\n\nKeep in mind you're limited to 52 items; only bring what you know will be useful, else you might not be able to take all the loot you want with you. Artefacts with multiple resistances and intrinsics are your friend!\n\n----\n\n===Conjurer Strategy===\nThe basic strategy is to use [[talisman of death|death form]] and cast your offensive spells. Throw [[javelin]]s at silencing foes. Depending on your god choice, you can also use Sif Muna's channel (more reliable), Vehumet's MP gain on killing (somewhat more random, but passive), or [[Gozag]]'s magic potion (expensive at first). Keep in mind that you can't escape to rest for MP, so make sure to have backup in the form of a potion of magic, Sublimation of Blood, etc...\n\n====Spells====\nSupport Spells:\n*'''[[Translocation]]s''': [[Blink]], [[Passage of Golubria]], maybe [[Disjunction]] all allow the movement of things to be in your favor.\n\nOffensive Spells:\n*'''[[Fire Storm]] or [[Chain Lightning]]''': High damage, high power AOE spells.\n*'''[[Polar Vortex]]''': MP efficient, largely irresistible, passive damage that sustains in silence.\n*'''[[Shatter]]''': Another [[LOS]]-wide spell with good damage, better against resistances. However, many threatening enemies like [[pandemonium lord]]s and the [[orb of fire]] are [[flying]], so take little damage from this spell.\n\nIf you plan on going past 1-2 ziggurats or so, you should rely mostly on '''[[Ignition]]''' rather than Fire Storm/Chain Lightning. Ignition hits every enemy in the cramped floors of a ziggurat 9 times over, which can outdamage both spells. However, Ignition cannot hurt fire-immune enemies, so you'll still want to have one of the latter spells. Also, for most of the 1st/2nd Zig, Fire Storm can match or even outperform Ignition. (Ignition can still be useful to have for one-time ziggurat divers.)\n\nOptional Spells:\n*'''[[Discord]]''': this makes floors with many natural monsters with low willpower, such as orc or merfolk floors, very easy.\n*'''[[Chain Lightning]]''': Useful for killing dangerous monsters (especially Pan lords) who get close to you. [[Crystal spear]] is an inferior alternative, but can work if you can't cast Chain Lightning yet.\n*'''[[Dragon's Call]]''': Creates distractions for a somewhat efficient MP cost, though it'll use your entire bar if you aren't careful.\n\n====Equipment====\nIn addition to the general equipment:\n*Enhancers (e.g. rings of fire/ice, staff of conjuration/fire/cold/air, etc...) to enhance the power of Fire Storm, Ignition, or Polar Vortex. A [[robe of the Archmagi]] is amazing for this purpose, if low AC.\n**A ring of wizardry to improve the success rates of your level 9 spells, if necessary. Also, try downgrading your shield type (tower shield to a kite shield to a buckler) if your Shields skill isn't high enough. Your offense is your best defense.\n**[[Orb of Mayhem|Orbs of mayhem]] can disable an entire screen's worth of enemies, including orbs of fire and other nonliving enemies, by causing them to go into a frenzy and attack their former comrades. This will also disable their spellcasting.\n\n====Specific Floors====\nMost floors can be completed by spamming high power spells. However, some need special care; more detail can be found in the [[Mega-Zig]] article.\n\nSilence, whenever it be from [[silent spectre]]s or [[pandemonium lord]]s, should be your main threat. It disables nearly all of your damage output and escape options.\n\nFire floors, with [[orbs of fire]] and [[balrug]]s, demand a spell that is not Ignition. [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]] and [[Chain Lightning]] work nicely.\n\n----\n\n===Necromancer Strategy===\nWhile this is not as effective as using offensive, full-screen elemental spells, a more companion driven variant is still effective. Begin every ziggurat floor with [[Death Channel]]. Use [[Infestation]] in crowded groups of enemies, and begin by slaying the first few infested monsters to begin snowballing with undead. [[Ignition]] is a great way of initiating the cascade. In particularly difficult floors, be prepared to escape with [[Death's Door]] and a [[scroll of blinking]] or two.\n\n====Spells====\nSupport Spells:\n*'''[[Anguish]]''': Affects the entire screen, so every monster that passes a willpower check takes damage from attacking. A [[scroll of vulnerability]] can greatly increase the number of affected targets, but be careful of dangerous hexers.\n\nOffensive Spells:\n*'''[[Death Channel]]''' & '''[[Infestation]]''': Create undead allies in large quantities.\n*'''[[Ignition]]''': Hits every enemy in the cramped floors of a ziggurat up to 9 times over; does not harm allies.\n*'''Non-Elemental Spells''': A lesser priority, but spells like [[Iron Shot]] are useful for hitting singlular immune enemies when Death Channel has not started yet.\n\n----\n\n=== Spell-less Strategy ===\nGenerally, you shouldn't attempt to fully clear a Ziggurat without spells of some sort. It is very likely to be fatal. Having said that, the first few floors are usually safe for many XL 27 characters, although this can still be risky.\n\nThe [[Singing Sword]] is a notable exception to this, and it is viable to clear the first ziggurat by using it with [[Manifold Assault]].\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Mega-Zig]] - also includes strategies to beat them.\n\n==History==\n*After [[0.32]], ziggurats now scale monster difficulty three times as fast and the monster count twice as fast.\n*In [[0.31]], a [[The Vestibule of Hell|vestibule]] floor was added, and many floors were revamped to compensate for the difficulty change caused by other gameplay reworks.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], ziggurats required at least 2 runes of Zot to enter.\n*In [[0.27]], the [[Zot clock]] now stops when you complete your first ziggurat.\n*Ziggurat [[player ghost]]s were added in [[0.25]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], ziggurat portals generated randomly in the Pandemonium, requiring money to enter.\n*[[0.16]] introduced so-called [[Mega-Zig]]s. Every time a ziggurat is cleared, subsequent ziggurats become much harder.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], ziggurats required at least 3 runes of Zot to enter.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], a ziggurat portal could be summoned by the [[Trowel card]] of a legendary [[Deck of dungeons]] once per game. The [[Trowel card]] was removed in [[0.15]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], ziggurat portals would generate randomly in the main [[Dungeon]], and required you pay an admission fee of 2,100 to 14,000 [[gold]] to enter.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], it was possible to permanently leave a ziggurat via [[Banishment]].\n\n{{Portals}}\n\n[[Category:Portals]]\n[[Category:Strategy]]"}

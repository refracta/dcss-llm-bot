{"title":"Arrow trap","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Arrow_trap","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|A mechanical trap that will fire an arrow when triggered.}}\n\n[[File:Arrow trap.png]]\n\nAn '''arrow trap''' is a [[trap]] which fires an [[arrow]] when stepped upon by the player or [[monster]]. As one of the weaker traps, they hold 3-11 arrows and deal 1d15 physical damage to the player or 1d7 damage to monsters. The game will prompt you if you try to walk over one on less than 35 HP.\n\nEffects that grant the [[Repel Missiles#Player sources|RMsl]] status will reduce the chance of this trap being able to hit the player.\n\nMuch like other traps, arrow traps cannot be disarmed, but they do have a limited supply of ammunition. They are fairly uncommon, appearing only in the [[Ossuary]] branch.\n\n==History==\n*Arrow traps were removed in [[0.27]].\n*Prior to 0.16, [[fly]]ing characters would never trigger traps.\n*In previous versions, traps could be disarmed by \"attacking\" the trap in place by pressing '''Ctrl-<Direction>'''. This ability was enhanced by the [[Traps & Doors]] skill. Both of these have been removed.\n\n[[Category:Traps]]"}

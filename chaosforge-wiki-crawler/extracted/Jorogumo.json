{"title":"Jorogumo","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Jorogumo","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Jorogumos''' are monsters that take spider-like forms. If you aren't fully immune to poison, their melee attacks can [[slow]] and [[paralyse]] for 1-3 turns (similar to [[hornet]]s). At range, they can trap you in [[web]]s and shoot bolts of [[negative energy]]. They are found in the [[Spider's Nest]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Incredibly high threat enemy. If you aren't immune to poison (and aren't a [[Formicid]]), getting hit in melee should be treated like '''[[instant death]]'''. Just one hit can [[paralyse]] you for 3 turns, which is enough for a crowd of spiders to kill you from 100% health. A jorogumo ''by itself'' can deal up to 240 negative energy damage in 3 turns, enough to kill most characters without rN+.\n:That's not to mention its spells - Ensnare halves [[EV]] and prevents you from moving and attacking with melee and ranged weapons. Bolt of Draining is high damage.\n*Their [[willpower]] is moderately high, though [[Hexes]] or [[Evocations]] specialists can hex them somewhat reliably.\n\n==Trivia==\nA [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jor%C5%8Dgumo Jor≈çgumo] is a type of creature from Japanese folklore that takes the forms of beautiful women to lure in and deceive others before preying upon them.\n\n==History==\n*Jorogumos were added in [[0.28]]."}

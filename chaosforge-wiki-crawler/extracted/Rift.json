It possesses an unusually large reach that teleports its attack directly to its victim.}}\n[[File:Rift.png]] '''''the +8 demon trident \"Rift\"'''''\n\n+8 [[demon trident]]\n\n[[Distortion]] brand<br>\nRange 3 [[reaching]] attack that is [[smite-targeted]] (bypasses intervening monsters, statues, and [[iron grate]]s).\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Rift''',<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|1556}}</ref> as a +8 demon trident of distortion, is already a top-tier weapon. The extra reach helps against [[blink]]ing enemies, while the smite-targeting makes it even better when attacking behind [[summon]]s or other allies. It can also be used to attack monsters behind other monsters (like [[boggart]]s). Distortion's blinking can be tricky to deal with, but it is a powerful brand, stronger than [[electrocution]].\n\nAs with other distortion weapons, Rift inflicts very dangerous effects on unwield, including [[banishment]], unless you worship [[Lugonu]]. But Rift is a great weapon for any character (melee or caster) - you shouldn't ''need'' to unwield it for the rest of the game.\n\n==History==\n*Rift was added in [[0.23]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Polearms]]"}

{"title":"Spell memorisation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spell_memorisation","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n\n'''Spell memorisation''' is the process by which you learn [[spell]]s from your spell library. \n\n==Spell Library==\nThe spell library can be viewed by pressing '''M'''. You can gain spells by starting [[background]], by picking up [[spell book]]s, or through the gifts of certain gods ([[Vehumet]], [[Kiku]]). \n\nOnce you're in the memorisation menu, press the letter of the spell in order to learn it. This takes a few turns (<code>spell level + 1</code> turns), and is interrupted when you are attacked, so do it in a safe area.\n\nYou can search for spells the library with '''ctrl-F''', and can switch between memorisation, checking descriptions, and hiding/showing spells you have no interest in with the '''!''' key.\n\n==Restrictions==\nWhile any character may gain access to spells, the following restrictions apply:\n\n*There's a limit to the number of [[spell level]]s. Each spell has a level, from 1 to 9. You can only have up to <code>2 * Spellcasting + Experience Level - 1</code> levels of spells at one time. E.g. a character at XL 11 and 5 Spellcasting can learn 20 levels of spells - that's four level 5 spells, two level 9 + one level 2 spell, etc.\n**If your spell level capacity is lowered ([[Ru]] sacrifice, removing [[Ashenzari]] curses), you will keep all your spells, even if you'd reach \"negative\" spell levels.\n*You cannot memorise a spell whose level is higher than your experience level.\n*There is a hard limit of 21 spells.\n\nIn addition, you cannot physically memorise a spell if you are [[confused]], [[berserk]], or [[brainless]].\n\nA [[scroll of amnesia]] lets you unmemorise a spell, freeing up spell levels. The spell remains in your library, so you can relearn it later.\n\n===Species Restrictions===\nSome [[species]] can't memorize certain spells, usually because they'd be useless:\n\n*[[Djinn]] can not memorize spells. Instead, they get random spells every 2 XLs.\n*[[Ghoul]]s & [[Mummies]]: [[Sublimation of Blood]], high level Necromancy ([[Borgnjor's Revivification]], [[Death's Door]], [[Necromutation]]), form-changing spells ([[Beastly Appendage]], [[Blade Hands]], [[Dragon Form]], [[Storm Form]], [[Ice Form]], [[Necromutation]], [[Spider Form]], [[Statue Form]], and [[Wereblood]]).\n*[[Vampire]]s: high level Necromancy ([[Borgnjor's Revivification]], [[Death's Door]], [[Necromutation]]). They can memorize [[Sublimation of Blood]] and form-changing spells, but only cast when they are Alive.\n*[[Felid]]s: [[Portal Projectile]], [[Animate Armour]].\n*[[Gargoyles]]: [[Statue Form]], [[Sublimation of Blood]].\n*[[Formicid]]s: [[Blink]], [[Swiftness]], [[Vhi's Electric Charge]]\n*[[Octopode]]s & [[Draconian]]s: [[Animate Armour]].\n\nAlso note that memorising spells while worshipping [[Trog]] will trigger [[penance]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], spells gifted by Vehumet were not added into the player's library even when memorised.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], there was no spell library. [[Spellbooks]] were permanent objects, and spells had to be memorised directly from a book each time.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], your chance of success at memorising a spell was related to your chance to cast the same spell. Failing to memorise a spell had no effect, except from a [[Book of Annihilations]], a [[Grand Grimoire]] or a [[Necronomicon]]. In these cases, you'd suffer a (likely high level) [[miscast effect]] from [[Conjurations]], [[Summonings]] or [[Necromancy]], respectively.\n\n[[Category:Magic]]"}

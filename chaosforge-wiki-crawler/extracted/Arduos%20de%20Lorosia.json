He's even got [http://twitter.com/ArduosTheGusty a twitter] and [http://arduosthegusty.webs.com/ a website]!\n\n\n== The first excursion ==\nJournal of Arduos of Lorosia, the Draconian Air Elementalist (Crawl version 0.6.0 tiled).\n\n=== Floor One === \nWell, I've nothing to go back to. I just barely manage to escape my captors the first time and hid as a Wizard's apprentice. Unfortunately, I only had enough time to learn the basics before they found me. I've escaped to the Dungeon. No one has devled into the dungeon and came back alive, but whatever is in there can't be as bad as what's out there. This journal, should anyone find it, shall be my life's work. Hopefully this information could help someone out, help them to avoid some fatal mistake I've made. Or maybe it can just be a story to be read in someone's spare time. Regardless, it starts.\n\t\nA dagger. This will have to last me until I can find a better weapon...\n\t\nMy first kill. A giant bat, slain in 3 hits. Took off a bit of health (3/11hp lost), though. I should really use more magic against these things.\n\t\nMore magic! Bah! Miscasting spells is so annoying. Not only does it drain your magical energy, but it contaminates you with magic, and that's not the worst. I've heard it can have other horrible side effects with the more powerful spells.\n\t\nItems, lots of items. I must've hit someone's old and forgotten stash. A mace; three scrolls labeled YCAIWK RIAXACA, DAZUFA SMAWN, and LYJAYPRAUH; a choco, 7 javelins, and enough gold to bring my total to 55.\n\t\nA cyan potion? I wonder what it does. I'll save it for a time when I'm in need of a miracle, though. I wouldn't want to waste a potion of healing or even heal wounds.\n\t\nBATS. JUST BATS. Also another scroll of YCAIWK RIAXACA and another sedimented white potion.\n\t\nA kobold to one side, a rat to the other, two scrolls labeled LYJAYPRAUH to the north-east, and Most of my health (9/11hp). Easy.\n\t\nI feel more powerful (Level 2). I decided to learn the \"Swiftness\" spell from this book I took with me. I only have about a fourth of my health (4/16hp), so I decided to rest up to full.\n\t\nAwesome, I destroyed a goblin with only Shock. Afterwards, I could tell that I was a bit better at casting spells (Conjurations level 2).\n\t\nSwiftness is awesome, if a bit short-lived. But I do feel a bit more hungry every time I use it. Shock, as well. I ate the choko I found ealier and it was quite bland, but I'm not that hungry anymore. I found a scroll of SOTSOZ LIATU as well. Cool.\n\t\nBleh, that choko wasn't very filling. I'll wait a little bit until I can't stand the hunger anymore to eat my bread ration.\n\t\nWEK ETAH FEIME... What language are these scrolls even in?\n\t\n16 silver bolts. These look important. I'll save them for later.\n\t\nThe entire first floor of the dungeon. Now it's time for level 2! ... But first, some bread.\n\n=== Floor Two ===\nAnother cyan potion, and some shiny ring mail. I wish I could wear ring mail, but my tail prevents me... Such is the woe of a Draconian...\n\t\nUrp, that hurt. What is a \"quokka\" anyway? Whatever it is, it's strong enough to kill me. Only floor 2? I thought for sure I could make it farther. Oh well... Ah, everything's fading... Can't focus much longer... goodbye cruel world...\n\t\n=== Gravestone ===\nHERE LIES ARDUOS THE GUSTY OF LOROSIA, THE SECOND LEVEL DRACONIAN. DEATH BY QUOKKA.

Doing these is more work than normal play, though, because I have to stop and take the time to write down all the significant events. [[User:DrSakuyaPhD|DrSakuyaPhD]] 18:05, 31 May 2010 (UTC)"}

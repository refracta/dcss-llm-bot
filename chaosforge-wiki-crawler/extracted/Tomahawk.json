Although somewhat less powerful than javelins, they could be thrown by all characters regardless of size and were still capable of inflicting decent damage.\n\nTomahawks can have the following brands:\n*[[Dispersal (brand)|Dispersal]]\n*[[Poisoned]]\n*[[Silver]]\n*[[Steel]]\n*[[Returning]]\n*[[Exploding]]\n\nTomahawks have a mulch rate of 5%, meaning there is a 1-in-20 chance that they will be destroyed each time the player throws them. Tomahawks branded with exploding or dispersal will always be destroyed on hit.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Characters should pick these up without fail on the first few floors. Having a source of ranged damage output, even an unreliable one, can make a big difference. Softening up inescapable [[adder]]s before engaging them in melee can greatly improve a level 1 or 2 characters' chance of survival. That being said, [[ogre (monster)|ogres]] and [[gnoll (monster)|gnolls]] may still be worth running from - your tomahawks might soften them up first, but it doesn't take many hits from a [[halberd]] or [[giant spiked club]] to take out weak adventurers.\n*Dispersal tomahawks can be very handy for situations where you need an opponent to back off, but remember that you need to deal damage for the brand to trigger. Characters with no Throwing skill may have trouble doing so against enemies with decent [[AC]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

Smaller species whose backgrounds would normally start with [[javelin]]s (such as [[Hunter]]s) were instead given the option of starting with tomahawks.\n\n{{weapons}}\n\n[[Category:Throwing]]"}

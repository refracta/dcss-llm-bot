It will only work on weapons without an existing enchantment.}}\n\n'''Poison Weapon''' was a level 3 [[Charms]]/[[Poison Magic]] spell which temporarily assigned the [[venom]] brand to the unbranded, non-[[artifact]] weapon you are currently wielding. This gives it a 75% chance per strike of [[poison]]ing the target. Multiple strikes will increase the effect, so this spell works best when cast on light, fast weapons.  Unwielding the weapon will cause the brand to be lost.\n\n[[The Shining One]] does not approve of his followers using poisoned weapons.\n\n==History==\nPoison Weapon was removed in [[0.15]]\n\nPrior to [[0.9]], Poison Weapon would not affect blunt weapons.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

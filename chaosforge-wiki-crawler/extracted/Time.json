{"title":"Time","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Time","type":"raw","data":"'''Time''' is a measurement of intervals in which actions take place. In ''Crawl'', time has multiple definitions:\n*'''[[Actions|Action Time]]''': Every action in-game is measured in [[aut]], or '''arbitrary units of time'''. Certain actions may be faster or slower relative to each other; you could perform 2 fast actions in the span of one slow one. This is what the \"Time\" counter in the status bar is measuring.\n*'''[[Turn]]s''': Every command uses up 1 turn, no matter if it was fast or slow (actions like [[autoexplore]] or [[wait|resting]] count as multiple commands). This is used for a few game mechanics (such as [[stealth]]), is the main component in determining [[high score]]s, and the focus of a [[speed_running#low_turn_count|turncount speedrun]]. Turn count can be viewed in the '''%''' screen.\n*'''[[Speed_running#Real Time|Clock Time]]''': How long, in minutes and hours, a game has been running. This is recorded in-game and is measured for [[Speed_running#Real Time|realtime speedruns]]. However, ''Crawl'' is turn-based; monsters won't move and the game won't progress no matter how much clock time passes. Clock time can also be viewed in the '''%''' screen.\n*'''System Time''': The real life time of day, according to the computer/server you're playing on, which progresses even if the game is off. Your game's start and end date are recorded in-game, but like clock time, it doesn't do anything tangible in-game. It is used for discussions relating to the outside world (\"when was a game played?\" and such)."}

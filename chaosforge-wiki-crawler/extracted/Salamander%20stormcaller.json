{"title":"Salamander stormcaller","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Salamander_stormcaller","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Salamander stormcallers''' are unusual pyromancers, summoning flame clouds or hitting you with weak [[fire]] spells, but also chanting for a few rounds to unleash a [[Fire Storm]]. Salamander stormcallers' chant does not need to be continuous; they only need to try to cast Fire Storm at their target three times for it to trigger. They can be found in [[the Vaults]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They are very resilient to fire, and vulnerable to [[cold]].\n*Their Fire Storm spell cuts through much of your fire resistance, so no character can truly ignore its effects. However, it takes them three attempts to cast. During that time, if you can kill or disable the caster, the spell will fizzle. Leaving their [[line of sight]] is also quite effective at negating the spell.\n\n==History==\n*Salamander stormcallers were removed in [[0.19]].\n*They got [[Fire Storm]] instead of [[Chant Fire Storm]] in [[0.18]].\n*Salamander stormcallers were added in [[0.17]]."}

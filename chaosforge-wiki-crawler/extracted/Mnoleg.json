{"title":"Mnoleg","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mnoleg","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Mnoleg''' is a unique [[Pandemonium lord]] and guardian of the glowing [[rune of Zot]]. Although it has unpredictable melee abilities, it's much more likely to try to kill you through its summoned allies. Mnoleg is accompanied by a horde of [[neqoxec]]s, [[cacodemon]]s, and assorted [[list of eyeballs|eyeball-type monsters]] on its floor of [[Pandemonium]], which has dark red floors and yellow walls.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Mnoleg isn't as innately strong as the other Pan lords, but the summons can get out of control. [[Summon Eyeballs]] often creates [[floating eye]]s, which can inflict [[paralysis]]. The other summons are no slouch, either; [[eldritch tentacle]]s inflict [[chaos|chaotic]] attacks, while [[tentacled monstrosities]] can [[constrict]] you in place. Powerful area of effect or piercing attacks are helpful.\n**If you don't have some way of countering floating eyes, be prepared to teleport when you find them.\n*Like all [[demon]]s, [[holy]] and [[holy wrath]] damage are extremely effective. Against Mnoleg, [[silver]] works just as well.\n*Be prepared to be malmutated while in Mnoleg's realm. A source of [[mutation resistance]] is very helpful, if you have one.\n*Mnoleg will be unable to summon eldritch tentacles if you summon one first, via [[Malign Gateway]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Mnoleg's spell set included [[Random Bolt]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Mnoleg was considered male.\n*In [[0.18]], Mnoleg gained [[Call of Chaos]], [[Random Bolt]], and [[Dig]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Mnoleg also had Klown and MR Vulnerability attack flavours.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Mnoleg did not have Klown and MR Vulnerability flavoured attacks, but did have [[Smite]].\n*Prior to [[0.8]], Mnoleg did not have blinking and mutagenic attacks and [[Summon Greater Demon|summoned greater demons]] instead of eyes. He also had less [[HP]].\n*In early versions of the game, Mnoleg came with two [[eldritch tentacle]]s attached to him."}

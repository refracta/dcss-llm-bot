{"title":"Arachne","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Arachne","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Arachne the Weaver''' is a [[unique]] half-spider caster who wields a [[staff of alchemy]], with a small chance of upgrading to the [[staff of Olgreb]]. She blinks around her [[web]]bed domain in combat, and likes to ensnare you in her own webs while she and her [[spider]] allies heavily [[poison]] you.\n\n==Location==\n*[[Spider's Nest]]:2-4\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Her Conjurations can deal absurd amounts of damage, and her constant webbing will reduce your [[ev]]asion to next to nothing. Bring poison resistance to make her significantly less deadly, and a source of [[Repel Missiles#Player sources|RMsl]] can keep you from being disabled for half the fight.\n*The combination of ranged webbing and constant blinking makes her harder to pin down in melee than practically anything else you'll encounter. Melee brutes should try to engage her quickly while heavily buffed, be prepared to teleport away if things start going wrong, and may want to consider avoiding her until they have a powerful ranged attack option to finish her off with.\n*If you brought a [[wand of paralysis]], you can pin Arachne down long enough to kill her. A [[scroll of vulnerability]] will help guarantee success, but is probably unnecessary if you have at least some skill in Evocations; Arachne's willpower isn't insurmountable. Other enchantments such as [[Confusing Touch]] or [[Petrify]] can work equally well.\n*Unlike most monsters found in the [[Spider's Nest]], Arachne has [[poison resistance]] thanks to her staff.\n\n==Trivia==\nAccording to Greek mythology, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachne Arachne] was a mortal weaver whose arrogant pride in her weaving ability caused her to be punished by becoming the first spider.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Arachne will no longer spawn in the [[Spider's Nest]]. Instead, she'll spawn in Vaults:1-4, Elf, and Depths:1, but only in the games without the Spider's Nest branch. Also, she'll get better defenses and become stronger: 3 AC/10 EV -> 9 AC/12 EV, 17 HD -> 23 HD; she'll cast her spells more often. Her [[Ensnare]] will be replaced with [[Greater Ensnare]], and [[Blink]] will be replaced with [[Blink Range]].}}\n*Arachne gained access to the staff of Olgreb as of [[0.14]].\n*Arachne was added in [[0.11]].\n\n[[Category:Arachnid]]"}

It is also amazingly useful for other melee characters so long as you have some means of generating stabbing opportunities: Short Blade-tier stabbing damage multipliers can be massive, and the much higher base damage of heavier weapons can lead to extremely potent blows. A reliable source of [[invisibility]] or [[confusion]], the [[Dazzling Flash]] spell, or distracting allies are all excellent ways to land stabs even if you're wearing noisy armour, though raising your Stealth skill will still significantly improve your stabbing performance.\n\nCasters and ranged fighters certainly don't suffer for wearing this hat, but they may find a hat or helm of [[intelligence]], [[willpower]], or [[see invisible]] more useful.\n\n==History==\n*The hood of the Assassin was introduced in [[0.25]], replacing the old [[boots of the Assassin]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Headgear]]"}

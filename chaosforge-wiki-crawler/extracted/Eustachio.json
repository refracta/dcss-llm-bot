{"title":"Eustachio","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Eustachio","type":"raw","data":"{{version024}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Eustachio the Magnificent''' is a [[unique]] summoner, usually equipped with [[leather armour]] and a [[falchion]] or [[rapier]], either of which may be enchanted or [[brand]]ed. Although he generates alone, he'll quickly summon an army of [[rat]]s, [[bat]]s, [[tier-5 demon|imps]], and [[quasit]]s.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:4-6\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*He likes to surround you with summons and then blink away. When this happens, remember that his summons give no rewards when killed, and avoid getting bogged down trying to chop your way through all of them. Try to kill him first, and his summoned creatures will be dismissed immediately. If you have a [[wand of acid]], consider zapping it right through his summons to take him down from a distance.\n*The best strategy is to lure him past a blind corner and beat him to a pulp without letting him summon anything. This applies even to casters, as his summons may block the line of fire of your most powerful spells. Get in close and nuke him quick.\n*If he's already got a wall of summoned animals around him and you have [[Mephitic Cloud]] available, try to hit as many targets as you can with its blast radius. A crowd of confused targets will tear itself apart quickly enough. His [[demonic]] allies will be immune, however.\n*[[Poison]]ing Eustachio might do enough damage to take him down even if he manages to blink away.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.8]], Eustachio would only appear on D:8-13.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

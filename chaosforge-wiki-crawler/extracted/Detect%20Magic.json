{"title":"Detect Magic","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Detect_Magic","type":"raw","data":"{{Obsolete}}\n\n'''Detect Magic''' was a level 1 [[Divinations]] spell which revealed details about nearby items, such as enchantment bonuses, [[ego]]s, and [[brand]]s. Higher [[spell power]] increased the odds of revealing useful information, as well as how many items were affected. [[Curse]]s were not revealed, however.\n\n==History==\nDetect Magic was removed in [[0.6]] with the removal of the Divinations school of magic.\n\n[[Category:Spells]][[Category:Obsolete spells]][[Category:Divination]][[Category:Level 1 Spells]][[Category:Obsolete]]"}

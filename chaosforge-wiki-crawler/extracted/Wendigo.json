{"title":"Wendigo","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wendigo","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Wendigos''' are found in [[Cocytus]]. Their signature ability is turning nearby [[simulacra]] into blasts of ice, dealing heavy damage. Their secondary spell lets them paralyze you for one turn and deal damage, possibly to blast you with an additional [[seracfall]].\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Paralysis]] for even a single turn can be deadly, especially if there is a group of monsters nearby.\n*[[Seracfall]]s do extreme damage, partially bypass cold resistance and completely ignore your EV score. Wendigos cannot use this lethal spell if no [[simulacrum (monster)|simulacra]] are in your line of sight, so make generous use of [[Ignition]] or other area-of-effect spells to ensure they never share the same screen.\n\n==History==\nWendigos were added in [[0.28]]."}

{"title":"Playing online","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Playing_online","type":"raw","data":"==Playing online==\n\nThere are several servers that host DCSS online, allowing you to play either by browser ([[WebTiles]]) or through [[SSH]]/telnet.\n\nThere are three main benefits to this, especially if you join the IRC Chatroom.\n\n* Other people can watch you play live, and page you with messages and advice (the often ignored \"hit _\" that shows up...)\n* Even if you repeatedly play a single combo, you'll encounter a more fun and diverse bunch of player ghosts to beat up on.\n* You can request replays of any milestone or death you know how to look up. It's great for reviewing where you went wrong, or reliving hilarious moments. \n\n==Servers==\n{| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"margin:0em 0em 1em 0em; width:100%; background-color:white\"\n| style=\"width:50%; vertical-align:top; border:1px solid #CC6600; background-color:#FF9966;\" |\n<div style=\"border-bottom:0px solid #CC6600; background-color:#FF6633; padding:0.2em 0.5em 0.2em 0.5em; font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;\">[[Playing online | Play ''Crawl'' Online Now]]</div>\n<div style=\"border-bottom:0px solid #CC6600; padding:0.4em 1em 1em 1em;\">\n'''North America Servers'''\n*[http://crawl.akrasiac.org:8080/ CAO] - Located in Arizona.

On most modern browsers, such as Chromium, it is a simple process. All you need to do is visit the server's website (linked above), create an account, and start playing. There's no need to enter any personal information, with email being optional for password recovery.\n\n==Console==\nConsole is generally more complex to set up, as you need an [[SSH]] client in order to play. Mac and Linux systems will likely have SSH preinstalled, but to properly play console online in Windows, you're going to have to download a program called [[PuTTY]].\n\nA guide to SSH connection can be found [http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/howto#connecting here]. There is also a [http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/howto list of servers and their SSH keys] right above it.\n\n===Options===\nIf you find yourself lagging, don't forget to enable SSH compression! Don't forget to set NetHack mode to ensure your keyboard works properly!  Note well that this effectively changes what the keypad types, '''meaning the numrow will produce a different password than the keypad''' (for logging in to play once connected to CAO).  One thing that guide doesn't mention is that you can \"Disable Application keypad mode\" under Terminal->Features. This allows you to use +-=/ to cycle targets. There's currently no working fix for allowing the numpad 5 to long rest. The only current method to perform a long rest online is by pressing numROW five.\n\nA lot of people like to change their character sets to produce more 'solid' walls, and portals/shops that no longer look like wands/staves. All you need to do this is add the following line to your options \"char_set = IBM\" and change putty's character set to CP437 under Window->Translation->Received data assumed to be in which character set.\n\nOn Gnome and KDE desktops, and other terminals supporting UTF-8, you can use \"char_set = unicode\" to enable it, resulting in nicer graphics.\n\nYou may also want to configure your terminal color palette to match the \"official one\" of the tiles version.\nThe colors to set are:\n<pre>\n    VColour(  0,   0,   0), // BLACK\n    VColour(  0,  82, 255), // BLUE\n    VColour(100, 185,  70), // GREEN\n    VColour(  0, 180, 180), // CYAN\n    VColour(255,  48,   0), // RED\n    VColour(238,  92, 238), // MAGENTA\n    VColour(165,  91,   0), // BROWN\n    VColour(162, 162, 162), // LIGHTGREY\n    VColour( 82,  82,  82), // DARKGREY\n    VColour( 82, 102, 255), // LIGHTBLUE\n    VColour( 82, 255,  82), // LIGHTGREEN\n    VColour( 82, 255, 255), // LIGHTCYAN\n    VColour(255,  82,  82), // LIGHTRED\n    VColour(255,  82, 255), // LIGHTMAGENTA\n    VColour(255, 255,  82), // YELLOW\n    VColour(255, 255, 255)  // WHITE\n</pre>\n\nFor PUTTY:\n<pre>\n    RGB(  0,   0,   0), // ANSI BLACK\n    RGB(  0,  82, 255), // ANSI BLUE\n    RGB(100, 185,  70), // ANSI GREEN\n    RGB(  0, 180, 180), // ANSI CYAN\n    RGB(255,  48,   0), // ANSI RED\n    RGB(238,  92, 238), // ANSI MAGENTA\n    RGB(165,  91,   0), // ANSI YELLOW\n    RGB(162, 162, 162), // ANSI WHITE\n    RGB( 82,  82,  82), // ANSI BLACK BOLD\n    RGB( 82, 102, 255), // ANSI BLUE BOLD\n    RGB( 82, 255,  82), // ANSI GREEN BOLD\n    RGB( 82, 255, 255), // ANSI CYAN BOLD\n    RGB(255,  82,  82), // ANSI RED BOLD\n    RGB(255,  82, 255), // ANSI MAGENTA BOLD\n    RGB(255, 255,  82), // ANSI YELLOW BOLD\n    RGB(255, 255, 255)  // ANSI WHITE BOLD\n</pre>\n\n[[Category:Community]]"}

While the stats are helpful, for most characters, they aren't ''that'' impactful. Any character may prefer an armour with higher defense and/or resistances. Casters in particular will likely prefer a [[robe of the Archmagi]], for its larger spellpower boost. But in any case, it's better than plain robes and [[ring mail]]s.\n\nDexterity/[[Dodging]]-focused characters arguably get the most from this robe, due to how dexterity scales. The higher your Dodging skill, the more EV you get per point of dexterity. A character with 25 Dodging will get +4 EV, in addition to extra [[SH]] and weapon damage. That being said, by the time you reach 25 Dodging, you might find a [[randart]] with better overall defense.\n\nThis artefact is more likely to spawn in the early game, where it is more likely to be useful (and less likely for you to find alternatives).\n\n==History==\n*This item was made more explicitly likely to spawn in the early-game in [[0.28]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

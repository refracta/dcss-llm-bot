You'll then gain 750 skill XP per experience level, divided by [[skill point#Specific Mechanics|a number depending on your total XP gained]]. For example, drinking the potion at XL 20 and 80% to the next level would make you XL 21, 80% of the way to level 22, gaining 750 Ã— 20 (15,000) skill XP before division in the process.\n\nThis skill experience can be divided among any of your currently trainable skills. Much like the manual skill training screen, you can choose the distribution; XP is split evenly between all available skills, though you can focus a skill to receive a double portion.\n\nThe XP level gained from a Potion of experience counts towards restoring a [[Felid]]'s extra lives, but only if they are below XP level 27.\n\nIf you are under penance from [[Hepliaklqana]], this potion counts as 750*XL XP toward mollifying them.<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|potion.cc|524}}</ref>\n\n{{crawlquote|Below level 27: ''You feel more experienced!''<br>At level 27: ''A flood of memories washes over you.''}}\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile extremely rare in the Dungeon proper, potions of experience are not uncommon in [[Ziggurat]]s, and may rarely appear as loot at the end of some vaults and timed [[portal]]s. If you ''do'' come across one in the early game, it is common practice to drink it immediately; you'll have an absurd power boost, which will improve your survival greatly. Low-level characters can quickly gain multiple skill levels instantly, while high-level characters will see almost negligible skill returns.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"400px\" heights=\"400px\" class=\"left\" mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:SampleScreenForPotionOfExperience.jpg|thumb|left|When quaffing a potion of experience, you'll be taken to a screen that looks something like this.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{potions}}"}

Knowing this spell allows the learner to memorise Fireball for no additional spell levels.}}\n\n'''Delayed Fireball''' is a level 7 [[Conjurations]]/[[Fire Magic]] spell which grants you the [[ability]] to launch a [[Fireball]] spell instantaneously and for no cost later on. Only one fireball can be stored at a time. The charged fireball persists indefinitely, even if the spell itself is forgotten. The fireball is lost if you drink a [[potion of cancellation]] or are hit with a [[Quicksilver Bolt]].\n\nIf you have already learned Fireball, then learning Delayed Fireball only costs 2 spell levels. Conversely, if you learn Delayed Fireball, then Fireball costs no spell levels.\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile Delayed Fireball is a level 7 spell that's only as strong as a regular Fireball, it can be cast outside of battle. Once you've learned the spell, you should ''always'' have one on hand, and you shouldn't be afraid to unleash it. Don't worry about the MP cost or high failure rate, since you can just rest after each (mis)cast. It still has [[food]] costs, but a [[staff of energy]] can eliminate that.\n\nCasting this spell mid-combat is a terrible idea (just use regular Fireball instead), so get into the habit of restoring it whenever you're between encounters.\n\n==History==\n*Delayed Fireball was removed in [[0.20]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

They take 5 turns to equip or remove, and can be [[scroll of enchant armour|enchanted]] up to +2. [[Scarves]] take the same slot and have useful properties, but provide less physical protection than a cloak; see their article for more details.\n\n==Egos==\nCloaks can normally have the following [[ego]]s: \n*'''[[Poison resistance]]:''' Grants poison resistance\n*'''[[Willpower]]:''' Grants +40 willpower\n*'''[[Stealth]]:''' Grants +50 stealth\n*'''[[Preservation]]:''' Grants [[Acid#Corrosion|corrosion resistance]]\n\nThese are only found in [[Ice Cave]]s and [[Volcano]]es, respectively:\n*'''[[Cold resistance]]:''' Grants cold resistance\n*'''[[Fire resistance]]:''' Grants fire resistance\n\n==Strategy==\nLooking for a cloak early on? If you come across (and can kill) [[Crazy Yiuf]], he's guaranteed to come with a cloak. It might even have an ego! Other uniques, including [[Maurice]] and [[Nikola]], are also guaranteed to wear cloaks.\n\nIf you still need a good cloak in the late game, [[the Realm of Zot]] can be a good place to search. Many [[list of draconians|draconians]] will generate with cloaks, increasing your chances of finding one with a decent ego and enchantment. [[Tiamat]] will always have the +4 [[dragonskin cloak]], if you can take her down.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], cloaks could generate with [[invisibility (ego)|invisibility]], but not with [[stealth]] or [[preservation]].\n*[[Scarves]] were added in [[0.20]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], all cloaks provided some protection against [[acid]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], the invisibility ego was called the Darkness ego.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the [[preservation]] ego could be found on cloaks. This ego was removed along with [[item destruction]] and permanent [[corrosion]] effects.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], [[racial equipment|racial variant]] cloaks existed. Also, wearing a cloak meant you had to take it off in order to change [[body armour]]; among other things, this meant that wearing a [[curse]]d cloak prevented you from taking off your body armour.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Cloak1_leather.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Cloak2.png]] or [[File:Cloak3.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Cloak4.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]] Cloaks\n|-\n| '''[[Cloak of the Thief]]''' || [[File:Urand thief.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Cloak of Starlight]]''' || [[File:Urand starlight.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Dragonskin cloak]]''' || [[File:New dragonskin.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Ratskin cloak]]''' || [[File:New ratskin cloak.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Cloaks]]"}

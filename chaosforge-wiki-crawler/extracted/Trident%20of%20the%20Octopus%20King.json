Luckily, he seems to be in no hurry to get it back.}}\n[[File:Trident_of_the_octopus_king.png]] '''''the +8 trident of the Octopus King'''''\n\n+8 [[trident]]\n\n[[Venom]] [[brand]]<br>\n[[Electricity resistance|rElec]]<br>\n[[Poison resistance|rPois]]\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''trident of the Octopus King'''<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|art-data.txt|595}}</ref> is a solid early-game weapon: it carries a decent brand, two useful resistances, and a high enchantment. Unfortunately, its damage output is a little low for the late game, especially considering the number of enemies with poison resistance and/or high HP later on. It might be a decent swap item if you suddenly find yourself in dire need of [[electricity resistance|electricity]] or [[poison resistance]], but most Polearm specialists will want to upgrade to a stronger weapon with a more powerful brand around the mid-game.\n\nAlthough it's unlikely to make a major difference, each [[ring of the Octopus King]] you wear while wielding this trident increases its enchantment by +2, up to a theoretical (but extraordinarily difficult to achieve) maximum of +24.<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|art-func.h|1148}}</ref>\n\nThis artefact is more likely to spawn in the early game, where it is more likely to be useful.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the trident of the Octopus King provided +40 [[willpower]] and was not weighted to appear early on.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the bonus from the rings of the Octopus King was +1 each. \n*Prior to [[0.15]], the trident of the Octopus King had an enchantment of +10, +4, and rings of the Octopus King had no effect upon it.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Polearms]]"}

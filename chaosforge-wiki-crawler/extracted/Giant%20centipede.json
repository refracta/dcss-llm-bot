Physically weak, it relies on its nasty poison to dispatch its victims.\n----\n“Traffickers in the Black Meat, flesh of the giant black centipede—sometimes attaining a length of six feet—found in a lane of black rocks and iridescent, brown lagoons, exhibit paralyzed crustaceans in camouflage pockets of the Plaza visible only to the Meat Eaters.”<br>\n-William S. Burroughs, _Naked Lunch_. 1959}}\n\n<!--monster-bot-end-->\n\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Giant centipede'''s are weak (but fast) vermin with a potent [[poison]] sting. They are found in the mid-[[Dungeon]] and [[the Lair]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nIf they land a few lucky hits, they can inflict a fair amount of poison. In practice, however, only the flimsiest of spellcasters are at risk and only if they are caught off guard, as giant centipedes are exceptionally weak by the time you generally see them. [[Poison resistance]] renders them even more harmless than usual.\n\n==History==\nGiant centipedes were removed in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

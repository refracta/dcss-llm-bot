This ignores [[EV]] and has a 50% chance of [[slow]]ing [[cold blooded]] targets.\n\nHowever, for each monster hurt by this spell, the damage is reduced for every creature (player or monster) that is directly adjacent to said monster:<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-damage.cc|684}}</ref>\n*One adjacent creature to target: 70% damage\n*Two or more adjacent creatures to target: 40% damage\n\n==Strategy==\nThis spell is a room-wide spell that is also decent at taking down single targets. It has full range and never misses, which are useful traits for any spell.\n\nAgainst a large, widely spaced group, you'll be doing about 30 damage to every monster in your line of sight. Teleported inside Elf:3's final vault? 4 OR casts later, it is mostly empty. A room full of [[boggart]]s? Easy. The adjacent creature penalty is harsh, but multiple casts will kill the weaker creatures.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*This spell can be used as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, [[Freezing Cloud]]. The latter is an area spell that works better against cramped enemies.\n*Casting Ozocubu's Refrigeration in quick succession takes a lot of MP. You may want to keep up the pressure with the aid of [[potions of magic]], MP restoration on kills from [[The Shining One]] or [[Vehumet]], or [[Sif Muna]]'s Channel Magic.\n*This spell will hurt your [[allies]] if they aren't immune to cold.\n**Note that [[lightning spire]]s, [[spellforged servitor]]s, and derived undead ([[zombie]]s, [[spectral thing]]s, [[simulacra]]) will not become hostile when attacked.\n*A way to move adjacent monsters away from you is helpful; spells like [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] make sure that you don't penalize Refrigeration's damage.\n*This spell has an ironic synergy with a [[scroll of immolation]], which helps negate this spell's \"adjacent enemies\" penalty. The [[Inner Flame|inner flame]] enchantment creates a flame [[cloud]] on every enemy you hit. This increases damage output, allowing OR to deal more against a clump of enemies, Then, once you kill an enemy, the immolation will start a chain reaction, wiping out the rest of the pack.\n\n==Quality of Life improvements==\nThe screen will flash blue every time you cast OR. Over time, that may seriously reduce the joy of using this spell. Fortunately, there is a setting you can add to your .rc file that will block all player animations (not just of OR...):\n\n<code>use_animations -= player</code>\n\n==Monster Version==\nThe version of the spell used by monsters functions in much the same way.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|allies will no longer count for the adjacent creatures penalty.}}\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Ozocubu's Refrigeration had harsher penalties for adjacent targets; it was reduced to 66% with 1 adjacent target, and 33% with 2.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Ozocubu's Refrigeration did not have a penalty when creatures were adjacent to each other, but prevented the player from drinking potions for 7-15 turns. It also dealt less damage (<code>4d(5 + power/10)</code>), but did not check [[AC]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Ozocubu's Refrigeration was a level 6 spell.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Ozocubu's Refrigeration dealt 25% less damage on-average and would also harm the caster.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], this spell would not temporarily disable potions, but did have a tendency to [[item destruction|destroy]] them.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Ozocubu's Refrigeration did not anger allies and did not wake up [[sleep]]ing monsters.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

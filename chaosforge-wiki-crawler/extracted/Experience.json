For the defunct card, see the article [[Experience card]]. For the potion, see the article [[Potion of experience]].''\n\n'''Experience''' ('''XP''') is earned when defeating monsters; stronger monsters are worth more. Gaining XP increases your [[#Expereince Level|experience level]], and grants [[skill]] levels.\n\n==Experience Level==\nWhen you have gained enough XP, your character rises to the next experience level and receives various benefits. Leveling up increases the following:\n*Total [[hit points]].\n*Total [[magic points]].\n*Total number of [[spell]]s that can be memorised.\n*The maximum spell level that can be learned (no character can memorize a spell whose level is higher than their own).\n*Stats. At level 3 and every six levels thereafter, most characters may add 2 points to their [[strength]], [[intelligence]], or [[dexterity]], as they choose. [[Demigod]]s get 4 stat points every third level. Also, most characters gain additional stat bonuses every few levels (which stats increase and how often depends on their [[species]]).\n*[[Willpower]]. Characters gain points of will at each level, the number depending on their race.\n*Characters of certain races will gain special abilities (see Maturity below).\n\nEvery character starts at experience level 1 with no XP, reflecting a total lack of knowledge of the Dungeon. The maximum level is 27, but characters who have reached this can still use XP to improve their [[score|final score]] and their skills.\n\nDifferent species require proportionally more or less experience to gain experience levels, as shown in the in-game documentation:\n{{#invoke:Apt|skill_table|Experience}}\n\nNote that a higher score translates into faster levelings; [[Djinni|Djinn]], [[Formicid]]s and [[Kobold]]s level the fastest (with an experience aptitude of 1), while [[Demigod]]s level the slowest (with an experience aptitude of -2).\n\n===Experience Required===\nThe following table assumes an experience aptitude of 0:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\" | Level \n! scope=\"col\" width=\"25%\" | XP\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"25%\" | Diff.\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"35%\" | Increase in diff.\n|-\n| 1     ||      0   ||     0   ||    0\n|-\n| 2     ||     10   ||    10   ||   10\n|-\n| 3     ||     30   ||    20   ||   10\n|-\n| 4     ||     70   ||    40   ||   20\n|-\n| 5     ||    140   ||    70   ||   30\n|-\n| 6     ||    270   ||   130   ||   60\n|-\n| 7     ||    520   ||   250   ||  120\n|-\n| 8     ||   1010   ||   490   ||  240\n|-\n| 9     ||   1980   ||   970   ||  480\n|-\n| 10    ||   3910   ||  1930   ||  960\n|-\n| 11    ||   7760   ||  3850   || 1920\n|-\n| 12    ||  15450   ||  7690   || 3840\n|-\n| 13    ||  29000   || 13550   || 5860\n|-\n| 14    ||  48500   || 19500   || 5950\n|-\n| 15    ||  74000   || 25500   || 6000\n|-\n| 16    || 105500   || 31500   || 6000\n|-\n| 17    || 143000   || 37500   || 6000\n|-\n| 18    || 186500   || 43500   || 6000\n|-\n| 19    || 236000   || 49500   || 6000\n|-\n| 20    || 291500   || 55500   || 6000\n|-\n| 21    || 353000   || 61500   || 6000\n|-\n| 22    || 420500   || 67500   || 6000\n|-\n| 23    || 494000   || 73500   || 6000\n|-\n| 24    || 573500   || 79500   || 6000\n|-\n| 25    || 659000   || 85500   || 6000\n|-\n| 26    || 750500   || 91500   || 6000\n|-\n| 27    || 848000   || 97500   || 6000\n|}\n\n==Maturity==\nCertain species 'mature' as they gain experience, gaining special bonuses or abilities:\n\n*[[Naga]]s and [[Draconian]]s get tougher scales every 3 levels, increasing their AC.\n*[[Draconian]]s begin as juveniles, and become adults at level 7. Some colors also gain further benefits at level 14.\n*[[Naga]]s gain the ability to [[constrict]] foes at level 13.\n*[[Felid]]s get thicker fur at levels 6 and 12, increasing their AC and giving them cold resistance (rC+) at level 12.\n**[[Felid]]s also gain an extra life every three levels, but can hold no more than two at once. After losing one of those two, they can get one of the \"overflow\" lives upon gaining a level which would not otherwise have awarded an extra life.\n*[[Demonspawn]] acquire more of their [[demonspawn mutations|demonic ancestry]] as they level up. This comes in the form of [[mutation]]s, and Demonspawn can acquire special mutations unavailable to other species.\n*[[Djinn]] gain spells every 2 levels.\n*[[Tengu]] gain the ability to fly and an EV bonus at level 7.\n*[[Mummies]] gain their second bonus to [[Necromancy]] [[spell power]] at level 13.\n*[[Vampire]]s may transform into [[Bat Form|bats]] at level 3.\n*[[Gargoyles]] gain incremental AC bonuses, and also gain the ability to fly permanently at level 14.\n*[[Vine Stalker]]s upgrade from [[Good mutations#Fangs|Fangs]] 2 to Fangs 3 at level 8.\n*[[Barachim]] upgrade from [[Good mutations#Strong Legs|Strong Legs]] 1 to Strong Legs 2 at level 13.\n*[[Coglin]]s can invent a [[Coglin#Invent Gizmo|gizmo]] at level 14.\n\n==Skill Experience==\n''See also: [[Skill point]]''\n\nOn top of contributing to your character level, any XP gain also contributes to your [[skill]] levels. There are two methods available to control distribution: automatic or manual. In automatic mode, every time you gain experience, it is distributed between all the skills which you have used lately, with the most commonly used ones getting proportionally bigger shares. On top of that, you can set skills to \"Disabled\" (they receive no XP), \"Enabled\" (no change), or \"Focused\" (the skill gets a guaranteed share of the XP on top of what it receives through practice).\n\nAlternatively, there is manual mode. Here, XP is divided into equal shares between all skills. Again, you can set skills to be Disabled for no growth or Focused for double ordinary growth.\n\nThe maximum level for each skill is 27, but many skills suffer from diminishing returns, so it may not be worth raising a skill to the maximum.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], [[Beogh]]'s orcs could steal up to 50% of XP from the player depending on how much damage they did to a monster compared to how much damage the player dealt.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], all allies took a share of your XP. You would gain a single stat point every 3 levels. Player-[[frenzied]] monsters also did not give XP. Also, the experience cost of high-level skills was higher. Late-game monsters provided more XP.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], [[draining]] reduced the player's experience level, and most high level monsters gave much more experience points when killed.\n*In version [[0.9]], new skills (before they reached level 1) had to be actively used (casting a spell, hitting something, etc.) to start applying experience to it. Once the skill had reached 1.0, it could thenceforth be disabled or focused manually.\n*In version [[0.8]] and earlier, skill experience was dumped into an \"experience pool\" until assigned to a skill. This was done in small increments by repeatedly performing actions relating to the skill. This led to the custom of \"victory dancing\" after fights to guarantee the XP went to the desired skill. Skills could be \"disabled\" to reduce their growth to 25% of normal.\n\n[[Category:Stats]]\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

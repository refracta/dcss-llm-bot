{"title":"Ironbound preserver","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ironbound_preserver","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ironbound preservers''' are durable enemy support fighters that take damage in place of their allies. This makes it more difficult to kill dangerous-yet-flimsy opponents first. Coupled with their ability to heal themselves, their presence can significantly lengthen battles with groups of foes. They can be found in [[the Vaults]], usually accompanying bands of [[deep troll]]s, [[list of deep elves|deep elves]], [[orc]]s, or [[ogre (monster)|ogres]], and often supporting a [[vault warden]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Injury Bond causes its allies to take half damage, redirecting HP loss to itself; this effectively doubles the HP of anything around it. Try to kill the preserver first. Using area-of-effect on a large group will quickly damage the preserver.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], this enemy was known as the '''ironheart preserver'''.\n*Ironheart preservers were added to the game in [[0.12]].\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

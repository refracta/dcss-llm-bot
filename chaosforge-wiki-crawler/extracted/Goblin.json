{"title":"Goblin","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Goblin","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Goblins''' are one of the first humanoid monsters you can find. Fresh, D:1 characters may have problems against them. Goblins generate with either a [[club]] or [[dagger]], though they can pick up other items from the ground. Starting from D:2, goblins have a 1/12 chance to spawn with a [[sling]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Goblins are stronger than the likes of [[kobold (monster)|kobolds]] and [[rat]]s. If you have a choice, avoid fighting a goblin as your first enemy - try to get XP from easier prey, first.\n*Pay attention to their equipment. A wandering goblin can pick up items that you haven't seen from the floor. They could be wielding a dagger of [[electrocution]] or a [[sling]]. Even the likes of [[scale mail]] can turn goblins into a much greater threat (for a D:1 enemy).\n*If you find a mass of goblins and [[hobgoblin]]s on D:2-4, it's likely that [[Robin]] is around.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], the hidden weapon penalties for monsters were removed, so all monsters now attack faster and hit harder with weapons. To compensate, goblins' base damage was nerfed (4 -> 1), though they always generate with a weapon.\n\n[[Category:Goblin]]"}

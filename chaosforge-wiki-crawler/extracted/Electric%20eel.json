{"title":"Electric eel","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Electric_eel","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Electric eels''' are a dangerous aquatic creature that attacks from afar using bolts of [[electricity]]. They are often encountered in the watery areas of [[the Dungeon]] and [[the Lair]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Simply charging at electric eels is unwise. Their Electrical Bolt deals significant damage, ignores 1/2 of your AC, can bounce off of walls to [[doublezap|hit you twice]]. It's rare to have rElec this early in the game, and they often appear in small groups.\n*Eels cannot traverse outside water, and like all monsters, cannot attack when outside your [[line of sight]]. So, by keeping the eel at the edge of your LOS, you can safely pelt it with ranged attacks. If the fight goes poorly, retreat - it can't chase you on land.\n*Certain [[wand]]s are particularly effective against electric eels:\n**[[Wand of flame]]: When a wand of flame passes over water, it creates damaging [[steam]] clouds. Eels don't have much HP, so the steam alone is often enough to kill the eel outright.\n**[[Wand of mindburst]]: Often deals enough damage to kill an eel, even at 0 Evocations skill.\n**[[Wand of polymorph]]: Won't kill, but they can turn eels into other [[amphibious]] monsters.\n:The other wands are effective, but you'll usually want to save them for a target more important than an electric eel.\n*If all else, just walk away. Eels can't leave water, so you can [[exclude]] any tile near water to avoid fighting eels. If you're caught out in the open, a [[scroll of fog]] or [[scroll of fear]] can give time to escape.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.6]], these monsters were called electric'''al''' eels. This was simply a misnomer."}

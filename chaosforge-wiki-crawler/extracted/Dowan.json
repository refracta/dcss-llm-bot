{"title":"Dowan","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dowan","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | deep elves}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Dowan, Brother of [[Duvessa]]''' is one of a pair of twin [[elf]] [[unique]]s that hunt through the [[Dungeon]] as a team, always encountered together. On their own, Dowan is a mediocre magician, while his sister is a somewhat competent fighter. Together, they are no joke, and killing one will buff the other.\n\nWhen Duvessa is killed, Dowan improves his spell set and gains a permanent [[haste]] effect.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:4-7\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n{{monster spells|Dowan (enraged)}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Neither Dowan nor Duvessa will follow you up or down [[stairs]] unless their sibling is adjacent to you too (in which case they both will) or their sibling is dead. However, you can drop one of them down a shaft without the other being able to follow.\n*Consider wearing them both down before killing either one. The survivor will still be near death even after they become more powerful.\n*Dowan's upgraded spell list is very dangerous, but he has much less staying power than a berserk Duvessa. \n**If you have the choice, it's nice to have [[cold resistance]] (to lower Throw Icicle's damage) if you want to kill Duvessa first.\n**Unlike berserk, Dowan's haste can be removed (permanently) by a [[wand of quicksilver]]. \n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Dowan's haste was not permanent, but he had the [[Haste]] spell. An enraged Dowan would immediately be hasted on sight, but it could wear out (forcing the spell to be cast again).\n\n[[category:Elf]]"}

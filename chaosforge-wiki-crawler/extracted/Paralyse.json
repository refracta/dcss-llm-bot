{"title":"Paralyse","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Paralyse","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Prevents a creature from taking any action for a short time.}}\n\n'''Paralyse''' is a monster-only spell which attempts to induce [[paralysis]] for 2-5 turns, rendering you unable to act for the duration. Your [[SH]] is set to 0, and [[EV]] set to near 0. After being paralysed, the player gets a brief period of immunity to paralysis (1-3 turns).\n\n[[Formicid]]s are completely immune to paralysis. For other species, the spell can be resisted by [[willpower]]. \n\nNote that the [[Paralysis Gaze|paralytic gaze]] of [[floating eye]]s does not work the same way as this spell; their gaze does not require line of fire and does not check willpower.\n\n==Monsters==\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nPlayers (and other monsters) can replicate the spell with a [[wand of paralysis]]. Your power (before stepdown) is <code>15 + 3.5 * [[Evocations]]</code>.\n\n===Spellpower===\nLike most Hexes, monsters cast Paralyse with <code>4 * [[HD]]</code> [[spellpower]]. After applying a [[Willpower#Enchantment power|stepdown function]], it is compared to your willpower. If your willpower is 99 points greater than power, you are immune to that monster's paralyse. If your will is equal the power, there's a 50% chance of resisting.\n\n==Strategy==\nParalysis has the potential to be ''extremely'' dangerous; it should be treated as [[instant death]]. Many monsters can kill you - just on their own - with 5 turns of action. For example, [[orc sorcerer]]s can deal 3d17 damage per turn, or up to 270 damage over 5 turns. With a group of monsters, the chance of survival decreases exponentially.\n\nParalyse works like any regular Hexes spell. The following tricks can be used against it:\n*It requires a line of fire to hex you. Hiding behind other monsters works. Any means of obstructing [[line of sight]] also prevents the spell from being cast.\n*Monsters can't cast spells while [[silence]]d. While expending a [[scroll of silence]] for every paralysing monster is prohibitively expensive, it can work in a pinch. A [[phial of floods]] can [[waterlog]] monsters (except [[dread lich]]es and demons) to the same effect.\n*[[Willpower]] - though it takes high willpower to reach 0% success. Your [[XL]] and [[species]] matters - don't think you're safe because you have \"Will+++\". See below table for details.\n**In [[Tartarus]], where dread liches and [[Ereshkigal]] reside, having enough willpower is outright impossible. Tartarus halves willpower.\n*Having other [[allies]] around. Allies can still fight while you're paralysed. Plus, monsters will often target allies over you. Of course, this isn't an infallible means of protection.\n{{Paralysis Spell Table}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], paralysis lasted for 2-7 turns.\n*Prior to their removal in [[0.18]], you could wear an [[amulet of stasis]] to block paralysis.\n*Prior to [[0.4]], Paralyse was available to players as a level 4 [[Enchantments]] spell. It was removed in favor of [[Petrify]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

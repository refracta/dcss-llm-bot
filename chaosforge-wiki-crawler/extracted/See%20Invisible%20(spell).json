For the character trait, see [[See invisible]].''\n\n{{Spell\n|name=See Invisible\n|level=4\n|school1={{Charms}}\n|school2=\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n* [[Book of Enchantments]]\n</div>\n|castingnoise=3\n|spellnoise=0\n}}\n{{Flavour|This spell enables the caster to perceive things that are shielded from ordinary sight.}}\n\n'''See Invisible''' is a level 4 [[Charms]] spell that grants the caster the [[see invisible]] intrinsic, allowing you to see [[invisible]] enemies (as well as yourself, negating the penalties associated with being unable to see your own body).\n\n{{crawlquote|Spell cast: ''Your vision seems to sharpen.''<br>\nSpell nearly concluded: ''You begin to squint at shadows.''<br>\nSpell concluded: ''Your eyesight blurs momentarily.''}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nWearing a [[ring of see invisible]] is usually more convenient, as it takes just about as much time to switch to it and there isn't any chance of a miscast or it wearing off mid-fight. However, if you haven't found a ring yet (or are already wearing two rings that are absolutely vital to your survival), this spell can help against pesky invisible critters like [[unseen horror]]s or [[ghost moth]]s.\n\n[[Felid]]s, [[naga]]s, [[spriggan]]s, and [[vampire]]s can see invisible naturally, as can any character with the [[Acute Vision]] [[mutation]]. This spell serves no purpose for these characters.\n\n==History==\nSee Invisible was removed in [[0.12]].\n\nPrior to the removal of the [[Divinations]] spell school in [[0.6]], this spell was an [[Enchantments]]/[[Divinations]] spell.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

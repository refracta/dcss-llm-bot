{"title":"Hoarfrost Cannonade","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hoarfrost_Cannonade","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{stub}}\n{{spell info}} \n'''Hoarfrost Cannonade''' is a level 5 [[Ice Magic|Ice]]/[[Alchemy]] spell that constructs 2 [[hoarfrost cannon]]s near the caster, which are stationary turrets that fire long-range [[Frozen|freezing]] projectiles each turn.\n\nThe cannons lose a portion of their HP with each shot they take. If they last long enough to shoot 5 times, their 5th shot will explode in a 3x3 area for increased damage that ignores allies.\n\nThe cannons count as allies, so followers of [[Okawaru]] cannot use this spell. When they are destroyed or dismissed for any reason, they will leave behind a pool of [[shallow water]].\n\n==Useful Info==\n\n==Strategy==\n\n==History==\n*This spell was added in [[0.32]]. An earlier revision of this was a level 7 Alchemy/Earth spell known as '''Seismic Cannonade'''.

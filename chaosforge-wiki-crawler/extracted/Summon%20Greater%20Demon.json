For players, Tier 1 demons would eventually turn hostile, while Tier 2 demons had a chance to turn hostile. Also, many of the [[Hell]] lords and unique [[pan]] lords cast Summon Greater Demon instead of a specific, themed summoning spell.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], this spell only summoned Tier 1 demons.  However, at the time the category included many demons that are now classified as Tier 2, such as balrugs and cacodemons.  This meant that every summon would eventually turn hostile."}

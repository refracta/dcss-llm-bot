{"title":"Blade card","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Blade_card","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{Flavour |  The card depicts a great sword, protruding from the back of a corpse in the middle of a battlefield.}}\nThe Blade card will provide the player with a cleaving effect with their current weapon, striking all targets adjacent to the player similar to using an [[Axe]]. This will not stack with the reaching effect of [[Polearm]]s, nor does it provide any additional benefit for [[Axes]]. This also works with [[unarmed]] attacks.\n\nThis is applied as a [[status effect]] with duration scaling versus card power level, so the player may switch weapons and retain the cleave until the effect expires.\n\n{{crawlquote|Your <weapon> looks oddly sharp.}}\n\n==History==\n*The Blade card was removed when decks were simplified in [[0.19]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], drawing the Blade card would instead:\n**Power level 0: Temporarily apply one of the following brands to the player's weapon: [[Flaming]], [[Freezing]], [[Venom]], [[Draining]], [[Vorpal]].\n**Power level 1: Temporarily apply one of the following brands to the player's weapon: [[Distortion]], [[Pain (brand)|Pain]], [[Antimagic]], [[Chaos]], [[Electrocution]].\n**Power level 2: [[Tukima's Dance|Animate]] the player's weapon.\n\nThe Blade card could be found in the following [[Decks|decks]] over the past several versions.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.11]]\n![[0.12]]\n![[0.13]]\n![[0.14]]\n![[0.15]]\n![[0.16]]\n![[0.17]]\n![[0.18]]\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n|----\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

Its damage is strongly reduced by armour.}}\n\nA '''wand of scattershot''' fires a volley of metal fragments in a range 5 cone. The damage for each projectile is 9d1 to 9d5 and the number of projectiles ranges from 4 to 14; damage and quantity of projectiles improve with [[evocations]] skill.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Most of the fragments will hit the targeted space, but there is a certain amount of spread which increases as you train evocations. If you're trying to primarily target a single creature, fire at them when they're closer (preferably melee range) to improve your odds of hitting them.\n*Because damage reduction from AC is calculated for each projectile separately, wands of scattershot work best against creatures with low [[AC]] and are generally ineffective against high-AC targets. Good targets include [[list of ogres|ogres]], [[list of jellies|jellies]], or [[hydra]]s. If you're fighting anything wearing armour, you may wish to use a different wand.\n\n==History==\n*Wands of scattershot were removed in [[0.25]], replaced by the [[tin of tremorstones]].\n*Prior to [[0.24]], monsters couldn't use this wand.\n*Wands of scattershot were added in [[0.20]], replacing [[iron rod]]s.\n\n{{wands}}"}

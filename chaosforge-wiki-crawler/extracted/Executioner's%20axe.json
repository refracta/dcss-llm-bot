It is a two handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''executioner's axe''' is a massive two-handed weapon. It is the strongest axe, and one of the strongest weapons in the game. Unfortunately, they are quite rare, and take a high amount of skill to reach mindelay.\n\nLike all axes, this weapon allows the player to [[cleave]].\n\n==Strategy==\nExecutioner's axes aren't common weapons. Other than [[Trog]] and [[Okawaru]] gifts, they can occasionally be found in the [[Elven_Halls#Elf:2 - The Hall of Blades|Hall of Blades]], or in the [[Pandemonium]] (from [[list of demonspawn|demonspawn]] opponents). \n\nIf you haven't found one, don't fret. A [[broad axe]] or [[battleaxe]] are still good weapons; both are capable of winning the game.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Executioner axe1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Executioner axe2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Executioner axe3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandarts|Unrandart]]<br>executioner's axe\n|-\n| '''\"[[Frostbite]]\"''' || [[File:Frostbite.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the executioner's axes' mindelay was reached at 26 skill (base delay of 20).\n*Prior to [[0.12]], executioner's axes had 20 base damage and no [[cleaving]].\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Axes]]"}

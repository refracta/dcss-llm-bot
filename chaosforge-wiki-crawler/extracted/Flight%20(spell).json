Unlike some sources of flying, you may cast Flight at any time during its duration to extend it. The higher your [[spell power]], the longer your flight will last.\n\n==Strategy==\nFlight is generally a useful spell to have, particularly in waterlogged branches such as [[the Swamp]], [[the Shoals]], [[the Abyss]], and [[Cocytus]]. Exploration of those areas is much easier when you aren't splashing around in [[shallow water]] or forced to find a way past [[deep water]] and [[lava]]. It also makes many smaller treasure [[vault]]s accessible, or at least much more convenient to reach.\n\nBeyond that, it greatly reduces damage from [[Shatter]], but renders you vulnerable to [[Airstrike]], so be mindful of spellcasters who know those.\n\nIt is a spell that most characters will eventually have some use for, and requires the exact same skills at the same level necessary to cast [[Repel Missiles]], another universally desirable spell. Unless you already have flight available from another source ([[boots]] of [[flight (ego)|flight]], a [[ring of flight]], a large stack of [[potions of flight]], or [[tengu|innate]] [[gargoyle|flying]] [[draconian|ability]]), it's almost always worthwhile learning this.\n\nUnlike most status effects, flight does not immediately get dispelled after you are struck by a [[Quicksilver Bolt]]. This is done in order to avoid infuriating sudden deaths. Even so, you only have one turn after being blasted to get to safety - if walking a single space away won't get the job done, consider reading a [[scroll of blink]] to do so, or refreshing your flight by casting the spell again.\n\n==History==\nFlight was removed in [[0.17]].\n\n[[Category:Movement]]\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

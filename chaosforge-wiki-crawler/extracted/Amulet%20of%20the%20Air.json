[[Air Magic]] specialists obviously benefit the most, though any character can appreciate this artefact. Both Repel Missiles and rElec are rare and valuable intrinsics. Any character who has seriously developed their skills will barely notice the accuracy drop. Overall, it's a strong amulet, especially in places where RMsl and/or rElec are useful.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], this amulet gave +5 EV, but did not boost [[Air]] magic.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], this artefact's base type was an [[amulet of controlled flight]]. When this [[intrinsic]] was removed in 0.12, the base type was changed to an [[amulet of inaccuracy]] and it received the permanent [[Repel Missiles]] effect to make up for that penalty.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Amulets]]"}

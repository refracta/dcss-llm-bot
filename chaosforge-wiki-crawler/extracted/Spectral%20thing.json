As a type of [[derived undead]], their stats are based on what the monster had in life.\n\n==Useful Info==\nLike [[zombie]]s and [[skeleton]]s, spectral things are weaker and stupider than what they were in life.\n\n*'''HP:''' ([[HD]])d4 + 4*HD\n*'''AC:''' Original + 2\n*'''EV:''' Original - 5\n*'''Speed:''' Original\n*'''Melee attacks:''' 80% of original\n*'''Attack flavour:''' [[Drain experience|Draining]].\n*'''Special:''' [[Flight]], [[see invisible]], [[insubstantial]], infinite [[willpower]], regenerates normally, cannot traverse stairs\n\nSpectral things are immune to poison, negative energy, torment, and resistant to cold damage. Like all undead, they are vulnerable to [[holy]].\n\nSpectral things can be created by [[Death Channel]], or by monsters' [[Spectral Cloud]] spell. [[Nergalle]] is capable of summoning spectral orcs, who will often be armed with [[reaching]]-capable polearms. Spectres can also be found in a few [[vault]]s.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe main appeal of spectres is that [[Death Channel]] does not consume a monster's body, so it works with any other undead-creating spell. You cannot combine [[Animate Dead]] with [[Simulacrum]], but you can combine Death Channel with Animate Dead, or Death Channel and Simulacrum.\n\nSpectres are not especially strong compared to zombies or simulacrum, but their draining can be useful. Also, see invisible and flight can occasionally help.\n\n==Identifying Spectral things==\nThough spectral things will have different stats depending on what they were made from, ''Crawl'' currently tends to lump them together, making identification somewhat difficult. In console mode, there are unique tiles for several categories of monster, but there are still possible variations within those categories.

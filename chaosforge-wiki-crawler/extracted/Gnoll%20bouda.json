{"title":"Gnoll bouda","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Gnoll_bouda","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{list of | gnolls}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Gnoll bouda''' are support casters often found with packs of standard [[Gnoll (monster)|gnoll]]s. Only slightly more physically powerful than a regular gnoll, they aren't much of a threat alone, but can speed up and heal their allies while weakening you.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Weakening gaze severely and irresistibly neuters your damage output for a short duration. Try to not let them get into line of sight until you want to actually fight them.\n*Try to lure them away from their group. That way they can't heal their fellow gnolls or speed their movement up.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], gnoll bouda were known as '''gnoll shamans'''. Also, they lost [[Haste Other]] for Hunting Call and [[Corona]] for Weakening Gaze.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], gnoll shamans knew [[Petrify]]."}

{"title":"Eringya's Formal Garden","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Eringya%27s_Formal_Garden","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Strewn with twigs and leaves that crunch loudly underfoot, the grass is crisp and fresh.}}\n\n'''Eringya's Formal Garden''' is a [[Wizard Laboratory]] made of [[bush]]es, [[tree]]s, and tasteful statuary. Its map is a fairly simple series of shrub-lined pathways, with a portal out just next to the entrance and a pair of fairly obvious guarded treasure chambers behind [[door]]s.\n\n==Summary==\nExpect heavy ranged resistance: from [[list of centaurs|centaur]] and [[satyr]] defenders, to [[eleionoma]] and [[thorn hunter]]s. The massive amount of ranged damage can be scary to frailer characters, so [[repulsion]] and [[shield]]s are quite useful.\n\nOne of the two treasure chambers will contain a variety of [[spellbook]]s and [[magical staves]], which will be guarded by two [[oklob plant]]s. The other will contain an [[altar]] to [[Fedhas Madash]], along with [[spectral]] weapons, including a [[lajatang]].\n\n==Monsters==\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Centaur warrior}}\n| {{monsterlink|Yaktaur}}\n| {{monsterlink|Faun}}\n| {{monsterlink|Satyr}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Deep elf archer}}\n| {{monsterlink|Deep elf master archer}}\n| {{monsterlink|Naga sharpshooter}}\n| {{monsterlink|Eleionoma}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Shambling mangrove}}\n| {{monsterlink|Thorn hunter}}\n| {{monsterlink|Fenstrider witch}}\n| {{monsterlink|Oklob plant}}\n|-\n|}\n\n==Map==\n[[File:Eringya_minimap_0.29.png]]\n<pre>ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\nctttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttc\ncttttttttttt1....1....t....1....1tttttttttttc\ncttttttt.............................tttttttc\nctttt1....tttttttttttt.tttttttttttt....1ttttc\ncttt.....tttttttttt.......tttttttttt.....tttc\nctt...tt...ttt......G...G......ttt...tt...ttc\ncty1.ttt2............A.A............2ttt.1ytc\nctt...tt......ttt...G...G...ttt......tt...ttc\ncttt.....tttttttttt.......tttttttttt.....tttc\nctttt1....tttttttttttt.tttttttttttt....1ttttc\ncttttttt.......1.............1.......tttttttc\ncttttttttttt1.....1.......1.....1tttttttttttc\ncttttttttttttttttttttT.Tttttttttttttttttttttc\ncttttttttt.2.ttttttt.....ttttttt.2.tttttttttc\nctttttttt.....t...t...T...t...t.....ttttttttc\ncttttttt...t....7.....7.....7....t...tttttttc\nctttttt....1......tc.....ct......1....ttttttc\ncttttt..t......tttttcc-ccttttt......t..tttttc\nctttt...tt.7..tttttt.....tttttt..7.tt...ttttc\ncttt...tttt..tttttt...3...tttttt..tttt...tttc\ncttt.2.tttt...tttttt2.2.2tttttt...tttt.2.tttc\nctttt...tttt.2.tttttt;t;tttttt.2.tttt...ttttc\nctttttp.pttttq.qtttttttttttttq.qttttp.ptttttc\ncttttttpppttttqqqttttyyyttttqqqttttpppttttttc\ncttttp..-..pttq...tt..2..tt...qttp..-..pttttc\nctty.........ytt....1...1....tty.........yttc\nctt;1..tTt..1;ytt.3...T...3.tty;1..tTt..1;ttc\nctty....3...2ytt....1...1....tty2...3....yttc\nctttt2..-...tt....tt;.3.;tt....tt...-..2ttttc\nctttttt...tttt...ttttytytttt...tttt...ttttttc\ncttttt...tttt2..ttttttgtttttt..2tttt...tttttc\nctttt11.tttt...tttt5G;_;G5tttt...tttt.11ttttc\ncttt..2tttt1.2tttt....3....tttt2.1tttt2..tttc\ncttt7..ttt...tttt2....6....2tttt...ttt..7tttc\nctttt...t.7..tttG;.........;Gttt..7.t...ttttc\ncttttt........tttttcc5.5ccttttt........tttttc\nctttttt.-.6.-..tttcc..7..ccttt..-.6.-.ttttttc\ncttttttt........t.7-..T..-7.t........tttttttc\ncttttttttt3...11.............11...3tttttttttc\ncttttttttttt..12...7..4..7...21..tttttttttttc\ncttttttttttttttt.............tttttttttttttttc\ncttttttttttttttttttt2...2tttttttttttttttttttc\nctttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttc\nccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\n</pre>\n\n==Origin==\nWhile modern ''Crawl'' players may know Eringya from [[Eringya's Noxious Bog]], this wizlab predates the spell by over 5 years. Instead, it references [[Eringya's Surprising Bouquet]], which was removed in a very early version. The Surprising Bouquet  transmuted any wooden item in your hands into a vaguely [[food|edible]] bouquet of flowers. Other than potentially ridding you of a [[curse]]d item or keeping [[spriggan]]s from starvation, it was useless.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], Eringya's Formal Garden will contain a stack of [[potions of lignification]] or [[scrolls of poison]], and guarantee the spell [[Eringya's Noxious Bog]]. Also, monsters won't drink the potions, increasing loot overall.\n*This laboratory was re-introduced and reworked in [[0.28]].\n*This laboratory was retired as of [[0.17]]. The original version had vine-covered [[earth elemental]]s, and custom script which would block your path with [[wandering mushroom]]s and drop [[fruit]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the altar of Fedhas Madash was guarded by '''vine-covered golems''', which were essentially [[stone golem]]s.\n\n[[Category: Dungeon Branches]]\n[[Category: Crystal Ball Articles]]"}

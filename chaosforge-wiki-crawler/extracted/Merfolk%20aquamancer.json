{"title":"Merfolk aquamancer","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Merfolk_aquamancer","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''For a list of merfolk, see [[List of merfolk]]''\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Merfolk aquamancers''' are aggressive casters that provide support for other [[merfolk (monster)|merfolk]] opponents. They can deal steam, cold, or physical damage, and can temporarily turn perfectly safe terrain into [[shallow water]] or push you around the field. They can be found almost exclusively in [[the Shoals]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Aquamancers are around the level of [[merfolk javelineer]]s in threat. Their spells hit very hard from a distance, and the ability to dump you in water is extremely dangerous when near [[water nymph]]s or other merfolk.\n*Their spells check three resistances: [[cold resistance]], [[steam resistance]], and drowning (resisted by being [[unbreathing]] or [[amphibious]]). It's unlikely for a character to have all three, so expect spikes of damage from time to time.\n*[[Fly]]ing is nice - you still take full damage from Primal Wave, but avoid being stuck in water.\n*Merfolk aquamancers often come with nice [[rapier]]s, so [[Short Blade]] specialists should make sure they kill them somewhere their loot is accessible.\n\n[[Category:Merfolk]]"}

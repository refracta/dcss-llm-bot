The tentacles do little harm on their own, but the poisonous toxins they inject can cause significant damage to muscle tissue.\n----\n“From this story it is evident that in former times the jellyfish once had a shell and bones something like a tortoise, but, ever since the Dragon King's sentence was carried out on the ancestor of the jelly fishes, his descendants have all been soft and boneless just as you see them to-day thrown up by the waves high upon the shores of Japan.”<br>\n-“The Jellyfish and the Monkey”, adapted by Yei Theodora Ozaki, _Young<br>\nFolk's Treasury_, vol.

They flee to [[deep water]] when severely injured, and can be found anywhere that water occurs, apart from the first few floors of [[the Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Poison resistance renders their attacks virtually harmless. Failing that, having even a modest AC is likely to negate their poison.\n*If poisoned, back off and let yourself recover before fighting them later. There's no sense in letting yourself get stung to death by a monster that can't follow you on land.\n\n==History==\nJellyfish were removed in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

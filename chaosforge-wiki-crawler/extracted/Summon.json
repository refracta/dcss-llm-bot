Killing it yields no experience or items; it is incapable of using stairs.}}\n__NOTOC__\n'''Summons''' are creatures bound by magical forces, most often created by the [[Summonings]] school of spells. For the most part, summoned monsters function much like real monsters, with the following exceptions:\n*They are worth no experience or piety, and leave nothing behind when slain.\n*[[Vampiric]] weapons and [[Vampiric Draining]] don't work on them.\n*They eventually \"time out\" regardless of their [[HP]], vanishing in a cloud of smoke. \n**Summoned monsters immediately vanish upon the death of their summoner.\n**Most player summons will vanish if angered.\n**They are vulnerable to [[abjuration]] and [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]].\n*They will not follow you up or down [[stairs]]. This allows you to flee hostile summoned units and return after sufficient time has passed. Your own summoned allies will disappear immediately when you change floors.\n*Allied summons will not attack monsters outside of the player's [[line of sight]].\n\n===Duration===\nSummoned monsters are generated with a duration between 1 and 6. This value roughly corresponds to the following amount in [[aut]]s (arbitrary units of time; 10 aut = 1 \"turn\"):<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|mon-ench.cc|2381}}</ref>\n\n# 90 aut <!-- TODO: add the range for each duration class -->\n# 180 aut\n# 270 aut\n# 360 aut\n# 810 aut\n# 1710 aut\n\nSome Summonings spells have a fixed duration. Other spells increase duration with power (spellpower, [[piety]], etc.).\n\n===Summon Limit===\nMost Summonings spells have [[Summoning#Summoning Limits|a cap on how many monsters]] you can sustain at any one time; exceeding the limit will cause the oldest monsters to time out almost immediately. Other sources of summons, like [[god]]s, [[evocable]]s, and the [[scroll of summoning]], are unaffected.\n\n==Durable Summon==\n{{flavour|This monster has been summoned in a durable way, and only partially exists. Killing it yields no experience or items, and it cannot be abjured.}}\nA '''durable summon''', or monster that is '''durably summoned''', is similar to a summoned monster with a few notable exceptions:\n\n*They never disappear.\n*They are not vulnerable to [[abjuration]] or [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]].\n*They will follow you up or down stairs.\n*They ''can'' be targeted by Vampiric Draining.\n\nDurable summons are most often used as punishments for the player; whenever from the [[divine retribution]] of several [[god]]s, or [[nameless horror]]s from [[miscast]] Summonings spells.\n\n==Non-Summons==\nThe following effects are not summoned, despite sharing similarities:\n*[[Malign Gateway]], which is immune to abjuration and will turn hostile over time. This is the only [[Summonings]] spell that doesn't create an actual summon.\n*[[Derived undead]], created by [[Necromancy]]. They are still temporary when created by the player, vanishing if you enter another floor.\n*[[Hornet]]s from a [[shambling mangrove]] or reinforcements from a [[doom hound]], which are completely non-summons and worth XP and piety as usual.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], [[Uskayaw]] did not give piety for harming summoned monsters.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], summoned monsters would steal [[XP]] proportional to their damage dealt (1/2 XP if you did no damage)\n*Prior to [[0.25]], non-durable summons could not be affected by [[Inner Flame]]. In addition, most player-summoned creatures didn't vanish when they became hostile.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the [[mercenary card]] would create allied durable summons.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], the [[warding]] intrinsic existed to counter (non durable) summons.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

{"title":"Swap card","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Swap_card","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|The card depicts a hooded executioner with his head on the block, while the condemned gleefully raises the axe.}}\nThe Swap card transposes the player with a random nearby monster (if there are any). If either party was caught in a net at the moment the card was drawn, the other party will become entangled if possible. ([[Xom]] thinks entangling oneself this way is hilarious.)\n\nThe Swap card could be found in the following [[Decks|decks]] over the past several versions.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.11]]\n![[0.12]]\n![[0.13]]\n![[0.14]]\n![[0.15]]\n![[0.16]]\n![[0.17]]\n![[0.18]]\n![[0.19]] and beyond\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of war|War]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n|----\n|}\n\n==History==\nThis card was removed in the deck simplification of [[0.19]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

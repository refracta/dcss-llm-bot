However, they are only ever found in a handful of rare [[vault]]s. If you see an elf elsewhere, it's most likely a [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]]. Elf zombies can be found inside and around an [[Ossuary]].\n\n===Variant Elves===\n[[File:Deformed elf.png]]You can find '''deformed elves''', '''febrile elves''', and '''sickly elves''' in some of the sealed chambers in [[Cigotuvi's Fleshworks]].\n\n{{Flavour|This poor creature looks hideously deformed.}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The [[unique]]s [[Dowan]], [[Duvessa]], and [[Fannar]] are listed simply as \"elf\" for their species.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.13]], you could find '''grey elves''', who had the same stats, in some vaults.\n\n[[category:Elf]]"}

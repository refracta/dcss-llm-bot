{"title":"The Enchantress","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/The_Enchantress","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{list of|spriggans}}\n{{monster info|the Enchantress}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''The Enchantress''' is a rare [[list of spriggans|spriggan]] [[unique]] who leads a band of [[spriggan defender]]s, [[spriggan berserker|berserkers]], and [[spriggan air mage|air mages]]. She spawns with a powerful weapon (16% chance of [[distortion]]) and the suit of randomly generated [[faerie dragon scales]], has an innate [[Repel Missiles]] effect up at all times, is incredibly [[ev]]asive, and knows several dangerous [[Hexes]]. \n\n==Location==\n*[[The Depths]]\n\n{{monster spells|the Enchantress}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The Enchantress and her band of allies can be devastating if faced all at once and are very difficult to escape. If you see spriggans, try to lure them away a few at a time; even if the Enchantress isn't part of the band, it's still a good habit. Like any other encounter, you should limit the melee attackers to a hallway.\n*You'll want massive amounts of [[willpower]] to reduce the impact of her hexes, and high [[AC]]/[[GDR]] will reduce the sting of her demon whip.\n*As she can deny you the ability to teleport, try to have another means of escape at your disposal, such as [[Haste]] plus a timely [[Swiftness]].\n*Actually hitting her can be a huge pain, especially for ranged weapon users. If possible, use spells like [[Airstrike]], [[Fireball]], [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]], or anything else that bypasses [[EV]].\n*Be sure to check out the faerie dragon scales she drops. Its usefulness can vary wildly, but has the potential to be extremely worthwhile.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the Enchantress had permanent [[Deflect Missiles]] instead of [[Repel Missiles]] (and had EV increased slightly to compensate).\n*Prior to [[0.14]], she would only appear in massive spriggan-themed vaults that would rarely generate in the lower floors of [[the Dungeon]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], she knew [[Banishment]] in place of Dimension Anchor, Strip Resistance, and Mass Confusion.\n*In [[0.7]], she could be generated in [[Wizard mode]]. She was added into the standard game in [[0.8]].\n*During the short period in which the [[Enchanted Forest]] generated in [[trunk]], the Enchantress was guaranteed to spawn on the lowest floor.\n\n[[Category:Spriggan]]"}

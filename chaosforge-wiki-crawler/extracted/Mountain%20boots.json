{"title":"Mountain boots","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mountain_boots","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|These sturdy boots were created by an artificer who lived high up on a remote mountain peak, as protection against the mountain's near-constant avalanches, rockslides, and snowstorms.

They also render the wearer immune to [[shaft]]s, one of the deadliest effects that you might encounter. The ability to [[stair dancing|stair dance]] around enemies like [[elephant]]s, [[swamp worm]]s, and [[rockslime]]s is a welcome bonus. A great pair of [[randart]] boots might be better for general use - especially in floors where you [[Shaft#Exploration Shafts|can't be shafted]]. However, these boots are still great in places where involuntary movement is common (like [[Lair]], [[Swamp]], and [[Slime Pits|Slime]]). In [[Shoals]], the boots allow you to resist [[Avatar Song]]'s pull, although they don't prevent [[mesmerisation]].\n\n==History==\n*The mountain boots were introduced in [[0.29]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Boots]]"}

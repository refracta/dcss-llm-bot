{"title":"Frozen Ramparts","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Frozen_Ramparts","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Frozen Ramparts''' is a Level 3 [[Ice Magic]] spell that temporarily covers all [[wall]]s within 2 tiles of the caster with ice. These ice-covered walls will inflict <code>1d(1 + 0.3 * power)</code> [[cold]] damage<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|spl-damage.cc|4418}}</ref> on any monster that stands next to them. It does not check [[ev]]asion, and may slow down [[cold-blooded]] creatures. The caster and their allies are immune to the spell's effects. If the caster moves, this spell will end prematurely.\n\nWhile the spell is active, attempting to cast the spell again will fail (but will not waste any time).\n\n[[Ice Elementalist]]s begin with this spell in their libraries.\n\n==Strategy==\nFrozen Ramparts deals significant damage over its duration to all enemies. However, it requires you to remain still and keep your enemies next to walls. It is most effective in corridors, but can perform adequately in semi-open areas so long as you can still position your foe(s) next to a wall.\n\nOverall, it is a strong spell that never misses. Useful for fighting [[ev]]asive enemies like [[killer bee]]s. It's also good against [[cold-blooded]] enemies, like [[adder]]s, [[water moccasin]]s, and even [[hydra]]s, as it can slow them from a short distance.\n\nDo note that intelligent enemies may attempt to avoid ice-covered walls if (and only if) their health is low enough; if you need to reactivate the spell, you may need to wait until your foes are in position in order to catch them in the area. Unlike [[cloud]]s, weaker monsters with full HP will charge into the Ramparts without care.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*[[Ozocubu's Armour]] shares its spell school, movement restrictions, and even spell level with Frozen Ramparts. The two spells possess impressive natural synergy.\n*Despite their similarity to walls, [[tree]]s are not affected by Frozen Ramparts, making the spell of little use in forested areas like the [[Swamp]].\n*''Any'' change in position will break the ramparts, be it voluntary (movement, [[blink]]ing) or not ([[Force Lance]], being [[trample]]d). Take care to position yourself to maximize the spell's effectiveness, and consider using a different spell against creatures that can force you to move.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Frozen Ramparts ignored [[AC]], but did less damage: <code>1d(2 + 0.2 * power)</code>.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], certain involuntary movements, such as an [[elephant]]'s [[trample]], did not disrupt the Ramparts.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], you could move without ending the spell.\n*Frozen Ramparts was added in [[0.25]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

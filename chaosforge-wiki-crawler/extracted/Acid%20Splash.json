It may also splash onto other nearby creatures on impact.}}\n\n'''Acid Splash''' launches a blob of [[acid]] at a targeted creature that deals damage and may inflict corrosion. It is similar to the [[Spit Acid]] ability present in [[oklob plant]]s and [[acid blob]]s and the like, but it may also splash onto creatures adjacent to the target.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}"}

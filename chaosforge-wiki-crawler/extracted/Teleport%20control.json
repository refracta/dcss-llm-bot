It also causes uncontrolled [[blink]]s to be semi-controlled.\n\n==Useful Info==\nTeleport Control is a temporary status. There are three methods of obtaining it: evoking a [[ring of teleport control]], casting the level 4 spell [[Control Teleport]], or drawing the [[Portal]] card (sometimes). It immediately ends if you teleport or blink, though it can also expire after enough time.\n\nWhile [[berserk]], you are unable to benefit from cTele, but teleports are still delayed. [[#-cTele|Certain levels]] can prevent cTele from functioning entirely, which also prevents the delay.\n\n===Teleport===\nWhen you teleport with teleport control, you can choose a specific location to land, delaying it by <code>1d3</code> turns. When the teleport activates, you'll be sent up to 2 tiles away from that location. If you would land in a wall or a monster, you get a random teleport instead. \n\nIf you activate teleport control while already teleporting, you get to choose the tile, and the delay still applies.\n\nSpecifically, a controlled teleport will send you to your chosen tile, or one of 8 adjacent tiles. Then, there is a 25% of being sent 1 tile away from that square. Assuming that all squares are valid teleport positions, the odds of each possible landing site are listed below (the center of the table is the targeted square):\n\n{| cellpadding=\"10\" border=\"1\" style=\"margin:auto\"\n| 0.3% || 0.6% || 0.9% || 0.6% || 0.3%\n|-\n| 0.6% || 9.6% || 10% || 9.6% || 0.6%\n|-\n|  0.9% || 10% || 11% || 10% || 0.9%\n|-\n| 0.6% || 9.6% || 10% || 9.6% || 0.6%\n|-\n| 0.3% || 0.6% || 0.9% || 0.6% || 0.3%\n|}\n\n===Blink===\nWhen you uncontrolled [[blink]] with teleport control, you are allowed to choose a direction. It will blink you 2-7 spaces in that direction, at no delay, and gives you some [[magic contamination]]. Try not to use it more than twice in a row to avoid unpleasant consequences.\n\nNote that if you cast the spell, reconsider, and then cancel the controlled Blink, you'll expend one turn.\n\n==-cTele==\nTeleport control is not allowed on some levels, until certain conditions are satisfied. The message, \"You sense a powerful magical force warping space,\" will appear as soon as you arrive on these levels, and you'll see the \"-cTele\" flag in your status display. Attempting to teleport anyway will simply generate a random teleport instead.\n\nControlled teleports are always disabled in:\n* [[Labyrinth]]\n* [[The Abyss]]\n* [[Elven Halls|Elf]]:3\n* [[Zot]]:5\n\nControlled teleports are conditionally disabled in:\n* [[Slime Pits|Slime]]:6 - disabled until you kill [[the Royal Jelly]].  Note that you'll need teleport control (or a means of [[dig]]ging) to get to the treasure and rune on this level.\n* [[Dis]]:7, [[Tartarus]]:7, [[Gehenna]]:7, [[Cocytus]]:7 - disabled until you've acquired the branch's rune.\n* [[Tomb]] - disabled until you have obtained the branch's rune.\n* [[Ziggurat]] - always disabled on floors 25-27. Floors 7-24 have the possibility of being disabled.\n\nOnce you've acquired the [[Orb of Zot]], controlled teleports are disabled for the rest of the game.\n\n==History==\n* Teleport control and the -cTele level flag were removed in [[0.17]].\n* Prior to [[0.13]], the cTele status didn't disappear after each use, controlled teleports' delay was normal, there was a mutation that granted permanent teleport control, and the ring of teleport control granted this intrinsic passively.\n\n[[Category:Intrinsic]][[Category:Status effects]]"}

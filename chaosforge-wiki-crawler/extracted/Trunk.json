{"title":"Trunk","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Trunk","type":"raw","data":"{{version-trunk}}\n\nBetween stable releases, the bulk of Crawl development occurs in '''trunk'''. These publicly available trunk builds allow users to preview and playtest new features, balance changes, and bug fixes, but the experimental code changes may also produce bugs (which may be severe). Unlike more experimental code branches, most of the changes that meet with developer and player approval are likely to make their way into the next stable release.\n\nPlayers can follow changes via:\n* [https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/docs/changelog.txt Version development summary]\n* [https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commits/master Git commits]\n\nDiscuss and read about future development:\n* [https://tavern.dcss.io/ The Tavern (official forum)]\n* [http://crawl.develz.org/wiki/doku.php?id=start Older dev wiki on CDO] - registration disabled\n* [https://github.com/crawl/crawl/wiki Dev wiki on GitHub]\n* [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=crawl-ref-discuss Archive] of old development mailing list.\n* IRC: #crawl and #crawl-dev on [ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697 Libera]\n\nAccess trunk versions:\n* [http://crawl.develz.org/trunk/ Download]\n* [[Playing_online | Play online]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:Crawl Versions]]"}

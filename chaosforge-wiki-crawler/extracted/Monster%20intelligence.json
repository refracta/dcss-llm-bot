{"title":"Monster intelligence","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Monster_intelligence","type":"raw","data":"{{version|030}}\n:''If you were looking for the \"Brainless\" status condition caused by having 0 [[Intelligence]], see [[Stat zero#Brainless (Intelligence)|Stat zero]].''\n\nAll monsters have a level of intelligence that determines certain behaviours, such as tracking the player, avoiding danger, and cooperating with allies. In general, a monster's intelligence is a secondary consideration compared to its physical and magical abilities, but it does have a number of effects, mostly in fairly specific situations.\n\n== Levels of Intelligence ==\nThere are three levels of monster intelligence:\n# [[:Category: Brainless intelligence | Brainless intelligence]]: Plants, zombies, jellies, golems, elementals. (\"Mindless\")\n# [[:Category: Animal intelligence | Animal intelligence]]: Animals, insects, some non-zombie undead.\n# [[:Category: Human intelligence | Human intelligence]]: Humanoids, some other powerful/magical monsters. (\"Intelligent\")\n\n== Effects of intelligence ==\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of effects of monster intelligence.\n\n'''Brainless'''\n* Brainless monsters are immune to [[Anguish]] and [[Mindburst]], cannot be [[pacify|pacified]], and are unable to be bound by [[Yredelemnul]].\n* Brainless monsters will blunder into [[shallow water]], [[shaft]]s, and dangerous [[clouds]] (except [[miasma]]). Intelligent monsters will avoid clouds unless they are resistant, though a strong enough intelligent monster may charge through clouds if there's no better path.\n* Non-brainless monsters will retreat if they can't reach you or shoot at you.\n* Non-brainless monsters will often try to make space for their allies to attack you.\n\n'''Intelligence'''\n* Intelligent monsters search and travel more effectively, and will continue to hunt for you longer after hearing [[noise]] or losing sight of you.\n* Intelligent ranged monsters will attempt to regain [[line of sight]] rather than charging directly at you.\n* Intelligent monsters may be able to guess your location even when you are [[invisibility|invisible]].\n* Only human intelligence monsters can be [[bribe]]d or activate [[net trap]]s.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the monster intelligence of your allies determined avoidance of [[traps]] (no effect on hostile).\n*Prior to [[0.26]], butchering intelligent creatures would anger [[Zin]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], there were 6 categories of intelligence: plant, insect, reptile, animal, human and high. \n*Prior to [[0.13]] reptile intelligence and insect intelligence were one value, and Elyvilon could thus pacify insects. Also, friendly dumb monsters wouldn't turn hostile when damaged by ranged attacks.\n\n[[Category:Monster intelligence]]"}

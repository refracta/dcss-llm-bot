It radiates the chill of its native habitat, slowing creatures from warmer climes.}}\n[[File:Skin_of_zhor.png]] '''''the +4 skin of Zhor'''''\n\n+4 [[animal skin]]\n\nPassive [[Metabolic Englaciation]]<br>\nrC+++<br>\n[[See invisible]]\n__NOTOC__\n==Mechanics==\nWhen one or more hostile monsters are in [[LOS]], there's a 1/7 chance per 1.0 [[decaAut]] that Metabolic Englaciation will be cast, with a [[spell power|power]] of 30.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-func.h|1403}}</ref> This requires no action from the player, no MP, no skills to be trained, and will not cause monsters to notice you. However, due to the low power, it can be resisted by high [[HD]] monsters.\n\nWith a power of 30, Metabolic Englaciation slows for <code>(3d31)/6 - HD/2 - 0.5</code> turns. It fails to slow if turns â‰¤ 0, otherwise there's a minimum of 2-5 turns (randomized per cast). Therefore, the chance to slow is given below:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"text-align: center\" border=1\n|-\n![[HD]] !! Chance to Slow\n|-\n|5 || 97.7%\n|-\n|10 || 78.1%\n|-\n|15 || 51.2%\n|-\n|20 || 13.6%\n|}\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''skin of Zhor'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|906}}</ref> passively [[slow]]s down enemies. This enables [[kiting]] tactics: against melee enemies, walk away, and you'll get free chances to englaciate. As slow also reduces monsters' attack speed, it helps against any vulnerable enemy. The cold resistance is also nice to have (especially for [[Ice cave]]s).\n\nHowever, this artefact isn't perfect. \n*As a +4 animal skin, it offers minimal [[AC]]. Heavy melee brutes should stay away; even casters may prefer a more reliable armour, like [[troll leather armour]] or [[swamp dragon scales]], instead. The slow definitely helps to reduce damage - but it isn't consistent. With a 1/7 chance to englaciate, it can take a while to kick in after you've been [[shaft]]ed or [[teleport trap|teleported]].\n*It does not affect all monsters. Creatures with any sort of [[cold resistance|rC+]] are fully immune to Metabolic Englaciation, while those with high [[HD]] have a good chance to resist. In the late-game, few enemies will be slowed, severely limiting this armour's usefulness.\n*It also affects your [[allies]] without cold resistance, which makes this armour less useful to [[Summoner]]s.\n\nThat being said, the slow effect is powerful and costs no time. Casters and EV-based fighters can make good use out of this armour. It is particularly strong in [[the Lair]], as it is filled with [[cold-blooded]] creatures, who are slowed for longer. It's also nice in places with swarms of low-HD enemies, namely the [[Spider's Nest]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.23]], the skin of Zhor did not provide passive Metabolic Englaciation. It also lacked SInv.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the skin of Zhor only provided rC++.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

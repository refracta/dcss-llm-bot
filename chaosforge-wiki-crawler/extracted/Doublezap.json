{"title":"Doublezap","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Doublezap","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Doublezap''' is the ability to hit a monster twice with a single casting of a spell.  \n\nThe following spells can bounce from most walls, allowing the ability to double-zap:\n* [[Shock]]\n* [[Lightning Bolt]]\n* [[Electrical Bolt]]\n* [[Crystal Bolt]]\nOf these spells, only Shock can be cast by players.\n\nIn addition, [[Wall#Crystal|crystal walls]] can reflect beams of cold and fire.\n\n==Common doublezap patterns==\nThese apply for range 8 Shock. \n\nFor other spells, remember that hitting a monster is free, but bouncing off a wall costs two units of range (i.e. the wall counts as two squares). A creature next to the wall is, however, still affected twice, if (at least) one unit of range is left before starting the bounce.\n\n===Bounce back, monster next to wall===\n Bizap and hit yourself:\n @.M# <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n\n Bizap:\n @..M# <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n\n... up to ...\n\n Bizap:\n @......M# <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n\n Monozap:\n @.......M <-- shoot at monster\n\n Bizap:\n ## <-- shoot at this wall with the '!' key\n ...\n M.@\n ##\n\n===Bounce back, monster one square from wall===\n\n Bizap and hit yourself:\n @M.# <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n\n Bizap:\n @.M.# <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n\n Bizap:\n @..M.# <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n\n Monozap:\n @...M.# <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n\n===Bounce back, monster two squares from wall===\n\n Bizap:\n @M..# <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n\n Monozap:\n @.M..# <-- shoot at monster\n\n===Corner bounce, monster next to wall===\nAlso works with a concave corner:\n M#\n ##\n\n Bizap and hit yourself:\n @\n  .\n   M. <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n   .#\n\n Bizap:\n @\n  .\n   .\n    M.  <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n    .#\n\n ...\n\n Bizap:\n @\n  . <-- shoot at empty square with the '!' key\n   .\n    .\n     .\n      .\n       .\n        M.\n        .#\n\n\n Monozap:\n @\n  . <-- shoot at empty square with the '!' key\n   .\n    .\n     .\n      .\n       .\n        .\n         M\n\n===Corner bounce, monster one square from wall===\n\nAlso works with a concave corner:\n M#\n ##\n\n Bizap and hit yourself:\n @\n  M <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n   ..\n   .#\n\n Bizap:\n @\n  .\n   M <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n    ..\n    .# \n\n Bizap:\n @\n  .\n   .\n    M <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n     ..\n     .#\n\n Monozap:\n @\n  .\n   .\n    .\n     M <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n      ..\n      .#\n\n===Corner bounce, monster two squares from wall===\n\nAlso works with a concave corner:\n M#\n ##\n\n Bizap:\n @\n  M <-- shoot at monster with the '!' key\n   .\n    ..\n    .#\n\n Monozap:\n @\n  .\n   M\n    .\n     .\n      # <-- shoot at monster\n\n===Offset by one, monster next to wall ===\n\n Bizap:\n @.\n  M# <-- shoot at this wall with the '!' key\n\n Bizap:\n @..\n   M# <-- shoot at this wall with the '!' key\n\n Bizap:\n @...\n   .M# <-- shoot at this wall with the '!' key\n\n Bizap:\n @....\n    .M# <-- shoot at this wall with the '!' key\n\n Bizap:\n @.....\n      M# <-- shoot at this wall with the '!' key\n\n Bizap:\n @......\n       M# <-- shoot at this wall with the '!' key\n\n Bizap:\n @.......\n        M# <-- shoot at this wall with the '!' key\n\n Monozap:\n @.......\n         M <-- shoot at monster\n\n===Offset by two, monster in a corridor===\n Bizap:\n @.\n #.# <-- shoot at this wall with the '!' key\n #M#\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], [[Lightning Bolt]] could be cast by players, one of the only two common ways to doublezap enemies.\n*It used to be possible to triplezap and even quadrizap, but zapping was limited to twice in some earlier version of the game.\n\n[[Category:Strategy]]"}

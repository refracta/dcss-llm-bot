{"title":"Deep elf blademaster","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Deep_elf_blademaster","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | deep elves}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Deep elf blademasters''' are the most powerful melee fighters of the [[list of deep elves|deep elves]]. They are fast, have annoyingly high evasion, and dual-wield [[Short Blades]] (small chance for [[quick blade]]s). They can be found in the [[Elven Halls]], particularly in the Hall of Blades.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While blademasters don't hit as hard as [[ettin]]s, they are fast, making them hard to escape from. Also, they are quite durable, unlike most of the other elves.\n*Blademasters have ''much'' higher evasion than other elves. Attacks that never miss, such as [[Freezing Cloud]], [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]], or  [[Fireball]], are effective. Using [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]] or a [[wand of roots]] will lower their EV to basically 0.\n*[[Haste]] lets you move at the same speed as a blademaster. Haste and [[Swiftness]] allow you to outrun one.\n\n[[Category:Elf]]"}

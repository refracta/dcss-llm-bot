{"title":"Strength","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Strength","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n\n'''Strength''' (or STR) is one of a character's three main [[attributes]], along with [[dexterity]] and [[intelligence]].\n\nStrength affects the following:\n*Increases damage of most physical attacks. Every point of STR past 10 gives +2.5% damage, while every STR below gives -2.5%:\n**Strength boosts the following attacks: many [[weapon damage|weapons]] ([[Axes]], [[Maces & Flails]], [[Polearm]]s, [[Staves]], [[Throwing]]), [[Unarmed Combat]], [[auxiliary attack]]s, [[constriction]].\n*Reduces the impact of [[encumbrance]], from both [[body armour]] and [[shield]]s. This lowers the penalty on [[ev]]asion, spellcasting success, and [[ranged weapon]] attack speed.\n\nA high strength score can go a long way toward allowing you to cast spells or dodge attacks while wearing heavy armour/shields, and significant boosts to strength (e.g. an artefact with +10 strength) will boost melee damage considerably. However, the defensive boosts from [[dexterity]] are helpful for any character.\n\nIf your strength is ever reduced to 0 or lower, you will suffer [[stat zero]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], strength had no impact on shield encumbrance.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], [[Short Blades]], [[Long Blades]], and [[Ranged Weapons]] scaled with STR instead of DEX.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Strength increased the [[SH]] of [[kite shield]]s and [[tower shield]]s. It also increased the chance of using [[auxiliary attack]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the Strength modifier was more complex. For STR > 10, you had a <code>100 + ([[random2]](STR - 9) * 2)</code>% multiplier, while for STR < 10, your damage was <code>100 - (random2(11 - STR) * 3)</code>. (10 STR still equaled 100% damage)\n*Prior to [[0.20]], many forms (like [[Statue Form]]) had extra scaling with strength.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], each weapon type had a strength weight that determined how much strength contributed to damage and accuracy. Now strength increases damage equally for all weapons, and does not affect accuracy.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], characters could only carry a certain weight of gear at any given time, measured in [[aum]]s. Strength increased your carrying capacity by 25 aum per point. Also, ranged combat was significantly more complicated, and strength played a role in determining your attack delay with ranged weapons (see [[weapon damage]] and [[ranged combat]] for details).\n*Prior to [[0.13]], the weapon damage bonus from strength was half as large. Strength also played a role in the now-obsolete Armour EV-Penalty system, which was replaced with [[encumbrance rating]]s.\n\n[[Category:Stats]]"}

{"title":"Ancient lich","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ancient_lich","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|liches}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ancient liches''' are extremely powerful undead casters with a wide array of resistances and access to brutal conjurations that can deal ridiculous amounts of damage. If you are not confident in your skills, escape is strongly advised.\n\nAncient liches can rarely be found on the last floor of [[the Vaults]], in [[the Abyss]], [[the Crypt]], [[the Tomb]], and [[the Realm of Zot]]. They are a particularly common sight near the orb chamber of [[Zot:5]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Strategy==\nUnderstand that ancient liches are some of the most powerful casters in the game. Don't worry too much about conserving resources; if burning a consumable or two will greatly ease the battle, do so. A [[haste]]d ancient lich can deal up to 288 damage per turn, enough to one-round most characters. While this max damage is exceedingly rare, ancient liches can still cause huge spikes of damage. Taking 100+ damage in a single turn stings.\n\nAs these liches resist most elemental damage, casters should use pure [[Conjurations]] or [[Earth Magic]] to deal with them. Necromancy users can use [[Dispel Undead]]. Melee fighters should lure them around corners or use a [[scroll of fog]]. If available, a strong [[holy wrath]] or [[antimagic]] weapon works great.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n* Ancient liches are spellcasters, so are vulnerable to both [[silence]] and [[antimagic]]. When silenced, all it can do is make weak melee attacks,  which is only dangerous to players at low HP. Weapons of antimagic and [[Enfeeble]] are also effective at disabling them.\n* [[Berserk]] can work well, as liches don't blink. However, ancient liches usually generate in areas you don't want attention (Vaults:5 and Zot:5). Being [[slow]]ed when an [[orb of fire]] comes into view isn't exactly a great situation.\n* Like most enemies in Crawl, ancient liches are vulnerable to [[throwing net]]s. Throwing a net at the edge of [[LOS]] guarantees that you can run away. Nets also allow for [[stab]] attempts.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], ancient liches could have one of several spell sets. In particular, the [[Summoning]]-focused spells were given to the newly-introduced [[dread lich]]es.\n** [[Bolt of Cold]] (3d37), [[Force Lance]] (3d27), [[Summon Greater Demon]], [[Slow]], [[Invisibility]]\n** [[Bolt of Draining]] (3d33), [[Poison Arrow]] (3d34), [[Haunt]], [[Banishment]], [[Haste]]\n** [[Bolt of Fire]] (3d37), [[Iron Shot]] (3d44), Summon Greater Demon, [[Confuse]], Invisibility\n** [[Corrosive Bolt]] (3d28), [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] (3d48), [[Petrify]], Haste\n** [[Lightning Bolt]] (3d29), [[Orb of Destruction]] (9d20), [[Paralyze]], Haste\n*Prior to [[0.18]], ancient liches had randomized spell sets.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], ancient liches would generate with one of four predetermined spell sets."}

{"title":"Ushabti","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ushabti","type":"raw","data":"{{version021}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nDespite their appearance, '''ushabtiu''' are not [[list of mummies|mummies]]. They are instead non-living constructs designed to guard [[the Tomb]] from intruders. They are capable of making inordinate amounts of [[noise]], exhaling blasts of [[miasma]], tearing apart [[undead]] adventurers who would otherwise resist the majority of the Tomb's defenses, and simply pummeling intruders in melee.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Their Death Rattle spell functions similarly to a [[catoblepas]]'s petrifying breath attack, creating a line of unwholesome clouds. If you're already standing in a cloud of your own creation, the spell won't be able to affect you. Characters with immunity to rotting can simply ignore the associated clouds, standing in them for safety. Just be mindful of your safe cloud dissipating.\n*Undead characters (and those using [[Necromutation|lich form]]) should be wary of their [[Dispel Undead]] - it isn't overly powerful, but it deals completely irresistible damage nonetheless.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.19]], ushabtiu inherited [[anubis guard]]s' [[Dispel Undead]] and [[Warning Cry]].\n*Ushabti were added in [[0.16]]."}

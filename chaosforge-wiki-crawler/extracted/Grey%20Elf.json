They were competent at using [[Short Blades]], [[Long Blades]], and [[bows]], but were poor at other fighting [[skill]]s and had little durability.  Their magical aptitudes were generally excellent, particularly in [[Air Magic]], but they had little talent for [[Necromancy]] and [[Earth Magic]].\n\n==Preferred Classes==\nGrey elves preferred to become [[Healer]]s, [[Crusader]]s, [[Reaver]]s, [[Wizard]]s, [[Conjurer]]s, [[Enchanter]]s, [[Summoner]]s, [[Fire Elementalist]]s, [[Ice Elementalist]]s, [[Air Elementalist]]s, [[Stalker]]s, [[Assassin]]s and [[Hunter]]s.\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*1 less [[HP]] than average every level until character level 14\n*1 [[MP]] every 2 out of 3 levels.\n*+1 [[intelligence]] or [[dexterity]] every 4th level.\n\n{{Old_Apts\n|arm = 140\n|ddg = 75\n|sth = 70\n|stb = 100\n|shd = 140\n|t&d = 100\n|inv = 75\n|evo = 67\n|exp = 140\n|fgt = 140\n|sbl = 90\n|lbl = 95\n|axs = 140\n|m&f = 160\n|pla = 160\n|stv = 100\n|u_c = 130\n|thr = 80\n|slg = 130\n|bws = 70\n|crb = 100\n|drt = 90\n|spc = 78\n|coj = 90\n|enc = 50\n|sum = 90\n|nec = 130\n|trl = 80\n|trm = 80\n|div = 80\n|fir = 90\n|ice = 90\n|air = 60\n|ear = 150\n|poi = 110\n}}\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.4]], grey elves could use the [[glamour]] ability to cloud the minds of nearby humanoids.\n\nGrey elves were removed in [[0.5]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete species]]\n[[Category:Elf]]"}

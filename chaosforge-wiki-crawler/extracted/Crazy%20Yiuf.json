{"title":"Crazy Yiuf","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Crazy_Yiuf","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Crazy Yiuf the Enlightened''' is a deranged [[unique]] [[Gnoll (monster)|gnoll]] who shouts gibberish while murdering trespassers. He always generates wearing a [[cloak]] and wielding a [[chaos]]-[[brand]]ed [[quarterstaff]], which has the potential to be extremely dangerous. He may occasionally generate with a powerful [[wand]] as well. \n\nHis vault is very distinct and recognizable: a stone chamber accessed through a characteristic uneven path, usually through [[tree]]s and occasionally blocked off by [[fungus|fungi]]. His hut is guaranteed to contain at least one [[hammer]]; sometimes, many hammers are scattered throughout its entrance. This vault is always blocked by a transparent [[runed door]].\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:2-7\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*His chaos quarterstaff can be very dangerous - it may heal you, or it may electrocute you for enough damage to one-shot some low XL characters. \n*Other than his quarterstaff, Crazy Yiuf is just a simple, 100% speed, melee monster with no resistances.\n**[[Spriggan]]s or [[haste]]d players can just [[kite]] him to death.\n**[[Tukima's Dance]] can disarm the quarterstaff, turning him into a relatively harmless opponent. A [[wand of paralysis]] or [[wand of polymorph]] can also do the trick.\n**A reasonably strong character (160 HP or so) can survive a string of worst-case chaos effects and just kill him.\n*Crazy Yiuf can wake up if you see him. So if you recognize his hut, you might want stay away until you're ready to fight him.\n**However, there can be [[artefact]] hammers inside or outside the hut. If you never plan on fighting Crazy Yiuf, it's worth checking out.\n*Note that you can be [[teleport]]ed or [[shaft#Exploration_Shafts|shaft]]ed inside Crazy Yiuf's hut.\n\n==Trivia==\nIf you are a follower of [[Xom]] or you've inflicted [[confusion]] on Yiuf, his dialogue will become... interesting.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], the worst-case effects of the [[chaos]] brand were more dangerous. You could be [[banish]]ed or [[paralysed]] for multiple turns, which made chaos attacks dangerous even to high level characters.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Crazy Yiuf's hut had maces instead of hammers.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], the door to Crazy Yiuf's hut was opaque.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Crazy Yiuf's hut had hammers instead of maces.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], you could find hammers as weapons outside Crazy Yiuf's hut."}

{"title":"Primal Wave","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Primal_Wave","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|Conjures a torrent of water that may knock back the target, and creates a pool of shallow water for a short duration.}}\n\n'''Primal Wave''' is a monster-only spell that causes massive amounts of water to surge into you, dealing significant damage, pushing you around, and turning the terrain beneath and near you to [[shallow water]] (if it isn't already). Fortunately, it cannot knock you into [[deep water]].\n\nThis spell deals 50% physical and 50% drowning damage. Amphibious ([[Barachim]], [[Merfolk]], [[Octopode]], grey [[Draconian]]), [[unbreathing]] ([[undead]] species, [[Gargoyle]], [[Djinni]], [[Death Form]], [[Statue Form]]), and [[aquatic]] creatures are immune to drowning, and will take a total of 50% damage from the spell.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nPlayers can produce a primal wave by [[evocations|evoking]] a [[phial of floods]]. This will also waterlog monsters caught in the wave, acting like [[Silence]] for those that need to breathe.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Primal Wave will no longer inflict collision damage when knocking a target into a wall. To compensate, the damage will be slightly increased.}}\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Primal Wave did a total of 60% damage to creatures that resisted it.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], the water generation was different.\n\n[[Category: Monster spells]]"}

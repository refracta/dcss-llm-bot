Each altar is dedicated to a single god. You can [[Choosing a god|convert to a god's religion]] by [[praying]] (command '''<''' or '''>''') at their altar. When you do this, you will be shown a description of the god and asked if you're ''sure'' you want to worship them, just in case. Altars are irrelevant to a religion once you've joined it.\n\nWorshiping a god will provide you with several useful abilities, but often comes with an associated cost or set of restricted actions. Failing to follow your god's code of conduct will result in being stripped of your benefits until you've made [[penance]]; you may also have to deal with [[divine retribution]]. As such, make your choice of god carefully.\n\nAltars to most gods can be found at the [[Ecumenical Temple]] (found between [[Dungeon]]:4-7). If you don't see a particular god's altar there, you are guaranteed to see one somewhere between D:3-10. There are a few exceptions to this rule:\n*Altars to [[Ignis]] may occasionally appear in a special layout of the Temple, but the most reliable way to worship Ignis is to start as a [[Cinder Acolyte]]\n*Altars to [[Beogh]] appear in or around the [[Orcish Mines]], and [[Hill Orc]]s may convert to Beogh's service any time an [[orc priest]], [[orc high priest]], or [[Saint Roka]] is in view.\n*Altars to [[Lugonu]] appear in the [[Abyss]] and rare Abyss-themed vaults, including a corrupted version of the Ecumenical Temple.\n*Altars to [[Jiyva]] appear in or around the [[Slime Pits]] and somewhat rare Slime-themed vaults, including around [[Lair]] and a different corrupted version of the Temple.\nAdditional altars to all the gods may appear anywhere in the game, but are not guaranteed.\n\n==Ashenzari==\n[[File:Ashenzari altar.png]] {{flavour|A broken altar of [[Ashenzari]].\n\nA crystal altar which shattered to pieces when Ashenzari was cursed.

Praying at it will convert you to an unknown god, and the altar's deity will greatly appreciate conversion at so ancient a site of worship.}}\n\nPraying at a [[faded altar]] will show you 3 random gods your species can worship and allow you to convert or cancel. If you convert, you will join a random god from those 3. This poses a risk, however, as the god may greatly clash with your strategy (getting Sif Muna for a melee character or Trog for a caster). To compensate, you'll begin with 20 extra piety. As their piety systems are unusual, Gozag waives the entry fee and Ru immediately offers a sacrifice.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], praying at altars was done with [[P|'''p''']].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], [[Zin]]'s donation, and [[Lugonu]], [[The Shining One]], and [[Kikubaaqudgha]]'s gifts could only be performed/received at altars. All of these have since been made into abilities.\n*Faded Altars were added in [[0.17]].\n\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

{"title":"Ball python","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ball_python","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{list of | snakes}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ball pythons''' are fast snakes found in the early [[Dungeon]]. While weaker than a [[hobgoblin]] or [[quokka]], ball pythons can [[constrict]] you with their attacks. Constriction has a chance to prevent you from moving, lowers [[evasion]], and deals minor damage every turn.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Ball pythons are weak and frail, but if they manage to constrict you, you'll start taking damage quickly. Try to kill them fast, and try not to fight them around other monsters.\n**[[Large]] species ([[Armataur]], [[Naga]], [[Oni]], [[Troll]]) are too big to be constricted by a ball python, so these species have little to fear.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.33|ball pythons will be nerfed. Their bite damage will be lowered from 3 to 2, and their EV will be lowered from 11 to 9.}}\n*Prior to [[0.27]], ball pythons dealt 1 less damage in melee.\n*Prior to [[0.25]] you could create your own ball pythons with the [[Sticks to Snakes]] spell.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], ball pythons were known as small snakes, and had a weak [[poison]]ous bite instead of a constriction attack. Also, they were tiny sized.\n\n[[Category: Monsters]]"}

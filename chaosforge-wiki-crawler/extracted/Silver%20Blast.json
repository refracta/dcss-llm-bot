Although it's capable of dealing tremendous amounts of damage, it is designed to only affect chaotic and evil targets, so most characters will resist the majority of it. After base damage is calculated, all targets then have that damage reduced to only 5% of that amount for each acquired [[mutation]] they possess (innate mutations do not increase the damage dealt, but [[demonspawn mutations]] do). Shapeshifted monsters and characters will always take full damage, while undead characters and followers of chaotic [[god]]s always take at least 33%.\n\nA peculiar side effect of this spell is that the target is occasionally cured of their mutations. This usually targets [[good mutations]], but occasionally affects [[bad mutations|bad]].\n\nThe following monsters cast Silver Blast:\n*{{monsterlink|Silver star}}\n\n==History==\nSilver Blast was removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

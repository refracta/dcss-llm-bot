{"title":"Shadow dragon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shadow_dragon","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n{{list of | dragons}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Shadow dragons''' are terrifying [[list of dragons|dragonkind]] whose breath and bite attacks inflict [[draining]]. Characters that lack resistance to [[negative energy]] may find themselves severely handicapped after combat with one if they allow the fight to go on too long. They are uncommon, usually only appearing in [[the Depths]], [[the Realm of Zot]], and the lowest floor of [[the Vaults]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Negative energy]] resistance will significantly reduce the effect of their draining, providing complete immunity with three ranks. If you have good reason to suspect a shadow dragon is coming (Vaults:5 is almost a guarantee), it's not a bad idea to come packing a [[ring of positive energy]] or other rN+ sources. [[Ghoul]]s, [[mummies]], and bloodless [[vampire]]s need not worry, as they come with innate rN+++ and a shadow dragon's physical damage output is far less terrifying than its withering breath.\n**If you don't have a ring available, you can gain complete immunity to negative energies by drinking a [[potion of lignification]] and entering [[Tree Form]]. This does prevent you from escaping, however, so this strategy is best used in situations where you know a shadow dragon is the only thing you have to worry about.\n**If negative energy resistance is not an option, high [[ev]]asion will allow you to dodge many of their breath attacks, although not infallibly. [[Repel Missiles]] will help further, if you can get it. In any case, kill them as quickly as possible to limit their opportunities to drain you.\n*Although shadow dragons aren't undead, they have the standard undead [[cold]] resistance, [[poison]] resistance, and immunity to negative energy. Being neither demonic nor undead, however, they are not susceptible to weapons of [[holy wrath]]. [[The Shining One]]'s Cleansing Flame is quite effective against them, however, as they are still considered [[evil]].\n*Killing a shadow dragon may provide [[shadow dragon scales]], a body armour that provides very solid physical protection and better [[stealth]] capabilities than even a [[robe]], but with significant penalties to [[ev]]asion and [[spell success]] rates.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], shadow dragons occasionally dropped hides when butchered that could be make into [[shadow dragon armour]] with a [[scroll of enchant armour]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], shadow dragons produced no hides.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], shadow dragons were even more obnoxious. They were special-cased to flee from combat when moderately injured, only returning to drain you further after getting several spaces away from you while you fought other foes."}

{"title":"Boulder beetle","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Boulder_beetle","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Boulder beetles''' are among the most massive bugs in the game, using their brutal melee attacks and decent [[AC]] whenever a player lets them get into melee. This is made easier with their rolling ability, which doubles their speed and damage for a short time. They need a tile of space in order to roll, but they can also leap away from their prey to set up the opportunity.\n\nBoulder beetles can be found in the mid-to-late [[Dungeon]], as well as in all parts of [[the Lair]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Be cautious around boulder beetles; any moment when they're not adjacent to you is a moment they could suddenly gain a huge burst of speed and power.\n*Their rolling attack is essentially a double-strength regular attack and follows many of the same rules. Characters with a decent [[sh]]ield or [[ev]]asion stand a chance of avoiding the attack outright, while characters relying on their armour to protect them will have a harder time of it. Placing an ally (such as [[summon]]s, [[Hepliaklqana]]'s ancestor, or even [[Fulminant Prism]]) in the path of their rolling charge will safely unleash the attack, and stop the roll.\n*Boulder beetles are vulnerable to [[poison]], so [[Poison Magic]] or even poisoned [[dart]]s work well. Due to their tendency to blink away, a [[scroll of poison]] is ''very'' effective. [[Curare]] is also great, since it slows them down.\n*They've also got weak [[willpower]] and only moderate [[HD]], so [[Hexes]] or disabling [[wand]]s can stop them fairly easily.\n*If you find one in the Dungeon, remember that boulder beetles can't open [[door]]s, and won't knock them over when rolling.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], boulder beetles dealt 32 damage (64 when rolling).\n*Prior to [[0.28]], incapacitating a boulder beetle did not stop them from rolling.\n*Boulder beetles returned in [[0.26]] with a new rolling mechanic.\n*Boulder beetles were removed in [[0.19]]. They were slower than average, and their rolling was subject to inertia (similar to an [[orb of destruction]], they would keep rolling in a straight line until they hit something).\n*Prior to [[0.11]], boulder beetles could not roll at you."}

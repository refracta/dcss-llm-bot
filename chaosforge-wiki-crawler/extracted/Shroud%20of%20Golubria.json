[[Spell power]] increases the spell's duration, but has no impact on its success rate. It may be cast again while still active to increase duration.\n\n{{crawlquote|'''Duration''': 7 + 2d(spell power) turns<br>'''Max Duration''': 50 turns<ref>{{source ref|0.25.1|spl-selfench.cc|220}}</ref>}}\n\n==Success Rate==\nFirst off, the Shroud only comes into play for melee attacks that you do not [[Dodging|dodge]] or [[Shields|block]]; it has no effect on ranged attacks of any sort. Of these attacks, there is a 33.3% chance that it will simply ignore the shroud and deal damage normally. Assuming that this event does ''not'' occur, damage is then calculated as normal ([[AC]] and [[GDR]] are applied) to determine whether the attack is deflected or if it causes the shroud to unravel.\n\nEach attack that the shroud affects has a\n\n Damage / (Damage + 10)<ref>{{source ref|0.25.1|melee-attack.cc|547}}</ref>\n\nchance of causing the shroud to collapse and dealing damage as normal. If the shroud does not collapse, the attack is negated. This means that an attack that would deal 10 damage has equal odds of collapsing the shroud, being negated, or affecting you normally. Weaker attacks are more likely to be deflected, while stronger attacks are more likely to get through.\n\n[[File:Shroud3.png]]\n\n==Strategy==\nShroud of Golubria provides the caster with a surprising amount of safety for a level 2 spell. It works best when preventing large numbers of weak attacks, making it very effective in the early game or when the caster has significant AC and GDR. Even fragile characters can benefit from it, as it requires little [[MP]] to prepare before a fight and even an additional 10% chance of avoiding attacks can be useful. That being said, consider it a very worthwhile investment for otherwise magic-free, low-[[intelligence]] medium armour characters. Their low spell power won't hamper the spell too heavily, and these characters can also benefit from [[Apportation]], [[Blink]], and [[Swiftness]], all low-level utility spells based off the same schools of magic.\n\n==History==\n*Shroud of Golubria was removed with the rest of the [[Charms]] school in [[0.26]].\n*Shroud of Golubria was added in [[0.9]].\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

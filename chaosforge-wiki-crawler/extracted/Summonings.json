{"title":"Summonings","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summonings","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Summonings''' is a magical skill that governs your ability at bringing forth monsters and other entities to fight for you, though unskilled practitioners may summon a hostile [[nameless horror]] instead. [[Summon|Summoned monsters]] are very similar to regular monsters, though are temporary and unable to follow you through stairs.\n\nNote that there is one spell in this school of magic that does not create summoned monsters: [[eldritch tentacle]]s, which can be created with the [[Malign Gateway]] spell and cannot be abjured.\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n{{spell table by level|Summoning}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{spell sources|Summoning|Book of Beasts,Book of Callings,Book of Dangerous Friends,Book of the Wilderness,Grand Grimoire}}\n\n==Duration==\nSummoned monsters are generated with a duration between 1 and 6. This value roughly corresponds to the following amount in [[aut]] (arbitrary units of time; 10 aut = 1 \"turn\"):\n\n# 90 aut \n# 180 aut\n# 270 aut\n# 360 aut\n# 810 aut\n# 1710 aut\n\nSome Summonings spells have a fixed duration. The other spells will increase monster duration with spell power.\n\n==Summoning Limits==\nMost Summonings spells also have a cap on how many monsters of that type you can sustain at any one time. Exceeding that cap by casting the spell too often will cause the oldest monsters to time out almost immediately.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n!

[[Shadow Creatures]] is removed as a player castable spell, with a new level 6 spell [[Summon Cactus Giant]].\n*In [[0.27]], [[Summon Demon]] and [[Summon Greater Demon]] were removed from player casting ([[Makhleb]] can still summon demons).\n*In [[0.26]], the last two utility spells were removed from this magic school: [[Aura of Abjuration]] and [[Recall]].\n*In [[0.25]], Summonings miscasts produce [[nameless horror]]s. Monsters summoned by the player dismiss if the player harms them or they would become hostile for some other reason, rather than attacking the player. Also, summoned monsters can get the [[Status_effects#Inner_Flame|inner flame status]] from the [[Inner Flame|spell]] and the [[scroll of immolation]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], [[warding]] provided partial protection from melee and ranged attacks of summoned creatures.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], summoned creatures could exist even after their summoner was defeated, leading to much more cautious behavior around certain enemy summoners. Many enemy summoners were also much more fragile and were not subject to the same summoning caps as players. 0.14 also massively overhauled the Summonings spell list; [[Summon Lightning Spire]], [[Summon Guardian Golem]], [[Summon Forest]], [[Summon Mana Viper]], [[Monstrous Menagerie]], [[Aura of Abjuration]], [[Forceful Dismissal]], and [[Spellforged Servitor]] were all added, replacing [[Summon Scorpions]], [[Summon Ugly Thing]], [[Mass Abjuration]], [[Demonic Horde]], and [[Summon Dragon]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Summonings spells had no limit on how many monsters you could summon at a time, barring MP restrictions. This led to players summoning hordes of monsters at all times, rendering them nearly untouchable by most monsters and leading to extremely dull optimal gameplay.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], summoned monsters could attack monsters outside of the player's [[line of sight]], and you could not recall flying monsters over [[lava]] or [[deep water]].\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Summoner]]\n*[[Summon]]\n\n{{Skills}}\n[[Category:Magic skills]]"}

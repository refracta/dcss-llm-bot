They start with a scroll of blinking, a selection of translocation spells, some dispersal boomerangs, a simple weapon of their choice, and leather armour.}}\n'''Warpers''' specialize in [[Translocations]]. While their school of magic lacks destructive power, they enter the [[Dungeon]] with a bit more combat training than most mages.\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Draconian]], [[Armataur]], [[Spriggan]], and [[Felid]] are the recommended species if you pick a Warper Background.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[weapon of choice]] ([[hand axe]], [[spear]], [[short sword]], [[falchion]] or [[mace]], or [[unarmed]])\n*7 [[dart]]s of [[dispersal (brand)|dispersal]]\n*+0 [[leather armour]]\n*[[Scroll of blinking]]\n\n'''Available Spells:'''\n*[[Blink]]\n*[[Lesser Beckoning]]\n*[[Vhi's Electric Charge]]\n*[[Teleport Other]]\n*[[Manifold Assault]]\n\nWarpers do not start with a spell memorised.\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Fighting]]: 2\n*Chosen Weapon's Skill: 2\n*[[Throwing]]: 1\n*[[Armour]]: 1\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Spellcasting]]: 2\n*[[Translocations]]: 3\n\nChoosing Warper adds 3 to your starting [[Strength]], 5 to your starting [[Intelligence]] and 4 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nWarpers lack the focus of a [[Fighter]] or [[Conjurer]] - they are a melee start with a few utility (Translocations) spells. While none of their spells are usable at XL 1, having these spells available can be helpful in the long run.\n\nAt first, focus more on being able to kill foes reliably - beginner Translocations won't help you kill enemies. This means melee skills, or any possibly [[Ranged Weapon]]s you find. Warpers should be comfortable with wearing heavier armour, foregoing their mage half until they can comfortably fight things. Warpers don't start with particularly good gear in any one offensive category, but are compensated with a really strong escape item, a scroll of blinking.\n\nOnce you get your spells up, dangerous early monsters like [[ogre (monster)|ogres]] can be softened up from a distance with boomerangs or any heavier [[Throwing]] weapons you've found. If they get too close, you can [[Blink]] away or use your weapons of dispersal. Once you've found some decent equipment, then you can focus on higher-level spells or branch out into other kinds of magic.\n\nStarting as a Warper is a good choice for players who wish to worship [[Cheibriados]] later, since you'll likely have an alternate means of escape online by the time Cheibriados starts slowing you down. Being a Warper also works well for characters who wanted to use medium or heavy armour, since most of their spells are simple enough that even big dumb bruisers can cast them well if they work at it.\n\n===Spell Details===\nWarper spells are useful to have, but not essential to start training for immediately.\n\n[[Blink]] remains useful for the entire game. It teleports you to a random location, meaning it most likely will create space from your opponent. Its random nature means it isn't a reliable escape, so use it ''before'' things get hairy. [[Lesser Beckoning]] is another spell like Blink. With enough Translocations investment, you can drag enemies back into melee range.\n\n[[Vhi's Electric Charge]] allows you to charge up to enemies. For every tile you travel (up to 4), you'll get an attack boost.\n\n[[Teleport Other]] can help you avoid or delay dangerous fights. Like [[Hexes]], it checks [[willpower]]. [[Gell's Gravitas]] and [[Lesser Beckoning]] allow you to control the position of enemies. Gravitas pulls monsters toward each other, while Beckoning brings enemies close.\n\n[[Manifold Assault]] is an expensive spell to get running, and at first you won't have enough MP for it to work. But it allows attacking multiple enemies in your [[line of sight]], which is just as powerful as it sounds.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Warpers had [[Gell's Gravitas]] rather than [[Vhi's Electric Charge]].\n*In [[0.29]], Warpers gained 2 more [[boomerang]]s of [[dispersal]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Warpers started with the [[book of Spatial Translocations]], which had [[Passage of Golubria]] instead of [[Manifold Assault]]. \n*Prior to [[0.19]], the [[book of Spatial Translocations]] had [[Apportation]], a level 1 spell that Warpers would start with memorised.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], warpers started with a stack of darts, a stack of darts of dispersal, and 50 [[gold]].\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

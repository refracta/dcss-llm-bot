However, the stipulations make it less effective than it may seem. It has no damage [[brand]], meaning it suffers in comparison to other two-handers. It requires a lot of skill to use practically, swinging slower and even less accurately than a base bardiche. Just being a two-handed weapon works against it; many characters won't want to give up their off-hand, and [[kobold]]s and [[spriggan]]s are outright incapable of using it.\n\nThis weapon isn't the greatest against single targets. Still, if you have ever dreamed of striking 20-ish enemies with a single swing, the lochaber axe can make that happen.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the lochaber axe did not drain on unequip.\n*The lochaber axe was reintroduced in [[0.29]] as an [[unrand]] [[artefact]], with the same base stats as a pre-reaching bardiche.\n*In [[0.4]], lochaber axes were renamed to [[bardiche]]s.\n*This weapon was introduced in [[0.1]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]] [[Category:Polearms]]"}

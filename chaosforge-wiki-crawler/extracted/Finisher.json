Its extraordinary speed is the work of a mad wizard, who spent years refining it before discarding it in a fit of rage.}}\n[[File:Scythe_finisher.png]] '''''the +5 scythe \"Finisher\"'''''\n\n+5 [[scythe]] (modified [[halberd]]; base damage 14, base delay 20)\n\n[[Speed brand|Speed]] brand<br>\n<code>(50 - [[HD]])/200</code> chance to instantly kill monster on successful attack\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Finisher'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|466}}</ref> has a horrendous base delay, though it's mitigated by the speed brand. This eccentric combination gives Finisher a fast [[minimum delay]], but only at very high skill levels. The â€‹chance to instantly kill your target makes it quite an appealing weapon: it ranges from about a 1-in-4 chance to kill [[goblin]]s and the like, to about a 1-in-10 chance to kill [[orbs of fire]].\n\nFinisher doesn't stand out as much later on in the game, where you can generally find a [[glaive]] or [[bardiche]] with a good brand and a much better ratio of damage to speed, but it's still a weapon worth considering if you find it early. Do what you can to improve your attack speed in tough fights -- a [[potion of haste]] or [[Okawaru]]'s Finesse will let you try to instagib your opponents more often.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], Finisher's base weapon, a [[scythe]], lost its unique stats. This weapon retains those stats, except that it gained +1 accuracy in the process.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], players could use Finisher with the [[Spectral Weapon]] spell. The evisceration property applied to the spectral copy's attacks as well, effectively doubling the chance to one-shot enemies.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], Finisher did not have a chance to instantly kill, but did have +3 [[strength]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Finisher had a +3, +5 enchantment level.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Polearms]]"}

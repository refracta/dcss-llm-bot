The number of heads is <code>spell power / 10</code><ref>{{source ref|0.26.1|transform.cc|1723}}</ref>, up to 20 heads\n*Gain innate [[AC]] based on spell power: <code>6 + 5 * spell power / 100</code><ref>{{source ref|0.26.1|transform.cc|254}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.26.1|form-data.h|245}}</ref>\n*Ability to heal by devouring any edible monster upon kill (amount healed based on monster HD). Any monster with a [[corpse]] considered edible, including [[undead]] ([[ghoul (monster)|ghoul]]s, [[death scarab]]s, etc.).\n*Fast swimming speed\n\n===Cons===\n*All equipment slots except for [[ring]]s and [[amulet]]s meld into the new form\n*Big size penalizes [[ev]]asion\n\n==Strategy==\nHydra Form provides the caster with some rather extreme strengths and weaknesses for its duration. This form drastically reduces the caster's defensive stats: no armour or defensive [[mutation]]s means that the caster's [[AC]] will drop dramatically, and the increase in size will make all but the most nimble and well-trained [[Dodging|dodgers]] into sitting ducks for its duration.\n\nTo make up for this, the caster is given a significant boost to HP, a massive increase in damage output (assuming many heads), and a significant amount of healing each time you defeat a monster which leaves an edible corpse. At its best, this amounts to an extraordinarily powerful [[vampiric]]-branded [[Unarmed Combat]] attack that specializes in taking out large groups of enemies. Also, the cleaving effect is superior to that provided by [[axes]] (secondary opponents do not take reduced damage), and unlike with natural hydras, you only make a single attack against your target, allowing Hydra Form to devastate even high-AC opponents. Unfortunately, these factors only come together in niche circumstances.\n\nGetting enough heads for Hydra Form to become truly devastating is difficult. Your headcount is based on your [[spell power]] and there are very few spell enhancers for the Transmutations school of magic. You cannot gain heads by having them chopped off by enemy bladed weapons, either.\n\nThe pseudo-vampiric cleaving effect is very impressive under the right circumstances (Vaults:5 is very delicious, for example), but bear in mind that areas without edible corpses suddenly render the powerful healing effect completely useless. On top of that, the healing effect only kicks in once you've killed an opponent; until that point, it does nothing. A string of unlucky misses or an encounter with a powerful, durable [[unique]] may get you killed, no matter how delicious your opponent may be.\n\nFinally, bear in mind that the significant damage output of Hydra Form is nearly matched (at least against a single opponent) by the level 5 spell [[Blade Hands]], particularly for characters with high [[strength]]. This alternative leaves your defenses largely untouched and is much easier to get up and running in almost all circumstances. Unlike Hydra Form, Blade Hands does have the downside of reducing your spell success rate, but this won't be an issue if you only planned on punching your opponents for the next dozen turns anyway.\n\nAs with its bigger brother [[Dragon Form]], Hydra Form benefits greatly from support magic such as [[Ozocubu's Armour]].\n\n==History==\n*Hydra form was removed in [[0.27]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], hydra form had a very short duration. Also, this form could devour only monsters with [[chunk|edible corpses]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], this form could not devour Big and Giant [[size]] monsters.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], this form had a +8 Str bonus. Also, the number of heads wasn't fixed and the caster could grow extra heads when hit with chopping weapons. Enemies with flaming weapons could lop off the caster's heads, ending the transformation if there were no heads left.\n*Hydra Form was added in [[0.16]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]\n[[Category:Transformation]]"}

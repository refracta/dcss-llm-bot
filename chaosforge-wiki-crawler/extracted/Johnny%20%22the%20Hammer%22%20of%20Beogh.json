{"title":"Johnny \"the Hammer\" of Beogh","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Johnny_%22the_Hammer%22_of_Beogh","type":"raw","data":"{{diary}}\n\nI, Johnny the Hammer, know not what shall become of me, but I shall write all that happens so others might succeed where I fail. I am sent into this dungeon by my mighty and just lord Beogh. I am to retrieve an orb for him, and I write all my adventures in hope that someone might benefit from them someday. Not like the average orc can read though....Anyways. I shall first tell of my life before coming to this dungeon.\n<br>\n<br>\nFirst the history of my name; My parents, being cruel orcs like most, decided it would be amusing to name me Johnny so that I would always be made fun of by the other young orcs. Such is how I got my first name. I received the title \"the Hammer\" for as soon as I could lift a hammer above my head I struck down my parents. This caught the attention of the local priest and so started my life in the service of our great and gracious lord Beogh. They wished to make me a wizard after discovering I was gifted with a much higher then average intellect but I refused. My life belonged to our lord. 19 years later, I start my journey into the depths...\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n''''Entry 1, Day 1''''\n\nArmed with nothing but a robe, a rather average axe, and a meat ration, I start my journey. After working my way through a rather puzzling passageway of doors I find a small woodland creature. I take a moment to ponder how such a creature could have made it into this foul place and then promptly sink my axe deep into its skull. I take a moment to offer a prayer to Beogh, he seems pleased. I decide that killing helpless animals seems like the best way to please my mighty lord and I start off once again.\n<br>\n<br>\n''''Entry 2, Day 1''''\n\nI find another rat thinking I could slay it easily, but this rat must have been slightly more intelligent for he managed to bite a chunk of flesh from my leg. Screaming profanities I send it to it's doom. Angry, I continue along the corridor but I find my way blocked by a short angry looking man armed with a club. I dive forward hoping to kill him quickly but he manages to thump me quite hard. He continues to beat me, my attacks doing nothing. On the threshold of death, I whisper, \"Beogh protect.\" I feel bolstered and I sidestep the next blow. Taking advantage of the opening in the creatures defenses, I sink my axe deep into the chest of the foul thing. I kick it off the small blade of my axe and watch as its lifeblood spills on the floor...I feel good. A short rest, and then I shall continue.\n<br>\n<br>\n''''Entry 3, Day 1''''\n\nYet another foul looking creature is found at the end of this room. This one also being short, but much more vile. It starts to through small metal tipped darts at me as I charge it. Half way there I realize that I have 5 darts protruding from my stomach. this creature shall die for its insolence. Upon reaching axe range, we start the dance known as combat. The creature, being very quick, dodges many of my blows, but I dodge many of his. It seems an even fight until the creature stumbled. Seizing the opportunity I swing my axe first into his its knee, then up into the bottom of its jaw. Another kill for my powerful and loving god Beogh.\n<br>\n<br>\n''''Entry 4, Day 1''''\n\nI killed 4 more of the short angry creatures another rat and what looked like an over-sized newt. I also found some oddly colored potions. Offering a prayer to my lord, I down all four potions. The first one I drank healed all of the wounds I had sustained so far, the second also healing what few wounds remained. Upon drinking the third I felt quite refreshed, my mind was rested and so were my muscles. The fourth however, I could feel my intelligence leaving me, words became harder to think of and I began to feel more and more inclined to kill everything in sight. I must stay strong and pray the my intellect returns.\n<br>\n<br>\n''''Entry 5, Day 1''''\n\nAfter sinking my axe into a bat, I felt power course through my veins. My lord has blessed me. He gave me the power to bring his divine might upon my foes. I also find that I fell stronger. My experiences in the dungeon must be paying off. I feel like I can tackle much stronger foes.\n<br>\n<br>\n''''Entry 6, Day 1''''\n\nThis place is filled with the strangest of things. I have found traps that shoot out darts, magic scrolls, potions of strange affects and many short angry men and small woodland creatures. Also snakes and newts and geckos and bats. And many wonderous things like darts that explode on impact and glowing needles dipped in poison. This is only the first floor. Filled with a morbid curiosity for more, I descend unto the second level of the dungeon.\n<br>\n<br>\n''''Entry 7, Day 1''''\n\nAfter killing a few things on the second level of the dungeon, I realized that my stomach was growling. Using my axe, I cut up a rat and eat the flesh raw. It tastes quite unpleasant, but it is filling. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a glowing cloak. I rush over to it and don it as fast as I can. Ii feels very sturdy, like it could perhaps deflect some of the attacks sent my way. Exploring only a little more, I find a glowing ring that seems to make my armor stronger. I also find a much larger axe, That's glowing! It has many rune inscribed on it. with this axe I can send even more to there doom for my great and perfect lord Beogh.\n<br>\n<br>\n''''Entry 8, Day 1''''\n\nUpon further exploration of this level of the dungeon, I found yet another potion and some ring mail. First I decide to chug the potion. I quickly realize that I am no longer visible! The uses this potion could offer should I find another. Then, rather comically I presume, I put on the ring mail. I sneak into the next room still invisible and find a sleeping short angry man (I have taken to calling then goblins). I bury my axe into the goblin and kill it before it can awaken. If only all of my battles were this simple. I proceeded to clear the rest of the level, finding nothing of interest. I continue down to dungeon level 3.\n<br>\n<br>\n''''Entry 9, Day 1''''\n\nAfter exploring the first room of the third level, I proceeded down a corridor. Looking into the next room I saw a feminine figure wearing long flowing robes and holding a staff of wood in her hands. Her eyes were glowing red and her hands looked almost as if they were on fire. I had seen this before in the spellcasters of my hometown. Preparing myself for a challenging fight I run forward. I sprint and I bring my broad axe down, removing her right arm from her body and knocking her to the ground. As I stand above her ready to deal the killing blow she shoots her foul magic at me. I quickly dodged to the side but still the magic hit me. It only glanced my body though doing little to hurt me. I step back over her and bring down my axe, parting her from her remaining arm. I then proceed to liberate her legs from her body. Finally, I removed her head with one last fell swing of my axe. In the name of Beogh!\n<br>\n<br>\n''''Entry 10, Day 2''''\n\nI took a short rest after killing the female spellcaster, and it dawned on me. I had been in this amazing and dangerous place for over a day. I continued on. In the next room I saw two pulsating blobs, they bubbled and spilled over themselves. I know Immediately that these creatures could devour me with ease. With no other choice I turned and headed back to the stairs for dungeon level 2. I looked back as I ran and I saw the jelly like creature devour a pile of cold coins and divide itself spawning another creature. I ran faster.\n<br>\n<br>\n''''Entry 11, Day 2''''\n\nAfter escaping the jelly things, I descended back to dungeon level 3. I snuck to the place where I had last found the jellies and there I found an altar to some god named Jiyva. Looking at his altar I caught a glimpse of his power. This god could make me all powerful, he could let me summon minions to devour all in my path. I shook my head. \"I am a follower of Beogh,\" I said to myself, but I marked down the location of this altar should I ever come back. I turn around. The jellies are back. Sick of running I brace myself for their attack. I swing my smaller axe into their mass leaving large holes. I am forced to drink one of the potion thats heals but I win nonetheless. Let the journey continue.\n<br>\n<br>\n''''Entry 12, Day 2''''\n\nI continued exploring and killing. After slaying yet another goblin, (they are really quite numerous), I felt much stronger and much more experienced. I noticed that my muscles had grown already from the fighting I had been doing, and my knowledge of fighting and of axes had increased greatly since my arrival. Dungeon 3 is almost finished I shall right upon descending to dungeon level 4.\n<br>\n<br>\n''''Entry 13, Day 2''''\n\nI almost lost my life yet again. I was caught unawares by 2 jelly creatures, Sprinting I managed to make it back to the second level of the dungeon. I have decided that dungeon level 3 is too dangerous and I shall move directly on to the fourth level. Beogh protect.\n<br>\n<br>\n''''Entry 14, Day 2''''\n\nIn the first room of the fourth level, I found a small stone building with assorted items and a man. I realized that this was a shop. Who in Beogh's name would make a shop in this hellhole? Deciding not to look a gift horse in the mouth, I went over to check his wares. I saw slimy looking ankus. It would be mine. But sadly it cost 210 gold pieces, I had 108. But I would be back for that ankus. On the ground next to the store I found some gloves. Hoping the shopkeeper wouldn't yell at me I took the gloves and left.\n\n''''Entry last, Day 3''''\n\nMy life is gone. A mummy casted his foul necromantic magic on me ripping my insides to shreds. He then, using his bare hands, ripped my body in to pieces. Beware the mum...........\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAnd so ends the tale of Johnny \"the Hammer\""}

Good targets in the late-game include [[lich]]es, [[curse skull]]s and [[curse toe]]s, as well as [[death cob]]s. If found early enough, [[Necromancer]]s can use it to take out [[wight]]s and other early-D enemies.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Dispel Undead is very effective against [[player ghost]]s; player ghosts often have tremendous AC/EV, and Dispel Undead ignores all defenses.\n*Keep in mind that it only affects undead, not [[demon]]s. Necromancers will need another way to kill foes immune to negative energy.\n\n==Monster Version==\n{{monsters with spell}}\nPlayer ghosts can cast this spell if they knew it in life.\n\nSeveral monsters have access to a ranged version of this spell, [[Dispel Undead Range]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Dispel Undead was a level 5 spell with range 5.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], Dispel Undead was a level 4 spell."}

{"title":"Prince Ribbit","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Prince_Ribbit","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Prince Ribbit''' is a [[unique]] [[blink frog]] (formerly a [[human (monster)|human]]) who behaves almost exactly like a regular blink frog, except for the fact that he's somewhat weaker and can arrive dangerously early on. Although you can't cure him of his curse in life, he leaves a human corpse once killed.\n\n==Location==\n===Solo===\n*[[The Dungeon]]:5-9\n*[[Bailey]]\n\n===With several [[blink frog]]s (rare)===\n*[[The Lair]]:1-3\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Players unaccustomed to blink frogs can expect fast movement speed, decently powerful melee damage, no resistances, excellent [[ev]]asion, and an irritating tendency to blink away from you after attacking. These blinks can be useful, however, giving you a few turns to pelt him from afar or to [[quaff]] a [[potion of heal wounds]]. Don't just [[tab]] at him; play smart and react to his blinks intelligently.\n*His [[willpower]] isn't too high, so a [[wand of paralysis]] or various [[Hexes]] may come in handy for either pinning him down or making a getaway. Alternatively, just wait for him to blink away from the stairs and make your escape.\n*Damage over time, like [[poison]] or [[Sticky Flame]], can be very useful for continuing to damage him while he's blinking around all over the place. You might even manage to kill him after he teleports away from you.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The curse Prince Ribbit is under is so strong that he cannot be polymorphed into a human.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|mon-poly.cc|135}}</ref>. The curse is only lifted once he dies.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Prince Ribbit could cast [[Teleport Self]] when low on health. Also, he couldn't spawn in a [[bailey]].\n*Before [[0.19]], Prince Ribbit, like his [[blink frog]] brethren, was immune to the effects of [[distortion]] weapons and would actually be healed by them 20% of the time.\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

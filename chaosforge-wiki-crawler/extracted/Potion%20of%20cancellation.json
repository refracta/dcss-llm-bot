It also reduces magical contamination.}}\n\nQuaffing a '''potion of cancellation''' immediately ends nearly all [[status effects]] you may be enjoying/suffering from. It also removes 1000-5000 points of [[magic contamination]]. The potion's description lists all your current status effects that can be removed by the potion.\n\n==Dispellable Effects==\nThese are also the effects that can be ended from [[Quicksilver Bolt]] (including the [[wand of quicksilver]]) and [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]]. The list of all affected [[status effect]]s is as follows:<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|duration-data.h|L159}}</ref> \n\n===The Bad===\n*Many action disabling effects:\n**[[Bad form]]s\n**-[[Blink]]\n**[[Confusion]]\n**[[Dimension Anchor]] (-Tele)\n**[[Cause Fear|Fear]]\n**[[Mesmerise]]d\n**[[Miscast effects|Locked Down]] (Stuck)\n**[[Petrify]]ing\n**[[Silence]] (when used on the source of the aura; e.g. the potion works if you cast the spell, but not if an enemy cast the spell)\n*Many debuffs:\n**[[Corona]]\n**[[Acid#Corrosion|Corroded]]\n**[[Slow]]\n**[[Vertigo]]\n**[[Weak|Weakness]]\n**[[Frozen]]\n*Elemental [[vulnerability|vulnerabilities]]:\n**[[Fire]] vulnerability (rF-)\n**[[Strip Willpower]] (Will-)\n**[[Virulence]] (rPois-)\n**[[Scroll of vulnerability|Weak-willed]] (Will 1/2)\n*Other effects:\n**[[Flayed ghost|Flayed]]\n**[[Doom hound|Howl]]\n**[[Sap Magic]]\n**[[Sentinel's Mark]]\n**[[Sticky Flame]] (Fire)\n\n===The Good===\n*[[Teleport]]ing\n*Most effects available from [[potion]]s, excluding [[berserk]]:\n**[[Potion of attraction|Attraction]]\n**[[Potion of ambrosia|Ambrosia]]\n**[[Brilliance]]\n**[[Haste]]\n**[[Invisible]]\n**[[Might]]\n**[[Resistance]]\n**[[Agility]] (formerly from a [[potion of agility|potion]])\n*[[Necromancy]] spells:\n**[[Animate Dead]]\n**[[Death Channel]]\n*Certain other spells:\n**[[Confusing Touch]]\n**[[Disjunction]]\n**[[Leda's Liquefaction|Liquefying]]\n**[[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]]\n**[[Ozocubu's Armour]]\n**[[Portal Projectile]]\n**[[Swiftness]]\n**[[Wereblood]]\n\n===Resistant Status Effects===\nRather than being dispelled outright, these status effects will have their duration set to 1 turn.\n*[[Flight]]\n*All [[Transmutations]] not listed above\n\n===Monster Status Effects===\nThese statuses can be cancelled normally, but are either exclusive to monsters, or a player wouldn't be able to act while in the status (where a monster's [[Quicksilver Bolt]] can end it).\n\n*[[Antimagic]] (only a status for monsters)\n*[[Bind Souls]], [[Simulacrum]]\n*[[Inner Flame]]\n*[[Repel Missiles]]\n*[[Word of Recall]]\n*[[Paralysis]]\n*[[Petrify|Petrified]] \n*[[Sleep]]\n\n==Unaffected Status Effects==\n===The Bad===\n*[[Draining]]\n*[[Barbs]]\n*No Potions / No Scrolls\n*[[Poison]]\n*Action cooldowns:\n**-[[Berserk]]\n**-[[Death's Door|DDoor]]\n**[[Exhaustion]]\n**-[[Barachi|Hop]]\n\n===The Good===\n*[[Berserk]]\n*[[Death's Door]]\n*[[Dragon's Call]]\n*[[Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling]] (though it ends if you do anything but wait)\n*[[Powered By Death]]\n*[[Polar Vortex]]\n*[[Thunderdome#Quad damage|Quad Damage]]\n*All [[god]]-granted status effects\n\n==Strategy==\nPotions of cancellation are rare, but quite useful. It can remove many dangerous status effects, such as [[Petrify]]. [[Mark]], and [[bad form]]s. It can also remove contamination in a pinch.\n\nNote that cancellation will also remove many useful statuses, such as Haste and Tele, so be careful. This makes monsters with Quicksilver Bolt some of the more dangerous foes in the game.\n\nPotions of cancellation aren't common, so try to conserve them if you can afford to. The following statuses may be ended via other sources:\n*[[Confusion]] - quaffing a [[potion of curing]]\n*[[Teleport]] - reading another [[scroll of teleportation]]\n*[[Slow]] - negated by [[haste]]\n\n==History==\n*The list of the cancellable effects was added to the potion's description in [[0.27]].\n*Potions of cancellation were added in [[0.15]], partially taking the role of [[scrolls of vulnerability]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{potions}}"}

The caster's melee damage, both unarmed and with weapons, is substantially increased. The caster's stone body is immune to poison and miasma, and gains resistance to electricity and negative energy. High power increases the armour granted by this form.\n\nWhile transformed, any equipped body armour, gloves and boots are melded.}}\n\n'''Statue Form''' is a level 6 [[Transmutations]]/[[Earth Magic]] spell which changes the caster into stone; strong and durable, but moves and acts slowly.\n\n==Useful Info==\nCasting this spell gives you Statue Form for a spellpower-dependent duration. You'll gain the following:\n\n'''Combat Bonuses'''\n* '''HP Bonus:''' 130% HP\n* '''Innate AC:''' <code>20 + 12 * pow/100</code> [[AC]] (20-38 AC)\n* '''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' 12 base damage.\n* All melee damage is increased by 50% (after [[AC]] is applied).\n\n'''Resistances'''\n* [[Poison resistance|Poison immunity]]\n* [[Electricity resistance|rElec]]\n* [[Life protection|rN+]]\n* rTorment (50% damage from torment, stacks with rN)\n* '''[[Non-living]]:''' [[Unbreathing]], lacks [[blood]], immune to [[sleep]] and [[petrification]]\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n* '''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' [[Body armour]], [[gloves]], [[boots]].\n* '''All''' actions slowed by 50%. Stacks with the [[slow]] status.\n** Species [[movement delay]] is set to 1.0, but it is then slowed by 50% (1.5 with no other factors).\n* If you are an [[amphibious]] species, you can stand in [[deep water]], but you get all the normal penalties from both shallow and deep water (statues can't swim). [[Flight]] works as normal.\n\n[[Gargoyle]]s cannot use this spell, as they are already made out of stone. In addition, the [[undead]] ([[ghoul]]s, [[mummies]], bloodless [[vampire]]s) cannot use any form-changing spell.\n\n==Strategy==\nDespite the scary sounding slowness, Statue Form is a strong spell, more durable than the stats suggest. Unlike most Transmutations, you get to keep your [[shield]]. And unlike heavy [[body armour]], you'll get your full, unencumbered EV. So, with good values in HP, AC, EV, and possibly SH, your effective HP is very high. In a pinch, you can end the form or use a [[potion of haste]] to get back to normal speed.\n\nIt's best used for Unarmed fighters, especially those unable to use most/all body armours (namely [[Troll]]s, [[Felid]]s, and [[Octopode]]s). It's also good for slow-moving characters ([[Naga]]s, [[Barachim]], worshippers of [[Chei]]), as they won't mind the speed penalty as much. Statue Form also has great resistances - [[torment]] resistance is particularly helpful for [[extended]].\n\nStatue Form only boosts Unarmed Combat. Other methods of fighting are the same, or outright worse, than with normal characters:\n*This form does not explicitly penalize spells... but all actions, including spellcasting, are slowed by 50%. Thus, direct damage spells become less effective. A Conjurations-focused caster can still appreciate Statue Form for its defenses, but bear in mind the slowness. Of course, spells are not ''useless'', as support magic can be very helpful.\n*Statue Form boosts melee weapon damage by 50%, but it also slows melee by 50% - there's no increase to damage. For strong, melee brutes, heavy armour is likely to be more effective. (At least, before extended.)\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*[[Translocations]] spells are great to have in this form. [[Lesser Beckoning]] and [[Vhi's Electric Charge]] help a slow-moving melee fighter approach enemies. [[Manifold Assault]] lets you swing your fists at full-screen range.\n*Very useful for (15 rune) low turncount [[speedrun]]s. Since you act at 1.5 delay, you'll regenerate 1.5 [[decaAut]] per move, while only taking 1 \"[[turn]]\".\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

Statue Form also gave a +2 STR bonus and a -2 DEX penalty.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Statue Form enhanced the AC bonus from Stoneskin.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Gargoyles could cast Statue Form; it gave them a lower AC bonus which still stacked with their natural AC and 50% GDR.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Statue Form also granted -10 [[EV]], and gave [[gargoyle]]s 62% GDR. It also used [[Earth Magic]] to determine AC instead of [[spell power]] and prevented [[scramble|scrambling]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], [[merfolk]] could not use Statue Form in [[deep water]] (if they fell in while in Statue Form, they would revert to normal).\n*Prior to [[0.13]], it only granted the player one rank of [[poison resistance]].\n\n{{Forms}}\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

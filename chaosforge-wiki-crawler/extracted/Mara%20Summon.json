{"title":"Mara Summon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mara_Summon","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Weaves illusions of the caster. Such illusions have the same physical prowess as the original, and can cast the same spells.}}\n\n'''Mara Summon''' is a monsters-only spell which temporarily creates up to two near-identical clones of the [[unique]] [[rakshasa]] [[Mara]]. These clones have all of Mara's stats, including his current health, and can cast any of his spells except for Mara Summon and [[Summon Illusion]]. The real Mara may immediately swap positions with one of the two clones upon creating them; this makes it impossible to tell which Mara is the real one. The clones will disappear after enough time has passed, and are vulnerable to abjuration (via [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]]).\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Mara could not swap places with his clones upon summoning them.\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

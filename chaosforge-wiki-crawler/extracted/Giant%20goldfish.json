Their bites deal significant damage to characters with weak defenses, but the fact that you can simply walk away from battle with them makes them only a hazard to the careless. They often [[submerge]] when near death, making them difficult to finish off. They are found in any area with water, except for the first few floors of the [[Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They're worth decent experience early on, making it worth your time to try to take them out. Their habit of swimming away when near-death can make this difficult, but a weapon of [[venom]] or other means of [[poison]]ing them will make things easier if you don't mind losing the corpse.\n*Don't stand in the water while fighting them; this reduces your combat performance and makes it more difficult for you to flee to land if you need to. Fight them from the shore, using corners to only face one fish at a time.\n*Giant goldfish (and other water-bound creatures) can make a handy snack if you find yourself traveling long distances between portions of the Dungeon.\n\n==History==\nGiant goldfish were removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

{"title":"Scroll","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Scroll","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|A disposable arcane formula inscribed on parchment by a professional scribe or sorcerer. Anyone can evoke the power of the arcane formula by reading it out loud, but the nature of that power is not a priori apparent.}}\n\n[[File:Scroll.png]]'''Scrolls''' are consumable items which, when read (command '''r'''), provide a wide variety of magical effects. They can be found as randomly generated loot or bought in certain [[shop]]s. Unidentified scrolls will have gibberish names until you've [[identified]] them, either by reading them or through use of a [[scroll of identify]]. These names are randomly generated each game, and provide no clues as to the scroll's effect.\n\nEvery character is able to read by default. However, the following status effects disable scroll-reading entirely:\n*[[Stat zero|Brainless]]\n*[[Berserk]]\n*[[Confusion]]\n*[[Silence]]\n*[[Engulf]] (unless you are [[undead]] or [[nonliving]])\n*Certain [[bad form]]s\n*The -Scroll status (inflicted by the [[No Unsafe Scrolls]] [[mutation]] when damaged, and while in [[Gehenna]])\n\nReading an unidentified scroll will destroy it, except for the [[scroll of acquirement]] (which always persists). However, if you read an ''identified'' scroll that requires a decision, you can safely change your mind by pressing '''Escape''' and without spending any [[time]] doing so.\n\nScrolls are always read at the start of your turn. Usually, it takes 1.0 turn to \"read\" a scroll. In this case, the scroll effects happen first, immediately, and then you spend the rest of the 1.0 turn doing nothing.\n\nMonsters cannot read scrolls.\n\n==List of Scrolls==\n{| class=\"prettytable sortable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0;\n! class=\"unsortable\"|Tile !!

Prior to this version, being [[stat zero|brainless]] only imposed an 80% fail rate to read scrolls (in order to allow [[scroll of remove curse|removing curse]]).\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the [[Blurry Vision]] mutation existed; it slowed your reading of scrolls, causing them to take effect later.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], the [[Blurry Vision]] mutation imposed a flat failure rate upon attempting to read a scroll that increased per rank.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], any time you suffered [[fire]] or [[hellfire]] damage, there was a chance your scrolls would be subject to [[item destruction]]. The [[conservation]] ego reduced the chance of this happening, as did having a high [[AC]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], reading scrolls at inappropriate times (a [[scroll of remove curse]] when you have no cursed items equipped, for example) would waste the scroll without actually identifying it.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], reading scrolls was the only way for a character without magical abilities to gain access to them, allowing you to train [[Spellcasting]].\n\n===Obsolete Scrolls===\n*[[Scroll of magic mapping]] - Changed to [[scroll of revelation]] in [[0.31]]\n*[[Scroll of holy word]] - Removed in [[0.29]], replaced with the [[scroll of poison]].\n*[[Scroll of remove curse]] - Removed in [[0.27]] with the removal of all non-Ashenzari item [[curse]]s\n*[[Scroll of random uselessness]] - Removed in [[0.27]].\n*[[Scroll of recharging]] - Removed in [[0.21]] when wand mechanics were overhauled.\n*[[Scroll of curse armour]], [[scroll of curse jewellery]], [[scroll of curse weapon]] - Removed in [[0.18]] when Ashenzari began granting the ability to curse items directly\n*[[Scroll of enchant weapon I]]/[[Scroll of enchant weapon II|II]]/[[Scroll of enchant weapon III|III]] - These were merged into the [[scroll of enchant weapon]] in [[0.15]].\n*[[Scroll of vorpalise weapon]] - Changed to [[scroll of brand weapon]] in [[0.13]].\n*[[Scroll of unholy creation]] - This briefly replaced the [[scroll of summoning]] in [[0.11]].\n*[[Scroll of detect curse]] - Removed in [[0.11]].\n*[[Scroll of paper]] - Removed in [[0.7]].\n**[[Scroll of old paper]] - Technically never existed in a stable game version, but would replace scrolls of paper if an old game was transferred to a new version.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{scrolls}}\n[[Category:Items]]"}

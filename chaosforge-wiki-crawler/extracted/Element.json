{"title":"Element","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Element","type":"raw","data":"An '''element''' is one of four classes of natural phenomena.\n\nThe four elements are [[Fire Magic|Fire]], [[Ice Magic|Ice]], [[Air Magic|Air]], and [[Earth Magic|Earth]].\n\n[[Crawl]]'s documentation suggests that Ice may be a specific form of the Water element; however, in the game, water magic is a lost and unknown magic.\n\n==Elemental magic==\n\nEach of the elements has a [[spell school]] associated with it, and a person who specializes in elemental magic is called an Elementalist. There are four playable Elementalist classes, one for each element:\n* [[Fire Elementalist]]\n* [[Ice Elementalist]]\n* [[Air Elementalist]]\n* [[Earth Elementalist]]\n\nElemental schools have specific oppositions:\n* Fire opposes Ice, and vice versa\n* Air opposes Earth, and vice versa\n\nA player specializing in one element will have difficulty [[skill|learning]] the opposing element, equivalent to a -4 [[aptitude]] penalty (or malus).\n\nBesides affecting [[spell power]] and [[spell success|success]], elemental magic skills also help with controlling summoned elementals  [[evocable items#Summoning items|summoning items]]), and increase the bonus melee damage from the corresponding [[magical staff]]. Wielding a magical staff in an elemental skill also boosts the power of that school's spells.\n\n==Elemental monsters==\nThese are monsters whose existence is associated with an element.  Some may be summoned by its associated summoning item or [[Qazlal]]'s Elemental Force ability:\n*{{Yellow|E}} [[File:Fire_elemental.png]] [[Fire elemental]]\n*{{Blue|E}} [[File:Water_elemental.png]] [[Water elemental]], created by a [[phial of floods]]\n*{{Brown|E}} [[File:Earth_elemental.png]] [[Earth elemental]]\n*{{LightGrey|E}} [[File:Air_elemental.png]] [[Air elemental]]\n\n==History==\nIn earlier versions, a player specializing in one element would also have difficulty with the other three elemental schools.\n[[Category:Magic]]"}

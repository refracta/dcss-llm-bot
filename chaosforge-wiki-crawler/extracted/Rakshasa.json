{"title":"Rakshasa","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Rakshasa","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Rakshasas''' are [[demonic]] illusionists that wield [[whip]]s and spawn multiple decoys of themselves and any monsters in their [[line of sight]]. These decoys are every bit as dangerous as the original, but all decoys will disappear when the original is slain. Also, when reduced to 50% HP, they will occasionally create two duplicates instantly. They are a common sight in [[the Depths]], [[the Abyss]], and [[Lom Lobon]]'s realm in [[Pandemonium]] - but may show up as early as D:8.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Thanks to Force Lance, their ranged damage output is significant, especially to lightly armoured characters; even heavily armoured characters can be knocked out of an advantageous choke point. If you're uncomfortable facing a single rakshasa, flee before it duplicates and makes itself even deadlier.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], rakshasas had [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] instead of [[Force Lance]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], they knew [[Blink]], [[Invisibility]], [[Teleport Self]], and the much-less-deadly [[Rakshasa Summon]] in place of their current spellset."}

In practice, it's quite similar to a halberd.\n\n----\n\n\"It was instinct. Illogical as lightning striking and not hurting. Each day the grain must be cut. It had to be cut. Why? Well, it just did, that was all. He laughed at the scythe in his big hands. Then, whistling, he took it out to the ripe and waiting field and did the work. He thought himself a little mad. Hell, it was an ordinary-enough wheat field, really, wasn't it?\"<br>\n-Ray Bradbury, _The Scythe_, 1943.}}\n\n{{crawlquote|This weapon falls into the [[Polearms]] category. It is a two handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Scythes''' are best known as the trademark weapon of [[Sigmund]]. They are identical to a [[halberd]], and are thus too large for [[Size#Small|small]] creatures ([[Kobold]]s, [[Spriggan]]s) to use. Scythes, outside of the 2 [[unrand]] scythes, do not generate naturally - they can only be found on Sigmund, [[reaper]]s, or in few [[vault]]s.\n\nNote that the [[unrand]] scythes [[Finisher]] and [[Scythe of Curses]] have their own, separate stats. See the history section for more details.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Scythe1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Scythe2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Scythe3.png]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || [[Unrandarts]]\n|-\n| '''[[Finisher]]''' || [[File:Scythe finisher.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Scythe of Curses]]''' || [[File:Scythe of curses.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n{{weapon\n |name        = Scythe\n |cost        = ?\n |skill       = Polearms\n |damage      = 14\n |accuracy    = -4\n |basedelay   = 20 (200%)\n |mindelay    = 7 at skill 26\n |hands       = 2H\n |size        = Large\n |ranged      = No\n |damtype     = Slicing\n |acquirement = 10\n}}\n*Prior to [[0.29]], scythes were their own base type, with their stats shown on the right.

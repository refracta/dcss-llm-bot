They're almost always found in packs, and encountering one may indicate the presence of the unique monster [[Grum]] nearby. Otherwise, they occasionally appear in [[the Dungeon]] and [[the Lair]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nDon't let them get close unless you're decently armoured or can prevent them from swarming you. You probably can't get away, so if you're low-level, use any and all tricks at your disposal (wands, potions, etc.) to take them down before they surround you and put the hurt on you.\n\n==History==\nWar dogs were removed in [[0.13]] in favor of upgrading [[wolves]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete_monsters]]"}

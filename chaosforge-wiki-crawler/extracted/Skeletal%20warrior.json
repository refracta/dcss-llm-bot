{"title":"Skeletal warrior","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Skeletal_warrior","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Skeletal warriors''' are surprisingly dangerous [[undead]] monsters which travel in packs. Although they resemble small [[skeleton (monster)|skeletons]], they move at average speed, have significant durability, and come armed with powerful [[brand]]ed weapons.  They are found in the mid-to-late-[[Dungeon]], [[the Crypt]], and [[the Abyss]].\n\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Avoid letting them attack you more than one at a time. Hallways help, but keep an eye out for skeletons armed with [[polearms]].\n*[[Dispel Undead]] will take them down in two or three castings. \n*Weapons of [[holy wrath]] are also effective, the bigger, the better.\n*If you don't have any way to reliably take on a pack of skeletal warriors, consider skipping them and coming back once you've leveled up more. Even a single skeletal warrior can kill a lightly armored character in a few hits, especially if they've got a big, nasty weapon.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], you could find '''skeletal archers''' in [[the Crypt]] and [[Tartarus]]. They were as durable as the warriors, but were armed with [[bows]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], skeletal warriors possessed [[Animate Dead]], a spell which they rarely had a chance to use, mostly being found in corpseless branches.  Also prior to 0.13, [[ancient champion]]s were vault-defined variants of skeletal warriors, as opposed to their own type of monster."}

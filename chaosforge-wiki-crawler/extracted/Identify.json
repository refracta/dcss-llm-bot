{"title":"Identify","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Identify","type":"raw","data":"{{Obsolete}}\n\n'''Identify''' was a [[Divinations]] spell which would fully identify any item, saving you the risk of identifying [[potion]]s, [[scroll]]s, and potentially cursed gear through trial and error. This identification included all intrinsics provided by artifacts that are only partially ID'd when worn.\n\nAlthough this spell can no longer be cast, you can duplicate its effects by reading a [[scroll of identify]].\n\n==History==\nIdentify was removed in [[0.6]] with the removal of the Divinations school of magic.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

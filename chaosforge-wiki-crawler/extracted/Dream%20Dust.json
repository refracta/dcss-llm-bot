{"title":"Dream Dust","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dream_Dust","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|Overwhelms the target with soporific dream dust, putting them to sleep. Additional dream sheep will increase the strength and duration of this effect.}}\n\n'''Dream Dust''' is a monster-only spell exclusive to [[dream sheep]] that puts the target to [[sleep]]. It is resistible, but does not check [[willpower]] -- instead, the spell becomes harder to resist as more dream sheep move into view. Even if a dream sheep is [[asleep]], [[petrified]], or [[paralysed]], it still contributes towards success rate.\n\nPlayers that are [[undead]] ([[Ghoul]], [[Mummy]], bloodless [[Vampire]]) or nonliving ([[Gargoyle]], [[Djinni]], [[Statue Form]], [[Storm Form]], [[Wisp Form]]) are immune to sleep. Going [[berserk]] or having [[clarity]] will also make you immune.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" cellpadding=\"10\" border=\"9\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|- \n! # of<br>Sheep !!

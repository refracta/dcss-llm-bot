{"title":"Blink frog","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Blink_frog","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Blink frogs''' are dangerous pack creatures which [[blink]] around constantly. If you let yourself get surrounded by them, blink frogs are a serious threat. They commonly appear in [[the Lair]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*As fast enemies that come in swarms, blink frogs are dangerous to low [[AC]] characters. Due to the constant [[blink]]ing, these frogs have a tendency to flank you, block your escape route, or do both at the same time. Their blinking also makes it hard to approach them in melee.\n*They'll often blink away from you, which you can take advantage of with ranged attacks.\n**Sources of passive damage, such as [[poison]] or [[Sticky Flame]], are effective. They'll damage the frog as it wastes time blinking and reapproaching, ''and'' the damage ignores their high [[EV]]. Even poisoned [[dart]]s can work at 0 skill.\n**Area of effect spells, such as [[Fireball]], [[Freezing Cloud]], or [[LRD]], can hit multiple frogs while bypassing their EV.\n*Blink frogs are [[cold-blooded]], making them vulnerable to slowing from [[cold]] attacks like [[Frozen Ramparts]] or weapons of [[freezing]].\n*Confusing them, either via the [[Confusing Touch]] spell or [[Mephitic Cloud]], keeps them from blinking.\n*If you alert an entire pack and don't feel up to taking them on, retreat may be advisable. Even with their speed advantage, their blinking makes it easy to climb stairs without luring up more than one at a time.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], blink frogs were immune to [[distortion]] effects. In fact, 20% of the time, distortion actually healed them."}

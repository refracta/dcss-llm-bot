{"title":"Abomination","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Abomination","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n'''Abominations''' are [[undead]] monsters made by mashing partially-animated corpses together; this process also leaves them with [[demon]]ic traits and gives them a permanent [[might]], [[haste]], or [[regeneration]] buff. Abominations come in two sizes:\n\n*{{monsterlink|Small abomination}}\n*{{monsterlink|Large abomination}}\n\nThey usually appear in [[vault]]s or can be found roaming naturally in the [[Abyss]]. Abominations are vulnerable to [[silver]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], abominations had randomized HD, AC, and EV instead of spawning with a permanent buff. Also, they did not regenerate.\n*Prior to [[0.31]], abominations had randomized [[speed]], 7-15 for small abominations and 6-12 for the large ones.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], abominations could heal by merging with [[crawling corpse]]s and [[macabre mass]]es. Also, monsters could cast [[Twisted Resurrection]] to create abominations.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], players could also cast Twisted Resurrection.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], abominations could regenerate naturally.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], the player could get a permanent friendly abomination by reading a [[scroll of unholy creation]].\n\n[[Category:Monsters]]"}

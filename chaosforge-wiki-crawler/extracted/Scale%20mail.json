Early on, high-[[strength]] characters may be grateful to find a scale mail on the first few floors. With [[strength]] in the upper teens, many low-level spells should be castable.\n\nHowever, the stats of a scale mail aren't terribly impressive. Some EV-based melee fighters may like one, but most characters will prefer either lighter or heavier. Still, if found with a solid enchantment rating and [[ego]], or in the form of an excellent [[randart]], scale mail ''might'' be worth using for a while. \n\nA plain +0 scale mail is completely outclassed by [[acid dragon scales]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Scale mail1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Scale mail2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artefact''' || [[File:Scale mail3.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.16]], scale mail had an encumbrance rating of 11.\n\n{{armours}}\n\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

Although not a very powerful [[wand]], melee-oriented characters may want to use it to weaken enemies at range before entering combat, at least in the early game. These wands often generate with a lot of charges, unlike the more powerful wands. It can have at most 48 charges.\n\nDue to the wand of magic darts' low damage output, enemies with significant [[AC]] will often negate its damage output entirely. Don't expect to accomplish much firing this at an oncoming [[orc warrior]] or other heavily armoured foe; it's much better suited for use against halberd-wielding [[gnoll (monster)|gnolls]] and other high-damage, low-durability threats.\n\n==History==\n*Wands of magic darts were removed in [[0.18]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], this wand could hold up to 24 charges."}

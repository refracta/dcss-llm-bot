Fortunately, they are weak enough that any hero who isn't very low level or already heavily injured should have little trouble dispatching them. The biggest threat they present lies in the fact that their attacks occasionally leave you [[held]] and unable to easily walk away from combat until the [[mimic]] is defeated. They can be found on Dungeon: 1-6, and less commonly on D:7-12.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nIf for some reason you find yourself in desperate need of escaping, [[blink]]ing or [[teleport]]ing away can help you do so more quickly. However, inept mimics are weak enough that this should rarely, if ever, be necessary.\n\n==History==\nInept mimics were added in [[0.11]], and removed in [[0.16]]."}

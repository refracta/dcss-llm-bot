Early on, chain mail can provide more overall defense than a [[plate armour]], and it's more common than plate. But as you gain more strength and/or [[Armour skill]], the plate armour will likely come out ahead. [[Dodge]]rs and casters will likely find this armour too [[Encumbrance rating|heavy]] to bother with. \n\nIn general, it's not worth wearing in the long run, unless you get an awesome randart.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], chain mail had an encumbrance rating of 15. It also was unable to have the ponderousness ego.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], chain mail had 7 base AC.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], it had 6 base AC.\n\nThe increases in AC have been due to the removal of [[banded mail]], and later, of [[splint mail]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[Image:Chain mail1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[Image:Chain mail2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[Image:Chain mail3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]] chain mail\n|-\n| '''[[Lear's hauberk]]''' || [[Image:Lear's hauberk.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n<!--- This is here to force the category line to not run into the sidebar. -->\n<br><br><br><br><br>\n\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

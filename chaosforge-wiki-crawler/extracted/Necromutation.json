The caster becomes stronger-willed, more resistant to cold and completely immune to poison, miasma, negative energy, and torment for the duration of the spell. The caster's necromancy spells are increased in power, and they gain a draining melee attack. The caster also gains some of the more dubious benefits of having an undead body, such as a vulnerability to holy damage and Dispel Undead, and an inability to consume potions.\n----\n“Don’t sing if you want to live long<br>\nThey have no use for your song<br>\nYou’re dead, you’re dead, you’re dead<br>\nYou’re dead and outta this world<br>\n\nYou’ll never get a second chance<br>\nPlan all your moves in advance<br>\nStay dead, stay dead, stay dead<br>\nStay dead and outta this world”<br>\n-Norma Tanega, “You’re Dead”. 1966}}\n'''Necromutation'''  ('''lichform''') is a level 8 [[Transmutations]]/[[Necromancy]] spell which transforms the caster into a [[lich]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nCasting this spell gives you Lich Form for a spellpower-dependent duration. You'll gain the following:\n\n'''Combat'''\n*'''Innate AC:''' 6 (plus any AC from [[armour]]).\n*'''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' 5 base damage, with an added [[drain]] brand.\n*A '''[[spell enhancer]]''' for [[Necromancy]] spells.\n\n'''Resistances'''\n*Standard '''[[undead]]''' resistances:\n**[[Cold resistance|rC+]].\n**Immunity to [[poison]] and [[miasma]].\n**Immunity to [[negative energy]] and [[torment]].\n**Cannot be [[mutate]]d. Receive [[stat drain]] if you would be mutated.\n**Cannot be [[polymorph]]ed.\n**Vulnerable to [[holy]], [[holy wrath]], and [[Dispel Undead]].\n*[[Will]]+\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n*Cannot drink [[potion]]s.\n*Cannot use spells that require you to be alive (any other form changing spell, [[Borgnjor's Revivification]], [[Death's Door]], [[Sublimation of Blood]]). \n*Cannot wield [[holy wrath]] weapons.\nLichform does not meld any equipment.\n\nLike all form changing spells, [[mummies]], [[ghoul]]s, and bloodless [[vampire]]s cannot use this spell.\n\n==Strategy==\nHaving this spell is a game-changer in late-game areas rife with effects that do not affect the undead, such as [[torment]], [[negative energy]], and [[mutation]]s. The [[Hell]]s, [[Pandemonium]], and the [[Tomb]] in particular are good places to be a lich, as any place with [[Malmutate|Malmutators]]. Unlike naturally undead species, you can also go back to the world of the living to deal with foes that use [[Dispel Undead]] or [[holy]] damage.\n\nThe Necromancy boost is useful, but unfortunately the most powerful Necromancy spells ([[Borgnjor's Revivification]] and [[Death's Door]]) are unusable while undead. The other boosts like AC are too minor to justify training this spell in an ordinary 3-rune game, and it's still quite the skill cost for the extended game.\n\n===Tips and Tricks===\n*Remember to recast Necromutation before it expires, as the spell will take advantage of its own Necromancy enhancer and last longer.\n*Note that casting this spell while worshiping a [[good god]] will cause you to be immediately excommunicated.\n\n==Settings==\nUsers of this spell may want to add this to their [[rcfile]]:\n\n runrest_ignore_message -= transformation is almost over\\.\n\nThis will stop autotravel if the spell is nearly over and allow you to recast it before it runs out.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

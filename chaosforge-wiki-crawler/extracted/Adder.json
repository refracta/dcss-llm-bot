{"title":"Adder","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Adder","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | snakes}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Adders''' are fast [[list of snakes|snakes]] with a [[poison]]ous bite. This poison can be lethal to low level characters, and their speed makes fleeing impossible in most cases. They can be found as early as [[Dungeon]]:2.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Adders are fast, so it can be impossible to avoid fighting them. And poison can quickly stack up; even a [[Minotaur]] can lose to a few bad RNG rolls. If things go poorly, don't hesitate to use your [[background|starting consumable]].\n**If you spot a sleeping adder early into D:2/D:3, consider just walking away from it. The more [[bat]]s, [[rat]]s, [[goblin]]s, and [[kobold]]s you slay before dealing with it, the stronger you'll be when that happens. Just don't generate too much [[noise]] around the sleeping adder until you're ready.\n**Don't be stingy with [[potions of curing]]. They'll heal you and cure all poison, which can let you win a losing battle. If you have no other option, try quaffing the potion you have the most of. Curing is the most common potion, so if you have multiples of a potion, it's likely to be curing.\n*Dispatch them from a distance if possible. Failing that, at least soften them up by [[throwing]] [[boomerang]]s, [[javelin]]s, [[darts]], or [[stone]]s before engaging in melee until you're strong enough to kill them quickly.\n*To avoid taking more potentially poisonous hits than necessary, run away while the snake is two tiles away and let it close the distance to you. If you charge in or simply stand your ground, they can land one or two free bites before you even get a chance to take a swing.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], adders dealt 5 damage per hit.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], adders were called '''snakes'''."}

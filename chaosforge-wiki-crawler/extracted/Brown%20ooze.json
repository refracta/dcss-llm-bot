Effectively a beefier [[jelly]], they devour items to heal and reproduce, deal significant [[acid]] damage with their attacks, and can corrode your equipment. They can be found in or guarding [[the Slime Pits]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nBy the time you encounter them, you should have the means for taking them out safely. Fill as many armour slots as possible to reduce acid damage (especially [[cloak]]s), have [[preservation]] or an [[amulet of resist corrosion]] to protect your insufficiently enchanted gear, and above all else try to kill them at a distance with spells, ''not'' ammunition which they can eat.\n\n==History==\nBrown oozes were removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

To make the best use of this, fire at large clusters of enemies, especially ones following you through long hallways. Penetrating weapons cannot be blocked by [[shields]] apart from the [[Warlock's mirror]].\n\nBe sure to aim carefully to make the maximum use of your attacks when fighting enemies that aren't conveniently lined up along a hallway. Also, if you don't want your projectile to travel the full distance (either because there's an ally behind your target or because it would land in impassable terrain), you can choose a specific tile for the attack to end on by pressing '''.''' (period).\n\n[[Javelin]]s inherently have the penetration property, and [[artefact]] [[crossbow]]s may generate with the penetration brand. The [[unrandart]] [[Storm bow]] gives arrows fired from it penetration.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.24]], [[javelin]]s did not inherently have the penetration property, but could generate with it as a brand. Additionally, penetration was in the pool of brands available to enchanted crossbows instead of only appearing on artefacts.\n*[[Bolt]]s of penetration were removed in [[0.18]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], penetrating projectiles could be blocked by shields.\n\n{{brands}}\n\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

{"title":"Spriggan rider","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spriggan_rider","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of|spriggans}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Spriggan riders''' are fast mounted opponents which ride [[hornet]]s, shooting [[dart]]s and attacking you with [[Polearms]]. They are impossible to escape on foot and hit hard, making them surprisingly deadly opponents. They can be found in the [[Swamp]] and in rare \"spriggan forest\" [[vault]]s found throughout the dungeon and its branches.\n\nWhen a spriggan rider is damaged below 50% HP, there's a <code>100% - (2 * current_hp%)</code> chance you kill either the [[spriggan (monster)|spriggan]] or its [[hornet]] mount, leaving the other behind (equal chance for each).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|monster.cc|5811}}</ref> The survivor will have the same HP value (not percent) as the spriggan rider when it died, and keeps any statuses it had.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Poison resistance]] renders their darts harmless.\n*Darts require a clear line of fire in order to hit you. However, their polearms can [[reach]] over other monsters.\n*If you manage to kill a spriggan rider's hornet while it's flying over [[deep water]], it will drop the spriggan into the water and kill it instantly.\n*Thankfully, spriggan riders don't have the paralytic poison of [[hornet]]s. If the spriggan dies, however, you'll risk [[paralysis]] (if you don't have immunity to poison).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], they rode [[wasp]]s instead of hornets.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], they rode [[giant fireflies]] instead of wasps.\n*Spriggan riders were added in [[0.7]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Spriggan]]"}

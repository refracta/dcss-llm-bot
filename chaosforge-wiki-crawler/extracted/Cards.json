While worshipping Nemelex, the god will occasionally [[gift]] you cards. You can see the deck which the cards were dealt, but not specific cards themselves (at least, without using an ability). You can store a maximum of 26 cards for the deck of destruction, and 13 cards for the other two. Nemelex draws from the [[deck of punishment]] as [[divine retribution]].\n\n==Power==\nThere are two aspects to the potency of a card's effect: called \"power\" and \"power_level\" in the source code.\n\n''Power'' is the card equivalent to [[spellpower]]. Players draw cards at <code>power = (9 × Invocations) + (1.5 × piety) + (piety × (Invocations + 25) / 27)</code>. Cards drawn by wrath have a power of <code>18 × XL</code>.\n\nMost cards then translate power into ''power level'', a number ranging from 0, 1, or 2. Each level can be considered a new \"tier\", and may add new effects or simply improve the card; for example, [[Orb card|the Orb]] fires multiple orbs of destruction at power level 2. Every time a card is drawn, the game rolls twice: <code>power / 900</code> and <code>power / 2700</code> - each successful roll raises power level by 1.\n\n==Lists of cards==\n===Currently available cards===\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n!Destruction\n!Escape\n!Summoning\n!Punishment\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Degeneration card|Degeneration]]\n<br>[[Orb card|the Orb]]\n<br>[[Pain card|Pain]]\n<br>[[Storm card|the Storm]]\n<br>[[Wild Magic card|Wild Magic]]\n<br>[[Vitriol card|Vitriol]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Cloud card|the Cloud]]\n<br>[[Elixir card|the Elixir]]\n<br>[[Exile card|Exile]]\n<br>[[Tomb card|the Tomb]]\n<br>[[Velocity card|Velocity]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Dance card|the Dance]]\n<br>[[Elements card|the Elements]]\n<br>[[Illusion card|the Illusion]]\n<br>[[Pentagram card|the Pentagram]]\n<br>[[Rangers card|the Rangers]]\n<br>[[Swarm card|Swarm]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Swine card|the Swine]]\n<br>[[Torment card|Torment]]\n<br>[[Wraith card|the Wraith]]\n<br>[[Wrath card|Wrath]]\n|----\n|}\n----\n\n===Removed cards===\n<div style=\"column-count:3\">\n*[[Alchemist card|the Alchemist]]\n*[[Banshee card|the Banshee]]\n*[[Blade card|the Blade]]\n*[[Bones card|the Bones]]\n*[[Crusade card|the Crusade]]\n*[[Curse card|the Curse]]\n*[[Damnation card|Damnation]]\n*[[Dowsing card|Dowsing]]\n*[[Feast card|the Feast]]\n*[[Famine card|Famine]]\n*[[Focus card|Focus]]\n*[[Fortitude card|Fortitude]]\n*[[Hammer card|the Hammer]]\n*[[Helix card|the Helix]]\n*[[Helm card|the Helm]]\n*[[Herd card|the Herd]]\n*[[Mercenary card|the Mercenary]]\n*[[Metamorphosis card|Metamorphosis]]\n*[[Potion card|the Potion]]\n*[[Repulsiveness card|Repulsiveness]]\n*[[Shadow card|the Shadow]]\n*[[Placid Magic card|Placid Magic]]\n*[[Solitude card|Solitude]]\n*[[Swap card|Swap]]\n*[[Venom card|Venom]]\n*[[Warpwright card|Warpwright]]\n*[[Xom card|Xom]]\n*[[Bargain card|the Bargain]] \n*[[Battlelust card|Battlelust]]\n*[[Experience card|Experience]] \n*[[Flame card|Flame]] \n*[[Flight card|Flight]] \n*[[Frost card|Frost]] \n*[[Genie card|the Genie]]\n*[[Map card|the Map]] \n*[[Minefield card|the Minefield]] \n*[[Portal card|the Portal]]\n*[[Sage card|the Sage]]\n*[[Shaft card|the Shaft]]\n*[[Shuffle card|Shuffle]] \n*[[Spade card|the Spade]]\n*[[Spark card|the Spark]] \n*[[Summoning card|Summoning]] \n*[[Trowel card|the Trowel]] \n*[[Vitrification card|Vitrification]] \n*[[Warp card|the Warp]] \n*[[Water card|Water]]\n</div>\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.23]], decks were evocable items with different tiers, and card power and power level depended on the quality of the deck.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], there were many more decks, many more cards, decks could be found on the floor, and card power scaled off Evocations with and without Nemelex.\n\n==See also==\n[[Decks]]\n{{Cards}}"}

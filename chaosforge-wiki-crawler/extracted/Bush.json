{"title":"Bush","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Bush","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Bushes''' are ridiculously tough [[plant]]s that require a severe beating to uproot. Players and monsters alike can shoot projectiles and cast magic through bushes. Bushes block [[LOS]] when looking through two or more. Unlike regular [[plant]]s, they don't wither after being hit.\n\nStrong [[Fire Magic]] (anything that can burn a [[tree]]) aimed directly at a bush will ignite it, destroying it relatively quickly. Just be sure to keep away from the thing until the fire goes out, as it may lash out at adjacent spaces. This is rare enough that fires won't get out of control - at most you'll see it spread a couple times before petering out.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*You can use bushes as cover and fire through them, but remember that ranged enemies can fire through as well.\n*If a bush is standing on top of an item you want, it's simplest to use [[Apportation]] to get it out from underneath without taking the time to destroy the bush.\n\n==History==\n*Though [[plant]]s were changed in [[0.26]] to wither in a few turns after being hit, bushes were unaffected."}

James Grainger, 1822.}}\n{{crawlquote|This weapon falls into the '[[Short Blades]]' category. It is a one handed weapon, and it is better for the dexterous.}}\n\nThe '''cutlass''' is the short blade with the highest base damage, making it a desirable choice for both [[stabbing]] and actual melee combat (though [[quick blade]]s are generally considered more powerful, particularly when coupled with a high [[slaying]] bonus). Just be careful about using them on [[hydra]]s; although they are short blades, they can still sever hydra heads (unless, of course, they have the [[flaming]] [[brand]], in which case a skilled user can wield them against hydras to great effect). Cutlasses are fairly uncommon, but some early- and mid-game monsters wield them (such as the [[unique]] [[summoner]] [[Eustachio]] and the deep elves of the [[Elven Halls]]).\n\nNote that cutlasses are special-cased to have a minimum delay of 5, even though all other weapons with a base delay of 12 have a min delay of 6.\n\n==History==\n*Cutlasses were retired in [[0.16]], and replaced with [[rapier]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], this weapon was known as a [[sabre]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Common\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Sabre1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Sabre2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Sabre3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]\n|-\n| '''[[Captain's cutlass]]''' || [[File:Captain's_cutlass.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Arc blade]]''' || [[File:Arc_blade.png]]\n|}\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Short blades]]"}

{"title":"Singing Sword","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Singing_Sword","type":"raw","data":"{{version|030}}\n{{flavour|An enchanted blade which loves nothing more than to sing to its owner, whether they want it to or not. \n\nIt radiates damaging sonic waves as you strike, especially in combat involving dangerous or numerous foes.}}\n\n[[File:Singing_sword.png]] '''''the +11 Singing Sword'''''\n\n+11 [[double sword]]\n\nDamages everything (excluding the user) in [[LOS]], creating [[noise]] in the process\n\n==Mechanics==\nEvery time you hit an enemy with the Singing Sword, it has a chance to cast the Sonic Wave spell. Higher [[tension]] increases the frequency, damage, and noise of Sonic Wave.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Tier\n!Tension\n!Noise\n!Chance\n!Damage\n|-\n|1\n|0+\n|0\n|1/4\n|2d15\n|-\n|2\n|20+\n|20\n|3/8\n|2d16\n|-\n|3\n|40+\n|30\n|1/2\n|2d18\n|-\n|4\n|60+\n|40\n|1/2\n|2d23\n|}\n\nAt the highest singing effect, the sword's name changes to the Screaming Sword. When [[silence]]d, the sword's name instead changes to the Sulking Sword and no noise or damage are produced.\n\nIf the character wearing the weapon is not the player, then only the first tier applies.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-func.h|370}}</ref>\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''Singing Sword'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|art-data.txt|189}}</ref> is a powerful weapon; a +11 double sword with extra singing damage is no joke. At the lowest tier, Sonic Wave is stronger than having [[electrocution]] (though Sonic Wave checks [[AC]]), can't be resisted, and hits every monster in LOS. It's one of the strongest one-handed Long Blades in the game.\n\nThe noise ''is'' a downside, but it can be managed. There's no penalty for switching to another weapon, and the noise is only created on swing. If noise would be an issue (such as when first entering a floor), you can always use a different weapon. Also, Sonic Wave becomes more powerful as more monsters are on screen. Just make sure you don't get carried away by that fact.\n\nSonic Wave will hurt your own [[allies]] (except those protected from harm, e.g. [[Hepliaklqana]] ancestor), so it's not a good idea for [[Summoner]]s, [[Beogh]] worshippers, etc. to use this weapon.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the Singing Sword was a +7 [[vorpal]] double sword.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], the Singing Sword's sonic damage was weaker, and would trigger over time with high enough tension (instead of requiring weapon hits). It also did not have the [[vorpal]] brand.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], this weapon was significantly worse; its base type was a [[long sword]] and it generated significant amounts of noise regardless of the presence of monsters.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], this weapon did not cast Sonic Wave.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Long blades]]"}

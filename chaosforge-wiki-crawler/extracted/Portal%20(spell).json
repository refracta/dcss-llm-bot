The portal lasts long enough for the caster and nearby creatures to enter. Casters are never taken past the level limits of the current area.}}\n\n'''Portal''' was a level 7 [[Translocations]] spell which allowed the caster to move up to 9 floors up or down through the Dungeon. The spell had to be cast on a standard floor tile and always delivered the player to a [[stairs|staircase]] of the floor they selected. Standing on a staircase, doorway, or over water would make the spell fail, as would being in a [[dungeon branch]]. If the player attempted to move beyond the limits of the dungeon, they would be prompted to select a different floor.\n\nThis spell stopped working once you picked up the [[Orb of Zot]].\n\nPortal was formerly found in the following [[spellbook]]:\n*[[Book of the Warp]]\n\n==History==\nPortal was removed from the game in [[0.8.0]].\n\n[[Category:Spells]][[Category:Obsolete spells]][[Category:Translocations]][[Category:Level 7 Spells]]"}

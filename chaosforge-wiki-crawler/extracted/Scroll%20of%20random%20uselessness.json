At worst, it can produce a noise and wake up nearby monsters.\n\n==Possible Messages==\n{{flavour|\"The dust glows a [weird glowing colour]!\"<br>\"[Your weapon] OR [Your hands] glow [weird glowing colour] for a moment.\"<br>\"You smell [weird smell].\" OR \"Your bandages flutter.\" (if you are a [[mummy]], and thus cannot smell)<br>\"You experience a momentary feeling of inescapable doom!\"<br>\"Your brain hurts!\" OR \"Your ears itch.\" OR \"Your nose twitches suddenly!\"<br>\"You hear [weird sound].\" (generates a little noise at your position, the loudness is the same for all [weird sound]s)}}\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], these scrolls were removed.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the scroll wasn't completely useless, as reading it had a 1 in 8 chance to [[Summon Butterflies]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the scroll could reassemble itself when the player read it.\n*Prior to the skill training overhaul in [[0.9]], scrolls of random uselessness could be used to train the first level of [[Spellcasting]], which gave them some slight desirability, particularly for their ability to sometimes reassemble in the player's hands.\n*Prior to [[0.5]], these scrolls were not identified when used, a trait which could make them genuinely annoying at times.\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

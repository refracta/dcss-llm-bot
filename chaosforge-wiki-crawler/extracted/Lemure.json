{"title":"Lemure","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Lemure","type":"raw","data":"{{version027}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Lemures''' are souls enslaved by hellish forces. [[Pikel]] always travels with a band of four lemures; defeating him will free his thralls, allowing them to peacefully depart the Dungeon.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*See [[Pikel]]'s article for tips on dealing with him.\n*They hit a bit harder than most monsters early on; definitely try to draw the whole group into a corridor so you only have to fight one of them at a time.\n\n==History==\n*Lemures returned in version [[0.26]] as a replacement for Pikel's human [[slave]]s.\n*Lemures were originally more conventional [[tier-5 demon]]s, but this incarnation was removed in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

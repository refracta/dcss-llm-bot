{"title":"Cirno","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cirno","type":"raw","data":"{{diary}}\nI feel like Spriggan Ice Elementalist fits Cirno more than any other character background. If you don't know who Cirno is, Check out Touhou 6.\n\nCirno wanted to prove she was the strongest by going into the dungeon and claiming the Orb of Zot. She also wanted to prove she could do it without having to use her spell cards and decided to only use the spells in her book and other books she would find lying around.\n\nDungeon 1:\nCirno ran around freezing everything in sight to death. Nothing stood a chance against her, and she felt completely invincible. Cirno drank all the potions and read all the scrolls in her inventory. First, she gained resistance to all elements, then started flying. As for the scrolls, Cirno felt strangely unstable, and then identified a scroll of remove curse. Lastly, Cirno also found an amulet and felt a bloodthirsty rage build up inside of her.\n\nDungeon 2:\nThe instant that Cirno set foot on the second level, she was teleported somewhere else. Cirno killed a few adders and gained level three and got more smarter. Cirno found a scroll of random uselessness and was very confused by the useless effect.\n\nDungeon 3:\nCirno found a wand lying on the ground and zapped herself with it like any idiot would do. She felt herself slowing down. She then found a cursed amulet of resist corrosion. How she knew it was cursed we will never know.\n\nDungeon 4:\nCirno found Dowan and Duvessa waiting for her. Cirno thought she would be able to kill Duvessa by freezing her just like everything else, but Duvessa cut Cirno in half with a cutlass. Oh well, mabye next time.\n\nOkay, quick note to self: DO NOT PLAY AS A SPRIGGAN ICE ELEMENTALIST!"}

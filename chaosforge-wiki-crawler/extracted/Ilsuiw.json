{"title":"Ilsuiw","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ilsuiw","type":"raw","data":"{{version024}}\n{{monster info}}\n''For a list of all merfolk, see [[list of merfolk]].''\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ilsuiw, Witch of the Tides''' is a [[unique]] [[merfolk aquamancer]] that is often found in [[the Shoals]]. She rarely appears without a large band of fellow [[merfolk (monster)|merfolk]].\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Shoals]]:2-4\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n[[See invisible]], [[fly]]ing (to avoid being stuck in [[shallow water]] the entire fight), and the means to kill her quickly are all highly recommended before taking her on. Between her high HP and decent EV, she can be tricky. Her [[water elemental]]s deal surprising amounts of damage, and she can summon a lot of them. If you're in melee with her while in water, both she and her elementals can outrun you; some form of haste or other escape may be necessary. Note that she lacks any resistances; poison can be very effective in taking her down, possibly after you have had to flee from her and her summons. Other area-of-effect spells can help deal with both her and her entourage at the same time. It's often easier to pick off a few members of her army at a time before fleeing back upstairs to heal.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.22]], Ilsuiw was guaranteed to spawn somewhere in the Shoals, and almost always spawned in a special vault on Shoals:4.\n\n[[Category:Merfolk]]"}

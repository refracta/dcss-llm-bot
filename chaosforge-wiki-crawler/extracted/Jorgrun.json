{"title":"Jorgrun","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Jorgrun","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Jorgrun Earthshaker''' is a [[unique]] [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[Earth Elementalist]]. He wields a [[staff of earth]] (33%) or a [[vorpal]] [[quarterstaff]] (66%).\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:12-15\n*[[The Orcish Mines]]\n*[[The Elven Halls]]:1-2\n*[[The Snake Pit]]:1-3\n*[[The Spider's Nest]]:1-3\n*[[The Shoals]]:1-3\n*[[The Swamp]]:1-3\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Jorgrun is a big threat for a variety of reasons:\n**[[Iron Shot]] is a high damage spell for the areas Jorgrun is found in.\n**[[Grasping Roots]] prevents you from moving, going upstairs, and it gives [[scrolls of blinking]] a chance to fail. This can be lethal if Jorgrun shows up when you're fighting other monsters. Being over [[deep water]] or [[lava]] prevents the roots from affecting you.\n**[[Petrify]] incapacitates you for up to 10 turns, sets your [[EV]] and [[SH]] to 0, and makes Lee's Rapid Deconstruction ignore AC.\n*Like all mages, Jorgrun can't do anything while [[silence]]d. Melee characters should silence if possible. Anyone can make use of a [[phial of floods]] to disable his casting.\n*[[Curare]], if it hits, will slow Jorgrun, which can make a big difference in combat.\n*Try to avoid him if you have low [[willpower]]; being Petrified around Jorgrun is basically death. If you get hit by Petrify, you can quaff a [[potion of cancellation]] to end it immediately. If not, a [[scroll of teleport]] is a strong option. You might end up someplace dangerous, but chances are that other monsters can't hurt you as much as Jorgrun.\n**Certain god abilities can take care of Petrification; [[Elyvilon]]'s Purification and [[Ru]]'s Draw Out Power end Petrifying; [[Zin]]'s Vitalisation makes you immune. In a pinch, [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]] or a [[wand of quicksilver]] can remove petrification.\n*Lee's Rapid Deconstruction can be used on walls or creatures made of wall-like materials:\n**[[Gargoyle]]s and players in [[Ice Form]] and [[Statue Form]] are innately vulnerable to LRD. Be very careful; Transmuters shouldn't use these forms against Jorgrun; Gargoyles should avoid the fight or be prepared to escape.\n**Users of the [[Simulacrum]] spell should be wary, as Jorgrun can explode the simulacra against you. Using Simulacrum can still be a good idea - Jorgrun will hesitate to LRD if he's in the blast radius - but it's something to be aware of.\n**Low-AC characters should stay away from [[wall]]s while you're fighting him, as LRD can deal heavy damage with shrapnel even if you're not petrified. Even heavily armoured characters may wish to stay away from walls made of crystal or metal during the fight.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.23]], Jorgrun could not spawn in [[Swamp]]. 0.23 also added [[Grasping Roots]] to his spell list.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], Jorgrun had [[Shatter]] in place of [[Iron Shot]], and spawned significantly later.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Jorgrun was a [[deep dwarf (monster)|deep dwarf]] and could not regenerate.\n*In [[0.15]], his [[glyph]] was changed from 'q' to 'g'.\n*Jorgrun was added in [[0.12]].\n\n[[Category:Dwarf]]"}

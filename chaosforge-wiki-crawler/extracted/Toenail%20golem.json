All they’re interested in is turning out toenails—semitransparent, flexible sheets of a hornlike material, as defense against—whom?”<br>\n-Jorge Luis Borges, “Toenails”. 1960.<br>\ntrans. Andrew Hurley, 1998.}}\n<!--monster-bot-end-->\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe bizarre '''toenail golem''' is a moderately powerful construct. They are not terribly dangerous, only posing a threat to flimsy elemental casters caught in melee with them for too long. They are extremely rare, but are slightly more common in the [[Volcano]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They have resistance to all elemental attacks, so use physical damage or non-elemental [[Conjurations]] if you've got them. [[Fire]] and [[cold]] damage are only partially resisted, however, and will take them down with enough applications.\n*They are valid targets for [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]]"}

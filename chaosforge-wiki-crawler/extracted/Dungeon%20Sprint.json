{"title":"Dungeon Sprint","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dungeon_Sprint","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n\n'''Dungeon Sprint''' is a fast-paced Crawl variant in which you must explore a single, often brutally hard, floor in pursuit of the [[Orb of Zot]]. Each map is a unique, mostly fixed floor for you to complete. The floorplan, monsters, and locations of items and shops usually remain the same (some maps feature sub-areas with multiple variations), while the exact items and shops you find are usually random. \n\nOver the course of a single floor, you will find yourself jumping from fighting goblins and rats to high level [[unique]]s, including some bosses only found in them.\n\n==Maps==\nThere are currently nine Sprint maps:\n*[[Red Sonja]]\n*[[The Violet Keep of Menkaure]]\n*[[The Ten Rune Challenge]]\n*[[Fedhas' Mad Dash]]\n*[[Ziggurat Sprint]]\n*[[Thunderdome]]\n*[[The Pits]]\n*[[Arena of Blood]]\n*[[Linesprint]] (|||||||||||||||)\n\nPlayers can easily modify existing levels or even make a new level for Sprint by editing files in the ''source/dat/des/sprint/'' folder. Making new maps is pretty straightforward: Crawl's .des files aren't hard to read and change even for a non-programmer, and there's a how-to guide<ref>https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/docs/develop/levels/syntax.txt</ref> available.\n\n==Differences from Crawl==\nDungeon Sprint features only one level, though densely filled with monsters and hazards. As a result, it has many mechanical differences from vanilla Crawl.\n*Since the game is much shorter, you gain experience 9x faster.<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|player.cc|2482}}</ref>\n*You gain 9x more [[piety]] from killing, and 27x more piety from exploration.<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|religion.cc|2809}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|sprint.cc|17}}</ref>\n**Followers of [[Gozag]] get more gold from corpses.<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|mon-death.cc|407}}</ref>\n**[[Okawaru]] and [[Uskayaw]] do not get a piety boost.\n**[[Ashenzari]] and [[Ru]] make their offers at an accelerated rate. \n**[[Trog]]'s Brothers in Arms and Greater Servant of [[Makhleb]] are 2.5x more costly to invoke.<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|ability.cc|3433}}</ref>\n*There is only one floor:\n**[[Shaft]]s, [[Formicid]] shafting, the [[Delver]] background, and [[Ignis]]' Rising Flame are all disabled.\n**The [[Abyss]] does not exist, so players can not be banished, while banishing monsters effectively kills them. Abyssal Knights start in the Dungeon.\n**[[Okawaru]]'s Arena also doesn't exist, so Duel doesn't, either.\n**As it would mess up sprint progression, floor-wide [[teleportation]] (of you and monsters) is disabled. [[Blink]] is still allowed.\n*To avoid waking up all monsters, the noise made by shouting is halved, and scrolls of noise are removed.<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|makeitem.cc|1381}}</ref>\n*To win, you must return with the [[Orb of Zot]]. [[Rune]]s are not always required; maps can feature zero to all 17 runes (all 4 [[Lair]] branches), or even custom runes.\n*Depending on the map, there may be unique items, monsters, and method of [[score|scoring]].\n*Some mechanics from the vanilla game are reverted:\n**There is no [[sourceless malevolence]] (all 3 of its effects would be invalid, anyways).\n**There is no [[Zot clock]]. The [[meteoran]] species is disabled as a result.\n\n==Trivia==\nDungeon Sprint was inspired by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Horrors the Tomb of Horrors], a Dungeons & Dragons module from the 1970's notorious for being unfairly deadly.\n\n==History==\n*Sprints themselves don't update too much, but changes of new versions of Crawl will often seep and change the balance of various sprints.\n*Dungeon Sprint was initially invented by [[Chapayev]]. It was included as an official part of the downloadable version of ''Crawl'' in [[0.7]], and has had multiple maps added since then.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Zot Defence]] - Another Crawl variant coded by Chapayev.\n*[[Sprint guide]] - Tips and tricks for beating Sprint.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External Links==\n*[http://sites.google.com/site/crawlvariations/dungeon-sprint Initial release's source code]\n\n[[Category:Crawl]]\n[[Category:Crawl variants]]"}

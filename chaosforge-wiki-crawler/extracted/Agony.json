This damage is never directly lethal.}}\n\n'''Agony''' is a monster-only spell which attempts to inflict [[torment]] on a single target in [[LOS]], requiring line of fire. If it succeeds a [[willpower]] check, it cuts their current HP by half. As with regular torment, [[negative energy resistance]] provides protection (players: -5% HP per rN+), as well as torment resistance.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nPlayers can cast an analogous spell, [[Curse of Agony]]. [[Player ghost]]s with Curse of Agony get this spell instead.\n\n==Agonizing Touch==\n'''Agonizing Touch''' has an identical effect to Agony, but it only has a range of 1.\n\n{{monsters with spell|Agonizing Touch}}\n\n==History==\n{{Spell\n|name=Agony\n|level=5\n|school1={{Necromancy}}\n|school2= \n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Necromancy]]\n*[[Book of the Senses]]\n</div>\n|castingnoise=5\n|spellnoise=0\n|power cap=100\n}}\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Agony was a level 5 [[Necromancy]] spell that player could cast, and it only had a range of 1.

[[Fenstrider witch]]es had the player version of Agony, which is now renamed to Agonizing Touch.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Agony had full LOS range. Monsters had plain Agony instead of Agony Range."}

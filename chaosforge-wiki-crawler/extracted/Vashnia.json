{"title":"Vashnia","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Vashnia","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|nagas}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Vashnia the Elite Marksnaga''' is a unique [[list of nagas|naga]] who leads a band of fellow [[naga sharpshooter]]s. She is deadlier and more durable than her allies, and her [[Translocations]] magic can send either herself or her allies backwards. Along with the standard [[longbow]] or [[crossbow]], she also always generates with a [[barding]].\n\nVashnia has the [[:Category:Archer flag|Archer flag]], dealing up to 21 extra damage with ranged weapons.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Snake Pit]]: 2-4\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*In general, you shouldn't try to fight Vashnia and her squad at the same time. If you get shot from 4 nagas at once, you can take up to 180 damage/turn (40 per sharpshooter, 60 from Vashnia) before [[AC]].\n**You may want to try luring monsters away from the group. Due to the \"band\" AI, the squad will generally stick together. However, with enough persistence - and an otherwise safe floor - you can eventually pick off the band.\n**All nagas move slowly. If you are faster than a naga, a good option is to walk away, go upstairs, and avoid her band entirely. If you engage in combat, try to retreat early, since each sharpshooter has free reign to shoot as you are retreating.\n**As with all ranged enemies, a [[kill hole]] can be effective at separating them.\n*Thanks to [[Portal Projectile]], each sharpshooter can attack past one another, so hiding behind enemies doesn't work.\n*She has considerable [[willpower]], though a [[scroll of vulnerability]] or [[orb]] of [[guile]] can bring it down to reasonable levels. [[Tukima's Dance]] is particularly effective. A [[wand of paralysis]] and [[wand of charming]] can do the trick, too.\n*A [[phial of floods]] can disable her blinking, allowing melee characters to catch up.\n**A ''much'' more risky method to disable blinking is a [[potion of attraction]]. First, be certain that none of her band is alive; trying to fight all the sharpshooters at once is bound to end up poorly. Then, you need to be confident to beat Vashnia in the first place; using [[might]] and [[haste]] is highly recommended.\n*Don't bother trying to go [[berserk]], as she'll just blink away and fill you with holes as your rage wears off.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Vashnia will have [[Blink Range]] instead of [[Blink Away]].}}\n*Prior to [[0.19]], she could cast [[Shroud of Golubria]].\n*Vashnia was added in [[0.14]]."}

{"title":"Kobold (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Kobold_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''This page is about the monster. For the player race, see [[kobold]].'' {{list of|kobolds}}\n{{monster info|kobold}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Kobolds''' are puny [[monster]]s who carry weapons, and occasionally spawn with [[poison]]ed [[dart]]s. While weak, they can still take out a starting player. Lone kobolds can be found in the early Dungeon. Packs of kobolds, along with [[kobold brigand]]s, can be in the middle Dungeon and in [[Sewer]]s.\n\n==Tips and Tricks==\n*Hiding behind a corner or another monster will force a kobold to move into melee range with you, rather than throwing stones or darts at you from a distance. It will probably still manage to throw a few before you can get behind cover, but they're usually more manageable in melee.\n*Kobold [[vault]]s are not uncommon in the middle-Dungeon. These contain a horde of kobolds, [[kobold brigand]]s, and possibly a [[kobold demonologist]] or two, the latter of which should definitely be your first priority. Strong melee characters can hold them off one a time in a hallway, while casters should focus on taking out multiple foes at a time or confusing them into self-destruction with [[Mephitic Cloud]].\n*Kobolds can spawn with [[brand]]ed weapons, so don't ignore them. A kobold that spawns with [[electrocution]] or [[distortion]] is ''much'' more dangerous than usual. They can also pick up any item you haven't seen, so be careful.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], kobolds could spawn with [[hand crossbow]]s.\n*In [[0.27]], the hidden weapon penalties for monsters were removed, so all monsters hit harder and faster with weapons. To compensate, kobolds' base damage was reduced from 4 to 1, though they always generate with a weapon. In addition, they can no longer spawn with [[curare]] [[dart]]s.\n\n[[Category:Kobold]]"}

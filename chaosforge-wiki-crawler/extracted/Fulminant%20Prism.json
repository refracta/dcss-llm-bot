Any blow which cracks its fragile surface is likely to result in a violent explosion.}}\n{{AttackSpell\n|name=Fulminant Prism\n|formula = <div>\n*Normal explosion: 3d(6+7*power/40)\n*Weak explosion: 2d(6+7*power/40)\n</div>\n|maxdmg = 3d23 ~ 36\n|maxsp = 200\n|range = 4\n|target = Smite\n|tohit=Never miss\n|special = Detonation radius:<br>2 (normal), 1 (weak)\n}}\n'''Fulminant Prism''' is a level 4 [[Conjurations]]/[[Alchemy]] spell which creates an explosive prism  of the same name.\n\n[[Conjurer]]s start with this spell in their libraries.\n\n==Useful Info==\nFulminant Prism creates a prism at an empty, [[smite-targeted]] location within its range. The prism will detonate with a radius-2 explosion after 20 [[aut]]s, dealing considerable physical damage that can't be blocked or evaded, though it is reduced by [[AC]] as normal. The explosion can hit monsters from outside your [[line of sight]].\n\nThe prism can be damaged and destroyed by enemy attacks; it is rather frail, but immune to most elemental damage. If destroyed prematurely, the prism will create either a smaller, weaker explosion, or no explosion at all (if it is destroyed immediately after being created).\n\nFulminant Prism is considered a conjured entity, not an ally, so it continues to function under [[Okawaru]] or [[Ru#Sacrifices|Sacrifice Love]]. [[Vehumet]] increases the range of where you can place the prism, but doesn't increase the prism's blast radius.\n\nYou don't need to wait for a prism to explode before placing a new one.\n\n==Strategy==\nAlthough you need to place prisms carefully to prevent monsters from destroying them, Fulminant Prism has a number of positives. It is smite-targeted, has a large AOE, and deals decent (never missing) damage. Although there are more time- and [[MP]]-efficient methods for taking out powerful, well-armored opponents, it's excellent for wiping out swarms of smaller foes. \n\nEven as the damage itself starts to become weak, the prism has a few major benefits:\n*The prism itself can block line of fire. A [[shining eye]] can't [[Malmutate]] you through a prism, for example. Enemy [[orbs of destruction]] and rolling [[boulder beetle]]s will collide with the prism. You can use smite-targeted attacks, like [[Airstrike]] and [[Freezing Cloud]], to attack enemies behind a prism.\n*It can hit things from outside line of sight; monsters never attack when outside LOS. Therefore, prisms can be used to whittle down [[oklob plant]]s and [[statue]]s from a position of safety. You can also snipe enemies around corners.\n\nTherefore, Fulminant Prism is often a spell worth keeping, even in the late game.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Don't blow yourself up. If you set a prism 1 space in front of you, a normal-speed species can back up 2 tiles and be safe. \n*Monsters will only target the prism if it would block their intended movement. As the explosion is quite big, you can set it out of an obvious path, if so desired.\n*When climbing up stairs, you can place a prism behind yourself to prevent [[trample]]rs from knocking you off.\n\n==Aiming Prisms==\nAs a normal speed species fighting a 10 speed monster, the following configurations work:\n<gallery widths=\"300px\" heights=\"300px\" class=\"left\" mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Fulm_prism1.png|thumb|left|Place a prism up to 4 tiles in front of a monster, then back away.\nFile:Fulm_prism2.png|thumb|left|You can place a prism 1 tile in front of you, back away, and it won't hit you.\nFile:Fulm_prism3.png|thumb|left|If you're willing to keep enemies in melee, place a prism 3 tiles away from you (2 tiles away from the enemy).\n</gallery>\nNotice how the prisms are in ''front'' of an enemy, but not ''in the direct path'' of it. Remember that diagonals exist. For example, if a monster is down and to the right, you can place the prism up and to the right.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Fulminant Prism was a level 4 Conjurations/[[Hexes]] spell.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Fulminant Prism was a level 5 spell.\n*Fulminant Prism was added in [[0.12]]."}

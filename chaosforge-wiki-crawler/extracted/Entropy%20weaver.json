{"title":"Entropy weaver","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Entropy_weaver","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Entropy weavers''' are potentially devastating humanoid casters, capable of quickly inflicting [[corrosion]], rendering a character extremely weak and vulnerable. They can be found in [[the Spider's Nest]] and rarely in [[the Vaults]], usually accompanied by several [[list of arthropods#Arachnids|spiders]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The best way to counter Entropic Weave is to fight weavers separately from other monsters. Stairs are your friends here.\n**Keep in mind that spells, wands, and Invocations are unaffected by corrosion. If you get corroded, you can switch to attacks that don't involve your weapons.\n**If weapons are your only way to fight, and you get severely corroded, be prepared to make a hasty retreat. With four relatively powerful attacks, even a lone entropy weaver can quickly shred you - having other enemies around only makes it worse.\n*Wearing a [[ring of resist corrosion]] (or any other form of [[corrosion resistance]]) reduces the chance of being corroded by 50%. Since it doesn't provide immunity, you should still try your best to kill them quickly.\n*Entropy weavers can rarely spawn in [[the Lair]] as part of a [[vault]]. It can be wise to skip a floor with an early entropy weaver, and come back later.\n*Entropy weaver [[simulacra]] are deadly, due to their 4 cold-boosted attacks - they can deal up to {52 physical + 84 cold} damage per turn. Like all simulcara, they are frail, so if created use any form of ranged means you can.\n**Simulacra are often created by [[pharaoh ant]]s. When the ant dies, it casts [[Bind Souls]] - killing the weaver after creates a simulacrum. Killing the weaver before the ant prevents Bind Souls from being cast.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], entropy weavers had 13 [[HD]], but no Fighter flag. This made entropy weaver [[simulacra]] significantly more deadly (156 cold damage ''plus'' the same physical damage).\n*Prior to [[0.27]], you could find entropy weavers in ant-themed [[vault]]s. You could find 2 entropy weavers at a time, even in [[the Lair]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], entropy weavers could pick up and use weapons and armour.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], entropy weavers used [[Chant Word of Entropy]] instead of [[Entropic Weave]]. Chant Word of Entropy required several turns to take effect, but applied 4 stacks of corrosion.\n*Entropy weavers were added in [[0.17]]."}

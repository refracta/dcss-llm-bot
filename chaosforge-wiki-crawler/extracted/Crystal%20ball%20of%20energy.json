However, it may fail and drain all of those energies completely, or cause other negative mental effects. When used with low reserves of magic it becomes increasingly likely to deplete those reserves.}}\n\nA '''crystal ball of energy''' is an evocable item which, when used successfully, restores a large amount of your [[MP]] (5 + 1d[[Evocations]]). It has no cost to use, but does have a high failure rate. Failure may result in [[confusion]], loss of MP, or 1-7 points of temporary [[intelligence]] damage.\n\nThe odds of success increase with both your Evocations skill and the percentage of your max MP you still have. Regardless of your Evocations, trying to use this item when nearly out of MP is almost guaranteed to fail, and attempting it while confused will always fail. However, the higher your Evocations, the greater the amount of MP you can spend before using this item becomes unlikely to pay off. See the table below for details:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"text-align: center; border:none; margin:auto; padding:0;\"\n! Evocations !! Min. MP% for<br> max. success rate !! Max. success rate !! MP restored (average)\n|-\n! 2\n| 72% || 8% || 6\n|-\n! 5\n| 66% || 61% || 7.5\n|-\n! 10\n| 56% || 78% || 10\n|-\n! 15\n| 46% || 84% || 12.5\n|-\n! 20\n| 36% || 87% || 15\n|-\n! 25\n| 26% || 89% || 17.5\n|}\n\n==Strategy==\nWith Evocations training, the crystal ball of energy is the most powerful MP restoration item in the game, outperforming even a [[potion of magic]]. However, the results of failure are potentially catastrophic, and even at maximum Evocations there is always a significant failure rate. Pay close attention to your current MP if you're considering using this, and have escape methods lined up that don't rely on MP. Use [[clarity]] to negate the possible confusion effects. Zin's Vitalisation prevents both confusion and int loss, but does not prevent the mp drain. Consider having a [[staff of energy]] to regain mp for the next try if you were drained by this item.\n\n==History==\n*Crystal balls of energy were removed in [[0.25]]."}

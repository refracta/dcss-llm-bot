Its enchantments increase in power when the wearer emerges victorious from threatening combat, but resorting to the use of scrolls or potions for assistance causes them to fade away again.}}\n\n[[File:Victory.png]] '''''the toga \"Victory\"'''''\n\n+0 [[robe]]\n\n[[Clarity]]<br>\nGrants +1 AC, Slay, and Int after killing a dangerous monster. Using a [[scroll]] or [[potion]] with hostile enemies in [[LOS]] will reset the bonuses.\n\n==Mechanics==\nWhen the wearer kills a threatening monster, the toga has a chance to gain +1 AC, +1 Slay, and +1 Int, up to +7. Killing a [[Threat|tough]] monster (\"dangerous\") has a 25% chance to improve the bonuses, and killing a nasty monster (\"extremely dangerous\") always increases the enchantments. See [[Threat]] for how this is calculated.\n\nWhen the wearer uses a scroll or a potion with a hostile monster in sight, its bonuses reset to +0. Unequipping it also resets its bonuses to +0.\n\n==Desirability==\n'''Victory'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|1772}}</ref> is a strong robe, assuming you can level it up early. A +7 robe with +7 slay and +7 int is no slouch. You can still use items like [[wand]]s and [[curare]] [[dart]]s to take out tough monsters. At the same time, don't be afraid of using your potions and scrolls. Using one will resets your bonuses, but being alive (by using said consumables) is much better than being dead with a +7 toga.\n\nIn any case, if you have nothing better than a plain robe or [[leather armour]], you might as well wear Victory. Even at +0, clarity is useful against [[orc wizard]]s and [[sleepcap]]s. If it levels up, all the better.\n\nThis artefact is more likely to spawn in the early game, where it is more likely to be useful.\n\n==History==\n*The toga \"Victory\" was added in [[0.30]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

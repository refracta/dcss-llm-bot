{"title":"Fiend","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fiend","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n'''Fiends''' are three specific [[greater demon]]s, usually found only in the later parts of the game. All of them are able to inflict [[torment]] as well as dangerous direct-damage spells, making them some of the deadliest end-game monsters. They are:\n\n* {{monsterlink|Brimstone Fiend}}s, who also throw [[Damnation]]. Previously they were simply called '''Fiends'''.\n* {{monsterlink|Ice Fiend}}s, who throw [[bolt of cold|bolts of cold]] and have a cold-branded melee attack.\n* {{Magenta|1}} [[File:Tzitzimitl.png]] '''[[Tzitzimitl|Tzitzimimeh]]''' (previously known as '''Shadow Fiends'''), who throw bolts of cold and [[bolt of draining|draining]]. They also cast [[Dispel Undead Range]] and can [[Slow|drain speed]] and the player's [[HP]] with their melee attacks.\n\n==History==\nThese monsters have bedeviled late-game characters since very early versions of ''Crawl''. There used to be another type of fiend, however: [[pit fiend]]s, which were similar to Brimstone Fiends but slower and stronger. They were reworked to become [[Hell Sentinel]]s, gaining normal speed, even more resilience, and nasty Earth conjurations in addition to Damnation, but they lost their ability to torment."}

It may also slow down cold-blooded creatures.}}\nThe '''freezing''' [[brand]] does the following:\n*Adds an average of roughly +25% [[cold]] damage (0% - 50%) to attacks, applied after [[AC]] and all damage factors (including [[slaying]]).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|attack.cc|1585}}<br>Specifically, if you dealt damage, freezing adds <code>(1d<damage_dealt>/2) + 0.5</code> cold damage, rounded down. Therefore, freezing's boost is slightly bigger than 25%. This is more noticeable on weak attacks, e.g. if you dealt 1 damage, you'd always get +1 freezing damage (for an average of +100%).</ref>\n*[[Slow]]s down [[cold-blooded]] monsters that are not resistant to cold.\n\n===Sources===\nAlong with finding freezing weapons as random loot, or using a [[scroll of brand weapon]], freezing can be found on a few monsters:\n*[[Wight]]s frequently carry weapons of freezing.\n*[[Frost giant]]s usually generate with freezing [[battleaxe]]s.\n*[[Fannar]] always comes with a [[staff of cold]] or a [[quarterstaff]] of freezing\n\n==Strategy==\nFreezing is one of a couple percentage-based brands that's good enough to beat a 3-rune game. It's especially good against cold-blooded creatures, including the reptiles in [[the Lair]] and draconians in [[Zot]]. Unlike [[flaming]], freezing works against [[orbs of fire]], so its somewhat better for Zot:5.\n\nAs freezing applies its percentage boost after AC reduction, it is no better or worse when considering strength, weapon type, slaying, or AC. An [[executioner's axe]] of freezing receives the same +25% boost to final damage as a [[quick blade]] of freezing. It's just that a quick blade's base damage is weak, so a brand like [[electrocution]] or [[pain (brand)|pain]] will be stronger for it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.15]], unbranded weapons could be temporarily given this brand with the level 2 spell [[Freezing Aura]]. This temporary brand could be made permanent by reading a [[scroll of vorpalise weapon]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{brands}}\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

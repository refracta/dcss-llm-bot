They are nearly identical to [[gloves]], except that gloves cannot generate as [[gauntlets of War]]. They may generate with the following [[ego]]s:\n*[[Strength]] (+3)\n*[[Dexterity]] (+3)\n\n==Restrictions==\nWearing [[curse]]d gauntlets prevents you from equipping or removing your [[ring]]s. Also, gauntlets are incompatible with the [[Claws]] [[mutation]]; wearing gauntlets over a rank 1 or 2 mutation will negate the mutation, and a rank 3 mutation makes gauntlets unwearable.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Glove1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical/Artifact''' || [[File:Glove2.png]] [[File:Glove3.png]] [[File:Glove4.png]] [[File:Glove5.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]] Gauntlets\n|-\n| '''[[Gauntlets of War]]''' || [[File:Gauntlets of war.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.14]], gauntlets were removed in favor of making all hand-slot armour gloves.\n\n[[Category:Gloves]]"}

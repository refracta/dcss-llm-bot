{"title":"Chaos spawn","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Chaos_spawn","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Chaos spawn''' are weak [[tier-4 demon]]s. Their [[chaos]]-branded attacks inflict random effects, and on death, they create a [[Cloud#Seething_chaos|cloud of seething chaos]] for a few turns. They are occasionally found in [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], or created by [[Summon Demon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Kill them at range. Although it's unlikely that their attacks will [[paralyze]] you, [[confusion|confuse]] you, or send you hurtling into the Abyss, it's best not to risk it.\n*They are one of the few demons which lack [[poison]] resistance, and they have low [[HD]]. [[Mephitic Cloud]] can turn them right back against their summoners.\n\n==Alternate Tiles==\nBeing creatures of chaos, chaos spawn can take many forms:\n\n[[Image:Chaos spawn2.png]] [[Image:Chaos spawn3.png]] [[Image:Chaos spawn4.png]] [[Image:Chaos spawn5.png]] [[Image:Chaos spawn6.png]]\n\nThe difference here is purely cosmetic. In console, they instead change to a random color every turn.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], chaos spawn could [[see invisible]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], chaos spawn were [[tier-3 demon]]s.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

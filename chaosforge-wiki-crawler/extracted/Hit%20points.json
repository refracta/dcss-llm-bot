{"title":"Hit points","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hit_points","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\nA character's '''hit points''' (or '''HP''') reflect their current healthiness and durability, and are displayed in an X/Y format; the X shows your current hit points, while the Y shows your maximum. [[Monster]]s and a wide variety of other effects will all reduce your current HP, but this [[Regeneration rate|recovers over time]] unless you are [[sick]].\n\n==Damage==\nIf at any time your character's current HP reaches 0 or lower, you [[death|die]] and your game is over. You can avoid this by resting between battles, quaffing [[potions of heal wounds]] or [[potion of curing|curing]], or using any of the more exotic [[healing]] methods available.\n\nBe very careful if you ever see the message, \"Ouch! That really hurt!\" pop up - it occurs after you've lost over 50% of your max HP in a single attack.\n\n==Regeneration==\n''Main Article: [[regeneration rate]]''\n\nCharacters which are not [[sick]] or under [[Inhibited Regeneration]] will naturally recover health over time.\n\n==HP modifiers==\nFrom [[Dungeon Crawl]] [[Stone Soup]] in-game documentation:\n{{#invoke:Apt|skill_table|Hit Points}}\n\nEach point is equal to 10% maximum HP.\n\n==Modifying Max HP==\n===Forms===\nThe following forms will change your maximum HP:\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n! Spell || Modifier\n|-\n| [[Serpent Form]] || 1.2\n|-\n| [[Statue Form]] || 1.3\n|-\n| [[Dragon Form]] || 1.5\n|-\n| [[Tree Form]] || 1.5\n|-\n|}\n\nIf are in a [[talisman]] form and do not have the minimum Shapeshifting skill, you get an HP penalty. The penalty is <code>1 - (Skill_min - Skill_current)/10</code> (min. x0.1).\n\n===Statuses===\n\n*[[Berserk]] will multiply your current and maximum HP by 1.5. [[Hat of the Bear Spirit|Bearserk]] multiplies it by 2.\n*[[Drain]] will reduce max HP proportionally to its strength.\n*[[Elyvilon]]'s Divine Vigor increases your max HP temporarily by your Invocations.\n\n===Mutations===\n\n*Gaining the [[Robust]] [[mutation]] increases your max HP by 10% per rank, while [[Frail]] decreases it.\n*Gaining the [[Rugged Brown Scales]] mutation increases your max HP by 3/5/7% (determined by rank).\n\n===Items===\n\n*The [[Rings of the Octopus King]] give you +2 HP.\n\n===Permanent===\nYour permanent max HP only changes under rare circumstance:\n*Leveling up:\n**Gaining an [[experience]] level.\n**Improving your [[Fighting]] skill will increase max HP.\n*Casting [[Borgnjor's Revivification]] permanently reduces your max HP by a small amount, determined by spell power.\n*Running out of time on the [[Zot clock]] permanently reduces your max HP by 16.6%.\n\nThe formula is:\n  Max HP = (Racial Mod.) * (Mutations Mod.) * (Forms Mod.)\n         * (8 + 11*XL/2 + Fighting*XL/14 + (1+Fighting*3)/2)\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], the Zot clock would only apply drain instead of permanent HP reduction. Prior to this, the Zot clock instantly killed you upon running out.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], [[rot]] existed, lowering maximum HP temporarily, like [[Drain]] does now. However, it could be cured with a [[potion of heal wounds]] or [[potion of curing]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], backgrounds had a small effect in the calculation of the player's hit points.\n\n[[Category:Stats]]"}

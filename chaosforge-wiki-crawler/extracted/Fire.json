{"title":"Fire","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fire","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n''Not to be confused with [[damnation]], which was previously known as hellfire.''\n\n'''Fire''' is one of the most common elemental forces you will encounter as you explore the [[Dungeon]]. \n\n==Fire Damage==\nPlayers have many ways to deal fire damage. [[Fire Magic]] is the most obvious, but you can also gain weapons of [[flaming]], or use a [[wand of flame]]. Followers of [[Qazlal]] gain fire through clouds, Upheaval, and Disaster Area.\n\nFire damage is reduced by fire resistance (rF+). All types of fire damage will negate the effects of the [[Icemail]] [[demonspawn mutation]]. Ranged attacks that are \"BEAM_FIRE\" (all [[Fire Magic]]; not including weapons of [[flaming]]) create [[LOS|sight-blocking]] [[steam]] clouds over [[water]]. Powerful fire attacks can light [[bush]]es and [[tree]]s on fire, creating [[Clouds#Spreading flames|spreading flames]].\n\n==Fire Resistance==\nThe fire resistance intrinsic significantly reduces the fire damage a defender takes when attacked:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Resistance Level !! Damage Taken (Player) !! Damage Taken (Monster)\n|-\n| rF+ || 50% || 50%\n|-\n| rF++ || 33% || 20%\n|-\n| rF+++ || 20% || 0%\n|}\n\nHaving any level of fire resistance also gives [[steam resistance]].\n\nYou can acquire fire resistance from a number of sources:\n\n'''Item'''\n*[[Ring of protection from fire]] or [[ring of fire]]: rF+\n*Armour of [[ego|fire resistance]]: rF+\n*[[Fire dragon scales]]: rF++\n*[[Gold dragon scales]]: rF+\n*[[Potion of resistance]]: rF+, among other resistances\n*[[Staff of fire]]: rF+\n*[[Tiamat]]'s [[dragonskin cloak]]: for 50% of attacks, grants rF+\n*[[Randart]]s: rF+, rF++ or rF+++\n\n'''Character'''\n*Being a red [[Draconian]]: rF+\n*Being a [[Djinni]]: rF++\n*[[Good mutations#Heat Resistance|Heat Resistance]] [[mutation]]: rF+/rank\n*The third rank of the [[Good mutations#Molten Scales|Molten Scales]] mutation: rF+\n*[[Dragon Form]] (except as a non-red draconian): rF++\n*Worshipping [[Ignis]]: rF+\n\n===Fire Vulnerability===\nFire vulnerability causes you to take x150% normal damage from most fire attacks, and x200% damage from fire melee attacks. You can acquire it by:\n\n'''Item'''\n*Wearing [[ice dragon scales]] or a [[ring of ice]]\n*Wearing an artefact with rF- or the Ice property\n\n'''Character'''\n*Being a [[Mummy]]\n*[[Ice Form]]\n*The Fire Vulnerability [[mutation]].\n\n'''Status'''\n*Being hit by the [[Sword of Cerebov]]\n*Being hit by a cherry [[Throw Klown Pie|klown pie]]\n\nHaving multiple levels of fire vulnerability does not cause greater damage; it simply makes it more difficult to acquire fire resistance.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], fire damage would melt [[Ozocubu's Armour]].\n*Prior to [[0.22]], [[Dithmenos]] worshippers were forbidden from using fire spells, the flaming brand, and anything that caused fire. Dithmenos also granted additional piety for killing fire enemies.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], [[damnation]] was called [[hellfire]], and monster resistance to it also granted rF+++. Additionally, [[Dithmenos]] hated hellfire/damnation in addition to hating fire.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], taking fire damage would also occasionally destroy [[scroll]]s in your [[inventory]].\n\n==See Also==\n[[:Category:Fire resistance|List of fire resistant monsters]]\n\n[[:Category:Fire vulnerability |List of fire vulnerable monsters]]\n\n[[Category:Fire Magic]]"}

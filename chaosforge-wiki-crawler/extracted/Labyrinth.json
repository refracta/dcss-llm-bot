Old stories say that the labyrinth was constructed as a prison for a fearsome minotaur. More recent stories say this beast dwells there still, guarding the labyrinth's sole exit â€” as well as a rich hoard of treasure taken from the bodies of foolish adventurers.\n}}\n{{flavour|A gateway to an intricate maze designed by subtle and malicious minds, its exit guarded by a fearsome monster. Many a helpless adventurer has lost his way in the twisted, shifting passages, and starved to death.}}\n\n[[File:Labyrinth portal.png]] The '''Labyrinth''' is a temporary sub-[[branch]] containing an elaborate maze that takes up an entire floor. Getting lost and starving to death is a very real possibility for characters who enter without sufficient provisions, and even if you manage to find the exit at its center, a [[minotaur (monster)|minotaur]] guards it fiercely. Labyrinth entrances may occur in [[the Lair]] or on floors in the middle portions of [[the Dungeon]], but are not guaranteed to generate in every game. If you hear the \"ticking of a distant clock\" or a \"distant snort,\" your floor contains a Labyrinth portal. Only one Labyrinth may be generated per game.\n\n===Timeout Messages===\n{{crawlquote|'''1st message''': You hear the ticking of a clock.<br>'''2nd message''': You hear the brisk ticking of a clock.<br>'''3rd message''': You hear the frantic ticking of a clock.<br>'''4th message''': You hear the last, dying ticks of the clock.}}\n\n==Layout==\nAlthough no two Labyrinths will be identical, their layouts are all very similar; they are all made almost entirely of winding, empty, one-tile wide hallways that span a massive area. Exploration is difficult, as portions of the map you've previously explored will rapidly be forgotten once they leave your [[line of sight]]. Mentally keeping track of where you've been helps tremendously in avoiding getting lost, but the Labyrinth will occasionally shift tiles around, opening or closing random passages (you'll notice the sound of gears and machinery whenever this occurs). This makes the \"left-hand\" rule somewhat less reliable for finding your way out. There is only one safe exit from the Labyrinth, located at the center of the maze with a sizable treasure heap and a minotaur standing guard. You may also come across a portal to [[the Abyss]] as you explore, but using it is generally a suicidal idea for characters this early in the game.\n\nFortunately the maze does provide clues to let you know you're going in the right direction. The outermost portions of the Labyrinth are composed of rock [[wall]]s, but as you get closer to the center, these will change to stone and eventually metal. The exit [[vault]] is sometimes made from a material that distinguishes it from the metal surroundings (such as crystal), but this is not guaranteed. Apart from the risk of starvation, exploration is generally safe; traps can only generate in the minotaur's chambers, and there are almost no monsters to encounter outside of the occasional vault. Other surprises are few and far between, and usually amount to nothing more than props to add atmosphere or tiny false exit vaults, though the monster vaults will often have a couple of extra items lying around.\n\nThe auto-explore feature is disabled in Labyrinths, forcing you to pick your way through manually. Also, the Labyrinth causes all teleports to deposit you farther from the center than you initially were. While this stops you from simply teleporting randomly until you find the core, it can give you a rough idea of the direction you should be heading.\n\nOnce you've left a Labyrinth, you can never return.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Even though there are next to no sources of food in the Labyrinth, the actual risk of starvation you face is dependent on your [[species]] and the permafood you have on hand when you enter. Average species can usually complete a Labyrinth carrying two or three rations with a very wide safety margin. [[Ghoul]]s and [[troll]]s may want to steer clear of a Labyrinth unless they've got a comfortably large food stock, and any character has a chance of running afoul of some [[hungry ghost]]s while wandering the maze.\n*Certain abilities can make the Labyrinth a much less frustrating place. [[Ashenzari]] followers with high piety will have no trouble finding their way out as they can simply see through walls. [[Passwall]] or a [[wand of digging]] allow you to bypass the outer portion of the maze, reducing the area you have to search.\n**While [[Lugonu]] worshipers may be tempted to simply corrupt reality and march on the exit that way, the neutral [[demon]]s this spawns will very likely pose a much greater threat than the maze and minotaur.\n*The loot pile at the end often contains a wide variety of items, making it worthwhile for any character to explore a Labyrinth. Although much of the loot will be junk, make sure to leave several [[inventory]] slots open before entering.\n\n==Monsters==\n===Found in vaults===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Redback}} || {{monsterlink|Earth elemental}} || {{LightGrey|9}} [[File:Gargoyle (monster).png]] '''[[Gargoyle (monster)|Gargoyle]]''' || {{monsterlink|Basilisk}} || {{monsterlink|Unseen horror}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Shadow}} || {{monsterlink|Hungry ghost}} || {{LightGrey|Z}} [[File:Skeleton medium humanoid.png]] '''[[Skeleton (monster)|Skeleton]]''' || {{Brown|Z}} [[File:Zombie minotaur.png]] '''[[Zombie]]''' ||\n|}\n\n===Boss: Minotaur===\n{{LightRed|H}} [[File:Minotaur (monster).png]] The '''[[Minotaur (monster)|minotaur]]''' guarding the exit makes for a formidable opponent. Characters that wish to engage it in melee must overcome powerful attacks (including a headbutt counterattack) and enough health and armour to take a beating, spellcasters or ranged specialists who prefer to fight from a distance will have to face a barrage of [[tomahawk]]s or [[javelin]]s, and hexers will find overcoming the minotaur's magic resistance difficult at best. Don't be afraid to pull out all the stops in the fight; buff potions, powerful wands, evokables -- use any and all tactics you can to give yourself an edge.\n\nBe aware that there's a chance the minotaur might pick up and use some of the treasure if it happens to wander over the loot pile before you get to the exit. Be sure to e'''x'''amine the minotaur to see what sort of equipment it has before engaging it; a minotaur wielding an [[artefact]] weapon it picked up is far more dangerous than usual.\n\n==History==\n*[[0.23]] replaced the labyrinth with the [[Gauntlet]], a different portal level consisting of a series of arenas ending in a fight with a minotaur.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], minotaurs did not spawn with armor or throwing weapons and there were generally a few more pieces of treasure at the exit.\n*In [[0.19]], [[Donald]] stopped appearing in the Labyrinth.\n*As of [[0.14]], the Labyrinth contains occasional [[vault]]s that can place a limited set of monsters.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], [[Donald]] could not appear in the Labyrinth.\n*In earlier versions of ''Crawl'', [[minotaur]] characters were able to map the Labyrinth with much greater precision than the other [[species]]. Also, multiple Labyrinths could appear in a single game until [[0.8]].\n*In much older versions of ''Crawl'', the Labyrinths were significantly different: they were completely static layouts in the form of a rectangular spiral, with numerous passages simply leading nowhere.  The exit could be at the center or on the outside.  This layout was simpler than the current one, but these older mazes could not be mapped at all: tiles were forgotten the instant they were out of view.\n\n[[Category:Portals]]"}

{"title":"Mace of Variability","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mace_of_Variability","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|A large mace said to have appeared when Xom grew bored with the predictability of more ordinary instruments of chaos. Striking an enemy with this weapon will occasionally unleash arcs of chaos upon any creatures nearby, leaving the wielder unharmed.}}\n\n[[File:Mace_of_variability.png]] '''''the Mace of Variability'''''<br>\n\n+7 [[great mace]]<br>\n[[Chaos]] brand<br>\n20% chance to cast [[Chain of Chaos]] on hit<br>\nColor changes each turn in console mode\n\n==Mechanics==\nOn 20% of attacks that hit, but do not kill the enemy, [[Chain of Chaos]] is cast with the following parameters:\n{{crawlquote|'''Spell power:''' 74 + 1d75<br>\n'''Base damage:''' 3d(5 + power/6) (minimum 3d17, maximum 3d25)}}\n\nThe Chain of Chaos can \"arc\" to other enemies near the target.\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''Mace of Variability'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|215}}</ref>, like any weapon of chaos, is naturally risky to use. You can always [[haste]] or [[berserk]] the enemy you're fighting, which can make any situation much more dangerous.\n\nIf you don't care about being consistent, it can be a strong and/or fun weapon to use. Chain of Chaos has a ~92% chance to hurt (or otherwise hinder) enemies it hits, and chaos itself has a ~90% chance to do so.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.22]], it did not cast Chain of Chaos. Instead, its [[enchant]]ment was variable, ranging from -4 to +16, with a 20% chance to increase by 1 and a 20% chance to decrease by 1 for every turn wielded.\n*This is one of the original five artefacts in the game (the others being the [[Wrath of Trog]], the [[Scythe of Curses]], the [[Singing Sword]], and the [[Glaive of Prune]]). It has evolved somewhat through the years, changing from a [[mace]] to a great mace, gaining a [[chaos]] brand, and having its variable enchantment replaced with a chain of chaos effect.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

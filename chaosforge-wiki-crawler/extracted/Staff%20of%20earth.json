If the wielder is skilled in Evocations and Earth magic, they can fracture the ground beneath those struck by it, dealing substantial damage - though much less to creatures which fly.}}\n\nA '''staff of earth''' is a [[magical staff]]. It gives a [[spell enhancer]] to [[Earth Magic]], but no resistance.\n\nThe staff can also be used in combat, functioning as a +0 [[staff]] that deals additional physical damage. [[Flying]] monsters only take 33% of this damage:\n\n{{crawlquote|'''Shrapnel Damage''': A random amount ranging from 0 to 1.5×(Evocations/2 + Earth Magic)<br>'''Chance to Activate on a Hit''': (Evocations + Earth Magic/2)×6.66% per hit}}\n\nIn addition, the [[Staves]] and [[Fighting]] skills will increase the damage done by the staff itself.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], staves of Earth had higher base bonus damage (<code>1.67×(Evocations/2 + Earth Magic)</code>), and it didn't do less to [[flying]] targets. However, this damage was impacted ×3 as much by [[AC]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], staves of earth had lower extra damage, but it was reduced by AC only once. The old melee effect was given to [[staff of conjuration|staves of conjuration]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], enhancer staves would penalize casting spells of the opposite school.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], the chance of a staff of earth auto-identifying when wielded depended on the Earth Magic skill of the wielder."}

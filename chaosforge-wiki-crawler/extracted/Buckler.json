These penalties will be reduced and eventually eliminated with increased Shields skill.}}\n\n'''Bucklers''' are the smallest kind of [[shield]], with the least [[SH]] bonus but the least encumbrance. Most characters will receive tiny penalties from a buckler, even at 0 Shields skill. While wielding a buckler, you can [[Shields#Blocking|block]] a maximum of 2 attacks per turn. They are the only type of shield that [[Spriggan]]s can handle, but they are too small for [[Oni]] and [[Troll]]s to use.\n\n==Egos==\nThey can be found with the following [[ego]]s:\n*[[Reflection]]\n*[[Protection]]\n*[[Cold resistance]]\n*[[Fire resistance]]\n*[[Poison resistance]]\n*[[Positive energy]]\n*[[Resistance_(ego)|Resistance]]\n\nShield egos are relatively rare. Of the egos, reflection and protection are the most common. You can occasionally find cold resistance and fire resistance in [[Ice cave]]s and [[Volcano]]s, respectively.\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Buckler 1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Buckler 2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artefact''' || [[File:Buckler 3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]\n|-\n| '''[[Warlock's Mirror]]''' || [[File:Warlock.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], shields did not have a maximum number of blocks per turn. Instead, the more blocks you made per turn, the less likely the next block was to be made.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], bucklers' penalties were negated completely by 4 Shields skill.\n*Shield penalties increased in [[0.27]].\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Shields]]"}

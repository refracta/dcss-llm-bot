Their singing will [[mesmerize]] you, preventing you from moving away. Mermaids are commonly found in [[the Shoals]].\n\n===Variant Mermaid===\nOne variation of [[the Sewers]] has a few '''malarious mermaids''' in it. They have significantly lower HD than normal mermaids, but can still mesmerize you and prevent you from moving away from them.\n\n{{flavour|Like other mermaids, this young merfolk woman who has become an acolyte of the sunken god, and is undergoing a transformation into an avatar. She looks deeply ill, but her voice still has the power to instill a powerful fascination in her victims.}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*High [[magic resistance]] will let you ignore a mermaid's song. The spell can also be broken early by killing or confusing the mermaid, using a [[scroll of noise]], or wielding a [[lantern of shadows]] to reduce your [[LOS]] so you can't see the mermaid anymore.\n*Although random [[blink]]s and [[teleport]]s can also break mesmerism if you manage to leave LOS, you cannot willingly make ''controlled'' blinks or teleports away. If you can't lose the intrinsic no matter what, try teleporting to a space occupied by a monster to force the game to send you on a random teleport instead.\n*Fortunately, mermaids will still try to close into melee with you. Unless you're in extreme danger, all you really have to do is wait for them to get close enough for you to hit them (though they often have [[polearms]], allowing them to poke at you from a distance).\n\n==History==\nMermaids were renamed in [[0.16]] to [[siren]]s. The former sirens were changed to [[merfolk avatar]]s.\n\n[[Category:Merfolk]]"}

{"title":"Killer bee","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Killer_bee","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Killer bees''' are poisonous flying insects that live up to their name. They're twice as fast as most characters, attack in swarms, and can quickly inject fatal amounts of [[poison]]. They are found in the mid-[[Dungeon]], as well as in \"[[hive]]\" [[vault]]s scattered around elsewhere.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Never believe that there's just one bee on the floor - they always travel with friends. Try to use hallways if you can.\n*With [[poison resistance]] and decent [[AC]], a bee swarm is a nuisance. With only poison resistance, they can be a handful if they surround you. Without either, charging into melee is often suicide.\n*Be extremely wary of [[out of depth]] swarms of bees. It's almost certain death to fight a swarm on D:4, even if in a hallway. If possible, close [[door]]s with '''C''' to keep them from reaching you.\n*Later in the game, watch out for [[queen bee]]s, who can [[berserk]] nearby killer bees. Even if you can [[tab]] through regular bees, a dozen berserked bees can be a serious threat.\n*The following are particularly effective against bee swarms:\n**[[Poison]] attacks work wonders. [[Mephitic Cloud]] will make a tightly-clumped swarm slaughter itself. [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] will slaughter large bee rooms. A weapon of [[venom]] can quickly kill if it hits, but due to their 18 EV, this isn't as reliable.\n**Bees have relatively low [[willpower]], so a [[wand of charming]] can be effective in turning some of them onto your side.\n**A [[potion of lignification]] can give characters some much-needed AC and poison resistance, greatly reducing the threat of a pack of bees.\n**When things go badly, don't forget about your [[potions of curing]]."}

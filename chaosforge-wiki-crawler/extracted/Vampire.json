{"title":"Vampire","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Vampire","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n''This article covers the player [[species]]. For the monster, see [[Vampire (monster)]]. For a list of all monstrous vampires, see [[List of vampires]].''\n{{flavour|Vampires are another form of undead, but with a peculiarity: they may become alive. A bloodless Vampire has the traits of an undead (immunity to poisons, negative energy and torment, resistant to damage from the cold), but cannot physically regenerate when monsters are in sight and are less resilient. On the other hand, a Vampire full with blood will regenerate very quickly, but will lose all undead powers. Upon growing, they learn to transform into fast-moving bats. Unlike other undead species, they may be mutated normally at all times.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*'''[[Acute Vision]]:''' Vampires can [[see invisible]].\n*'''[[Fangs|Fangs 3]]:''' Vampires have razor-sharp teeth, allowing a bonus auxiliary attack. While Bloodless, vampires can also restore a small amount of HP every time they successfully bite a living foe.\n* Vampires can change blood level (Alive or Bloodless) at will. See below for more details.\n*Vampires are [[undead]], which results in the following traits ''even when Alive'':\n**Vampires may not worship [[Zin]], [[Elyvilon]], or [[the Shining One]]. The holy wrath brand will not function on weapons they wield.\n**Vampires are vulnerable to [[holy]] damage, weapons of holy wrath, and [[Dispel Undead]]. (However, Dispel Undead will never be used against the player when alive due to how monsters check vulnerability).\n**Vampires can never cast [[Borgnjor's Revivification]] or [[Death's Door]], nor can they enter [[Death Form]].\n**Vampires cannot become [[Cause Fear|afraid]].\n**Vampires may still [[mutate]], regardless of blood level.\n\nVampires have a base [[Strength]] of 7, [[Intelligence]] of 10 and [[Dexterity]] of 9 (before Background modifiers) and have normal base [[magic points]].\n\n===Blood-Dependent Stats===\n[[File:Exsanguinate.png]] [[File:Revivify.png]] Vampires may switch between Alive and Bloodless using their natural abilities Exsanguinate and Revivify. Both abilities take 60 [[aut]]s (6 turns) to complete. Additionally, when transitioning from Bloodless back to Alive, you gain one temporary rank of the [[Frail]] [[mutation]] (-10% Maximum HP); like other temporary mutations, this will eventually fade as you gain [[experience]].\n\n{| border = \"1\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n! || Alive ||  Bloodless\n|-\n| '''[[Regeneration rate|Regeneration]]''' || Fast (+0.2HP/turn) || None while monsters are visible\n|-\n| '''HP Modifier''' || None || -20% HP\n|-\n| '''[[Stealth]] Boost''' || None || +100 to [[Stealth#Stealth Score|Stealth Score]]\n|-\n| '''[[Vampiric]] [[Auxiliary attack|Bite]]''' || No || Yes\n|-\n!colspan=3 align=\"center\"| ''Resistances''\n|-\n| '''[[Poison]] Resistance''' || No || Immune\n|-\n| '''[[Cold]] Resistance''' || None || 2\n|-\n| '''[[Negative Energy]] Resistance''' || None || 3\n|- \n| '''[[Torment]] Resistance''' || No || Yes\n|- \n!colspan=3 align=\"center\"| ''Transformations''\n|-\n| '''[[Bat Form]]''' ability || No || Yes (level 3)\n|- \n| '''Other [[Transformation]]s<br> and [[Berserk]]''' || Yes ||  No\n|}\n\nBloodless vampires also have the following properties:\n*Lacking blood: [[Sublimation of Blood]] is unavailable, and [[skyshark]]s do not benefit from bloodzerk.\n*[[Unbreathing]]: Immune to [[water elemental|drowning]] damage and to [[ballistomycete spore|spore confusion]].\n*Cannot be put to [[sleep]].\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Warriors:''' [[Gladiator]], [[Brigand]]\n*'''Warrior-mages:''' [[Enchanter]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Necromancer]], [[Ice Elementalist]]. [[Earth Elementalist]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[dexterity]] or [[intelligence]] every 5th level.\n*Average [[hit points]].\n*+4 [[willpower]] per level.\n*[[File:Bat form.png]] Starting at level 3, vampires can change to [[Bat Form]] at will when Bloodless. \n**This allows movement at [[spriggan]] speed (6 auts instead of 10) and increases your base [[dexterity]] by 5, but temporarily drains all of your stats by 2 each, disables many items, melds all armour and jewellery except your [[amulet]], prevents spellcasting, and weakens melee attacks. Wands and divine abilities may still be used while in bat form. Entering bat form costs 2 MP and provides [[flight]] for the extent of the transformation.\n{{flavour|Transforms the user into a swift-moving vampire bat, increasing evasion but substantially weakening melee attacks. The transformation drains the user's attributes.\n\nWhile transformed, any equipped weapons, armour and rings are melded, and the user becomes unable to cast spells.}}\n\n==Starting Skills and Equipment==\nVampires start with all the skills and equipment listed for their background.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Hard}}\n\nAs long as you play according to your aptitudes and take advantage of your special abilities, you can do very well without too much fuss. Bat Form is extremely helpful as a means of escape, especially early on, and it becomes available at level 3 (but only when Bloodless). Vampires excel at Hexes and have good magic aptitudes overall. Their Hexes proficiency coupled with their exceptional Stealth aptitude and stealth bonus when Bloodless means that Vampires are particularly well suited to the [[Enchanter]] background.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Vampire}}\n\n==Strategy==\nExactly how to use your variable blood states will depend on a number of things. At Bloodless, you suffer reduced health and hindered regeneration (bad) in exchange for Bat Form (good), increased stealth (depends), and several resistances (helpful, but somewhat situational).\n\nKeep in mind that switching blood states requires a significant delay. Try to anticipate situations where you might want increased regeneration or your undead resistances and set up ahead of time, as trying to switch mid-fight may well be suicidal.\n\nYour innate escape ability, [[Bat Form]], is usable only while Bloodless. Furthermore, it renders you mostly helpless and drains your stats each time you use it, so try not to over-rely on escaping as a bat.\n\nYou can cope with limited HP regeneration while Bloodless in a number of ways:\n*Reusable options available regardless of god choice include stabbing living enemies, casting the [[Vampiric Draining]] spell, or wielding a [[vampiric]]-branded weapon. Unfortunately, these methods are of almost no use in the [[Crypt]], [[Pan]], [[Hell]]s, or [[Tomb]], which are dominated by unholy creatures that provide no health in this way.\n*In an emergency situation, [[potion]]s can still be used.\n*[[Makhleb]] provides the most consistent healing, as killing anything has a good chance of healing a significant amount of HP. One downside of this ability for Necromancers or Summoners is that, while Makhleb acknowledges allied kills through Piety gain, it does not grant HP for such kills.  \n\n==Trivia==\nUnlike most other attack options, many combat-oriented [[Invocations]] are not disabled while in Bat Form. This is the basis of various self-imposed challenges that center around staying in Bat Form as much as possible by, for instance, worshiping Makhleb and using its destruction and summoning abilities to dispatch enemies.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], vampires were explicitly [[unbreathing]].\n*Prior to [[0.24]], vampires had a hunger clock. Instead of using food like other species, they could drink blood directly from corpses (using '''e''') or bottle the blood into [[potion of blood|potions]] (using '''c''') to drink later. When at least Full, vampires would both heal and hunger quickly but lost all of their undead benefits. When Thirsty or below, they healed and hungered slowly, but could enter Bat Form and their undead traits would gradually assert themselves the closer to Bloodless they became. Additionally, entering Bat Form did not incur stat reduction.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], vampires could not use wands while in bat form.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], vampires had six distinct satiation states instead of four.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], vampires did not gain a stat every 5th level.\n*Prior to [[0.16]] vampire characters couldn't bottle up blood from the beginning.\n*Prior to [[0.15]] thirsty vampires received only half the effect from most potions. Also, vampires wouldn't mutate and would lose the effect of mutations at or below near bloodless.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], vampires could not cast [[Cure Poison]], even when they had blood.\n\n{{species}}"}

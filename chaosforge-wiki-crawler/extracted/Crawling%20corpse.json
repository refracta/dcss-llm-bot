{"title":"Crawling corpse","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Crawling_corpse","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n<!--monster-bot-begin-->\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Crawling corpses''' are the sad result of casting the [[Twisted Resurrection]] spell with [[corpse]]s in your [[line of sight]]. These husks have no offensive or defensive capabilities, and will generally do nothing but fuse with each other, with [[macabre mass]]es, or with [[small abomination]]s. When there is nothing left to fuse with, they will simply follow you around, waiting for you to generate more flesh for fusing.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Crawling corpses will happily charge through [[trap]]s to follow you, and are easy pickings for any monster. Try to convert them up to abominations as quickly as you can, as you'll be wasting them if they fall in battle.\n\n==History==\n*Crawling corpses were removed in [[0.27]]."}

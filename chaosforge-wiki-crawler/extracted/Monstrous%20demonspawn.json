{"title":"Monstrous demonspawn","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Monstrous_demonspawn","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{list of | demonspawn}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Monstrous demonspawn''' are demonspawn with several melee attacks and more hit points than other demonspawn. They can be found in the [[Pandemonium]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n\nSince they don't have ranged attacks unless they find or generate with a ranged weapon, [[kiting]] them and using powerful ranged spells works well. If you end up in melee, high level [[fighter]]s shouldn't have too much trouble, but low [[XL]] characters should stick with spells and ranged weapons. If you end up in melee range, use a [[potion of might]] if you have one, and use your heal wounds potions or wands on yourself as needed. [[Berserk]]ing isn't usually a good idea since they have a large amount of [[HP]]. Like all demonspawn, they are also vulnerable to holy weapons and [[silver]], so use those if you have them.\n\n==History==\n*Monstrous demonspawn were removed in [[0.28]].\n*Monstrous demonspawn were added in [[0.14]].\n[[Category:Demonspawn]]"}

{"title":"Orc wizard","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Orc_wizard","type":"raw","data":"{{version027}}\n{{list of | orcs}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Orc wizards''' are the first enemy casters most players will encounter. They can deal significant [[fire]] damage at range, turn [[invisible]], and confuse you. They often travel with a band of other [[orc]]s and like to turn [[invisible]] so they can snipe you while you deal with their friends. They are a common menace as early as Dungeon:2, and can also be found in the [[Orcish Mines]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Getting confused while under assault from several orcs is a quick way to lose an early character. Neutralize orc wizards on sight, don't be afraid to quaff a [[potion of curing]] to clear your head, and keep [[willpower]] high if you've found a means of doing so that early in the game.\n*Orc wizards are dangerous in wide open areas, but much easier to handle if you can filter them and their allies into a narrow corridor. Unlike [[orc priest]]s, they need a clear line of fire to target you with any of their abilities.\n*[[Magic Dart]], [[Freeze]], and [[Vampiric Draining]] are all early spells that never miss, rendering enemy invisibility a moot point. You can also use [[Corona]] or perhaps [[Sticky Flame]] to outright negate their invisibility.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], orc wizards could have one of three possible spell sets:\n**[[Magic Dart]] (3d4), [[Slow]], [[Haste]], and [[Blink]]\n**[[Magic Dart]] (3d4), [[Throw Flame]] (3d5), [[Confuse]], and [[Invisibility]]\n**[[Cantrip]], [[Magic Dart]] (3d4), [[Throw Frost]] (3d5), [[Throw Flame]] (3d5), [[Haste]], and [[Invisibility]]\n\n[[Category:Orc]]"}

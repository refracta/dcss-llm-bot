The Fire status deals <code>2d(3 + power/14)</code> fire damage per turn, ignoring [[AC]].<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|beam.cc|4075}}</ref> It also causes the target to become [[backlit]], making them easier to hit, and revealing [[invisible]] creatures.\n\nThe Fire status lasts for <code>3 + power/20</code> to <code>3 + power/10</code> turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|beam.cc|4823}}</ref>\n\nWhen the target physically moves, the Fire status will quickly run out. For monsters, each movement reduces duration by 5 turns. For players, each move reduces duration by 6 turns. For players only, if your post-movement duration is â‰¤ 2 turns, the status automatically ends. Also, entering or being in [[water]] (even when [[flying]]) will immediately end the Fire status.\n\n[[Insubstantial]] creatures are immune to the Fire status, but still take impact damage from the spell.\n\n==Strategy==\nA moderately strong damage spell, good for those who don't mind getting into melee range. You can open a fight with Sticky Flame, then use [[Flame Wave]] or a melee attack. The main downside is the 1-tile range, which isn't great for squishy casters. Many monsters, such as [[hydra]]s, are too dangerous to engage in melee.\n\nNote that Sticky Flame deals a fair amount of impact damage. You should use other spells if available, but if you have nothing better, this spell can be decent to spam.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Sticky Flame can be used to reveal [[invisible]] monsters (use '''Z''' on a suspected tile). This isn't useful against [[unseen horror]]s, since they constantly move around. Neither can it be used on [[shadow]]s, since they are insubstantial. But it does work against [[sky beast]]s and casters of [[Invisibility]].\n\n==Monster Version==\nMost monsters use [[Pyre Arrow]], which inflicts the Fire status from range, but doesn't deal impact damage.\n\n[[Player ghost]]s will cast Sticky Flame, however.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], Sticky Flame was reworked. Prior to this version:\n**Sticky Flame was a level 4 [[Conjurations]]/[[Fire]] spell, and it only dealt <code>2d(1.5 + power/24)</code> impact damage.\n**The Fire status dealt always dealt 2d4 damage; it did not depend on power.\n**The duration was equal to <code>4.5 * levels</code>turns, for levels = <code>(pow/96 + 1.37)</code>.\n**The Fire status did not expire faster when the target moves.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the Fire status dealt <code>2d4 - 1</code> damage per turn. However, [[attacks of opportunity]] didn't exist, so the spell was more viable to normal speed species.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], [[Fire Elementalist]]s started with this spell.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the Fire status wasn't [[dispel]]lable.\n*Earlier versions had more ways for players to gain resistance to sticky flames:\n**Prior to [[0.25]], [[Tiamat]]'s [[dragonskin cloak]] had a 50% chance of providing sticky flame resistance when hit by sticky flames\n**Prior to [[0.20]], [[draconian|mottled draconians]] and players wearing [[mottled dragon scales]] were always resistant\n*Prior to [[0.22]], Sticky Flame would spread between adjacent [[sheep]] and [[dream sheep]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Sticky Flame's enchantment level depended on the victim's [[HD]] rather than the power of the spell.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

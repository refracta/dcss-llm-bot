The caster's demise will cause the transformation to end.}}\n\n'''Porkalator''' is a monster-only spell. If it beats a [[willpower]] check, it turns the target into a pig. For players, you are temporarily forced into [[Pig Form]]. This melds all equipment except [[amulet]], prevents spellcasting, and greatly weakens your Unarmed Combat. Monsters are turned into a [[hog]], [[hell hog]], or [[holy swine]], for [[natural]], [[demonic]], and [[holy]] monsters respectively. Players do not get these alternate forms.\n\nLike the [[Polymorph]] spell, players can be immune by being [[undead]] or in another [[bad form]], and can resist this spell with willpower. Monsters that are [[undead]] or [[nonliving]] are immune to this spell.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*As with any other non-damaging enchantment, high [[willpower]] will help you to avoid becoming porkalated. Will+++ reduces the success rate to single digit percentages.\n*You can end this form early by quaffing a [[potion of cancellation]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

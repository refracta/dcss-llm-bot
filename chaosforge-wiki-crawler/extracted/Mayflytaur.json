This applies separately to every source of damage, every time it is dealt; for instance, damage shaving generally negates the effects of all but the worst cases of being [[poison]]ed.\n\nMayflytaurs have a base [[Strength]] of 9, [[Intelligence]] of 9, and [[Dexterity]] of 9 (before [[background]] modifiers). They start with an extra [[MP]] point.\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Adventurers:''' [[Delver]] and [[Wanderer]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[strength]], [[intelligence]], or [[dexterity]] (equal chance) every 3rd level.\n*20% more [[HP]] than average.\n*+5 [[willpower]] per level.\n*At level 6, gain [[Mana Regeneration]] 1.\n*At levels 9 and 18, your Passive Mapping is upgraded to ranks 2 and 3, respectively.\n*At level 12, gain [[Regeneration (mutation)|Regeneration]] 1.\n*At level 14, gain [[Life Protection]] 1.\n\n==Starting Skills and Equipment==\nMayflytaurs start with the skills and equipment listed for their background.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Hard}}\nThanks to their extremely restrictive turn conducts, playing like any other character is outright impossible. Mayflytaurs would often have to skip floors and imploy [[speedrun|meta turncount strategies]] just to live. These tactics also tend to make My players underleveled, even with their obscene stats.\n\n{{aptitudes\n|arm = 1\n|ddg = 1\n|sth = 3\n|stb = n/a\n|shd = 1\n|t&d = n/a\n|inv = 2\n|evo = 1\n|exp = 0\n|fgt = 1\n|sbl = 3\n|lbl = 3\n|axs = 1\n|m&f = 3\n|pla = 3\n|stv = 3\n|u_c = 3\n|thr = 2\n|slg = 3\n|bws = 2\n|crb = 2\n|spc = 2\n|coj = 1\n|hex = 2\n|cha = n/a\n|sum = 2\n|nec = 1\n|trl = 2\n|trm = 1\n|fir = 1\n|ice = 1\n|air = 1\n|ear = 1\n|poi = 1\n}}\n\n==History==\n*Mayflytaurs were [https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/ad05b8d81 added] on 1 April 2022 and removed on the next day. 26 players managed to win 32 out of 736 games (4.35% win rate), and Sapher got a new best [[score]] result with a [https://underhound.eu/crawl/morgue/Sapher/morgue-Sapher-20220415-104228.txt MyTm].\n*Mayflytaurs originate from hellmonk's [[variants#bloatcrawl2|fork]], [https://github.com/Hellmonk/bloatcrawl2 bloatcrawl2]. As it was forked before the introduction of the [[Zot clock]], Mayflytaurs instead immediately die after turn 20,000. They don't gain passive mutations, but have a different set of aptitudes (most skills are +4).\n\n{{species}} [[Category:Obsolete species]]"}

{"title":"Paladin","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Paladin","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n''This article is about the obsolete player class. For the monster, see [[Paladin (monster)]].\n\n'''Paladins''' are holy warriors who worship [[the Shining One]], and share many abilities of the [[Fighter]] and the [[Priest]]. In particular, they are charged with smiting evil, and gain power from destroying demons, the undead, and other evil beings.\n\nNote that a Paladin's religion requires them to fight honorably. They must refrain from using [[poison]], unholy magic or items, or attacking while [[invisibility|invisible]]. Nor can they attack a confused, held, fleeing, sleeping, paralyzed, or otherwise helpless opponent, unless that opponent is evil. Of course, you may deem [[the Shining One]]'s protection and gifts to be more than worth all this restraint.\n\nPaladins begin with 28 [[piety]].\n\n==Racial Restrictions==\nAs with other religious classes, [[demigod]]s cannot be Paladins. In addition, the undead races ([[Mummy|mummies]], [[ghoul]]s, and [[vampire]]s) and [[demonspawn]] may not start as Paladins, since [[the Shining One]] will not accept them as followers. Even temporarily becoming undead via the [[Necromutation]] spell will result in excommunication.\n\n[[Human]]s, [[high elves]], [[mountain dwarves]], [[hill orc]]s, [[centaur]]s, and [[minotaur]]s are the recommended races for this class.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\n*Paladins start with a +0 [[falchion]], +0 [[ring mail]], +0 [[shield]], [[potion of healing]], and a [[bread ration]], before racial variation.\n\n==Starting Skills==\nAdjusted for species aptitudes:\n*[[Fighting]] 2\n*[[Long Blades]] 3\n*[[Shields]] 2\n*[[Armour (skill)|Armour]] 2\n*[[Invocations]] 2\n\n==History==\nPaladins were removed in [[0.8.0]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete backgrounds]]\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

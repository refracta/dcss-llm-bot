{"title":"Natasha","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Natasha","type":"raw","data":"{{version|030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Natasha, Servant of Life and Death''' is a [[unique]] [[felid (monster)|felid]] wizard. Although not very durable, she is fast and capable of [[Call Imp|summoning imps]] to her aid, as well as inflicting irresistible damage at any range and disabling you with [[status effect]]s. On top of all that, she has three lives; when killed, she will respawn elsewhere on the floor twice before finally dying for good.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:2-4\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Her summons can quickly turn the fight into a disastrous situation. Consider retreating and returning later if she manages to get a sizable imp army up before you can reach her. Remember that summons will vanish as soon as the summoner is defeated (even if she still has extra lives.)\n*Natasha can wield wands and has been known to spawn with a [[wand of polymorph]] in addition to her own Slow spell. Be cautious if you have low [[willpower]].\n*If you are trying to track her down after she's respawned in an otherwise cleared-out level, consider reading any previously discarded [[scroll of noise|scrolls of noise]] or even deliberately setting off an [[alarm trap]] to help draw her out.\n**If you hear an \"angry hissing noise\", then she's within earshot and will be coming your way momentarily.\n\n==Trivia==\nAlthough never explicitly stated, the (now removed) [[unrand]] [[dagger]] [[Morg]] once belonged to a \"powerful mage called [[Boris]]\" who \"got lost in the Dungeon while seeking the Orb.\" Given Natasha's flavour text, this strongly suggests that Natasha was once the unique [[lich]] Boris' familiar, making the pair into one of ''Crawl'''s [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_and_Bullwinkle_Show sneakier pop culture references.]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], [[Call Imp]] created either [[crimson imp]]s, [[white imp]]s, [[shadow imp]]s, or [[iron imp]]s. They were replaced by the spear wielding [[cerulean imp]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Natasha became weaker upon revival.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Natasha knew [[Mephitic Cloud]].\n*Natasha was added in [[0.14]]."}

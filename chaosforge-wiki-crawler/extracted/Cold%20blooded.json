They have a 50% chance of being [[slow]]ed when they are damaged by any of the following cold sources:\n*[[Freezing]]-[[brand]]ed melee attacks\n*[[Freeze]]\n*standing next to walls that have been affected by [[Frozen Ramparts]]\n*[[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]]\n*[[Freezing Cloud]]\n\nThey are also more strongly affected by [[Metabolic Englaciation]], remaining slowed for twice as long.\n\nNotably, [[Hydra]]s are cold-blooded monsters. As a melee character, if you don't have a slicing flaming weapon to deal with them, another good strategy is using a non-slicing cold weapon to slow them. Other early game examples include [[list of reptiles and amphibians|the various snakes, lizards, and frogs]].\n\nThe [[list of draconians|draconians]] that populate the Realm of [[Zot]] are also cold-blooded. This can mean that the [[freezing]] brand is sometimes preferable to the [[flaming]] brand in the late game. This also includes player [[draconian]]s -- until you find a source of [[cold resistance]] (or develop white scales), you will be equally susceptible to cold.\n\nFor a full list of cold-blooded monsters, see [[:Category:Cold-blooded]].\n\n[[Category:Cold-blooded]]"}

{"title":"Twister","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Twister","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{list of | vortices}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Twisters''' generally only occur as the temporary result of running afoul of a [[Zot trap]], though some can be found outside the walls of the [[Cloud Mages' Chambers]]. They are permanently confused creatures which cannot attack but generate a [[Polar Vortex]] around themselves at all times, which can do significant amounts of damage to anything caught in it.\n\nTwisters are immune to Polar Vortices.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Twisters have insane amounts of health and are resistant to all forms of magic. On top of that, they're worth no experience. Just keep your distance from them and they'll eventually go away.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Twisters were resistant to and caused a [[Tornado]] instead of [[Polar Vortex]].\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Twisters could be summoned by powerful [[Air magic]] [[miscast effects]].\n*Prior to [[0.22]], Twisters had wind resistance instead of tornado resistance."}

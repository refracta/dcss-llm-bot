{"title":"Haunt","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Haunt","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Haunt''' is a level 7 [[Necromancy]]/[[Summonings|Summoning]] spell, which uses [[smite-targeting]] to summon high level phantasms near an enemy.\n\n==Effect==\nBetween 2 to 6 wraith-type monsters are summoned around the target. Unlike other summoning spells, Haunt cannot be cast without a valid hostile target. Possible summons include:<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|spl-summoning.cc|1841}}</ref>\n:{{monsterlink|Wraith}} (50% chance)\n:{{monsterlink|Freezing wraith}} (20% chance)\n:{{monsterlink|Phantasmal warrior}} (20% chance)\n:{{monsterlink|Shadow wraith}} (10% chance)\n\nThe summons will only attack the target selected by the caster, ignoring player commands. When the haunt target dies, the remaining monsters will expire within a few turns, regardless of how much duration was otherwise remaining (though they will be free to attack other targets during this short window).\n\nHigher [[spell power]] may increase the number of summons.\n\nUnless the target dies, the summons have duration of around 27 turns. This does not depend on the spell power.\n\nThere is a summon limit of 8; additional summons will cause the oldest to very quickly time out.\n\n==Strategy==\nFor a character relying on Necromancy, Haunt is one way to kill enemies. This spell can kill monsters up to [[orbs of fire]], even if it takes multiple casts to do so. With Necromancy, killing just a few monsters can lead to an army, due to the snowball effect from spells like [[Death Channel]] and [[Infestation]]. This spell can also be useful to non-Necromancers, as its summons can be quite useful.\n\nThe monsters summoned by Haunt tend to lack high damage output, though Haunt often creates a lot of monsters. In addition, these monsters can [[slow]] enemies. More importantly, ''nothing in the game can resist this slow''. This makes Haunt a good way to weaken (and ultimately deal with) nasty enemies.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Since the monsters spawn around a target, this spell is a good way to block their line of fire.\n\n==Monster Version==\nMonster version of the spell is almost identical to the player version. Number of summons is 2 to 3, and does not depend on the spell power.<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|mon-cast.cc|4300}}</ref>\n\n[[Summonings#Duration|Duration class]] of the summons ranges from 2 (around 18 turns) to 6 (around 171 turns), based on the strength of the caster.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], this spell did not have a summon cap.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], this spell could summon [[hungry ghost]]s and [[phantom]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.17]] this spell inflicted [[sickness]] upon the caster.\n*Prior to [[0.13]] this spell could summon [[flayed ghost]]s, the ghosts summoned by haunt could attack other targets, and it could be cast on friendly targets.\n*Prior to [[0.8]] the duration of summons created was longer.\n*Prior to [[0.7]] the spell level was 6.\n*Haunt was added in [[0.6]].\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

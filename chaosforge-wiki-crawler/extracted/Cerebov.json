{"title":"Cerebov","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cerebov","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Cerebov''' is a mighty [[demon]] lord of [[Pandemonium]] who guards the [[fiery]] [[rune]] and wields the [[Sword of Cerebov]]. With the second highest HP in the game (behind [[Antaeus]]) and very powerful [[Fire Magic]], they are a very dangerous foe. Cerebov is found on a unique Pandemonium floor crawling with [[balrug]]s, [[efreet]], [[orange demon]]s, and the occasional [[brimstone fiend]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Like with other pan/hell lords, it is recommended to clear any nearby monsters before engaging Cerebov. Getting hit by multiple [[smite]]s or [[torment]]s in a single turn can make an already dangerous fight suicidal. If you ''do'' encounter Cerebov with such a posse, strongly consider teleporting away and regrouping. \n:Worshipers of [[the Shining One]] may not mind some popcorn enemies around, though, as they can provide some minor healing mid-fight.\n*Cerebov is arguably ''the'' toughest foe in the game. High defenses (rF+++, HP, AC, etc.) and buffs ([[haste]], [[might]], [[brilliance]]) are recommended if you don't intend to steal the rune. For melee fighters, [[holy wrath]] and [[antimagic]] work well. Casters will want to use spells that aren't resisted, such as [[Orb of Destruction]] or [[Chain Lightning]].\n*Remember that killing Cerebov isn't required to grab the rune. When attempting to steal the rune, [[Haste]] and [[Passage of Golubria]] are very helpful. Keep the demon lord just outside [[LOS]], to prevent being hit by Fire Storms. Be prepared for brimstone fiends, who often guard the rune chamber itself. Also, know that Cerebov will return to its fortress if it loses track of you. \n**Like with other unique pan lords, if you steal the rune, you might encounter Cerebov on other Pandemonium floors and during the [[orb run]].\n*Surprisingly, this pan lord does not [[fly]]. Cerebov is unable to get past lava, and can even be flung into it with [[Polar Vortex]]. Polar Vortex won't always drop a monster into lava, so be prepared for a melee fight when using this spell.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Cerebov had [[Summon Greater Demon]] instead of [[Fire Summon]]."}

{"title":"Minotaur","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Minotaur","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{for monster}}\n{{flavour|The Minotaurs are a species of hybrids, posessing human bodies with bovine heads. They delve into the Dungeon because of their instinctive love of twisting passageways.\n\nMinotaurs are extremely good at all forms of physical combat, but are awful at using any type of magic. They can wear all armour except for some headgear. When in close combat, Minotaurs are able to reflexively headbutt those who dare attack them.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n* '''[[Horns]] 2''': Minotaurs get a secondary melee attack from their horns, but cannot wear [[helmet]]s.\n* Minotaurs instinctively counterattack foes in melee with a [[auxiliary attack|headbutt]] with an <code>[[XL]] + 22.5</code>% chance. This equates to roughly 25% at XL2 and 50% at XL27.\n\nMinotaurs have a base [[Strength]] of 12, [[Intelligence]] of 5 and [[Dexterity]] of 5 (before Background modifiers). They have -1 to their base [[magic points]].\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Warriors:''' [[Fighter]], [[Gladiator]], [[Monk]], [[Hunter]]\n*'''Zealots:''' [[Berserker]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n* +1 [[strength]] or [[dexterity]] (equal chance) every 4th level.\n* 10% more [[HP]] than average.\n* +3 [[willpower]] per level.\n\n==Starting Skills and Equipment ==\nMinotaurs start with the skills and equipment listed for their background, with these exceptions:\n* Any [[helmet]] is replaced with a [[hat]].\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Beginner}}\n\nMinotaurs are incredible at physical (melee & ranged) combat. They have a wide assortment of strengths: their actual strength, skill aptitudes, their HP, and automatic Horn attacks. Combined, they make the Minotaur one of the strongest and most durable species in the game, without the armour restrictions or skill deficiencies of a [[Troll]] or [[Oni]]. \n\nThe Minotaur playstyle fits right at home with [[Trog]] or [[Okawaru]] as their [[god]], simple but strong god choices. However, they are by no means limited to just those two. Picking any of their recommended backgrounds will make use of all of the Minotaur's strengths.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Minotaur}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], retaliation headbutt attacks occurred when passing <code>5 * [[STR]] + 7 * [[DEX]] > 1d(600)</code> (as opposed to the current, XL-based check).\n*Prior to [[0.17]], headbutt auxiliary attacks would apply a small stun.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], Minotaurs had slightly different aptitudes.\n{{species}}"}

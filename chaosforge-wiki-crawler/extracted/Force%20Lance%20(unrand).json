While a branded [[demon trident]] will deal more damage per turn, this artefact can knock enemies back, and can be found much earlier than a demon trident.\n\nKnocking enemies into a wall, impassible terrain (like [[deep water]] or [[lava]]), or another enemy will cause some extra damage.\n\nThis artefact is more likely to spawn in the early game, where it is more likely to be useful.\n\n==History==\n*The Force Lance unrand was added in [[0.30]], named after the spell of the [[Force Lance (spell)|same name]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Polearms]]"}

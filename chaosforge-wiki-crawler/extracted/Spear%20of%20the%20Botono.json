{"title":"Spear of the Botono","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spear_of_the_Botono","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|A dark and malign artefact. It increases the potency of hexes cast by anyone unwise enough to risk wielding it.}}\n[[File:Spear_of_the_botono.png]] '''''the +6 spear of the Botono'''''<br>\n\n+6 [[spear]]\n\n[[Reaping]] brand<br>\nrPois<br>\nrN+<br>\n-6 [[HP]]<br>\nEnhances [[Hexes]]\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''spear of the Botono''' is a good weapon for the early- and mid-game, but sadly a spear will be outclassed later on, even one as good as this. That being said, using it as an unorthodox [[magical staff]] for your Hexes is not a bad idea, and the reaping brand is nice for generating an army of [[zombie]] meat shields (though [[Animate Dead]] works fine for that purpose regardless of your weapon). Just don't expect to do ''that'' much damage if you use this for [[stabbing]]; [[polearms]] don't get a very big bonus for that purpose.\n\n==History==\nThe Spear of Botono was removed in [[0.16]].\n\nPrior to [[0.15]], this weapon had a +2,+10 enchantment level.\n\nPrior to [[0.12]], it did not enhance Hexes, made [[noise]] while equipped, and only reduced your HP by 3.\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Polearms]]\n[[Category:Obsolete items]]"}

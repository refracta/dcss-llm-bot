Swinging the fan unleashes a powerful blast of wind around the bearer. Once activated, this device and all other devices of its kind will be rendered temporarily inert. However they will recharge as you gain experience.}}\n\nA '''fan of gales''' is an evocable item which calls forth a [[wind blast]].\n\nUsing this item depletes it, rendering it inert, but it will recharge each time you gain sufficient [[experience]] while it is in your possession.\n\nCarrying multiple fans is no more useful than carrying one, since evoking one causes all fans, both carried and stashed, to become temporarily inert.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe wind blast is very useful for pushing back enemies that have gotten too close.\n\n==History==\n*Fans of gales were removed in [[0.25]]. A similar knock back effect was added to the [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] spell instead.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], using this item would summon up to three allied [[air elemental]]s. \n*Prior to [[0.14]], all [[Evocable items#elementalevokers|elemental evokers]] recharged simultaneously.\n*In [[0.13]] this item replaced the [[air elemental fan]]."}

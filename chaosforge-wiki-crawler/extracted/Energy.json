It always returns the magic spent on miscasts.}}\n\nThe '''Energy''' [[ego]] occasionally [[channel|refunds MP]] when casting spells. It can only be found on [[orb]]s.\n\nWhen successfully casting a spell, this ego gives a 20% chance to have the full MP cost refunded. When you [[miscast]] a spell, you will always have MP refunded. However, it increases your ''raw'' [[spell failure]] chance by +10%, added. (For reference, the first stack of [[wizardry]] reduces raw spell failure by x75%.)\n\nNote that this does not mean that your spell failure actually increases by +10%, as its modified by a function. See the [[Spell Success#Final Step|Spell Success]] page for details. For example:\n*If you have a spell with 6% failure, an orb of energy increases it to 17% actual failure.\n*If you have a spell with 2% failure, an orb of energy increases it to 8% actual failure.\n*For spells with 1% failure, it varies. A 1% failure might increase to 2% or 9% actual failure, depending on how much skill you have.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Crystal ball of Wucad Mu]] - an [[unrand]] orb with an improved version of this ego.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], channeling was different, You had a <code>2 * Evocations / 108</code> chance to regain MP on any cast. Each time this happens, the channel could \"backfire\" - you have a <code>1 / (Evocations - MP cost)</code> chance of either being confused for <code>1 + 1d4</code> turns or losing 1-5 [[intelligence]]. It did not increase failure rate.\n*This ego was introduced, along with orbs, in [[0.28]].\n\n{{orb}}"}

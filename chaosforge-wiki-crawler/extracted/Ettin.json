{"title":"Ettin","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ettin","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | giants}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ettins''' are massive, two-headed humanoids, around the threat level of [[stone giant]]s. They usually dual-wield [[dire flail]]s or [[great mace]]s, allowing them to deal massive damage in melee. They can be found in the deepest portions of [[the Dungeon]], the [[Orcish Mines]], [[the Vaults]], and [[the Depths]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Ettins are not complicated opponents; they move into melee range and crush you as best they can. All they have going for them is brute melee strength. So long as you don't engage them in melee, you'll be fine. Even melee characters can win fights against them, but it might require spending some consumables.\n**They have low [[willpower]], so all sorts of [[Hexes]] and [[Evocations]] are good against them. [[Tukima's Dance]] works especially well; it takes away their weapon, which lowers their max damage considerably.\n**They aren't resistant to poison. [[Curare]] darts allow you to outrun ettins, allowing you to fight or make a quick escape.\n*Still, you should always respect ettins as threats - they can deal more than 100 damage per turn, depending on their weapons. An ettin camping the entrance to the [[Orcish Mines]] is a reason to ignore that branch for an extended period of time.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], ettins dealt 45 base damage per hit. However, all monsters had hidden weapon penalties - they attacked slower with weapons."}

If you were looking for the [[monster intelligence]] category, see [[:Category:Brainless intelligence]].''\n\nWhen one of a character's primary [[attributes]] ([[strength]], [[intelligence]], or [[dexterity]]) is lowered to 0 or below, the character suffers crippling penalties until that attribute is restored and stays above 0 for a period of time equal to: <code>10 + 1d10 + the number of turns it was below 0</code> (Max: 200 turns).\n\n==Effects==\nThe following effects occur when any stat reaches 0:\n\n*You immediately suffer 2-4 turns of [[paralysis]], which ignores a [[Formicid]]'s [[stasis]].\n*You are [[slow]]ed until the stat completely recovers.\n\nThe following effects are dependent on the specific stat which was drained to 0:\n\n===Collapse (Strength)===\n*You do not regenerate [[HP]] when monsters are in sight.\n\n===Brainless (Intelligence)===\n*You can't memorise or cast [[spell]]s.\n*You fail to read [[scroll]]s.\n\n===Clumsy (Dexterity)===\n*Your [[EV]] score is set to <code>2 + size_bonus + [[Repulsion field]] bonus</code>.\n*Your [[SH]] score is set to 0.\n*Your [[stealth]] score is set to 0.\n*You can't [[stab]] monsters.\n\n==Causes==\nThe following sources of '''stat drain''' can all temporarily lower your attributes ([[Str]], [[Int]], [[Dex]]):\n\n'''By 1 at a time:'''\n*The [[bad mutations#Deterioration|Deterioration]] mutation.\n*The melee attacks of certain monsters:\n**{{monsterlink|Quasit}} (dexterity only)\n**{{monsterlink|Ghost moth}}\n**{{monsterlink|Eidolon}}\n*Decomposition from attempted [[mutation]] of an undead character.\n\n'''By more than 1 at a time:'''\n*[[Corrupting Pulse]] can give transient (temporary) mutations, which can include [[Bad_mutations#Reduced_Attributes|Reduced Attributes]] (-2 stat).\n**{{monsterlink|Wretched star}}\n*[[Brain Feed]]: Drains 1-3 intelligence in one go.\n**{{monsterlink|Orange crystal statue}}\n*[[Hell's mystical force]] can drain up to 5 stat points when you descend down a stair, and can also give transient mutations.\n*Mummy [[death curse]]s drain from 1-4 of a random stat.\n*Quaffing a [[potion of degeneration]] drains 1-3 of each stat.\n*[[Throw Klown Pie]] can drain 1-3 of each stat.\n**{{monsterlink|Killer Klown}}\n*Stepping on or being in view of a monster stepping on [[Zot trap]]s, which could drain 1-5 stat points.\n\nAs you gain experience, you regain stats lost through temporary drain or mutation.\n\nStats can be more permanently lowered by the following means:\n*[[Mutations]] (such as from [[Malmutate]]) which affect attributes. This lasts until the mutation is removed [[potion of mutation|somehow]].\n*Equipment with negative stat modifiers. But, you can remove the equipment to restore the stat.\n\n==Precautions==\nAny character with a particularly low attribute should be aware of the dangers involved. Any attribute below 6 could conceivably be reduced to 0 by a single unfortunate effect, and below 11 are vulnerable to stat zero from repeated effects.\n\nSpecifically, [[Hell]] effects can reduce an attribute by up to 5 in a single go, while [[Zot trap]]s, and [[mummy]] [[death curse]]s reduce up to 4. You may wish to bring all of your attributes up to a minimum of 9 to guarantee that you can survive two worst-case scenario effects from the latter. All three happen reasonably late in the game, so early level ups should not take stat zero into account (unless you find a great stat-reducing artefact).\n\nOutside of the extended game, stat zero only realistically happens to the extreme end of combinations, such as a [[Minotaur]] [[Berserker]] or [[Deep Elf]] [[Conjurer]]. A [[human]], for example, is normally much less vulnerable to its effects.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], zero intelligence only had an 80% chance to fail reading scrolls. Zero strength's -Regen was a flat regen/4 modifier.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], [[sustain attributes]] existed which would halve stat damage. Hence, multi-point stat damage was roughly halved in [[0.19]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], taking further stat damage after a stat reached 0 would inflict HP damage.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], items had [[aum|mass]], and strength determined your carrying capacity. Collapse seriously reduced this.\n*Stat zero was added in [[0.13]], replacing [[stat death]].\n\n[[Category:Stats]]\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

Its first wielder was a worshipper of Yredelemnul who eschewed the use of magic in combat, preferring to destroy her enemies with brute force.

While any [[Long Blades]] specialist can appreciate a +13 great sword with +40 [[magic resistance]], the inability to cast spells is annoying at best and deadly at worst. Swapping weapons every time you need to cast a spell isn't a huge amount of wasted time, but it can make a big difference in critical situations. Also, to get any use at all out of the weapon's pain brand, you'll need to invest heavily in [[Necromancy]]. Once there, however, it is an exceptionally powerful weapon against most living foes... but by the time you've trained Long Blades and Necromancy sufficiently, you might be running out of those. This weapon's minimum attack delay of 0.7 is reached at skill level 18! Don't be afraid to use this weapon, but don't be surprised if you find a nicely enchanted [[triple sword]] more appealing. \n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|the sword of the Doom Knight will return. Instead of the Pain brand, it will have a unique Doom brand that inflicts additional damage proportional to its victim's maximum health.}}\n*In [[0.19]], this great sword was removed.\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Long blades]]"}

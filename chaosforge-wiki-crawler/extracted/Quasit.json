{"title":"Quasit","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Quasit","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Quasits''' are fast and annoying [[tier-5 demon]]s whose attacks drain your [[dexterity]]. They've got high [[ev]]asion and a wide variety of resistances, making it difficult for low-level characters to defeat them without taking some stat damage. They are one of the few [[demon]]s you can encounter naturally in the upper floors of the [[Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While their Dexterity-draining attacks can be annoying, they are very rarely dangerous. You'll just be a little worse at [[EV|dodging]] and [[stealth]] for a while.\n*[[Searing Ray]] and [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] ignore resistances, so they're perfect for the quasit, and even [[Magic Dart]] is an option if you don't mind taking a while killing them. [[Earth Magic]] like [[Stone Arrow]] or [[Sandblast]] can also work. If you only have [[fire]] or [[cold]] damage at your disposal, use the biggest spells you've got; their resistances aren't insurmountable.\n*Quasits have low [[willpower]], which makes them good targets for [[Hexes]] or wands of [[wand of paralysis|paralysis]] and [[wand of disintegration|disintegration]].\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

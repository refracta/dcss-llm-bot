It is a one handed weapon, and it is better for the strong.}}\n\nA '''spiked flail''' is the best common one-handed mace.  It requires a skill of 18 to reach min delay though; you can get better damage with the same delay at 14 skill if you use a [[dire flail]], although that is two-handed.  Don't enchant one of these, since [[demon whip]]s are common later on.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Spiked flail\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Spiked flail1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Spiked flail2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Spiked flail 3.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\nSpiked flails were removed in [[0.12]]\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]][[Category:Obsolete]][[Category:Obsolete items]]"}

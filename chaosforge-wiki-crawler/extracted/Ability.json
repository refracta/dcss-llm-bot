{"title":"Ability","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ability","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n''For unique monster abilities, see [[Special ability]]''\n\nAn '''ability''' is a power that a player character may have, and may choose to use at any time. Abilities can be unleashed by pressing the '''[[a]]''' key.\n\nAbilities can be:\n*Natural abilities, such as a [[Naga]]'s [[Spit Poison]] ability\n*Powers given by [[mutation]]s, such as [[Demonspawn]]'s [[Hurl Damnation (mutation)|Hurl Damnation]]\n*Powers given by an [[item]], such as an [[artefact]]'s +[[Blink]].\n*Powers given by a [[god]], such as [[Elyvilon]]'s Heal Self.\n\nAbilities have both a cost and a chance of success. They may also depend on the player's state; eg. vampires cannot transform into [[Bat Form]] while full of blood. Abilities based on sound or speech are stopped by [[silence]].\n\n==Ability Costs==\nUnlike spells, which almost always only cost [[MP]], abilities can have multiple costs. These include:\n*[[HP]]\n*[[MP]] \n*Permanent MP ([[Deep Dwarf#Innate Abilities|Deep Dwarf's Heal Wounds]])\n*[[Piety]]\n*Cooldown ([[Exhaustion]], [[Breath]], -[[Barachim|Hop]]...)\n*[[Delay]]\n*[[Drain]]\n*[[Pain]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], many abilities were regulated with a [[food]] cost.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], ability scores were capped at 72, now at 125.\n\n[[Category:Abilities]]"}

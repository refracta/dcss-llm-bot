They often [[blink]] closer to you to engage in melee as rapidly as possible. They are occasionally found in [[the Depths]], [[the Vaults]], and [[the Crypt]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n* They hit hard, but by the time you encounter them in the Depths, you should be able to easily vanquish anything with low hit points.\n* Be especially careful facing them if you're around anything that checks [[willpower]], such as [[vampire knight]]s.\n* You can summon your own phantasmal warriors with the [[Haunt]] spell.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.17]], phantasmal warriors' attacks \"pierced\" through shields and armour, ignoring [[SH]] and only being subject to half of your [[AC]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], phantasmal warriors were fairly ordinary melee opponents with [[draining]]-branded attacks.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], they were called spectral warriors."}

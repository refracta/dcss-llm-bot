You may prefer a resistance, but since shield [[ego]]s are rare, a shield of protection can be your best option.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], weapons of protection provided a passive bonus (+5 AC) instead of a temporary +7 AC on hit.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], ranged weapons would generate with the protection brand instead of [[Evasion (brand)|evasion]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{brands}}\n\n[[Category:Brands]]\n[[Category:Egos]]"}

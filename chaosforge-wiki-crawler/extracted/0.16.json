They can now (very occasionally) appear on the [orb run][52].\n* New monsters: \n  * [Robin][53] of the Strong Arm, appearing in the early Dungeon. An unusually strong hobgoblin, with a personal army of hobgoblins and goblins. She happily hurls the latter at her enemies.\n  * [Caustic shrikes][54], appearing in Depths. Metallic birds that travel in flocks, attacking with acid-dripping claws that sear through armour &amp; flesh alike.\n  * [Shard shrikes][55], appearing in Cocytus. Batty monsters that come in flocks and spit deadly ice shards at their foes.\n  * [Elemental wellsprings][56], appearing in Cocytus.

Attacks with draining and holy; when killed, explodes into ghostly flame and instantly returns to life (once).\n  * [Ushabti][58], funerary statues, appearing in Tomb. They exhale long lines of draining clouds, and rumble deeply to alert far-away foes.\n  * [Anubis guards][59], living fanatics appearing in Tomb. They're conditioned to be immune to torment, and breathe draining, dispel undead, and howl to alert other guards.\n  * [Death scarabs][60], swarming insects appearing in Tomb.

Extremely effective against agile, low-AC enemies, but ineffective against armoured enemies or at a distance.\n  * The [Akashic Record][110], a new high-level Translocations book.\n  * [Potions of ambrosia][111], which give substantial health &amp; magic regeneration for a short period, but also confuse the user; if the confusion ends, so does regeneration.\n* [Regeneration][112] has been moved from rings to amulets.\n* Corrosion [resistance][113] can now occur on artefact armour.\n* [Artefact][114] generation has been generally reworked.\n* [Scale mail][115] now only has 10 ER, down from 11.\n* [Unrand][116] changes: \n  * The Ring of Vitality is now the [Amulet of Vitality][117].\n  * The [captain's cutlass][118] is now +5 (was +10) and can disarm enemies.\n  * The [Hat of the Alchemist][119] is now -2 (rElec rPois rF rC rN MR rMut rCorr).\n  * [Maxwell's Patent Armour][120] now gives rCorr rElec instead of rF+ rC+.\n  * The arbalest [Hellfire][121] has had its explosion damage roughly doubled.\n  * The [dark maul][122] has had both its base damage &amp; enchantment increased.\n* All [food][123] other than rations, chunks, and royal jellies now takes one turn to eat.\n* [Potions of blood][124] no longer give nutrition for non-vampires.\n* All [short blades][125] now do piercing damage.\n* Weapons other than short blades &amp; felid claws are all now equally good at [stabbing][126].\n* Light [armour][127] now has a small [spellcast success][128] penalty.\n* [Elemental evocables][129] now charge &amp; discharge on a type-by-type basis, rather than individually for each item.\n* The [Box of Beasts][130] and [Rod of Shadows][131] are now considerably stronger.\n* The [lantern of shadows][132] now drains MP while in use, and ceases to function once its wielder runs dry.\n* [Steel][133] ammo no longer has a decreased mulch rate.\n* [Large rocks][134] no longer have randomized range.\n* Renamed items: \n  * Cutlasses are now [rapiers][135].\n  * Bastard swords are now [double swords][136].\n  * Claymores are now [triple swords][137].\n  * Cloaks of darkness are now cloaks of [invisibility][138].\n* Removed items: \n  * Boots of [jumping][139].\n  * [Potions of confusion][140], [porridge][141] and [coagulated blood][142].\n  * [Blessed Blades][143].\n  * [Rods of Striking][144].\n  * [Tomes of Destruction][145].\n  * The [book of Wizardry][146].\n  * The [Spear of the Botono][147].\n  * The [blowgun of the Assassin][148].\n## Cards \n\n* All characters can now evoke [decks][149] from the inventory.\n* If one's [god][150] would disapprove of a card's effects, they will block the blasphemous effects in question as it is drawn.\n* New [cards][151]. \n  * [Elements][152], which summons three beasts of the four elements.\n  * [Rangers][153], which summons two or three ranged-missile users.\n  * [Placid Magic][154], which removes all status effects and applies heavy antimagic to all creatures in sight, including the user.\n  * [Water][155], which creates temporary pools of shallow water &amp; summoned elemental allies.\n* Revamped [destruction][156] cards: \n  * [Storm][157] has replaced rain and swiftness with summoning air elementals, or thunder clouds alongside a wind blast.\n  * [Pain][158] has lost Torment and can now summon a flayed ghost to instantly apply its flaying effect to living targets.\n  * [Venom][159] has lost Sting for earlier Venom Bolts and Poison Arrows, but at low power will briefly make the user vulnerable to poison.\n  * [Degeneration][160] now applies a temporary malmutated effect to targets, along with polymorphing them to creatures with lower HD.

(The old 'stealth words') are still visible with @.)\n* A third page has been added to the [god][150] description (^) screen, listing causes and effects of divine wrath.\n* [Xom][202] now has a 'mood' meter, in the same place other gods have piety meters.\n* Control-direction no longer tries to open or close [doors][203].\n* [Derived undead][204] (zombies, skeletons, &amp;c) now have their full names displayed.\n* [Corrosion][205] now visibly (temporarily) reduces weapons' enhancement bonuses.\n* Monsters no longer appear on the minimap.\n* The [weapon][206], [species][207], and [background][26] options allow these aspects to be specified in the init file, causing one to be randomly selected; a new combo option allows entire sets of the above to be specified, again with one being randomly selected.\n* Added [explore mode][208], which is a limited version of wizard mode, where the only benefit gained is the inability to die. No extra information is displayed (like in wizard mode), and no extra commands are available. As with wizard mode, explore mode games are not scored. Enter explore mode using '+'.\n* &nbsp;?/ has been generally improved, and a new&nbsp;?/c(L)oud lookup has been added.\n## 0.16.1 \n\nFirst point release for 0.16. It was released on March 22th, 2015. \n\n* Major bugfix release. Because of the first two bugfixes listed below, it's strongly recommended that all 0.16.0 users upgrade to this version.\n* Fix a bug where all player [melee][209] damage was effectively doubled. This only affected player melee damage, not player ranged or spells, or monster damage at all.\n* Fix a bug in [sprint][210] where [controlled blink][211] was blocked as if from the stasis effect.\n* [Artefacts][114] with the Contam property are no longer marked as chaotic and hence hated by [Zin][193], since Zin wouldn't give penance for using e.g. weapons with this property anyhow. There's now a warning under Zin when Contam items are removed, since this does incur penance.\n* Monsters no longer avoid walking on [shadow traps][212].\n* Fix the build for the Android port of DCSS.\n* Other minor bugfixes.\n## 0.16.2 \n\nSecond point release for 0.16. It was released on August 11th, 2015. \n\n* Give [Fe][31][EE][213] players stones at game start.\n* Display base [|attributes][214] in the '@' display.\n* No longer revoke [Zin][193]'s sanctuary when a confused ally attacks you, and allow confused allies in your sanctuary to get away with attacking hostiles.\n* Ranged and confused player attacks as well as the Tornado, Static Discharge, and Singularity spells now all break sanctuary.\n* Fix a bug where players who lose the [big wings mutation][215] while flying with no other source of flight would continue to fly. They now stop flying and get an emergency flight evocation if wearing a ring of flight.\n* Fix a bug where a player with the confused status could cancel accidental attacks when wielding a weapon [inscribed][216] with \"!a\".\n* Fix a bug where monsters with [phase shift][217] got 8 more EV than intended.\n* Fix a bug where players could take a [shaft][218] and land in inescapable areas.\n* Have [Dithmenos][191]' spell-shadowing attack use the same targeting as the player attack that triggered it to avoid it doing things like hitting allies.\n* Fix a mouse bug in the Tiles version where Ctrl and Alt modifiers would be set when clicking despite those keys not being pressed.\n* Fix the Tiles version failing to run on OS X.\n* In the Objstat debug mode for counting items and monsters, the output format has been streamlined to generate one file per table with data from all levels in each table.\n* Fix a bug in Objstat where items in shops weren't counted.\n* Other minor bugfixes, and cleanups to in-game descriptions and help text.\n\n\n[0]: /Crawl\n[1]: /List_of_Stone_Soup_versions\n[2]: #Highlights\n[3]: #Branches.2C_environment\n[4]: #Character\n[5]: #Monsters\n[6]:

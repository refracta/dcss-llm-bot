{"title":"Naga (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Naga_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version017}}\n''This page is about the various naga [[monster]]s. For the player race, see [[naga]]. For different nagas, see [[List of nagas]].''\n{{monster info|naga}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Nagas''' are a race of cruel snakemen who dwell in the [[Snake Pit]], usually travelling in packs. They move slowly and wear little armour, but carry heavy weapons and can spit [[poison]] at you. When in melee, they also tend to [[constrict]] you, dealing surprising amounts of damage.\n\n{{monster spells|naga}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*All nagas pack powerful poisonous attacks, making [[poison resistance]] tremendously useful. They also deal significant amounts of physical damage (even the mages), so heavy armour and high [[AC]] helps too. \n*Although nagas will eventually charge you in melee, they will happily spit poison at you repeatedly on the way. Expect to take damage at any range.\n*Basic nagas are far less threatening than their specialized brethren. Focus your attention on bigger threats first.\n\n[[Category:Naga]]"}

{"title":"The Dungeon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/The_Dungeon","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|It is still a mystery how this bizarre place was created. Some claim that it is the playground of bored gods, whereas others maintain that it was shaped by all kinds of species who fled the overworld and shunned the light. No matter what its origin, this deep cavern is filled with riches unheard of as well as with ample dangers to any intruder. Few have escaped alive, and even fewer have kept some sliver of sanity sufficient to tell the tale.\n\nThe dungeon is 15 levels deep, but, honestly, this is only the beginning.}}\n[[File:Dungeon exit.png]]'''The Dungeon''' is the main setting of ''Dungeon Crawl''. The first area you arrive in upon creating a new character, it is 15 floors deep, not counting its many [[branches]]. The final floor contains an entrance to [[the Depths]], where [[portal]]s to more dangerous branches are found, including [[the Realm of Zot]].\n\n==Layout==\nThe Dungeon consists of 15 randomly generated floors filled with rooms, corridors, [[door]]s, and [[vault]]s. Most [[wall]]s are made of rock, but sometimes from other materials such as stone, metal, or green crystal. You can travel between floors using [[stairs]] and (not always intentionally) [[shaft]]s.\n\nLike most areas in the game, each floor has three stairs leading up and three stairs leading down; sometimes you'll also encounter [[Escape_hatch|hatches]], which are one-way staircases. Save those for emergencies, and never use them to enter a new floor if you can take the stairs, as you will be unable to flee back up them if you encounter trouble right away.\n\nGoing upstairs on Dungeon:1 will return you to the overworld and end the game, whether you have the [[Orb of Zot]] or not. Although your character did not die, they have retired all the same, and you will have to create another.\n\nUnlike certain other roguelikes, floors in ''Crawl'' are permanent, once generated. They do not change if you leave, then return.\n\n==Uniques==\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Agnes}}\n| {{monsterlink|Amaemon}}\n| {{monsterlink|Azrael}}\n| {{monsterlink|Blork the orc}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Crazy Yiuf}}\n| {{monsterlink|Dowan}}\n| {{monsterlink|Duvessa}}\n| {{monsterlink|Edmund}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Erica}}\n| {{monsterlink|Erolcha}}\n| {{monsterlink|Eustachio}}\n| {{monsterlink|Fannar}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Frances}}\n| {{monsterlink|Gastronok}}\n| {{monsterlink|Grinder}}\n| {{monsterlink|Grum}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Harold}}\n| {{monsterlink|Ijyb}}\n| {{monsterlink|Jessica}}\n| {{monsterlink|Jorgrun}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Joseph}}\n| {{monsterlink|Josephine}}\n| {{monsterlink|Kirke}}\n| {{monsterlink|Lodul}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Louise}}\n| {{monsterlink|Maggie}}\n| {{monsterlink|Maurice}}\n| {{monsterlink|Menkaure}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Natasha}}\n| {{monsterlink|Nergalle}}\n| {{monsterlink|Nessos}}\n| {{monsterlink|Pikel}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Prince Ribbit}}\n| {{monsterlink|Psyche}}\n| {{monsterlink|Pargi}}\n| {{monsterlink|Robin}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Roxanne}}\n| {{monsterlink|Rupert}}\n| {{monsterlink|Sigmund}}\n| {{monsterlink|Snorg}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Sonja}}\n| {{monsterlink|Terence}}\n| {{monsterlink|Urug}}\n|}\n\n==Strategy==\nIf you're trying to win each and every game, the first few floors of Dungeon are the hardest part of ''Crawl''. While the monsters may be weaker, you won't have as many [[potion]]s or [[scroll]]s to bail you out of a bad situation. If you meet an [[out-of-depth]] monster, you will have only a few options.\n\n[[The Depths]] are a sudden difficulty spike from D:15 - unless you're looking for a challenge, you shouldn't enter right away. Instead, explore other [[dungeon branches]] first.\n\n===Branch Order===\nThe main Dungeon goes down to 15 floors, where each floor increases in monster strength. If a floor gets too difficult, you can enter a new dungeon branch. You'll need to enter a branch ''eventually'', to get their [[runes of Zot]] (3 of which are required to win the game). \n\nThe recommended branch order can vary based on character, item selection, and player preference. A rough outline is as follows:\n\n#Dungeon: 1-9 or 1-10\n#[[The Lair]]: 1-5\n#Dungeon: 11-12\n#[[Orcish Mines]]: 1-2\n#Dungeon: 13-15\n#Other branches.\n\nFor more detailed branch order advice, check out the [[Walkthrough]].\n\n===Malevolent Force===\nExperienced players may want to skip D:10 until after completing part/all of Lair. This is because, when entering D:10 or any branch of the Dungeon, the chance of [[malevolent force]] increases:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n! Branch !! Malevolent Force %\n|-\n| D:1-9 || 1/9\n|-\n| D:10-15 || 2/9\n|-\n|Lair || 2/9\n|-\n|Orcish Mines || 2/9\n|-\n|Other branches || 2/9 - 4/9<br><small>(Depending on depth)\n|}\n\nWhile D:10-15 and Lair have the same chance of a malevolent force effect, a [[shaft]] in the Dungeon is more dangerous than a shaft in the Lair. First, going from D:10 -> D:13 is a greater difficulty spike, on average, than Lair:1 -> Lair:4. Second, the possible [[out-of-depth]]s are stronger in Dungeon. The ''worst case'' out-of-depth in Dungeon are the likes of [[sphinx]]es and [[storm dragon]]s in a [[vault]], which are much harder than the [[hydra]]s and [[skyshark]]s you'd find in Lair.\n\nThat being said, if you feel that your character isn't strong enough to handle the 'common' enemies in Lair, you'll probably want to do D:10-11 first, even when considering the malevolent force increase. Being able to deal with common enemies is ''much'' more important than the rare chance of a malevolent force happening.\n\nOf course, if Lair spawns on D:10/D:11, you'll have no choice but to enter those floors. Also, if you have already been shafted in the Dungeon, you won't have to worry about being shafted again on D:10/D:11.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], the Dungeon's monster distribution was changed; many \"chaff\" monsters were removed, making floors generally harder.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the Dungeon was 27 floors deep, with the Realm of Zot located on D:27. The Depths were introduced to help better control the amount of [[experience]] a player acquires throughout the game, and to help force the player to explore side-branches earlier in the game.\n\n{{Branches}}\n\n[[Category:Dungeon_Branches]]"}

{"title":"Dragonskin cloak","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dragonskin_cloak","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|An opalescent cloak gleaming with the colours of all kinds of dragons. It imbues the wearer with draconic resistances, although somewhat unreliably.}}\n[[File:New dragonskin.png]] '''''the +4 dragonskin cloak'''''\n\n+4 [[cloak]]\n\nEach time the wearer takes damage from one of the following elements, there is a 50% chance to temporarily receive one rank of resistance against it:\n*[[Fire]]\n*[[Steam]]\n*[[Cold]]\n*[[Electricity]]\n*[[Poison]]\n*[[Acid]]\n*[[Negative energy]]\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''dragonskin cloak'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|1251}}</ref> can only be acquired by killing [[Tiamat]]. It has a great [[enchant]]ment and ''occasionally'' gives you resistance to virtually any element. Against serious elemental threats, don't rely on this cloak as your only resistance; taking multiple unresisted attacks from an [[orb of fire]] stings. Regardless, if you can kill Tiamat, it's a very nice cloak - if only for the AC.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the dragonskin cloak occasionally provided resistance to [[Sticky Flame]] instead of [[acid]].\n*The dragonskin cloak was added in [[0.10]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Cloaks]]"}

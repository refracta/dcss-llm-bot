Although it does not provide its wearer with as much protection as the armour made from the scales of some larger dragons, it is somewhat lighter and less encumbering. It is also remarkably smooth, letting corrosive slime flow off it like water.}}\n'''Acid dragon scales''' are a lightweight armour that provides [[corrosion resistance]].\n\nThis item has a 33% chance to generate when you slay an [[acid dragon]].\n\n==Desirability==\nAn upgrade over plain [[ring mail]]s and [[scale mail]]s, acid dragon scales are very light. They are only 1 encumbrance above [[leather armour]], so even if you have poor strength, they won't hinder you much. Overall, they are a nice choice for early casters and [[EV]]-based characters. They are also useful for [[Troll]]s and [[Oni]] who haven't found anything heavier yet. \n\nYou might want to upgrade to the slightly heavier [[swamp dragon scales]] once you can handle the encumbrance.\n\nCorrosion resistance is useful in the [[Slime Pits]], and against certain enemies like [[entropy weaver]]s. But if you're a heavy melee character, don't wear this armour ''just'' for the resistance. The loss in AC is not worth having rCorr.\n\n==History==\n*Acid dragon scales were introduced in [[0.20]], replacing [[mottled dragon scales]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

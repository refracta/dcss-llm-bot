They are faster than most [[species]] and capable of inflicting lethal amounts of poison damage. Scorpions can be found in the the early-to-mid portions of the [[Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*A beefier [[adder]]. Low-level characters should try to weaken or kill them at range however they can. Remember to use [[potions of curing]] (or other consumables) if you don't think you'll win a fight.\n*Scorpions are vulnerable to poison themselves. Poisoned [[dart]]s, [[Mephitic Cloud]], and [[Poisonous Vapours]] are very effective methods of handling them.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], scorpions dealt 10 damage per hit.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], scorpions had speed 10.

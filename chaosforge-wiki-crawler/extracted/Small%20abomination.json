{"title":"Small abomination","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Small_abomination","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Small abominations''' are mindless, [[demonic]], [[undead]] horrors that stalk [[the Abyss]]. They spawn with [[haste]], [[might]], or [[regeneration]] as a permanent buff. They are much less dangerous than [[large abomination]]s, but can still be pests, especially due to their high speed.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Though these are much weaker than the [[large abomination|big version]], they are faster. This makes running from them in the Abyss a challenge, and you generally don't want to stand and fight there.\n*They can usually be one-shot by [[Dispel Undead]].\n\n==Alternate Tiles==\nBeing haphazard collections of random body parts, small abominations can take multiple forms:\n\n[[Image:Abomination small.png]] [[Image:Abomination small1.png]]  [[Image:Abomination small2.png]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], small abominations had randomized attributes instead of spawning with a permanent buff. Also, they did not regenerate.\n*Prior to [[0.31]], small abominations had randomized speed (7-15). They also gained several new tiles in this version.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], small abominations could heal by fusing with [[crawling corpse]]s and [[macabre mass]]es. Also, monsters could cast [[Twisted Resurrection]], allowing them to create small abominations.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], players could also cast Twisted Resurrection.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], abominations could heal naturally.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], you could read a [[scroll of unholy creation]] to get a permanent friendly abomination."}

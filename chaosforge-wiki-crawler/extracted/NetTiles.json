{"title":"NetTiles","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/NetTiles","type":"raw","data":"'''NetTiles''' is a tile-based interface that allows you to play with on unmodified online servers. It was created by Luca Barbieri. It is outdated; for all intents and purposes, [[WebTiles]] has replaced NetTiles.\n\nNetTiles works by connecting to the servers with libssh, parsing the terminal data with an embedded version of [[PuTTY]] and finally heuristically parsing the screen to produce a tile-based view. It also possible to switch between tile and console view with Ctrl-V.\n\nIt can be used to play 0.6 online and watch other players and ttyrecs with a tile-based interface (it features seamless charset auto-detection). The interface is a limited version of Tiles, which works like the console version, except for a tile-based dungeon view. Tiles specific interfaces like the minimap, inventory pane and tiled menus are not available.\n\nA note is automatically entered into the game to allow compiling usage statistics.\n\n==External links==\n\n* [http://www.mediafire.com/?zmyzge3o2wd Compiled Windows build on Mediafire]\n* [http://repo.or.cz/w/crawl/crawl-nettiles.git Current version Linux and Windows builds]\n\n[[Category:Tiles]]"}

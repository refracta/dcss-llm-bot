Although it had no real combat applications, knowing where all items and secret [[door]]s are is always helpful, as is having the layout of the floor as soon as you arrive on it. The [[trap]] detection proved extremely useful in areas which tend to have plentiful nasty traps, such as the [[Orb]] chamber and [[the Tomb]]. Even with no [[Evocations]] skill, casting it multiple times throughout a floor to map everything wasn't very difficult.\n\n==History==\nThe rod of Discovery was removed in [[0.8]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete]]"}

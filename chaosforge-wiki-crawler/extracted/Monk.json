{"title":"Monk","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Monk","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{flavour|Monks have a head start with the divine. They start with only a simple weapon of their choice, a potion of divine ambrosia, a robe, and an orb of light to guide them. However, when they worship a god for the first time, their spiritual training gives them a piety boost.}}\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Mountain Dwarf]], [[Merfolk]], [[Gargoyle]], [[Troll]], [[Demonspawn]] and [[Armataur]] are the recommended races if you pick a Monk Background.\n\n==Racial Restrictions==\n[[Demigod]]s cannot be Monks, as they refuse to worship a god.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[weapon of choice]] ([[hand axe]], [[spear]], [[short sword]], [[falchion]], [[mace]], or [[unarmed]])\n*+0 [[robe]]\n*[[orb]] of [[light]]\n*[[Potion of ambrosia]]\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n*[[Fighting]]: 3\n*Chosen Weapon's Skill: 3\n*[[Dodging]]: 3\n\nChoosing Monk adds 3 to your starting [[Strength]], 2 to your starting [[Intelligence]] and 7 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Special==\nMonks do not start with a god, but automatically gain ** [[piety]] when they first convert to a god.<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|religion.cc|3472}}</ref> The following gods have special properties with monks:\n*[[Ashenzari]]: Monks are provided the first set of curses much sooner.\n*[[Gozag]]: Monks skip the entry fee.<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|religion.cc|3294}}</ref>\n*[[Ru]]: Monks are immediately given a set of sacrifice options to make upon conversion.\n*[[Uskayaw]]: No effect.\n*[[Xom]]: No effect.\n\nThe Monk bonus ''does'' stack with that of a [[faded altar]].\n\n==Strategy==\nThe main appeal of this background is the piety boost you gain upon choosing a god, especially when worshiping a god who offers bonuses at 1* or 2* of piety, such as [[Okawaru]] or [[Nemelex]]. On the other hand, surviving until you find a suitable god to worship can be more challenging than with better-equipped backgrounds like [[Fighter]] or [[Gladiator]].\n\nThe orb of light will reveal [[invisible]] enemies nearby and increase your [[to-hit]] (i.e. accuracy). However, it also lowers your [[stealth]] and prevents you from going invisible. Note that the orb doesn't increase enemies' accuracy against you, though.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Monks did not start with an [[orb]] of [[light]], but started with 2 [[Stealth]] skill.\n*In [[0.29]], Monks received a [[potion of ambrosia]]; most other backgrounds also gained an extra consumable.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], monks could not choose a starting weapon - instead they always started with unarmed combat.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], there was no piety bonus gained upon choosing a god.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

{"title":"Dispersal","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dispersal","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n:''This page describes the Dispersal [[spell]]. For the ammunition brand, see [[Dispersal (brand)]]. For the trap, see [[dispersal trap]]..''\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Dispersal''' is a level 6 [[Translocations]] spell which attempts to clear away all monsters adjacent to you.\n\n==Useful Info==\nIf the spell manages to beat a monster's [[willpower]], the monster is instantly [[teleport]]ed away. If the spell fails, the monster will [[blink]] away, even if they have infinite willpower.\n\nAny affected monster may get [[confusion|confused]] for <code>1d(power/10)</code> turns<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|spl-transloc.cc|L1428}}</ref> if it fails a separate willpower check.\n\n==Strategy==\nDispersal is useful in crowded situations, where some monsters will be teleported away completely, and the others will at least be sent back some distance. It's especially great against [[guardian serpent]]s and [[draconian shifter]]s, as [[Blink Allies Encircling]] can quickly surround you with enemies.\n\nCompared to [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]], Dispersal is 2 levels higher and isn't also a [[Conjurations]] spell. IMB deals damage, but Dispersal will never fail to at blink monsters away, while IMB can fail based on size. Also, Dispersal has the ability to teleport monsters away. Overall, the 2 level difference is a key drawback, as the Translocations investment is substantial for many character builds.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Disjunction]]\n*[[Dispersal trap]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.12]], there was only a 50% chance that the monster would blink away when the teleport attempt failed.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

Though it has been reanimated by some unknown magic, this magic is not enough to prevent its decaying.

Every now and then they would rot away a few max HP in spite of their rot resistance, though this rarely affected the outcome of a battle. Bog mummies had the same [[death curse]] as regular [[mummy (monster)|mummies]], and were found in [[the Swamp]] and the submerged [[Ossuary]].\n\nSpells: [[Throw Frost]] (3d6), [[Slow]], [[Corpse Rot]]\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Although unlikely to actually kill you, bog mummies are annoying to deal with; they can destroy your [[potion]]s with cold attacks and killing them curses your items. With [[conservation]] and enough summoned or undead minions, you could deal with them without much fuss. Otherwise, it may be best to simply take advantage of their slow speed and run past them to save your [[scrolls of remove curse]].\n*Be careful when killing any [[corpse]]-producing monsters with a bog mummy in sight; their Corpse Rot spell can seriously harm and rot you if you're standing over a corpse at the time.\n\n==History==\nBog mummies were replaced with [[bog bodies]] in [[0.11]].\n\n[[Category:Mummy]]\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

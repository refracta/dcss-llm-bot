{"title":"Cross-train","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cross-train","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n\nAll melee weapon skills '''cross-train''' with at least one other weapon skill. When investing XP into the main skill, any cross-trained skills get a direct bonus equal to 40% of that XP. For example, if you put 10 skill points into Polearms, both Axes and Staves will get 4 skill points each for free.\n\nThe following weapon skills cross-train with each other:\n\n*[[Short Blades]] and [[Long Blades]] cross-train each other.\n*[[Axes]] and [[Staves]] cross-train [[Polearms]] and [[Maces & Flails]].\n*[[Maces & Flails]] and [[Polearms]] cross-train [[Axes]] and [[Staves]].\n(Axes and Staves do ''not'' cross-train each other, but cross-train the other [[strength]] weapons. Think about Maces & Flails and Polearms the same way.)\n\n[[Gnoll]]s do not benefit from cross-training.\n\n==Strategy==\nCross-training allows characters to switch between weapon types more easily, should they come across an attractive weapon. For example, if you trained Axes, but find an amazing [[demon trident]], you'll already have some XP into Polearms due to cross-training. One common example is Short Blades -> Long Blades; a [[quick blade]] is useful, but less so against enemies with high [[AC]].\n\nInvesting XP into a skill directly is more efficient than putting XP into a cross-trained skill with a [[manual]] boost.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], [[Slings (skill)]] crosstrained with [[Throwing]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], cross-training gave an aptitude bonus to the secondary skills, rather than a direct experience bonus.\n\n[[Category:Skills]]\n[[Category:Strategy]]"}

For the skill, see [[Stealth (skill)]]. For the Stealth armour ego, see the [[ego|list of egos]].''\n\nThe '''Stealth''' stat determines how likely you are to be detected. While the [[Stealth (skill)|Stealth skill]] may be the most direct way to influence this stat, many other factors contribute as well:\n\n==Stealth Score==\nThe measure of a character's stealthiness is its stealth score. A character innately has a base stealth score, which is then modified by various external factors.\n\nYour base stealth score equals:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|player.cc|3063}}</ref>\n\n{{crawlquote|(3 × [[Dexterity]]) + (Stealth skill × 15)}}\n\n==Modifiers==\nThe following modifiers are applied in order:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|player.cc|3067}}</ref>\n\n===Confusion===\nConfusion's penalty applies before all other modifiers.\n*[[Confused]]: x0.33\n\n===Flat Modifiers===\n'''Positive'''\n*Armour of [[ego|stealth]]: +50 per item\n*Artefacts with Stlth+: +50 per Stlth+\n*[[Mutations]]:\n**[[Nightstalker]] mutation: +50 per rank\n**[[Camouflage]] mutation: +50 per rank\n**[[Thin Skeletal Structure]] mutation: +50 per rank\n**[[Translucent Skin]] mutation: +50, regardless of rank\n*Bloodless [[Vampire]]: +100\n**[[Bat Form]] Vampire: +50\n*[[Merfolk]] / [[Octopode]] on [[water]] (even if [[flying]]): +50\n\n'''Negative'''\n*[[Armour encumbrance|Body armour encumbrance]]: -2 × ([[Encumbrance rating]])<sup>2</sup> / 3\n*When emitting [[Silence]]: -50\n*Artefacts with Stlth-: -50 per Stlth-\n\n===Multipliers===\n'''Positive'''\n*[[Umbra]]: depends on the source; the highest stealth source is used. This only applies when the player is the source of umbra.\n**[[Ring of Shadows]]: ×1.5\n**[[Dithmenos]]: Varies based on piety. Equal to ×<code>(piety + 200)/200</code>, or ×1 at minimum, ×2 at maximum. \n*[[Shadow Form]]: ×2\n\n'''Negative'''\n*[[Backlit]] ([[Corona]], [[halo]], etc.): ×0.40\n*In [[shallow water]] (if not [[flying]], [[large]], or [[amphibious]]): ×0.5\n*Carrying the [[Orb of Zot]]: ×0.33\n*[[Qazlal]] (if 1* or higher): ×<code>(200 - piety) / 170</code>, capped at 160 piety. At 6* or higher, this is roughly a x0.24 multiplier.\n\nThe following conditions set stealth to 0:\n*[[Berserk]]\n*[[Clumsy]] (Dex=0)\n*[[Ru#Sacrifices|Sacrifice Stealth]]\n\nIf your stealth score is below 0, it is treated as though it were 0.\n\n===In-Game Display===\nAlthough you cannot display your exact stealth score, you can get an idea of it in the '''%''' screen. Every '+' is 50 stealth, every '*' is 100 stealth, '#' is 150 stealth, and '!' is 200 stealth.\n\n==Detection==\nEvery monster has their own Monster Awareness score. Each monster has a base awareness of 10, modified as follows:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|shout.cc|287}}</ref>\n\n'''Positive Factors'''\n*[[Monster intelligence]]: +0 for mindless, +8 for animal intelligence, +12 for human intelligence\n*[[Hit dice]]: +1 per HD\n*If the monster is wandering instead of sleeping: +15\n*Any monster that is not [[natural]] holiness: +10\n\n'''Negative Factors'''\n*Monsters under the effects of [[Ensorcelled Hibernation]]: -10\n*If the player is [[invisible]] and the monster can't see invisible: -75\n\nIf Monster Awareness is < 0, it is treated as though it were 0.\n\nEach time you move or perform an action, all monsters in your [[line of sight]] have a <code>(Awareness + 1) / (Your Stealth)</code> chance of spotting you. How fast or slow this action is does not matter; a [[Naga]] and [[Spriggan]] with the same Stealth score have the same chance per move to be detected. Once they've spotted you, they'll only lose track of you once you've left their line of sight for a while; this occurs much sooner for mindless enemies than for intelligent ones.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], [[hooves]] had a minor stealth penalty when not swimming or flying, and [[Translucent Skin]] offered less stealth. Also, [[Felid]]s gained 20 stealth when not swimming/flying, but lost 50 stealth if in [[Blade Hands]] when not swimming/flying.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

{"title":"Background and race combinations for beginners","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Background_and_race_combinations_for_beginners","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}{{Advice}}\nCrawl allows you to play using widely different play styles, depending on your character and god choice. The wide variety of choices offered might intimidate or even overwhelm new players. These are a selection of strong combos from the main character archetypes in the game. Please keep in mind that most accompanying strategy guides are severely outdated.\n\n===Melee Brute===\n\n*'''[[Minotaur]] [[Fighter]] ''' ([[H%27s_Minotaur_Fighter_Guide|strategy guide]]): Pure melee build. Find a big weapon and the heaviest armour, worship [[Okawaru]] or [[Trog]] and beat things to death. \n**'''[[Berserker]]''' ([[Beef Jerky's Simple 3 Rune Minotaur Berserker Guide for Beginners|strategy guide]]) is another melee build, worshipping Trog for the start.\n**'''[[Hill Orc]], [[Gargoyle]], and [[Troll]]''' are similarly strong melee species.\n\n*'''[[Troll]] [[Gladiator]]''': Strong melee + ranged character; able to hurl a fearsome [[large rock]] from a distance (gaining more rocks later), and using deadly [[claws]] up close. [[Okawaru]] gives you more ammo to throw and a strong buff to [[unarmed combat]].\n\n===Hybrid===\n\n*'''[[Gnoll]] (Any Class)''': Gnolls are the ultimate hybrids, able to use just about anything in the dungeon, albeit without a great proficiency in any one thing. [[Reaver]] is a very fitting pick, though you can also ''start'' with melee ([[Fighter]], [[Gladiator]]) or magic [[Conjurer]], [[Ice Elementalist]]. But you can really try anything - even [[Wanderer]], to embrace something new each time. Remember that a start is a start - e.g. a Gnoll Fighter can still cast all sorts of spells.\n\n===Caster===\n\n*'''[[Djinni]] [[Fire Elementalist]]''': Removes much magical complexity; instead of several magic schools, you only need to train one skill, and you don't need to choose spells at all. [[Scorch]] carries its weight all the way to the Lair, at which point new random spells will be naturally granted. Worships [[Ashenzari]] for additional bonuses. A good choice for a first attempt as a caster.\n\n*'''[[Gargoyle]] [[Earth Elementalist]]''' ([[Majang's Caster Walk-Through|strategy guide]]): A durable, more standard caster with powerful destructive spells. Typically worships [[Vehumet]].\n\n===Stabber===\n\n*'''[[Spriggan]] [[Enchanter]]''' ([[Huggz's Spriggan Enchanter guide|strategy guide]]): The classic stealth and stab build. Spriggans are a great stealth class for new players since their high speed lets them flee when stealth fails. [[Ensorcelled Hibernation]] makes stabbing things really easy. \n\nThese are just few examples, there are lots of other combinations that are reasonably easy to play. Feel free to experiment.\n\n{{Guides}}\n\n[[Category:Strategy Guides]]"}

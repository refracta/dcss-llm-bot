Their mastery of fire is woven into every strike of their weapons, filling the air around their opponent with sweltering flames.}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Salamander firebrands''' were fast-moving [[list of nagas#Salamander Types|salamanders]] which created a ring of flame [[cloud]]s around their enemies when they attacked in melee. They could be found in the [[Snake Pit]], [[the Depths]] and the [[Vestibule of Hell]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*As is the case with all salamanders, [[fire]] resistance greatly reduces the threat they pose. With sufficient resistance and [[AC]], you can likely ignore the flame clouds they produce without taking much damage. If you ''don't'' have fire resistance, however, consider [[blink]]ing if you need to escape without getting scorched.\n\n==History==\n*Salamander firebrands were removed in [[0.18]].\n*Salamander firebrands were added in [[0.14]]."}

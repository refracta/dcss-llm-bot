If the wielder is skilled in Evocations and Ice Magic, they can freeze those struck by it, dealing cold damage which bypasses armour.}}\n\nA '''staff of cold''' is a [[magical staff]]. It gives a [[spell enhancer]] to [[Ice Magic]], and gives the wielder a rank in [[cold resistance]].\n\nThe staff can also be used in combat, functioning as a +0 [[staff]] that deals additional cold damage:\n\n{{crawlquote|'''Cold Damage''': A random amount ranging from 0 to 1.25×(Evocations/2 + Ice Magic)<br>'''Chance to Activate on a Hit''': (Evocations + Ice Magic/2)×6.66% per hit}}\n\nIn addition, the [[Staves]] and [[Fighting]] skills will increase the damage done by the staff itself.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|the maximum cold damage in melee will be increased to <code>1.575×(Evocations/2 + Ice Magic)</code> and be reduced by AC.}}\n*Prior to [[0.19]], enhancer staves would penalize casting spells of the opposite school.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], the chance of a staff of cold auto-identifying when wielded depended on the Ice Magic skill of the wielder."}

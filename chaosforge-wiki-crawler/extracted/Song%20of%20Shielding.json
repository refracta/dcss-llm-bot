Incoming damage will be absorbed by the shield, decreasing the caster's available magic in the process.}}\n\n'''Song of Shielding''' is a level 4 [[Charms]] spell which temporarily causes all damage dealt to you to reduce your [[MP]], not your [[HP]]. Once you run out of MP, the spell ceases to protect you. This is different than the effect of an [[amulet of guardian spirit]], which causes the damage to be split between the two.\n\nBe aware that Song of Shielding will end immediately if you are affected by [[silence]]. Leaving the affected area does not cause it to restart for free.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Characters that focus on magic to deal damage will likely wish to avoid this spell. It essentially turns any powerful monster into an [[eye of draining]], and suddenly finding yourself with 0 MP is a much worse fate than taking a heavy hit or two. Unless you really need a quick block of HP while waiting for a [[teleport]] to kick in and save you, don't bother with it.\n*Although it may be tempting to couple this with [[Sif Muna]]'s [[channeling]] ability, most characters who can safely use it will likely want a different [[god]]. It ''does'' couple well with other sources of MP regeneration, such as [[Sublimation of Blood]], a [[staff of energy]], a [[crystal ball of energy]], [[the Shining One]]'s MP-on-kills, a stack of [[potions of magic]], or [[ambrosia]] (if you can manage the [[confusion]] effect).\n*As it only requires training in Charms to cast effectively, Song of Shielding works well for melee characters who intend to master the [[Haste]] spell in the late game. Just remember that even brutes occasionally have a need for MP.\n\n==History==\nSong of Shielding was removed in [[0.14]].\n\nThis spell was added in [[0.13]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

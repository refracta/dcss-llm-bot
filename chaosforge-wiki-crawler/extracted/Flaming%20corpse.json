Their melee attacks inflict [[Sticky Flame]], and they run faster than the average character. They are fortunately rare, appearing most often in [[the Crypt]] and [[the Abyss]], but occasionally spawning in the middle-[[Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Yredelemnul]] worshipers may receive flaming corpses as pets at high [[piety]].\n*If taking them out quickly at range isn't an option, bring high [[fire]] resistance or [[mottled dragon armour]], and [[conservation]] to protect your scrolls.\n*While they normally avoid [[shallow water]], if you can [[confusion|confuse]] one into falling in, its fire goes out, rendering it [[invisible]] but much less dangerous.\n\n==History==\n*Flaming corpses were removed in [[0.15]].\n*Prior to [[0.8]], flaming corpses had [[:Category:Human_intelligence|human intelligence]].\n*Flaming corpses were added in [[0.5]]. They were the first monster with [[:Category:Sticky_flame_resistance|Sticky Flame resistance]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

However, drinking an unidentified potion of haste gives you the effect with no consequences.\n\n[[Formicid]]s' innate [[stasis]] makes them unable to become hasted, so this potion is useless for them.\n\n{{crawlquote|Normal: \"You feel yourself speed up.\"<br>Already Hastened: \"You feel as though you will be hastened longer.\"}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.20]], gaining, being under the effect of, and extending the haste effect gave you magical contamination. Also, the effect increased the player's rate of [[hunger]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], potions of haste were known as potions of speed.\n\n{{potions}}"}

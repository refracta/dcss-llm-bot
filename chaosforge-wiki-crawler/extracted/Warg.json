{"title":"Warg","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Warg","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | canines}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Wargs''' are the largest natural canines in the game and are closely tied to [[orc]]ish culture. They serve as guards in and around the [[Orcish Mines]], quickly chasing down their victims and mauling them in melee. They can also be found in the company of [[Saint Roka]] and other roaming orcish bands.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Wargs can close the distance and deal surprising damage before you can run to stairs. Have a method of keeping them away.\n*They are resistant to poison, making them the only things in the Orcish Mines that can't be incapacitated with [[Mephitic Cloud]]. Casters relying on it should find a different way to kill them.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], wargs were considerably weaker (slower, less AC, less damage) and could be summoned with [[Call Canine Familiar]]."}

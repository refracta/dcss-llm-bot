While exhausted, you are prevented from using any other abilities that inflict exhaustion.\n\nCurrently, only [[Ru]] and the [[Wu Jian Council]] have abilities that cause exhaustion.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.20]], [[Death's Door]] and [[berserk]] wearing off made the character exhausted, instead of just giving -DDoor or -Berserk (respectively).\n*During its brief existence ([[0.14]] and [[0.15]]), making a [[jump attack]] would inflict exhaustion.\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

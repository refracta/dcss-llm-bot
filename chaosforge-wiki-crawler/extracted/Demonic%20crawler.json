{"title":"Demonic crawler","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Demonic_crawler","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Demonic crawlers''' are grotesque [[demon]]ic pests. In addition to fast speed and moderately high damage, demonic crawlers regenerate ''very'' quickly, gaining +6 HP/turn. They are often encountered in the [[Spider's Nest]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*High damage is usually required to kill them. Barring that, the following work well:\n**Hex [[wand]]s. They have moderate [[willpower]], but a [[scroll of vulnerability]] can lower it. [[Wand of paralysis|Paralysis]] gives [[stab]] bonuses, which usually lets melee fighters kill it in time. [[Wand of charming|Charming]] can allow other spiders to do the work for you. [[Wand of polymorph|Polymorph]] will turn it into a form without regeneration. \n**[[Cloud]]s. A [[condenser vane]], if it doesn't create poisonous clouds, will let you outdamage their regeneration. [[Freezing Cloud]] will work just as well.\n**[[Scroll of immolation]] or [[Inner Flame]]. A couple of spiders exploding can do the trick. In a pinch, immolation can even work against a lone crawler, since Inner Flame creates a flame cloud on hit. Just make sure the explosions don't kill you.\n*Unlike many other opponents in the Spider's Nest, demonic crawlers are resistant to [[poison]], but they are vulnerable to weapons of [[holy wrath]] and other holy effects.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], demonic crawlers didn't have fast regeneration, but had many resistances (rF+ rC+ rElec rMiasma, and 100 will) and the [[Warning Cry]] ability.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], demonic crawlers were Big-sized, did less damage, and did not have Warning Cry.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], demonic crawlers could [[cling]] to walls.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

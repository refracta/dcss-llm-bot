Although significantly less common than boots, they provide double the AC and can be enchanted twice as heavily. In exchange, they do have a slight [[encumbrance rating]], but this has no effect on your spellcasting, [[stealth]], or accuracy. The only negative impact is a loss of 2 points to your [[ev]]asion, which can not be reduced by a high armor skill. \n\nPossible egos include:\n*[[Fire resistance]]\n*[[Cold resistance]]\n*[[Flying]]\n*[[Stealth]]\n\nAC from centaur barding is not penalized by a centaur's [[Bad mutations#Deformed Body|oddly-shaped body]]. Non-centaurs cannot wear centaur barding, though [[naga]]s have [[naga barding]], a type of barding intended for them.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.26]], [[centaur barding]]s and [[naga barding]]s were merged into a single item type called [[barding]]s.\n*In [[0.12]], bardings of levitation were replaced with bardings of flying.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[Image:Centaur barding 1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[Image:Centaur barding 2.png]] or [[Image:Centaur barding 3.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[Image:Centaur barding 4.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]] barding\n|-\n| '''[[Black Knight's barding|Black Knight's horse barding]]''' || [[File:Black knight barding.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n\n[[Category:Barding]]"}

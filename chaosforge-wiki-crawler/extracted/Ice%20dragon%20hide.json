It can be fashioned into proper armour, but even in its raw form it provides great protection from the effects of cold but renders its wearer susceptible to fire.}}\n\n'''Ice dragon hide''' is not a very impressive form of body armour on its own. With 4 [[AC]] and 11 [[encumbrance rating]], it is inconvenient for most casters, and provides meager physical defense. However, it does provide two ranks of [[cold]] resistance (though with a rank of [[fire]] vulnerability) and can be upgraded to a much more impressive [[ice dragon armour]] by using a [[scroll of enchant armour]] on it.\n\nAlthough rare, you can make your own ice dragon hides by [[butchering]] [[ice dragon]] [[corpse]]s.\n\n==History==\nIce dragon hides were removed in [[0.19]]\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

{"title":"Mennas","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mennas","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | holy monsters}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Mennas, the Voice of Zin''' is an incredibly dangerous [[unique]] [[angel]], the only one who normally appears in the main [[Dungeon]] not locked behind a wall. He is fast, extremely durable, and disables many player abilities with [[Silence]], making him a notorious menace to spellcasters.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Depths]]:3-5\n*[[The Vaults]]:2-5\n*[[The Crypt]]\n*[[The Tomb]]\n*[[Pandemonium]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Mennas is a nasty foe. It's ''very'' difficult to escape from him: he has the speed of a [[haste]]d Human, and his [[Silence]] disables [[scroll]]s, [[god]] abilities, and [[spell]]s entirely. He's also quite durable and annoyingly evasive. If you were already low HP, and Mennas shows up, it's a big problem. Don't underestimate him, even if you're in [[extended]].\n**As a holy monster, he is even more deadly to [[undead]], [[Demonspawn]], and [[Death Form]] players.\n**If you see Mennas and don't think you can handle him, act immediately. You can initiate a [[scroll of teleport]], and even if you're silenced afterwards, it will still activate. Using [[Haste]] before he's in melee range allows you to run to a nearby stairs.\n**[[Wand]]s and other [[evocable]]s still work during silence. A [[wand of quicksilver]], if it hits, will end the Silence spell. A [[phial of floods]] prevents him from casting Silence for a short while. Using a [[phantom mirror]] can be risky, since the Mennas clone can end up casting Silence (although you can attack the clone to dispel it instantly).\n**[[Invisibility]], by potion or [[ability]], can be extremely useful, as long as you stay outside of Mennas' [[halo]].\n**His [[willpower]] is usually too high for a [[wand of paralysis]] or the like to work. A [[scroll of vulnerability]] with a high Evocations wand can disable him, though note that the scroll will make you susceptible to his Mass Confusion.\n**[[Shaft]]s, if you happen to find one (or be a [[Formicid]]) can let you escape an adjacent Mennas.\n*If you do try to fight Mennas, plan accordingly. A mid-level \"tank\" character should be able to overcome Mennas with [[haste]] and [[might]]. [[Berserk]] gives both effects, but if it runs out, the silence puts you in even more danger than usual. Casters have a much harder time, for rather obvious reasons.\n**Mennas' guaranteed [[tower shield]] makes him significantly more durable in combat. If possible, use attacks that bypass shields, such as piercing, area-of-effect, or [[smite-targeted]] attacks.\n**Casters can use spells that have lasting effects, such as Summoning spells ([[Malign Gateway]], [[Dragon's Call]]) or [[Polar Vortex]].\n**If you have [[Passage of Golubria]], cast it before engaging to set up an emergency exit. If you do, remember that the portals will last 10-19 turns, so reassess the fight after a few turns and escape if it's not going well.\n*Remember that he can use [[Mass Confusion]] if not currently under silence. Good [[willpower]] is important to avoid being confused, then silenced, then [[YASD]]ed.\n*If you notice him without waking him up, remember that you can just walk away. Returning later with more experience and better equipment can make a huge difference (alternatively, just avoid him entirely -- you are under no obligation to kill every enemy you see).\n\n==Trivia==\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Menas_of_Constantinople&redirect=no Mennas] was a Catholic saint of the early Christian church. He lived in the 6th century, and was excommunicated twice (and pardoned both times).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Mennas could [[see invisible]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], Mennas could not spawn in [[Pandemonium]] and knew [[Confusion]] instead of [[Mass Confusion]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], worshipers of [[good gods]] would have a [[piety]]-based chance of turning Mennas neutral when they encountered him.\n*Mennas was added in version [[0.8]]."}

{"title":"Deep water","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Deep_water","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|A pool of deep water. Only giant creatures can wade through this, and only those well-adapted to water can swim through it; for the rest, the only way through is to fly over.}}\n\n'''Deep water''' is a type of terrain that is normally impassible. Players can only cross it when [[flying]] or when [[amphibious]] (by being a [[Merfolk]], [[Octopode]], [[Barachi]], [[Draconian#Grey|Grey Draconian]], or while in [[Ice Form]]). Monsters can cross deep water if they can fly, are [[amphibious]] or [[aquatic]], or are [[Size#Giant|giant-sized]].\n__NOTOC__\n===Falling in===\nDeep water will instantly kill non-swimming monsters who fall into it. Players who are stuck in deep water instead enter emergency flight, which inflicts [[drain]]ing (~3% max HP) for every turn spent.\n\nKnockback effects like [[Primal Wave]] or [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] cannot push things into water - the tile is treated as a wall instead. Monsters can fall in if they are [[confused]], or if [[Polar Vortex]] flings them in. Players won't stumble into deep water while confused; they can only enter deep water if temporary [[flight]] runs out. Fortunately, you will receive a warning if your flight source is expiring. \n\nNaturally amphibious species can recover items from deep water. Otherwise, items dropped in deep water are destroyed forever, including [[artefact]]s. Even [[Ice Form]] cannot retrieve fallen items (since ice floats).\n\n==Strategy==\n*You can use confusion to your advantage (e.g. [[Confusing Touch]], [[Mephitic Cloud]]) by targeting monsters near deep water. They may attempt to cross it and fall in, killing them instantly. Keep in mind that this will also render their equipment inaccessible unless you are an amphibious species.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Shallow water]]\n*[[Lava]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.24]], followers of [[Fedhas Madash]] could use its Sunlight ability to turn deep water into shallow water.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], falling in deep water resulted in instant death rather than draining.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], you risked drowning if you moved next to deep water while confused. Also, enemies with high intelligence would refuse to move while confused and adjacent to deep water.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], it was sometimes possible to [[scramble]] out of deep water if your flight expired over it.\n\n[[Category:World]]\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

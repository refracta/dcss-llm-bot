{"title":"Auxiliary attack","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Auxiliary_attack","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n'''Auxiliary attacks''' ('''aux attacks''') are additional attacks that you can perform in melee combat.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhenever you make a melee attack, you have a chance to perform an auxiliary attack, taking no time in the process. If your character has multiple valid attacks, each has a separate chance to trigger. \n\nAux attacks have a base damage dependent on the aux attack and its relevant [[mutation]]s; e.g. higher levels of [[Talons]] increases kick damage. They are affected by [[strength]], [[slaying]] and the [[Might]] effect as normal. [[Fighting]] affects aux attacks, but at a reduced effectiveness.<ref>For auxiliary attacks, Fighting skill multiplies damage by <code>1 + uniform(Fighting)/40</code>, where <code>uniform(x) = 1d(x+1)-1</code>, or a roll from 0 to x, inclusive; see {{source ref|0.31.0|fight.cc|1355}}</ref> They do not scale with weapon damage (though swinging faster means you perform aux attacks more often). Other than the \"offhand punch\" or equivalent, [[Unarmed Combat]] skill has no influence on them.\n\n[[Reaching]] weapons don't make aux attacks when attacking from a distance. When [[cleaving]], you only make aux attacks on the main target. [[Quick blade]]s make 2 sets of aux attacks per action, but [[Gyre and Gimble]] still only make 2 sets of aux attacks (despite attacking four times).\n\n===Chance to Trigger===\nIn order to make an auxiliary attack, you must succeed 2 separate chances ''at the same time'':\n\n:'''1.''' A chance based on [[XL]], <code>(30 + XL) / 59</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|melee-attack.cc|1181}}</ref> This is equal to to 52.5% at XL 1, and 96.6% at XL 27. A few attacks ignore this check:\n:*Constriction, Demonic Touch, and Maw Form bite completely ignore this check.\n:*The off-hand punch replaces it with chance = <code>(3 + [[UC]]_skill) / 60 </code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|melee-attack.cc|1330}}</ref> That's 5% at 0 skill, and 50% at 27 skill.\n:'''2.''' A % chance based on the auxiliary attack itself. For example, Bite has a 40% chance to pass only if the XL-based check above succeeds. See below for a list of attacks and their chances of success.\n\nIn addition, the body part related to the attack must be free. You must have your offhand free (no [[shield]] or two-handed weapon) to make an offhand punch, you cannot be wearing [[boots]] to kick with [[Talons]], and so on.\n\n==List of Auxiliary Attacks==\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n!

Octopodes also had an extra chance to do an offhand tentacle slap. Also, Bite had an extra +1 damage for every 5 STR beyond 10.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], headbutts had a chance to stun, hooves partially bypassed AC, and claws caused [[bleeding]].\n*In earlier versions of ''Crawl'', all auxiliary attacks were more effective if you had a high Unarmed Combat skill, making it a valuable skill for any character designed for melee combat.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Combat]]"}

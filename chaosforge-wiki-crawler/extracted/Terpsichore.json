She was somewhat durable herself, and had a permanent [[Deflect Missiles]] effect up at all times, but the bigger threat lay in whatever potential [[brand]]ed allies she could raise.\n\nSpells: [[Tukima's Ball]], [[Swiftness]], [[Corona]], [[Blink]], [[Cantrip]]\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nDepending on where you faced her, Terpsichore's difficulty could vary tremendously. If you knew she was around, picking up all errant weapons would effectively disarm her.\n\n==History==\nTerpsichore was considered for inclusion in [[0.8]], and was briefly encounterable in trunk. However, her Tukima's Ball spell was deemed too broken to merit actually including her in the game; alone she was pathetic, and with more than one or two weapons around she would devastate characters. At present she has been removed from the code, and there are no plans to incorporate her.\n\n==Trivia==\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpsichore Terpsichore] was the Greek muse of dance.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

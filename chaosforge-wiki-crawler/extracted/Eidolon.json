{"title":"Eidolon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Eidolon","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{monster info}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Eidola''' are insubstantial [[undead]], a type of [[wraith]]. Their melee attacks [[slow]] and cause [[stat drain]], and they can fire damaging bolts at range. They can be found in and around [[the Crypt]], [[the Abyss]], and [[Tartarus]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Pile on the [[negative energy resistance]] when dealing with these guys, as [[Cause Fear]] coupled with [[Bolt of Draining]] can result in heavy amounts of [[draining]] very quickly.\n*Cause Fear can be resisted with high [[willpower]]. This can be critical if you lack the means to defeat them quickly at range.\n*[[Silence]] doesn't stop these guys from casting, so don't expect that [[silent spectre]] you have following you around to provide any assistance.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.13]], eidola would drain your experience with their melee attacks. This change accompanied the 0.13 overhaul to draining effects. They also gained [[Bolt of Draining]]."}

It is a one handed weapon.}}\n\nThe '''dagger''' is the smallest short blade. While daggers are one of the weakest weapons, they receive a large [[stabbing]] bonus, higher than all other weapons. See the [[Stabbing]] page for more details.\n\n==Strategy==\nDaggers are weak if you aren't stabbing. If you have nothing else, a dagger is at least better than a [[club]] or [[Unarmed Combat]]. However, a [[short sword]] will be better at everything but stab damage. On the other hand, \"stabber\" characters (such as [[Enchanter]]s and other users of [[Hexes]]) greatly benefit from the dagger boost. A skilled stabber with a good dagger can one-shot sleeping dragons and giants with ease.\n\nFor other characters, a dagger/short sword with a \"flat\" damage brand, namely [[venom]] or [[electrocution]], is a strong early game weapon. A dagger of venom can take you to [[Lair]] with 0 skill investment. This isn't because daggers are good, but because the venom brand is so powerful in the early Dungeon.\n\n===Comparison to Short Blades===\nDespite their special stabbing bonus, daggers may be worse than other short blades for stabbing damage. Assuming you've reached mindelay:\n\n*[[Quick blade]]s: Quick blades are better at every stab except [[sleep]] stabs. Quick blades have the same base damage, but make twice as many stabs. The dagger bonus is ''always'' less than twice the damage of other short blades, so quick blades are just better.  Sleeping enemies are the sole exception: since sleeping enemies can only be stabbed once, the stronger first hit off a dagger is better.\n\n*[[Rapier]]s: At ''extremely'' high levels of skill and dexterity, rapiers may deal more stab damage than daggers do.<!--\n**Daggers deal <code>4 * skill_dmg% * stat_dmg% + 10 * log2(1 + [dex/10 + 1 + <wpn_skill + stealth> / 2] / 5)</code> damage before the stab multiplier.\n**Rapiers deal <code>7 * skill_dmg% * stat_dmg% + 10 * log2(1 + [dex/10 + 1 + <wpn_skill + stealth> / 2] / 10)</code> damage before the stab multiplier.\nFor \"skill_dmg%\" equals the average damage multiplier from Fighting and Short Blades skill, and \"stat_dmg\" equals the multiplier from dexterity. Example:\nAt 20 dexterity, 14 Fighting, 14 Short Blades, and 14 Stealth, a rapier stab results in 29.46 pre-multiplier damage, and a dagger stab results in 31.89 pre-multiplier dmg.--> For reference: at 25 dexterity, 27 Fighting, 27 Short Blades, and 27 Stealth, a rapier stab is just slightly better than a dagger stab. At more realistic levels of skill, dagger stabs are significantly better. Of course, sticking with a rapier means you don't have to waste time swapping weapons.\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Dagger.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Dagger2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Dagger3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]s\n|-\n| '''[[Spriggan's Knife]]''' || [[File:Spriggan's_knife.png]]\n|}\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Short blades]]"}

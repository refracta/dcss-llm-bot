It is cumbersome to wear, and impedes the evasion, spellcasting ability, and attack speed of an unskilled wearer. These penalties will be reduced and eventually eliminated with increased Shields skill.}}\n\nThe largest of the [[shields]], '''tower shields''' provide high [[SH]], but with significant penalties. High [[Shields]] skill and/or [[strength]] can reduce these. While wielding a tower shield, you can [[Shields#Blocking|block]] a maximum of 4 attacks per turn. They are too large for [[Spriggan]]s or [[Kobold]]s to use at all.\n\n==Egos==\nThey can be found with the following [[ego]]s:\n*[[Reflection]]\n*[[Protection]]\n*[[Cold resistance]]\n*[[Fire resistance]]\n*[[Poison resistance]]\n*[[Positive energy]]\n*[[Resistance_(ego)|Resistance]]\n\nShield egos are relatively rare. Of the egos, reflection and protection are the most common. You can occasionally find cold resistance and fire resistance in [[Ice cave]]s and [[Volcano]]s, respectively.\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Large shield 1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Large shield 2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Large shield 3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]<br>tower shields\n|-\n| '''[[Tower shield of Ignorance]]''' || [[File:Shield of ignorance.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], shields did not have a maximum number of blocks per turn. Instead, the more blocks you made per turn, the less likely the next block was to be made.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], tower shields had a base EV penalty of 5, negated completely by 25 Shields skill.\n*Tower shields were known as \"large shields\" until [[0.25]].\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Shields]]"}

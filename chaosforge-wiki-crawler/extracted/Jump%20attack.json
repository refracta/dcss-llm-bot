{"title":"Jump attack","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Jump_attack","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n''This article is about the [[Felid]] and evocable ability. For the Power Leap, ability see [[Ru#Given Abilities|Ru]]. For the [[Barachi]] ability, see [[Strong Legs]].''\n\n'''Jump attack''' is an [[ability]] that allows you to quickly leap into melee range with an enemy, reaching it in spite of intervening obstacles and attacking it all in the time it takes to make a normal attack. You cannot leap through [[wall]]s or trees, or past [[fly]]ing enemies, and you can only leap over [[size|giant]] or huge enemies if they're currently standing in [[lava]] or [[deep water]]. Regardless of the enemy's current status effects, you can't [[stab]] monsters with this type of attack. Standing or swimming in water, lava, or [[Leda's Liquefaction|liquefied ground]] will prevent you from using this attack at all.\n\nThere are two ways to gain this ability:\n*Wearing [[boots]] with the [[jumping]] [[ego]]. Each use costs 2 [[MP]] and makes you slightly hungrier. Its success rate depends on [[Evocations]], and its range is set at 4.\n*[[Felid]]s can jump as a natural ability, costing only some food. Its range and success rate depend on the [[experience]] level of the player (range 3 at level 1, 4 at 6, and 5 at 12).\n\nLike [[berserk]]ing and the [[Death's Door]] spell, this ability causes [[exhaustion]] and cannot be used when exhausted.\n\n==History==\n* Removed in in [[0.16]].\n* Added in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Abilities]]"}

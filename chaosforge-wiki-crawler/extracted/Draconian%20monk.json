{"title":"Draconian monk","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Draconian_monk","type":"raw","data":"{{version|028}}\n{{list of|draconians}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Draconian monks''' are lightly armored combatants that fight with their fists. And feet. And tails! Despite their lack of weapons, they're still capable of causing serious injury. They are common in [[the Realm of Zot]]. Randomly generated monks are [[green draconian]]s, who spit out a [[Poisonous Cloud]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nAlthough by no means harmless, their complete lack of spells renders draconian monks one of the least dangerous draconian professionals you can encounter. Low AC characters should still be careful around them, of course, but make them a lower priority than any of the draconian casters. Just keep an eye out for any dangerous breath weapons they might have.\n\nThey have high EV, so use your most accurate attacks, and be prepared for a long fight if you choose to go mano-a-mano with them.  However, their aforementioned lack of spells makes it easy to walk away from them.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], classed draconians could be generated with random colours."}

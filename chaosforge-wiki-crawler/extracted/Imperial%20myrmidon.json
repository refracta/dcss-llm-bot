{"title":"Imperial myrmidon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Imperial_myrmidon","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Imperial myrmidons''' are fast, aggressive support hexers with melee attacks that halve your [[willpower]], essentially being a crossbreed between [[phantasmal warrior]]s and [[vampire knight]]s. Disabling you with status effects and carving your health away with [[Agony]], they are dangerous on their own and deadly when paired with allies. They are found in the [[Desolation of Salt]], usually guarding treasure vaults.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Three pips of [[willpower]] should be enough to be safe; that way, when your will is halved, the hexes still have a fairly low chance (lower than 25%) of succeeding. Less is only risky if you engage them in melee; if you can defeat them at range, it's not much of an issue, though you might want a [[potion of curing]] on hand to end [[confusion]] early.\n\n==History==\n*Imperial myrmidons were added in [[0.19]].\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

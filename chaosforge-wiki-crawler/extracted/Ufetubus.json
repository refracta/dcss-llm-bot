{"title":"Ufetubus","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ufetubus","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ufetubi''' are fast, puny tier-[[5]] demons which hound you, sneaking behind you and dealing minor damage. They can be found in the early Dungeon, [[the Abyss]], or when summoned by other monsters. [[Ynoxinul]]s in particular summon hordes of them.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nEven in large numbers, ufetubi are hardly a threat. When summoned in droves, they will usually outpace other threats and surround you, bogging you down. Don't waste time killing summoned ufetubi while actual threats are around, unless they're blocking your way to a [[smite]]r.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|ufetubi will get a damage buff: 5 -> 6 (for both attacks). Also, they will appear earlier in the Dungeon: on D:4-7 instead of D:5-7.}}\n*In [[0.31]], ufetubi got the '''AF_FLANK''' attack flavour and slightly more HP; their size was reduced from medium to small. Also, they spawn in pairs and appear on D:5-7 instead of D:4-7 now.\n*In [[0.26]], they replaced [[crimson imp]]s in [[the Dungeon]].\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

Like all deep dwarves, they do not regenerate health naturally. They are occasionally found in packs of [[deep dwarf (monster)|deep dwarves]] roaming [[the Abyss]]. \n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nThese guys rank among the least of your worries when facing a pack of deep dwarves. Try not to ignore them entirely though, as their weapons can hold powerful [[brand]]s.\n\n==History==\nDeep dwarf scions were added in [[0.8]] and removed in [[0.13]].\n\n[[Category:Dwarf]]\n[[Category:Obsolete_monsters]]"}

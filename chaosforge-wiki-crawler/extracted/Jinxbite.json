{"title":"Jinxbite","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Jinxbite","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n'''Jinxbite''' is a level 2 [[Hexes]] spell. It gives attacks some extra damage and [[drain]] status for a short time, but halves the caster's [[willpower]] for the duration.\n\n[[Hexslinger]]s start with this spell in their libraries.\n\n==Useful Info==\nGrants the Jinxbite (Jinx) status and lowered will (Will/2). Whenever you make an attack, even if you miss, there is a [[willpower]]-based chance to cause extra effects:<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|spl-damage.cc|4060}}</ref>\n*Deal <code>2d(2 + power/25)</code> irresistible damage (never misses, ignores [[AC]]).\n*Inflict the [[drain]] status for 3-5 turns.\n\nJinxbite triggers when attacking with melee, [[ranged weapon]]s, and damaging [[Throwing]] implements. It can trigger against multiple targets when [[cleaving]]. It does trigger with [[Vhi's Electric Charge]], but not with [[Manifold Assault]].\n\nThis spell can only be cast if there are hostile monsters in [[line of sight]]. The Jinx status lasts for <code>9 + pow/4</code> to <code>15 + pow/4</code> turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|spl-selfench.cc|285}}</ref> However, Jinx ends if you spend 2 turns without any monsters in sight, regardless of the duration. The Will/2 status lasts for <code>(duration of Jinx) + pow/4</code> to <code>15 + pow/4</code> turns,<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|spl-selfench.cc|286}}</ref> and does not wear off when no monsters are in sight.\n\nNote that although you can inflict draining with this spell, the [[good gods]] won't put you under penance for this. Also, Jinxbite can drain even [[undead]] monsters.\n\n==Strategy==\nJinxbite adds some damage and a useful debuff to hybrid-type characters. Heavy melee brutes shouldn't bother.\n\nBecause of the low power cap, Jinxbite isn't worth casting past the early game. As you progress, monsters will have too much willpower for this spell to be of any practical use.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Since this spell lowers your willpower, watch out for monsters who have Hexes of their own. In the early game, this consists mostly of [[orc wizard]]s and a few [[unique]]s like [[Sigmund]] and [[Grinder]], though any monster can pick up a [[wand]].\n\n==History==\n*Jinxbite was introduced in [[0.31]].\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

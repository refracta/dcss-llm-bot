{"title":"Preservation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Preservation","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{flavour|It provides partial protection from all sources of acid and corrosion.}}\n'''Preservation''' is an [[ego]] found on [[cloak]]s which grants resistance to [[acid]] and its [[corrosion|corrosive]] effects. Although unimpressive early on, this ego is useful for fighting the occasional monster with acidic attacks like [[deep elf sorcerer]]s or [[yellow draconian]]s, and is especially helpful in late-game areas where acidic attacks are commonplace like the [[Slime Pits]].\n\nA cloak of preservation is good for rounding out your list of resistances, but a [[ring of resist corrosion]] or a [[potion of resistance]] will do the trick just as well. Many characters may wish to use a cloak with a more broadly useful ego like [[willpower]], if they've found one.\n\n==History==\n*Preservation returned in [[0.25]], where it is functionally identical to [[resist corrosion]].\n*Prior to its removal in [[0.15]], preservation also granted the [[conservation]] intrinsic, which protected the wearer's items from [[item destruction|destruction]].\n\n[[Category:Egos]]"}

{"title":"List of vortices","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_vortices","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Vortices''' are odd phenomena that occur in certain elementally charged places or are created by [[spell]]s. For the most part, they aren't overtly hostile; many of them are permanently [[confused]] and will float aimlessly about, only dealing damage when they happen to crash into something. They are all [[nonliving]], however, and are all immune to [[Hexes|magical effects]] as well as generally highly resistant to elemental magic.\n\n==List of vortices==\n{{monsterlink|Fire vortex}} - Swirling clouds of flame found in volcanic areas or created with [[Fire Storm|extremely powerful]] [[Fire Magic]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Spatial vortex}} - A wandering tear in the fabric of space that deals heavy [[distortion]] damage to anything it bumps into.\n\n{{monsterlink|Spatial maelstrom}} - A cognizant (and hungry) hole in creation. It seeks to dissolve all matter into raging storms of unreality.\n\n{{monsterlink|Twister}} - A localized [[Polar Vortex|windstorm]] that sweeps away anything unfortunate enough to be caught in its path.\n\n==Retired vortices==\n{{monsterlink|Insubstantial wisp}} - Thin clouds of [[Swamp]] gases that traveled in packs and swarmed passersby. They [[Blink|blinked]] often and occasionally [[Static Discharge|discharged electricity]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Vapour}} - Invisible wads of mist that occasionally discharged [[Lightning Bolt]]s in random directions.\n\n==History==\n*Insubstantial wisps were replaced by [[will-o-the-wisp]]s in [[0.26]].\n*Vapours were removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

{"title":"Frenzy","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Frenzy","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n\n'''Frenzy''' is a [[status effect]]. During frenzy, monsters turn \"neutral\", causing them to attack anything in sight - friend or foe. This also applies the [[haste]] and [[might]] status effect. Afterwards, they are [[slow]]ed for a brief time. Like [[berserk]], frenzied monsters can't cast spells.\n\nWhen a source of frenzy is used against the player, the [[berserk]] effect is applied instead.\n\n==Sources of Frenzy==\nFrenzy can be afflicted by:\n*[[Discord]]: A level 8 [[Hexes]] spell which attempts to frenzy all monsters in sight.\n*[[Datura]]-tipped dart: Throwing weapon which can apply the frenzy effect to vulnerable monster upon hit.\n*[[Orb]]s of [[mayhem]]: May frenzy a monster whenever you kill.\n\n==History==\n* Prior to [[0.28]], non-[[natural]] creatures would not get the [[haste]] or [[might]] effect. You would not get XP when a frenzied monster died. Gods which hated attacking neutral monsters would forbid attacking a frenzied one. Also, in 0.28, frenzy was made dispellable again.\n* In [[0.27]], frenzy was made non-dispellable.\n* Prior to [[0.13]], frenzy could only affect natural creatures."}

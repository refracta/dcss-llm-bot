{"title":"Monster attributes","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Monster_attributes","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\nAll monsters have different '''attributes'''.  These attributes govern every aspect of how the monster functions in-game &ndash; the monster's behavior, its toughness in combat, its special abilities, its resistances and vulnerabilities, and its general stats.\n\nMost of the attributes for each individual monster are stored in the [https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/stone_soup-0.26/crawl-ref/source/mon-data.h mon-data.h] file in the ''Crawl'' [[source code]], in the following format:\n\n row 1: monster id, display character, display colour, name\n row 2: monster flags\n row 3: monster resistance flags\n row 4: experience modifier, genus, species, holiness, willpower\n row 5: damage for each of four attacks\n row 6: hit dice, hit points\n row 7: AC, evasion, spells, corpse, shouts\n row 8: intel, habitat, speed, energy_usage\n row 9: gmon_use class, body size, body shape\n row 10: tile, corpse\n\nMany other monster properties are hardcoded into other parts of the source.  For instance, [[negative energy resistance]] is not one of the \"resistance flags\" in mon-data; it is in [https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/stone_soup-0.26/crawl-ref/source/monster.cc monster.cc]:\n\n int monster::res_negative_energy(bool intrinsic_only) const\n {\n     // If you change this, also change get_mons_resists.\n     if (!(holiness() & MH_NATURAL))\n         return 3;\n     [additional checks for items w/ resistance]\n }\n\nThe above means \"if the monster is not [[natural]], it has 3 levels of negative energy resistance\".\n\nSee [[:Category:Monster attributes]] for documentation of various attributes and lists of monsters with specific attributes.\n\n[[Category:Monster attributes|*]]"}

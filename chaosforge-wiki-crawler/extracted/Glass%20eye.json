{"title":"Glass eye","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Glass_eye","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | eyeballs}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Glass eyes''' are harmless on their own, but their [[Vitrifying Gaze|gaze]] unavoidably inflicts the [[Fragile]] status for 4-8 turns. Fragile causes you to take 50% more damage, making glass eyes a dangerous support monster. They can be found in [[the Slime Pits]] and [[the Depths]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Watch out - the +50% damage really hurts if other monsters are around you.\n*Their gaze doesn't need a line of fire to hurt you. Just being in [[line of sight]] of the glass eye will put you at risk.\n*As monsters made out of glass, they are vulnerable to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] and [[Shatter]]. LRD in particular will cause a range-2 blast when targeting them.\n\n==History==\n*Glass eyes were introduced in [[0.31]], replacing [[floating eye]]s, which could irresistibly [[paralyze]] the player."}

{"title":"Thrashing horror","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Thrashing_horror","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Thrashing horrors''' are massive heaps of muscle and flesh which tromp about [[the Abyss]], seeking out invaders and smashing them beneath their bulk. They move erratically, like [[bat]]s, and when seriously injured, they can [[might]] themselves. They often come in small packs like raijus.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*By the time a character is ready for the Abyss, thrashing horrors aren't big threats, even when [[might]]ed. But if you're banished to Abyss early (or just low on HP), thrashing horrors can be a huge issue. They are very fast, so it's almost impossible to escape by running.\n\n==History==\nThrashing horrors were added in [[0.12]]"}

{"title":"Cactus giant","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cactus_giant","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Cactus giants''' are durable creatures summoned in by [[Summon Cactus Giant]]. Fitting for a giant, they most often spawn with a [[giant club]]. And fittingly for a cactus, they retaliate with 5d8 [[spiny]] damage when hit in melee.\n\nThe actual max HP of this monster depends on the [[spell power]] of which you cast Summon Cactus Giant. This can be lower than (92 - 187) HP range listed in the infobox.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*With their high HP and low EV, cactus giants excel at any shielding tactics a summon can provide.\n*Their spines do contribute a great deal of damage, though weary summoners can still use these giants in conjunction with the rest of their arsenal.\n\n==History==\n*Cactus giants were added in [[0.28]]."}

Most of them are harmless, but some contain dangerous traps or actively try to kill you. While each kind of statue behaves in a unique way, they are most easily divided into inanimate statues (which are treated like [[dungeon features]]) and animated statue monsters (which will attack you and can be \"killed\"). Whether animate or not, all statues are completely [[stationary]], and if a statue is capable of attacking you, the game will auto-exclude all tiles in their [[LOS]] to keep you from accidentally wandering into danger.\n\nAll statues behave much like transparent walls, being a barrier to ranged attacks but not visibility; unlike transparent walls, they are ''not'' a barrier to [[reaching]] or [[smite]]-targeted attacks. Remember that statues are stationary, so even if you are forced to retreat, you may come back and try again to destroy one after you've healed.\n\n==Inanimate Statues==\nInanimate statues, while unaffected by physical attacks, are susceptible to [[wands of digging]] and [[Shatter]].\n*'''Granite statues''' come in a variety of shapes, often resembling dangerous monsters, but pose no risk; at worst they may prevent you from reaching a [[shop]] or pile of treasure.\n{{crawlquote|A stone statue whose features have long since withered away.}}\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n| [[File:Statue ancient evil.png]] || [[File:Statue ancient hero.png]] || [[File:Statue angel.png]] || [[File:Statue archer.png]] || [[File:Statue axe.png]] || [[File:Statue cat.png]] || [[File:Statue centaur.png]] || [[File:Statue cerebov.png]] || [[File:Statue demonic bust.png]] || [[File:Statue dragon.png]]\n|-\n| [[File:Statue dwarf.png]] || [[File:Statue elephant.png]] || [[File:Statue hydra.png]] || [[File:Statue imp.png]] || [[File:Statue maw.png]] || [[File:Statue mermaid.png]] || [[File:Statue naga.png]] || [[File:Statue orb.png]] || [[File:Statue orb guardian.png]] || [[File:Statue polearm.png]]\n|-\n| [[File:Statue princess.png]] || [[File:Statue sigmund.png]] || [[File:Statue snail.png]] || [[File:Statue sword.png]] || [[File:Statue tengu.png]] || [[File:Statue tentacles.png]] || [[File:Statue triangle.png]] || [[File:Statue twins.png]] || [[File:Statue wraith.png]]\n|}\n*[[File:gravestone.png]] '''Gravestones''' are generally found in special vaults or [[portal]] levels (like [[Zonguldrok's Shrine]]). If they show up in the main dungeon, it's a sure sign that the [[undead]] are wandering the level.\n{{crawlquote|A nameless grave.}}\n*[[File:Orcish idol.png]] '''[[Orcish idol]]s''' are like granite statues but are dedicated to the [[orc]] god [[Beogh]].\n{{crawlquote|An idol of the orc god Beogh.}}\n*[[File:Broken pillar 1.png]] [[File:Broken pillar 2.png]] [[File:Broken pillar 3.png]] [[File:Broken pillar 4.png]] [[File:Broken pillar 5.png]] [[File:Broken pillar 6.png]] '''Broken pillars''' are decorative, but no different than regular statues.\n{{crawlquote|A ruined and crumbled stone pillar.}}\n*[[File:Golden statue.png]] [[File:Golden statue 2.png]] '''Golden statues''' can be found in some vaults, most often ones containing an [[altar]] to [[Gozag Ym Sagoz]]. They are otherwise indistinguishable from granite statues.\n{{crawlquote|A solid gold statue of a saint.}}\n*[[File:Sarcophagus.png]] '''Sarcophagi''' can be found in [[The Tomb]], [[The Crypt]], and certain special levels. Normally, they behave like granite statues. One of the Crypt arrival vaults, '''grunt_crypt_arrival_guarded_gate''', has sarcophagi that release monsters, swarming unsuspecting players.\n{{crawlquote|An ancient sarcophagus.<br>It appears to be empty. OR It is sealed shut.}}\n*[[File:Elephant statue.png]] '''Elephant-shaped statues''' are inanimate lumps of stone occasionally found in the temple on the bottom floor of the [[Lair]]. They do nothing until you kill the [[anaconda]] in the back of the temple, at which point several of them will come to life and attack you as [[dire elephant]]s. Be sure to close [[door]]s behind you as you explore; this will ensure you only face a few of them at a time.\n{{crawlquote|This worn granite statue depicts an elephant standing guard.}}\n*'''Ruined idols''' are scattered around the few remaining structures in the [[Desolation of Salt]]. They are otherwise identical to granite statues.\n{{crawlquote|A monument to the glory of a dead god. The statue has been methodically defaced; not a single distinguishing feature remains.}}\n*[[File:Iron statue.png]] '''Iron statues''' are found only in the [[Iron City of Dis]], but are no different from other statues.\n{{crawlquote|A statue of an ancient warrior, festooned with trophies from fallen victims.

Most animate statues have considerable elemental resistance and/or immunity as well as complete immunity to magical effects. All can be worn down by physical damage from weapons or spells like [[Iron Shot]] or [[Orb of Destruction]]; as they are made of brittle substances, [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] and [[Shatter]] are particularly effective.\n\n{{monsterlink|Pillar of salt}}- The consecrated remains of an unfortunate demon or undead that suffered the wrath of [[Zin]]. Will crumble to nothing shortly.\n\n{{monsterlink|Block of ice}}- All that's left of a hapless creature that got in the way of a [[Glaciate]] or [[Absolute Zero]] spell; it will melt away in short order.\n\n{{monsterlink|Training dummy}}- A weak, fragile statue found only in the [[Tutorial]] and a few vaults.\n\n{{monsterlink|Charred statue}}- A statue that guards an altar to [[Vehumet]].

They summon in creatures found among the worst of the worst.\n\n{{monsterlink|Diamond obelisk}}- Surrounded by a constant [[Tornado]], these solid pieces of diamond are virtually indestructible.\n\n===Unique Statues===\n{{monsterlink|Roxanne}}- An [[Earth Elementalist]] who accidentally turned herself into a statue. She forces her opponents to [[Blink Other Close|blink into range]] of her powerful spells.\n\n{{LightRed|8}} [[File:Wucad mu statue.png]] '''The [[Wucad Mu's Monastery#Statue of Wucad Mu|Statue of Wucad Mu]]''' - An [[orange crystal statue]] carved into the likeness of the famed monk and placed in the center of his monastery.

Their presence [[Haunt|summoned ghosts]] to attack intruders. Removed in [[0.13]].\n\n==Other immobile monsters==\nCertain types of plants are immobile and may create movement exclusion zones when discovered, but unlike statues, they are not [[nonliving]]. See [[list of plants]] for more details.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], statues couldn't regenerate [[HP]].\n*Prior to [[0.22]], [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] could destroy mundane statues.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], [[wand of disintegration|wands of disintegration]] and [[Orb of Destruction]] could destroy mundane statues; [[wand of digging|wands of digging]] had no effect.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], statues weren't stabbable; obsidian & orange crystal statues had no sInv. Also, destroying orcish idols had a chance of causing Beogh to smite you.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], some hostile statues could be destroyed instantly with a wand of disintegration.\n\nPrevious versions had \"scorch marked granite statues\", which were statues in areas that would perpetually generate flame [[cloud]]s. The vaults containing the statues are still present, but the statues themselves are no longer distinguishable from other statues.\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

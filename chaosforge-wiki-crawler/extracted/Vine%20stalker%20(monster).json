{"title":"Vine stalker (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Vine_stalker_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n''This page is about the vine stalker [[monster]]. For the player race, see [[Vine Stalker]].''\n{{monster info|vine stalker}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Vine stalkers''' are hybrid plant creatures.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nLike most monsters based off of player [[species]], vine stalkers do not spawn naturally. If you see one, it's probably a shapeshifter. They may also spawn in decorative arrival or [[Pandemonium]] vaults.\n\nBe aware that vine stalkers regenerate more quickly than normal and have an [[antimagic]] bite, though neither are likely to matter much to characters that encounter one.\n\n==History==\nMonstrous vine stalkers were added in [[0.14]] along with the player race."}

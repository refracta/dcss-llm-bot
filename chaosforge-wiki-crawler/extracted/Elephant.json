{"title":"Elephant","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Elephant","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Elephants''' are massive creatures which commonly roam [[the Lair]] in packs. They have enough HP and AC to last a few hits, and their attack deals decent damage and knocks you back a square, making it very difficult to escape via [[stairs]]. They can't knock you into [[lava]] or [[deep water]] this way, but that's small comfort after you've been trampled. They're still much weaker than their vicious cousins, the bloodthirsty [[dire elephant]] and the downright evil [[hellephant]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you can kill a [[yak]], then this creature shouldn't give you much more trouble. Fight them in corridors to keep the pack from surrounding you, and try not to stand at the last tile of the hallway or you'll be pushed out into the open.\n**Fighting with a [[wall]], [[plant]], or other creature behind you will keep you from getting shoved backwards.\n*Note that even though elephants are not immune to poison, their relatively high HD makes them less likely than yaks to be confused by [[Mephitic Cloud]] unless you manage to keep them in the cloud for a few turns. [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] works just fine, however.\n*Elephants are one of the first monsters you'll see that are large enough to safely wade through [[deep water]]. Don't count on any nearby lakes or rivers keeping them away from you.\n\n==History==\nElephants were added in [[0.7]]."}

{"title":"Water nymph","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Water_nymph","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Water nymphs''' are amphibious creatures who force their prey into [[water]] before drowning them. Their [[Waterstrike]] spell deals heavy, [[smite-targeted]] damage to anything in or flying above [[water]]. They are found in the [[Shoals]].\n\nWater nymphs have an aura of [[shallow water]] around them, with a radius of 1 tile. This aura can take a bit to catch up.\n\nThey also have a teleport ability, thematically \"flowing with the water\". Every turn, they have a 20% chance to teleport to a water tile. This must be closer to the player, and at least 3 tiles away from its current position.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-abil.cc|1039}}</ref>\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Nymphs are a serious threat, especially at low HP. Waterstrike is as strong as [[damnation]], and thrice as strong as [[Smiting]]. While this spell checks [[AC]], and can only damage those on water, you should treat it like you would a monster with [[Call Down Damnation]]. When you're slowly wading in water, 1 misstep can cause you to take 102 damage, which really stings.\n*Nymphs can also cover the stairs with water, making it impossible to retreat up. This significantly raises the risk of any encounter involving them.\n*They are spellcasters, so [[Silence]] prevents Waterstrike from working. They have high [[willpower]], but don't resist poison, so [[Mephitic Cloud]] can also disable their casting. They can't [[see invisible]], so ''as long as you are also [[flying]]'', invisibility makes it much less likely for you to be targeted. (Invisible creatures are revealed by water if not flying.)\n*Like many creatures in the Shoals, fire is effective due to the [[steam]] it creates. Even a [[wand of flame]] can work; nymphs aren't particularly durable, so a few puffs of flame are enough to kill. Dedicated [[Fire Magic]], of course, works like a charm.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], water nymphs could [[see invisible]] and were explicitly female.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], water nymphs had more health (base 50 HP).\n*Water nymphs were added in [[0.14]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

{"title":"Avatar Song","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Avatar_Song","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Sings a powerfully haunting song; in addition to making nearby victims unwilling to move away from the singer, it calls forth drowned souls from any nearby bodies of deep water.}}\n\n'''Avatar Song''' is a monster-only spell that attempts to [[mesmerise]] the player. Mesmerise prevents the player from intentionally moving away from the singer, and prevents [[berserk]]. In addition, Avatar Song gradually pulls the target towards the caster, and creates [[drowned soul]]s that inflict [[drowning]] damage. The mesmerise effect can be blocked by [[willpower]], but requires no line of fire.\n\nIf you are immune to mesmerise (e.g. via [[clarity]]) or beat mesmerise through willpower, Avatar Song will still create drowned souls. Disabling the caster (e.g. with [[confusion]]) ends the effect entirely.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.20]], you could break out of the spell by making a sufficiently loud noise (such as from a [[scroll of noise]]).\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

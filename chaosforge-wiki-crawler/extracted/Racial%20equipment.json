{"title":"Racial equipment","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Racial_equipment","type":"raw","data":"{{Obsolete}}\nEquipment can have various race variants: Dwarven, Elven, Orcish, or Demonic.\n\n==Dwarven==\nDwarves do slightly more damage with dwarven weapons. Dwarven weapons also have a 50% chance each of getting +1 to hit and to damage.\n\nDwarven armour provides better protection when worn by any [[species]], though its added weight impedes spellcasting more than usual. Dwarves are protected even further, and they do not receive the additional spellcasting penalty.\n\nIn addition, all dwarven equipment is more resistant to corrosion than normal, providing an innate 80% chance to resist corrosion on top of any enchantment bonuses. \n\n==Elven==\nElven weapons are more accurate when wielded by elves. They also have a better chance of starting with up to +2 to-hit enchantment.\n\nElven armour is lighter than usual, so it impedes spellcasting less than other types of armour when worn by any species. Elven [[cloak]]s and [[boots]] also grant a small bonus to [[stealth]]. Elven armour also grants increased protection when worn by elves.\n\n==Orcish==\nOrcish weapons give damage bonuses to [[hill orc]]s who wield them, which is increased even further for followers of [[Beogh]] (damage bonus increases with [[piety]]). They have a 50% chance of getting -1 to hit, and a 50% chance of getting +1 to damage.\n\nOrcish armour grants better protection and reduced spell failure, but only when worn by hill orcs. Followers of Beogh get even more AC, depending on their piety.\n\n==Demonic==\nThe only types of demonic equipment are weapons: [[demon blade]]s, [[demon trident]]s, and [[demon whip]]s. They are not true variants, but are instead their own types of weapon. [[Demonspawn]] deal slightly more damage with demonic weaponry.\n\n==History==\nRacial variants were removed in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete]]"}

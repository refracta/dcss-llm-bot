{"title":"Ring of sustain attributes","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ring_of_sustain_attributes","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{item\n |itemtype=Jewellery\n |name=Ring of sustain attributes\n |cost= 175\n}}\n\n{{flavour|This ring protects its wearer from the loss of their strength, dexterity and intelligence.}}\n\nThe '''ring of sustain attributes''' cuts any temporary loss of [[stats]] in half, rounding down. Note that most sources of stat loss cause you to lose a single point, so this ring completely negates those (e.g. [[sickness]] and the [[Bad mutations#Deterioration|Deterioration mutation]]).\n\nThis ring does '''not''' affect stat loss directly from [[mutation]]s, which are permanent.\n\n==Strategy==\nTemporary stat loss is restored as you gain [[XP]]. Most characters can easily recover from stat drain by killing monsters. However, characters with at least 1 low stat ([[Berserk]]ers, [[Deep Elf]] [[Wizard]]s...) are at risk of [[stat zero]]. Sustain attributes can help avoid this lethal status when fighting stat-draining monsters. \n\nYou'll receive far more stat drain in [[the Tomb]] ([[death curse]]s) and [[Hell]]s ([[Hell's mystical force]]). It's important to watch your stat levels when visiting these branches, putting on sustain attributes as necessary. Even if you aren't at risk of stat zero, losing stats will reduce your effectiveness in combat. Sustained attributes can also be useful if you're using a [[crystal ball of energy]] or the [[staff of Wucad Mu]].\n\n==History==\n*Sustain attributes were removed in [[0.19]]. Temporary stat losses were reduced to compensate.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], this item was called a ''' ring of sustain abilities'''.\n*Prior to [[0.15]] you received a cumulative effect for wearing two rings, reducing stat loss by 75%, thus entirely negating all stat damage dealt in increments of 3 or less.\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

Its damage partially bypasses armour.}}\n'''Orb of Electricity''' is a monster-only spell that hurls a crackling orb of [[electricity]], which explodes (5x5 area) with immense force on impact. As BEAM_ELEC damage, it ignores 1/2 of the target's [[AC]].\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nAlso, [[Asterion]] can hurl orbs of electricity by using the [[Major Destruction]] ability.\n\n==Player Version==\nBlack [[Draconian]]s can create orbs of electricity with their [[Breathe Lightning]] ability.\n\nAdditionally, [[Makhleb]] and [[Vehumet]] can throw orbs of electricity at disloyal followers as a part of their [[divine retribution]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], [[Makhleb]]'s Major Destruction ability could let players use this spell.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], evoking a [[disc of storms]] would provide a similar ability.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], drawing the [[Spark card]] from a [[deck of destruction]] at power level 2 (legendary deck) could cast this ability.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], this spell was named '''Orb of Electrocution'''.\n*Orb of Electrocution was a level 7 [[Conjurations]]/[[Air Magic]] spell, which was replaced with [[Chain Lightning]] way back in [[0.1]]. However, the game still has many ways to invoke electric orbs.\n\n[[Category:Spells]][[Category:Conjurations]][[Category:Air Magic]][[Category:Level 7 Spells]]"}

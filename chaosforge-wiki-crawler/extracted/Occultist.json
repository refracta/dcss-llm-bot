{"title":"Occultist","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Occultist","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Occultists''' are spell casters who can roast you with Fireballs or banish you into the [[Abyss]]. Fortunately, they are flimsy. They can be found in late [[Dungeon]] and [[Depths]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Occultists can deal high damage, but they aren't too [[ev]]asive, cannot [[see invisible]], and don't have much [[willpower]].\n*[[Banishment]] requires line of fire, and can be defeated by high enough [[willpower]] of your own. Fire resistance is helpful to defend against [[Fireball]]s, too.\n*A [[silence]]d or [[waterlog]]ged occultist can only do weak melee attacks.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], occultists were added to the game, split off from [[wizard (monster)|wizards]]. \n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

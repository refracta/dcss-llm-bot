It usually lives near water, and is an able swimmer.\n----\n“The latter lived in the country, and before his house there was an oak, in which there was a lair of snakes. His servants killed the snakes, but Melampus gathered wood and burnt the reptiles, and reared the young ones. And when the young were full grown, they stood beside him at each of his shoulders as he slept, and they purged his ears with their tongues. He started up in a great fright, but understood the voices of the birds flying overhead, and from what he learned from them he foretold to men what should come to pass.”<br>\n-Pseudo-Apollodorus , _Library and Epitome_, 1.9.11. circa 150 BC.<br>\ntrans. Sir James George Frazer, 1913.<br>\n<br>\n“A snake, with mottles rare,<br>\nSurveyed my chamber floor,<br>\nIn feature as the worm before,<br>\nBut ringed with power.”<br>\n-Emily Dickinson, “In Winter In My Room”. circa 1860.}}\n<!--monster-bot-end-->\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Water moccasins''' are larger, stronger, and faster than [[adder]]s, but are otherwise similar. They are fast monsters that inflict [[poison]] with their bites. They commonly appear in [[the Lair]] and [[the Snake Pits]], and may appear around mid-[[Dungeon]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Ideally, you should be equipped to survive poison by the time you encounter them. If you find yourself having difficulty handling moccasins, be wary of the Lair, as [[black mamba]]s are far, far deadlier.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.6]], water moccasins were called '''brown snakes'''."}

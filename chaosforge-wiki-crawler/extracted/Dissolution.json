{"title":"Dissolution","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dissolution","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{list of | jellies}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Dissolution, High Priest of Jiyva''' is a [[unique]], intelligent [[list of jellies|jelly]] that burrows through rock. If you hear a \"sizzling sound\", then you know Dissolution is somewhere nearby.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Slime Pits]]:2-5\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*They hit as hard as [[the Royal Jelly]], although at a considerably slower speed. More dangerously, they can cast [[Summon Eyeballs]], bringing forth monsters to [[paralyze]] you, [[mutate]] you, and drain your MP. Make sure to have a means of clearing the eyes quickly if you decide to confront Dissolution ([[Yara's Violent Unravelling]], [[Ignition]], [[Fire Storm]]).\n**Paralysis is the biggest concern, but is unfortunately also the hardest to avoid -- only [[Formicid]]s can resist the gaze of [[floating eye]]s. If possible, use area-of-effect spells to damage both the eyeballs and Dissolution at the same time.\n**Avoiding the mutations can be done by confronting Dissolution in [[Necromutation|lichform]], as a follower of [[Zin]], or with summoned allies blocking the [[shining eye]]s' line of effect.\n*Taking Dissolution out without these preparations is possible if you do it quickly enough; a [[berserk]]er that manages to get into melee quickly can often tear them apart in a few turns if all goes well. This approach definitely has potential to end badly, however. Assuming you don't encounter Dissolution on the last floor of the Slime Pits, you should minimize the time it takes to reach them with a [[scroll of blinking]].\n*The disconnected structure of the Slime Pits means that Dissolution can often be easy to avoid. Don't explore every part of the floor, since there's no loot to be had, and if you hear a sizzling sound, try to leave the level as quickly as possible.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Dissolution is a devout worshipper, but not a burbling mass of conciousness like [[The Royal Jelly]], and therefore unable to sustain a god alone. So when TRJ (thus, [[Jiyva]]) dies, Dissolution's Summon Eyeballs spell is replaced with a unique set of [[cantrip]]s.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.28]], Dissolution recieved special behavior when Jiyva dies.\n*Dissolution was considered male before version [[0.24]]."}

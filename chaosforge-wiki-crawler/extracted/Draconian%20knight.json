{"title":"Draconian knight","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Draconian_knight","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{list of | draconians}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Draconian knights''' are similar to [[deep elf knight]]s, but with more dangerous spells. They are lightly armored fighters who wield heavy weaponry and occasionally shields, supplemented with the ability to cast powerful [[Conjuration]]s. Knights are typically generated as [[black draconian]]s, who can fire a [[Lightning Bolt]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*In spite of the flavour text, draconian knights are neither especially competent with their weapons or armoured beyond the usual draconian cloak. Their spells, however, are potent enough to be a concern (though less so than any of the pure draconian casters). The difficulty of this foe depends mainly on its breath weapon (determined by its colour) and its randomly-selected spell set.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], classed draconians could randomly generate with varying colours.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], they could cast [[Ozocubu's Armour]], but had a higher base AC to compensate.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], draconian knights had a wider variety of spell sets, with less focus on [[Ice Magic]] and [[Necromancy]]. Specifically they could have the sets of [[hell knight]]s, [[deep elf conjurer]]s, or [[Necromancer_(monster)|necromancers]]."}

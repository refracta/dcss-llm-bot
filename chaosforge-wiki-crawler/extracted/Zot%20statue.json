One thing is certain: it is profoundly disturbing.}}\n<!--monster-bot-end-->\n\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Zot statues''' are immensely powerful statues that appear at the end of the [[Sprint]] variant \"The Ten Rune Challenge.\"  They have high HP, are resistant or immune to all elements, and possess a very nasty spell set.\n\n<!--spl-bot-begin-->\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster4\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Summon Eyeballs]]\n|flags1={{Magical slot flag}}\n|slot2=[[Malmutate]]\n|flags2={{Magical slot flag}}\n|slot3=[[Haste]]\n|flags3={{Magical slot flag}}\n|slot4=[[Shadow Creatures]]\n|flags4={{Magical slot flag}}\n}}\n{{clear}}\n<!--spl-bot-end-->\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Zot statues can't actually haste themselves, because they are [[stationary]] monsters. And since they don't know [[Haste Other]], they can't haste their allies either.\n*Their [[Shadow Creatures]] spell is especially strong because it will only generate [[Orb Guardian]]s and [[moths of wrath]].\n*[[Mass Abjuration]] is good for dealing with the summons in general. There is not much space around the statue, so summoning your own monsters is also a good way to stop it from summoning.\n*Having [[stasis]] will protect you from being paralyzed by the eyes it will summon, while [[resist mutation]] can help against the Malmutate spells being fired from both the statue and any [[shining eye]]s it may summon, as well as the [[mutagenic fog]].\n\n[[Category:Vault-only monsters]]"}

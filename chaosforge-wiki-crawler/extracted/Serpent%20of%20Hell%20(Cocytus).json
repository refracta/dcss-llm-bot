{"title":"Serpent of Hell (Cocytus)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Serpent_of_Hell_(Cocytus)","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | dragons}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe '''Serpent of Hell''' is a [[unique]] dragon whose elemental affinity varies based on which branch of [[Hell]] you encounter it in. When faced in [[Cocytus]], the Serpent is capable of breathing bitter [[cold]] at you. It is also entirely immune to cold damage itself.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you brought enough [[cold]] resistance to endure the other threats in Cocytus, the Serpent of Hell here should pose you little threat. All of its special abilities are largely negated by rC++ or higher, and it isn't especially durable otherwise.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|this Serpent of Hell will have an extra 43 HP.}}\n*In [[0.16]], it lost [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]] in favor of [[Freezing Cloud]] and [[Flash Freeze]].\n*Prior to [[0.11]], this Serpent of Hell had Freezing Cloud instead of [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]]."}

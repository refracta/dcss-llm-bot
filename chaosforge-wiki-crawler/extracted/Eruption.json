Lava from this spell can be used to cast [[Pyroclastic Surge]]. The lava creation works identically as [[Upheaval]] - each empty tile around you has a chance to become a lava tile.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Eruption was 45% irresistible (45% physical, 55% fire).\n*Eruption was added in [[0.28]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

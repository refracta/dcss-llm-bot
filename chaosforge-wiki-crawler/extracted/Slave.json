However, its magical enslavement lasts only as long as its master does, and it would surely appreciate being freed.\n----\n“Who rebels? Who rises in arms? Rarely the slave, but almost always the oppressor turned slave.”<br>\n-E.M. Cioran, _History and Utopia_. 1960.}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nThe [[unique]] [[big kobold]] [[Pikel]] is accompanied by several human [[slave]]s that give no experience, items, or corpses when killed.\n\n[[File:Slave freed.png]] They will become neutral '''freed slaves''' when Pikel dies, so you may want to avoid fighting them.\n{{Flavour|A human who has just been released from magical enslavement. It tries to stand proudly before you, despite its lingering fear and unkempt appearance.}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Check out [[Pikel]]'s page for tips.\n*Slaves can be dangerous for a low-level character. In general, try not to let them come at you in a mob; they're pretty strong even individually. If you can get Pikel away from his slaves, he's ''much'' easier to kill.\n**Fortunately, Pikel will move past his slaves to attack you, so if you can just lure the lot into a corridor, isolating Pikel will be relatively simple.\n*After they become neutral, they will fight any hostile monsters they encounter, whether or not you are present. You will not get experience for their kills. This can be a problem when you wanted corpses or experience, as the full set can clear out most of the level for you.\n**Of course, the amount of experience provided by a single floor in the early [[Dungeon]] is fairly insignificant in the long run, so it's probably not worth worrying about.\n\n==History==\n*Pikel's slaves were replaced with [[lemure]]s in [[0.26]].\n*Prior to [[0.24]], dead slaves would drop [[corpse]]s, [[animal skin]]s, and experience.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

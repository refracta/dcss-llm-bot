For the defunct spell school with those effects, see [[Enchantments]].''\n{{flavour|Weapons can be enchanted; when you first identify them, you reveal values which tell you how much more effective they are than an unenchanted version. Weapons which are not enchanted are simply '+0'.\n\nMost armours can be improved by reading the appropriate scroll. Body armour and bardings can be enchanted up to the base value of AC they provide. Shields can be enchanted up to +3, +5, or +8, depending on their size. Other gear is limited to +2.}}\n\nArmour, weapons and shields may have '''enchantments'''. For example, a +7 [[broad axe]] has an enchantment of +7. Each enchant, or \"plus\", adds +1 to a specific stat:\n\n*A '''[[scroll of enchant armour]]''' enchants armour and shields.\n**[[Armour]] gain 1 [[AC]] per enchantment, increasing the maximum AC roll by 1.\n**[[Shield]]s gain 1 [[SH]] per enchantment, increasing the chance to block.\n*A '''[[scroll of enchant weapon]]''' enchants weapons.\n**[[Weapon]]s gain +1 [[slaying]] per enchantment, increasing both [[to-hit]] and maximum damage by 1. \n\n[[Ring]]s may also display an enchant value, but except for a unique [[shop]] [[vault]], they will always be either +4, +5, or +6, depending on the stat of the ring. They can not be enchanted further. [[Artefact]]s come with a random enchantment value and can not be enchanted further.\n\nThis is not to be confused with [[brand]]s or [[ego]]s (e.g. broad axe of [[flaming]]).\n\n===Enchantment Limit===\nAll enchantable items have a maximum that they can be naturally enchanted:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! colspan=2 | Maximum Enchantment Levels\n|-\n| [[Weapon]] || +9\n|-\n| [[Body armour]] || +([[Body armour|Armour's base AC]])<br>0 for [[quicksilver dragon scales]]\n|-\n| [[Barding]] || +4\n|-\n| [[Shields]] || +3 for [[Buckler]]s, +5 for [[Kite shield]]s<br>+8 for [[Tower shield]]s\n|-\n| All other armour || +2\n|}\n\nNon-artefact weapons (namely the [[club]]s of [[Killer Klown]]s) can rarely generate with an enchantment level that is higher than the normal limit.\n\n[[Artefact]]s are not bound to these limits and may be \"overenchanted\". Enchantment level ''can'' be negative, though items do not normally generate with a negative enchantment. Artefacts can be negatively enchanted, as well as items from very specific sources (such as the [[Cinder Acolyte]] background).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]]'s removal of [[curse]]s, negative enchantments used to be a lot more common (on cursed items).\n*Prior to [[0.25]], stat boosting rings could naturally spawn with an enchantment from 2 to 6, positive or negative. An [[amulet of reflection]] varied in the same way, though was always positive.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], weapons had a seperate to-hit enchant and damage enchant (e.g. +8,+6 broad axe). A scroll of enchant weapon I increased the former, a scroll of enchant wepaon II for the latter, and a scroll of enchant weapon III increased both twice."}

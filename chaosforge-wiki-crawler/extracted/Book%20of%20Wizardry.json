Mages of a scholarly nature consider it a point of pride to have contributed in some way to this work, though more than a few of them have been slain by jealous rivals using their own spells against them.}}\n\nMost spells in this book require much training before they can be effectively cast. [[Haste]] is valuable to almost any character, while everything else here can be extremely useful to someone. [[Agony]] is an excellent damage source for [[Necromancy]]-specialists, [[Invisibility]] is wonderful for [[short blades]]-wielding [[stab]]bers, and [[Spellforged Servitor]] is a phenomenal damage booster for those who rely on [[Conjurations]].\n\n==Spells==\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

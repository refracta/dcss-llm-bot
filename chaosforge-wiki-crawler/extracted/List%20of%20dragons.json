The [[draconian]] race is closely related to them, though this genetic similarity does not make these beasts any more amicable. While dragons vary wildly in their strengths and weaknesses, they are all susceptible to weapons of [[dragon slaying]] (currently limited to the artefact lance [[Wyrmbane]]), and some of them have other vulnerabilities.\n\nDespite their outward similarities, [[wyvern]]s and [[hydra]]s are not true dragons and are instead considered [[List of reptiles and amphibians|reptiles]].\n\n==Dragon Types==\n{{monsterlink|Steam dragon}}- The smallest of the dragons, steam dragons breathe scalding [[steam]] to blind prey.\n\n{{monsterlink|Acid dragon}}- A tiny dragon that sprays corrosive [[acid]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Swamp dragon}}- A smallish dragon which bellows [[poison]] fumes at its prey.\n\n{{monsterlink|Fire dragon}}- The archetypal fire-breathing dragon, these creatures are quite powerful but are also weak to cold.\n\n{{monsterlink|Ice dragon}}- Slightly smaller than their fire-breathing cousins, ice dragons breathe powerful frost breath and are vulnerable to fire.\n\n{{monsterlink|Storm dragon}}- Fast, strong, and armed with lightning breath, storm dragons are one of the more powerful members of dragonkind.\n\n{{monsterlink|Quicksilver dragon}}- Slight and swift, these terrors breathe devastating irresistible energies, making them more feared than many of their larger cousins.\n\n{{monsterlink|Shadow dragon}}- While their claws and teeth are dangerous enough, shadow dragon breath withers even powerful characters with [[draining]] negative energy.\n\n{{monsterlink|Iron dragon}}- Made of living iron, these dragons are slow and unable to fly. They make up for it with lethal metal shard breath and immense durability.\n\n{{monsterlink|Pearl dragon}}- A proud and noble dragon with breath of holy fire. They are a symbol of the undaunted heroic spirit and an inspiration to young heroes that they ''can'' in fact make it all the way to the [[Orb of Zot]]. That doesn't mean they won't still eat you.\n\n{{monsterlink|Bone dragon}}- Cobbled together from the skeletons of others, these \"dragons\" lack most draconic powers but are phenomenally strong all the same.\n\n{{monsterlink|Golden dragon}}- The kings of all dragons, golden dragons can breathe and resist multiple elements. Despite this, they are hunted for the phenomenal hides they produce.\n\n===Drakes===\nDiminutive cousins of dragons, don't be fooled by drakes' (relatively) small statures: they come with a wide variety of dangerous abilities, and can be just as deadly as many of their larger cousins.\n\n{{monsterlink|Rime drake}} - A miniature ice dragon which breathes [[Flash Freeze|slowing blasts of icy breath]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Swamp drake}} - A miniature swamp dragon. Although it lacks the venom of its larger cousins, its noxious breath causes [[confusion]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Death drake}} - A miniature shadow dragon, rife with corruption and capable of breathing [[miasma]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Lindwurm}} - A strange, flightless dragon with potent fire breath, though still no match for an actual fire dragon.\n\n{{monsterlink|Wind drake}} - A sea-dwelling dragon that breathes blasts of piercing winds and can [[Airstrike|swat prey out of the air]].\n\n===Unique Dragons===\n{{LightCyan|D}} [[Image:Bai Suzhen (dragon).png]] '''[[Bai Suzhen#Dragon Form|Bai Suzhen]]''' - She first appears as a [[list of draconians|draconian]], but make her angry enough and she'll reveal her true form: a dragon with watery breath, surrounded by a constant thunderstorm.\n\n{{monsterlink|Xtahua}}- An ancient and powerful fire dragon whose breath leaves lingering flames. Beware their [[paralyse|paralysing]] roars!\n\n{{Red|D}} [[Image:Serpent of Hell (Gehenna).png]][[Image:Serpent of Hell (Cocytus).png]][[Image:Serpent of Hell (Tartarus).png]][[Image:Serpent of Hell (Dis).png]] '''[[Serpent of Hell]]''' - A three-headed [[demon]]ic dragon found deep in one of the four [[Hell]]s.\n\n===Retired Dragons===\n{{monsterlink|Fire drake}} - A miniature dragon capable of spitting gouts of fire. Replaced with [[Rime drake]]s in [[0.18]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Mottled dragon}}- A tiny dragon with a mouth full of [[Sticky Flame|napalm]]. Replaced with [[acid dragon]]s in [[0.20]].\n\n==Dragon Scales==\n{{flavour|\"His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.\"\n\n-KJV Bible, Job 41:15-17.}}\n\nIn spite of the risk involved, slaying most dragons can prove extremely rewarding. Upon killing a dragon, there is a 33% chance for you to find an intact set of scales which can be used as armour. The different types of dragon scales grant a wide array of resistances and levels of protection and have the added benefit of being able to fit almost any species regardless of size -- [[ogre]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[spriggan]]s will almost certainly want to seek out some dragon scales at some point. You can also occasionally find dragon scales in [[shop]]s, lying around the Dungeon floor, or as a [[god]] gift from [[Okawaru]]. While dragon scales can never have [[ego]]s, they can be [[artefact]]s.\n\n*[[File:Steam_dragon_armour.png]] '''[[Steam dragon scales]]:''' An extremely light yet somewhat durable suit of armour, often used by casters or stabbers.

Also, they were called dragon armour.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the [[dragon slaying]] brand was available for all [[polearms]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], fire dragons were simply called \"dragons\".\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

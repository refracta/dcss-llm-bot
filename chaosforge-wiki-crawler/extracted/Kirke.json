{"title":"Kirke","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Kirke","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Kirke, Weaver of Myths''' is an unusual [[unique]] sorceress who travels with a band of [[hog]]s, and would very much like you to join them! She casts several dangerous [[Hexes]], including one unique spell which turns you into a [[Pig Form|pig]], and calls various mythical beasts into existence to aid her in combat.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:12-15\n*[[The Lair]]:4-6\n*The [[Elven Halls]]:1\n*[[The Swamp]]\n*[[The Snake Pit]]\n*[[The Shoals]]\n*The [[Spider's Nest]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Kirke's most dangerous abilities all check [[willpower]]. Will+++ brings her Hexes to single-digit success rates. \n*Even if you got willpower, her summons are quite threatening. [[Lindwurm]]s have fairly strong fire breaths, [[manticore]] barbs make it painful to flee on foot, and a [[sphinx]]'s [[paralyse]] is even more devastating than Porkalator. These monsters become extra dangerous if you're a pig.\n*Make sure you have an escape plan lined up before fighting Kirke. Pig Form moves quickly, but a [[slow]]ed player in Pig Form remains slower than normal. Fortunately, [[scrolls of teleportation]] work as normal.\n**If you've got one, drinking a [[potion of cancellation]] will instantly snap you out of Pig Form.\n**Entering [[Tree Form]] technically gives immunity to Pig Form. However, if she summons too many deadly threats, entering Tree Form may as well be a death sentence.\n**Should you get turned into a hog yourself, your best bet is usually to flee, as pigs are unable to use weapons, armour, or spells. [[Unarmed Combat]] specialists may be tempted to continue fighting, but your damage output will be severely reduced, so don't try it. \n**[[Wand]]s and [[Invocation]]s still function in Pig Form; if Kirke's almost dead and you've got a good way to do damage, you might still be able to take her out. Strongly consider reading a scroll of teleportation before making the attempt, just in case things go sour faster than you anticipated.\n*Her hogs can deal decent damage, but are a lesser threat than Kirke herself.\n*Having [[see invisible]] helps, as she can turn herself invisible.\n*[[Silence]] or [[Phial of floods|waterlogging]] will shut down Kirke's spellcasting abilities entirely, at which point you can just take her out in melee. She's no threat there, though any allies she's already summoned will still be trouble.\n\n==Trivia==\nKirke is an alternate spelling of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circe Circe], a beautiful Greek goddess of magic who used potions to turn her enemies into pigs.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Monstrous Menagerie could spawn [[harpies]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Kirke also knew [[Corona]] and [[Deflect Missiles]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Kirke knew [[Summon Ugly Thing]] in place of Monstrous Menagerie.\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

They are shown when you press %:\n\n* [[Resistance]]s to [[fire resistance|fire]], [[cold resistance|cold]], [[poison resistance|poison]], [[electricity resistance|electricity]], [[corrosion resistance|corrosion]] and [[negative energy resistance|negative energy]]. These are all obtained from [[ring]]s (except rElec) and particular [[dragon scales]], and can all be found on artefact armour, weapons and jewellery. All except rN are given from a [[potion of resistance]].\n\n* [[Willpower]] stops you from being affected by enemy Hexes, and can be found on rings and armour as well as artefacts and [[quicksilver dragon scales]]. All races gain some amount of innate will, ranging from 3 will per XL for most races to 7 will per XL for [[spriggan]]s - enough to make them virtually immune to all hexes (\"hostile enchantments\") by XL 27 without any external equipment.\n\n* [[Spirit shield]] means that external damage sources will subtract proportionally from both your [[MP]] and your [[HP]]. Once MP has been exhausted, you will suffer damage as normal. It is obtained from an [[amulet of guardian spirit]], amulet [[randart]]s, and a few [[unrandart]]s.\n\n* [[See invisible]] means that you can see [[invisible]] monsters.  It is obtained from several mutations: [[Good_mutations#Acute Vision|Acute Vision]], [[Antennae|Antennae 3]], or [[Jiyva]]'s [[Jiyva_mutations#Eyeballs|Eyeballs 3]]; being a worshiper of [[Ashenzari]], from some [[randart]]s, or by wearing a [[ring of see invisible]] or a headgear of see invisible. [[Naga]]s, [[spriggan]]s, [[vampire]]s, [[felid]]s, and [[palentonga]]s start with this intrinsic.\n\n* [[Clarity]] means that you cannot be unwillingly [[confusion|confused]], [[mesmerise]]d or [[berserk]]ed.  It is obtained as a [[Good_mutations#Clarity|mutation]], being a worshiper of [[Ashenzari]], or through a couple of specific [[unrandarts]]. \n\n* Some [[mutations]] and [[artefact]] properties give other bad intrinsics: notably [[teleportitis]] or *Tele, -Tele (also intrinsic to [[formicid]]s through [[stasis]]), [[berserk (mutation)|berserkitis]] or *Rage, and -Cast, which randomly teleport the player next to monsters from time to time, stop the player from translocating at all, give the player a chance to go [[berserk]] on every attack, and stop the player from casting spells, respectively.\n\n* HP regeneration rate can be affected by higher max [[HP]] and the regeneration intrinsic, found as a mutation and a property found on [[amulet]]s and [[artefacts]]. MP regeneration rate is similarly affected by higher max [[MP]], but also from the [[amulet of magic regeneration]] and artefact amulets.\n\n==History==\nOver time, the available intrinsics have varied dramatically:\n\n*[[Rot]] (and resistance to it) were removed in [[0.26]]. Prior to 0.26, willpower was known as magic resistance.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], a [[ring of sustain attributes]] existed, granting the [[sustain attributes]] intrinsic.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], rCorr was available through an amulet instead of a ring, and amulets of [[resist mutation]], [[stasis]], [[clarity]] and [[warding]], which made these intrinsics not readily available (or in the case of warding completely unavailable). \n*Prior to [[0.17]], [[controlled teleport]] was an intrinsic which determined the location of an otherwise random [[teleport]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], [[saprovore]] and [[conservation]] intrinsics existed.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], [[controlled flight]] and [[levitation]] existed, intrinsics which were simplified into regular [[flight]].\n\n[[Category:Stats]]\n[[Category:Intrinsic]]"}

You'll gain the following:\n\n'''Combat'''\n*'''HP Bonus:''' +50%\n*'''Innate AC:''' 16 AC <ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|form-data.h|128}}</ref>\n*'''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' 38 base damage (32 + 6 from [[Claws]] 3)\n* Two '''[[auxiliary attacks]]''': Bite 5 (11 dmg) & Tail slap 3 (6 dmg).\n*'''[[Breathe Fire]]:''' Active ability. Launch a piercing, range-5 bolt of fire, creating a [[flame cloud]] where it lands. No cost, but has a [[Breath|cooldown]] of a few turns. Damage = <code>3d(4 + 2*[[XL]]/3)</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|ability.cc|742}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|zap-data.h|999}}</ref>\n*'''Stat Bonus:''' +10 [[strength]].\n\n'''Resistances'''\n*[[Fire resistance|rF++]]\n*[[Cold resistance|rC-]]\n*[[Poison resistance|rPois]]\n*Innate [[flight]]\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n*'''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' All [[armour]], [[weapon]] and [[shield]]. (only [[ring]]s and [[amulet]] remain)\n*'''Other Restrictions:''' Cannot [[throw]].\n\n'''Other'''\n*Dragon Form is '''[[Size#Giant|Giant]]'''-sized. This gives a penalty to [[EV]], but you are resistant to [[trample|trampling]], [[constriction]], and [[net]]s.\n*Suppresses many mutations. Species [[movement speed]] set to 10.\n*Claws 3 severs [[hydra]] heads.\n\n===Draconians===\nIf you are a [[Draconian]], Dragon Form has special bonuses:\n\n*The AC bonus from draconian scales is added to Dragon Form.\n*You retain your natural [[draconian breath weapon|breath weapon]] (or lack thereof) instead of Breathe Fire. Additionally, your breath weapon is boosted in power.\n*Instead of gaining rF++ and rC-, you retain your natural elemental resistances (or lack thereof). Red and white draconians gain rF++/rC- and rF-/rC++, respectively. You still get rPois, no matter the colour.\n\n==Strategy==\nDragon Form should be treated as the 'glass cannon' of Transmutation spells, much less durable than the +50% HP would make you think. The reduction to [[EV]] from size, lack of [[shield]], loss of all [[armour]] slots, and relatively low [[AC]] (compared to [[Statue Form]] or a heavy armour character) seriously lowers your survivability. The vulnerability to [[silver]] doesn't help things.\n\nThat being said: with 38 base damage, 2 [[aux attack]]s, and added strength, you hit like a truck. Using Dragon Form at 0 Unarmed skill means you hit harder than a character at 27 skill. Extra flame breaths don't hurt. Since Dragon Form is so strong at base, you don't need to train much UC to effectively fight in this spell. Overall, this spell can become a powerful killing tool, assuming you don't overestimate yourself.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Unlike many other transmutations, Dragon Form does not impede spellcasting, beyond the inability to wield [[staves]] or [[Archmagi]]. You can use support spells or attack magically however you please.\n**Support magic, like [[Ozocubu's Armour]] or [[Vhi's Electric Charge]], can be very useful to have. Since you're using Unarmed Combat, [[Manifold Assault]] only hits 1/2 targets, but it can still be worth using.\n*Don't forget about the fire breath, a free, moderately powerful ranged attack. It creates a [[flame cloud]] on landing; aim with '''f .''' to place the cloud on a specific enemy. Using flame breath at melee range means your enemy will be stuck inside the cloud for a while.\n*If you can manage to get Dragon Form castable by the time you are ready to take on the various [[Lair]] sub-branches, its ability to fly and resistance to poison can prove quite helpful. Just watch out for [[silver]] [[javelin]]s in [[the Shoals]] (and [[Throw Icicle]] from [[merfolk aquamancer|aquamancers]], if you are vulnerable to cold).\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

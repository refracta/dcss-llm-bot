{"title":"Ammunition","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ammunition","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n'''Ammunition''' is a finite amount of items which are then fired for [[ranged combat]]. Ammo as a concept is limited to [[Throwing]] items; other [[ranged weapon]]s have infinite ammo. \n\n==Useful Info==\nAmmo can be fired with the '''f''' key. Throwing does not require a wielded item to use. Items thrown may then be recovered for future use, though items that fall into [[lava]] are lost, and items in [[deep water]] can only be recovered by an [[amphibious]] species. Items will stop where it hits a monster (if the projectile can only hit one monster),  a location you specified via ('''f .'''), or at the end of [[LOS]]. [[Boomerang]]s return, so will be placed back in your inventory.\n\nMonsters are not limited by ammo, with the sole exception of [[throwing net]]s.\n\n===Mulching===\n''Main Article: [[Mulch]]''\n\nAmmunition may occasionally [[mulch]], which destroys the item and prevents infinite use. Bigger Throwing ammo mulches less often.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Throwing]]: List of ammo types\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], [[ranged weapon]]s used ammo: [[stone]]s and [[sling bullet]]s for Slings, [[arrow]]s for [[Bows]], and [[bolt]]s for [[Crossbows]].\n*Prior to [[0.24]], [[blowgun]]s required [[needle]]s; both were replaced by the throwable [[dart]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], ranged weapon ammunition could be [[brand]]ed.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], ammo could have its own [[enchant]]ment."}

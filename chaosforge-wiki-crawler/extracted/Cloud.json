{"title":"Cloud","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Cloud","type":"markdown","data":"***Version [0.31](/0.31 \"0.31\")**: This article **may not be** up to date for the [latest stable release](/0.32 \"0.32\") of Crawl.*\n\n**Clouds** are temporary, non-solid dungeon features, which occupy tiles. Some clouds cause damage or status effects, while others do nothing more than block [line of sight](/Line_of_sight \"Line of sight\"). Some areas of the dungeon will perpetually create clouds.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Useful Info](#Useful_Info)\n\n- [2 Atmospheric](#Atmospheric)\n\n- [3 Opaque](#Opaque)\n\n- [4 Damaging](#Damaging)\n\n  - [4.1 Steam](#Steam)\n  - [4.2 Flame](#Flame)\n  - [4.3 Spreading flames](#Spreading_flames)\n  - [4.4 Freezing vapour](#Freezing_vapour)\n  - [4.5 Acidic fog](#Acidic_fog)\n  - [4.6 Blessed fire](#Blessed_fire)\n  - [4.7 Excruciating misery](#Excruciating_misery)\n  - [4.8 Spectral flames](#Spectral_flames)\n  - [4.9 Thunder](#Thunder)\n  - [4.10 Blastmotes](#Blastmotes)\n  - [4.11 Whirling frost](#Whirling_frost)\n\n- [5 Status](#Status)\n\n  - [5.1 Calcifying dust](#Calcifying_dust)\n  - [5.2 Noxious fumes](#Noxious_fumes)\n  - [5.3 Poison](#Poison)\n  - [5.4 Miasma](#Miasma)\n  - [5.5 Mutagenic fog](#Mutagenic_fog)\n  - [5.6 Seething chaos](#Seething_chaos)\n  - [5.7 Degeneration](#Degeneration)\n  - [5.8 Rain](#Rain)\n\n- [6 History](#History)\n\n## Useful Info\n\nClouds are non-solid, so they can be stood on. [Blink](/Blink \"Blink\") can land you into any cloud, but [teleportation](/Teleport \"Teleport\") will never land you into a harmful cloud. Clouds will dissipate over time. However, player-generated clouds disappear the moment the cloud leaves your line-of-effect (similar to [line of sight](/Line_of_sight \"Line of sight\"), but they can dissipate behind transparent walls).\n\nIn most cases, no clouds can be placed on tiles where a cloud already exists. For example, placing a cloud of smoke will prevent a more dangerous cloud from appearing on that tile. Note that atmospheric-type clouds and [steam](/Steam \"Steam\") clouds can be replaced; no other type can.\n\nRegardless of other factors, players that follow [Qazlal](/Qazlal \"Qazlal\") or wear the [Robe of Clouds](/Robe_of_Clouds \"Robe of Clouds\") are immune to the harmful effects of all clouds. Opaque clouds still block sight, though.\n\n## Atmospheric\n\nAtmospheric clouds are merely decorative; they have no effect. Several varieties exist, including sparse dust, thin mist, or magical condensation. Non-opaque atmospheric clouds can be replaced by other clouds.\n\nCreated by certain effects, usually part of the Dungeon floor or a [vault](/Vault \"Vault\"). [Jumping spiders](/Jumping_spider \"Jumping spider\") leave behind clouds of dust, while [Xom](/Xom \"Xom\") can give followers a trail of magical condensation.\n\n## Opaque\n\nOpaque clouds can block [line of sight](/Line_of_sight \"Line of sight\"). Your line of sight stops after two opaque clouds in any direction. Many opaque clouds have no other special effect, but some have extra effects like damage or status effects.\n\nLike atmospheric clouds, there are multiple varieties of opaque clouds, including several colours of smoke, translocational energy, golden dust, salt, white fluffiness, and ink.\n\nThey are somewhat rarer than atmospheric clouds. Translocational energy is created, in small amounts, by [Translocations](/Translocations \"Translocations\") magic, [teleports](/Teleport \"Teleport\"), and [summons](/Summon \"Summon\"). [Scrolls of fog](/Scrolls_of_fog \"Scrolls of fog\") create smoke, which spreads to adjacent tiles. Many effects like [Dithmenos](/Dithmenos \"Dithmenos\")' Bleed Smoke, [Wu Jian](/Wu_Jian \"Wu Jian\")'s Heavenly Storm, and the [Cloak of the Thief](/Cloak_of_the_Thief \"Cloak of the Thief\") create opaque clouds.\n\nUnlike other clouds, a [kraken](/Kraken \"Kraken\")'s ink will only affect water tiles.\n\n## Damaging\n\n### Steam\n\nSteam clouds are full of scaldingly hot mist. They inflict [steam](/Steam \"Steam\") damage on anything standing on them. Creatures with rSteam or rF+ are immune to the cloud's damage. In addition, these clouds are [opaque](#Opaque) and will block LOS.\n\nSteam clouds are created when [Fire Magic](/Fire_Magic \"Fire Magic\") (including a [wand of flame](/Wand_of_flame \"Wand of flame\")) passes over [water](/Water \"Water\"), or when icy projectiles pass [lava](/Lava \"Lava\"). It is also created when water is adjacent to lava, or in certain vaults.\n\n- Damage: `(2d16)/2 - 1` [steam](/Steam \"Steam\") per turn\n\n* Negated entirely by rSteam or rF+\n\n### Flame\n\nClouds of flame are tiles which have caught on fire, which deal [fire](/Fire \"Fire\") damage. Certain icy beams, like [Bolt of Cold](/Bolt_of_Cold \"Bolt of Cold\"), will put out flame clouds.\n\nCreated by [Fire Storm](/Fire_Storm \"Fire Storm\"), red draconian or [Dragon Form](/Dragon_Form \"Dragon Form\") breath attack, demonspawn with [Ignite Blood](/Ignite_Blood \"Ignite Blood\"), [Qazlal](/Qazlal \"Qazlal\") worshippers, or a [condenser vane](/Condenser_vane \"Condenser vane\"). [Ignite Poison](/Ignite_Poison \"Ignite Poison\") turns poison clouds into flames, and creates flames from [Eringya's Noxious Bog](/Eringya%27s_Noxious_Bog \"Eringya's Noxious Bog\"). The unrand [salamander hide armour](/Salamander_hide_armour \"Salamander hide armour\") constantly creates flames around you.\n\n- Damage: `(2d23)/2 + 9` fire per turn (against players)\n\n* * `(2d16)/2 + 5` fire per turn (against monsters)\n  * Resisted by rF+. Players with demonspawn mutation, [Ignite Blood](/Ignite_Blood \"Ignite Blood\") are immune.\n\n### Spreading flames\n\nSpreading flames are a special type of flame cloud, created when [trees](/Tree \"Tree\") are set on fire. They act like regular flames, but periodically create new flames in tiles next to them, potentially lighting other trees on fire.\n\n- Damage: Same as clouds of flame.\n\n### Freezing vapour\n\nFreezing clouds are tiles filled with brutally cold mist. They deal [cold](/Cold \"Cold\") damage. It can be dispersed by strong [Fire Magic](/Fire_Magic \"Fire Magic\"), such as [Fireball](/Fireball \"Fireball\") or [Bolt of Fire](/Bolt_of_Fire \"Bolt of Fire\").\n\nCreated by the spell [Freezing Cloud](/Freezing_Cloud \"Freezing Cloud\"), a [condenser vane](/Condenser_vane \"Condenser vane\"), [Qazlal](/Qazlal \"Qazlal\") worshippers, and the [unrand](/Unrand \"Unrand\") axe [Frostbite](/Frostbite \"Frostbite\"). [Simulacra](/Simulacra \"Simulacra\") create an ice cloud when destroyed. For monsters, using [Bolt of Cold](/Bolt_of_Cold \"Bolt of Cold\") over water, or the spell [Glaciate](/Glaciate \"Glaciate\"), creates frost clouds.\n\n- Damage: `(2d23)/2 + 9` cold per turn (against players)\n\n* * `(2d16)/2 + 5` cold per turn (against monsters)\n  * Resisted by rC+. Players wielding [Frostbite](/Frostbite \"Frostbite\") are immune.\n\n### Acidic fog\n\nAcidic fog is a hideously dangerous type which inflicts [acid](/Acid \"Acid\") damage, and causes the [corrosion](/Corrosion \"Corrosion\") status. Creatures with corrosion resistance are fully immune. Fortunately, monsters with rCorr are very rare outside of [the Slime Pits](/The_Slime_Pits \"The Slime Pits\")\n\nCreated by a [condenser vane](/Condenser_vane \"Condenser vane\") at high power.\n\n- Damage: `(2d23)/2 + 9` acid per turn (against players)\n\n* * `(2d16)/2 + 5` acid per turn (against monsters)\n  * Negated entirely by rCorr.\n\n### Blessed fire\n\nClouds of blessed fire burn with [holy](/Holy \"Holy\"), cleansing light. Deals more damage to [demons](/Demon \"Demon\") and the [undead](/Undead \"Undead\"). Only creatures consecrated by or in service to the [good gods](/Good_gods \"Good gods\") are immune to their effects. In addition, these clouds are [opaque](#Opaque) and will block LOS.\n\nCreated by [pearl dragons](/Pearl_dragon \"Pearl dragon\") and [ophans](/Ophan \"Ophan\"). Appears in a few [vaults](/Vault \"Vault\").\n\n- Damage: `(2d19)/2 + 7` holy per turn (against players)\n\n* * `1d12 + 3` holy per turn (against monsters)\n  * Affected by holy resistance.\n\n### Excruciating misery\n\nClouds of excruciating misery deal 10% of the player's max HP (15% for monsters) every turn spent in it. [Negative energy resistance](/Negative_energy_resistance \"Negative energy resistance\") can reduce this to 6.6%, 3.3% and 0% respectively for every level of rN+. [Torment resistance](/Torment_resistance \"Torment resistance\") has no effect on these clouds, and unlike [torment](/Torment \"Torment\") this damage can be directly lethal.\n\nCreated by the [condenser vane](/Condenser_vane \"Condenser vane\"), [March of Sorrows](/March_of_Sorrows \"March of Sorrows\"), [Mourning Wail](/Mourning_Wail \"Mourning Wail\"), and [weeping skulls](/Weeping_skull \"Weeping skull\").\n\n- Damage: `(10% of player's max health)` negative energy per turn (against players)\n\n* * `15% of monster's max health` negative energy per turn (against monsters)\n  * Resisted by rN+.\n\n### Spectral flames\n\nSpectral flames burn with the chill fires of undeath. They deal partially-irresistible [negative energy](/Negative_energy \"Negative energy\") damage. In addition, they summon [spectral things](/Spectral_thing \"Spectral thing\"), which immediately attack creatures hostile to the cloud's creator. [Undead](/Undead \"Undead\") creatures are immune to the damage.\n\nSpectral flames are only ever created by monsters: [ghost crabs](/Ghost_crab \"Ghost crab\") and [revenants](/Revenant \"Revenant\") can both create banks of spectral fire.\n\n- Damage per turn: `(2d15)/2 + 3` partial negative energy\n\n* Undead and [Yredelemnul](/Yredelemnul \"Yredelemnul\") worshippers are immune to damage.\n\n### Thunder\n\nClouds of thunder (storm clouds) deal electric damage, and are resisted by electricity resistance.\n\nCreated by [condenser vanes](/Condenser_vane \"Condenser vane\"), [Qazlal](/Qazlal \"Qazlal\") worshippers, or the [unrand](/Unrand \"Unrand\") [robe of Clouds](/Robe_of_Clouds \"Robe of Clouds\").\n\n- Damage: `?` electric per turn (\\~18 dmg/turn average)\n\n* Resisted by rElec.\n\n### Blastmotes\n\nCreated by the spell, [Volatile Blastmotes](/Volatile_Blastmotes \"Volatile Blastmotes\"). When a creature steps on its tile, or when hit by [Fire Magic](/Fire_Magic \"Fire Magic\"), it will explode, dealing damage.\n\n- Damage: See [Volatile Blastmotes](/Volatile_Blastmotes \"Volatile Blastmotes\")\n\n### Whirling frost\n\nClouds of whirling frost are created by the spell, [Polar Vortex](/Polar_Vortex \"Polar Vortex\"). They deal heavy, partially irresistible cold damage, lift creatures into [flight](/Flight \"Flight\"), and cause creatures to move counter-clockwise around the caster. In addition, they can destroy trees.\n\n- Damage: See [Polar Vortex](/Polar_Vortex \"Polar Vortex\")\n\n* * 50% resisted by rC+.\n  * Creatures who are currently casting Polar Vortex are immune.\n\n## Status\n\n### Calcifying dust\n\nClouds of calcifying dust inflict the [Petrifying](/Petrify \"Petrify\") status on any creature that stands on them. [Nonliving](/Nonliving \"Nonliving\") or [insubstantial](/Insubstantial \"Insubstantial\") creatures are immune. In addition, these clouds are [opaque](#Opaque) and will block LOS.\n\nPlayers can only be affected by these clouds if they end their turn inside one. If you move outside of dust the moment it appears, then you won't get petrified.\n\n[Catoblepae](/Catoblepas \"Catoblepas\") belch forth clouds of calcifying dust at their prey, affecting friend and foe alike (though are immune to the effects themselves).\n\n### Noxious fumes\n\nClouds of noxious fumes (also known as mephitic clouds) are mildly toxic and foul-smelling gases. Anything caught in one is [confused](/Confusion \"Confusion\") for several turns; creatures with higher [HD](/HD \"HD\") are less likely to be confused. Can be turned into flame clouds via [Ignite Poison](/Ignite_Poison \"Ignite Poison\").\n\nCreated by the [Mephitic Cloud](/Mephitic_Cloud \"Mephitic Cloud\") spell, [condenser vane](/Condenser_vane \"Condenser vane\"), green player [draconian](/Draconian \"Draconian\") breath, and [swamp drakes](/Swamp_drake \"Swamp drake\").\n\n- Status: `(21 - HD) in 21` chance to confuse monsters.\n\n* rPois gives immunity\n\n### Poison\n\nPoison clouds are tiles filled with highly [poisonous](/Poison \"Poison\") gas. Creatures with poison resistance are fully immune. Can be turned into flame clouds via [Ignite Poison](/Ignite_Poison \"Ignite Poison\").\n\nCreated by a [scroll of poison](/Scroll_of_poison \"Scroll of poison\"), [condenser vanes](/Condenser_vane \"Condenser vane\"), or player [nagas](/Naga \"Naga\") with the [Spit Poison](/Spit_Poison \"Spit Poison\") 2 mutation. [Swamp dragons](/Swamp_dragon \"Swamp dragon\"), [gold dragons](/Gold_dragon \"Gold dragon\"), enemy [green draconians](/Green_draconian \"Green draconian\"), and [green deaths](/Green_death \"Green death\") breathe these.\n\n- Damage: `1d10 - 1` poison (direct damage)\n\n* * Additional poison status\n  * rPois gives immunity\n\n### Miasma\n\nClouds of miasma (also known as foul pestilence) are dangerous banks of corrupt fog. Vulnerable creatures take damage, are [poisoned](/Poison \"Poison\"), and become [slowed](/Slow \"Slow\"). [Nonliving](/Nonliving \"Nonliving\") and [undead](/Undead \"Undead\") creatures are immune; poison resistance stops the poison, and [stasis](/Stasis \"Stasis\") stops the slow.\n\nYou can create miasma clouds with [Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot](/Cigotuvi%27s_Dreadful_Rot \"Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot\") or the demonspawn mutation, [Foul Stench](/Foul_Stench \"Foul Stench\"). [Death drakes](/Death_drake \"Death drake\"), [ushabtiu](/Ushabti \"Ushabti\"), and [putrid mouths](/Putrid_mouth \"Putrid mouth\") can breathe them. [Tainted leviathans](/Tainted_leviathan \"Tainted leviathan\") and some [pandemonium lords](/Pandemonium_lord \"Pandemonium lord\") generate a ring of miasma, and [curse toes](/Curse_toe \"Curse toe\") leave them behind when moving. They can appear in certain [Swamp](/Swamp \"Swamp\"):4 vaults.\n\n- Damage: `1d12 - 1` poison (direct damage)\n\n* * Additional poison status.\n  * rMiasma gives immunity, as does demonspawn mutation [Foul Stench](/Foul_Stench \"Foul Stench\").\n\n### Mutagenic fog\n\nMutagenic fog is composed of raw, uncontrolled magic. These clouds inflict heavy [magic contamination](/Magic_contamination \"Magic contamination\") to players, which can cause [bad mutations](/Bad_mutation \"Bad mutation\"). Monsters are instead [polymorphed](/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") every turn they stay inside one.\n\nThese clouds are usually only found in vaults. [Cigotuvi's Fleshworks](/Cigotuvi%27s_Fleshworks \"Cigotuvi's Fleshworks\") in particular has several rooms filled with mutagenic fog.\n\n### Seething chaos\n\nFormed from the unpredictable forces of pure [chaos](/Chaos \"Chaos\"), clouds of seething chaos produce effects similar to being hit with a weapon of chaos on any creature that enters them.\n\nCreated by [apocalypse crabs](/Apocalypse_crab \"Apocalypse crab\"), and appear when a [chaos spawn](/Chaos_spawn \"Chaos spawn\") is killed or when you burn a [demonic tree](/Wall#Demonic_Trees \"Wall\").\n\n### Degeneration\n\nClouds of degeneration rapidly wither creatures that stand in them, repeatedly inflicting the effects of a [potion of degeneration](/Potion_of_degeneration \"Potion of degeneration\").\n\nSpawns in the [wizlab](/Wizlab \"Wizlab\"), [Alistair's Party Mansion](/Alistair%27s_Party_Mansion \"Alistair's Party Mansion\").\n\n### Rain\n\nRain clouds create [water](/Water \"Water\") over time. Solid ground becomes shallow water, and shallow water becomes deep water. This effect is temporary. Does not harm creatures.\n\nOnly created by [sky beasts](/Sky_beast \"Sky beast\"), who create rain when turning invisible or becoming visible again.\n\n## History\n\n- In [0.32](/0.32 \"0.32\"), clouds of magnetised fragments will be added as a part of the [Magnavolt](/Magnavolt \"Magnavolt\") spell.\n- Clouds of [negative energy](/Negative_energy \"Negative energy\") were replaced with clouds of excruciating misery in [0.31](/0.31 \"0.31\"). Also, now no opaque or harmful cloud, except for steam, can be overwritten by other clouds.\n- Prior to [0.30](/0.30 \"0.30\"), clouds of thunder would create \"strikes of thunder\"; they dealt less damage over time, but caused a damaging thunder strike every so often. This was bugged, where faster actions would trigger lightning strikes less often. Also, the \"smouldering flames\" cloud, created by [Conjure Flame](/Conjure_Flame \"Conjure Flame\"), was removed.\n- Prior to [0.28](/0.28 \"0.28\"), noxious fumes dealt minor poison damage, and clouds of degeneration did not exist. Also, rain and storm clouds would cause rain, which hurt water-vulnerable creatures.\n- Prior to [0.27](/0.27 \"0.27\"), [unbreathing](/Unbreathing \"Unbreathing\") protected against certain clouds. The [Hurl Damnation](/Hurl_Damnation_\\(mutation\\) \"Hurl Damnation (mutation)\") [demonspawn mutation](/Demonspawn_mutation \"Demonspawn mutation\") provided flaming cloud immunity. Thunder clouds would create loud noises. Also, in this version, [Tornadoes](/Tornado \"Tornado\") were replaced with [Polar Vortices](/Polar_Vortex \"Polar Vortex\")\n- Prior to [0.19](/0.19 \"0.19\"), player-created clouds did not vanish instantly when out-of-sight, instead they just dissipated faster.\n- Prior to [0.15](/0.15 \"0.15\"), clouds of mutagenic fog directly caused mutations rather than causing heavy [magical contamination](/Magical_contamination \"Magical contamination\").\n- Prior to [0.14](/0.14 \"0.14\"), clouds could be placed outside of the caster's [LOS](/Line_of_sight \"Line of sight\"), and lasted normal duration. 0.14 also added clouds of negative energy, thunder, and acid.\n- [0.13](/0.13 \"0.13\") added spectral flames.\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\"

Clouds will dissipate over time. However, player-generated clouds disappear the moment the cloud leaves your line-of-effect (similar to <a href=\"/Line_of_sight\" title=\"Line of sight\">line of sight</a>, but they can dissipate behind transparent walls).\n</p><p>In most cases, no clouds can be placed on tiles where a cloud already exists. For example, placing a cloud of smoke will prevent a more dangerous cloud from appearing on that tile. Note that atmospheric-type clouds and <a href=\"/Steam\" title=\"Steam\">steam</a> clouds can be replaced; no other type can.\n</p><p>Regardless of other factors, players that follow <a href=\"/Qazlal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Qazlal\">Qazlal</a> or wear the <a href=\"/Robe_of_Clouds\" title=\"Robe of Clouds\">Robe of Clouds</a> are immune to the harmful effects of all clouds.

Several varieties exist, including sparse dust, thin mist, or magical condensation.

Your line of sight stops after two opaque clouds in any direction. Many opaque clouds have no other special effect, but some have extra effects like damage or status effects.\n</p><p>Like atmospheric clouds, there are multiple varieties of opaque clouds, including several colours of smoke, translocational energy, golden dust, salt, white fluffiness, and ink.\n</p><p>They are somewhat rarer than atmospheric clouds. Translocational energy is created, in small amounts, by <a href=\"/Translocations\" title=\"Translocations\">Translocations</a> magic, <a href=\"/Teleport\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Teleport\">teleports</a>, and <a href=\"/Summon\" title=\"Summon\">summons</a>. <a href=\"/Scrolls_of_fog\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scrolls of fog\">Scrolls of fog</a> create smoke, which spreads to adjacent tiles. Many effects like <a href=\"/Dithmenos\" title=\"Dithmenos\">Dithmenos</a>' Bleed Smoke, <a href=\"/Wu_Jian\" title=\"Wu Jian\">Wu Jian</a>'s Heavenly Storm, and the <a href=\"/Cloak_of_the_Thief\" title=\"Cloak of the Thief\">Cloak of the Thief</a> create opaque clouds.\n</p><p>Unlike other clouds, a <a href=\"/Kraken\" title=\"Kraken\">kraken</a>'s ink will only affect water tiles.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Damaging\">Damaging</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Steam\">Steam</span></h3>\n<p>Steam clouds are full of scaldingly hot mist.

are temporary, non-solid dungeon features, which occupy tiles. Some clouds cause damage or status effects, while others do nothing more than block [[line of sight]]. Some areas of the dungeon will perpetually create clouds. \n\n==Useful Info==\nClouds are non-solid, so they can be stood on. [[Blink]] can land you into any cloud, but [[teleport]]ation will never land you into a harmful cloud. Clouds will dissipate over time. However, player-generated clouds disappear the moment the cloud leaves your line-of-effect (similar to [[line of sight]], but they can dissipate behind transparent walls).\n\nIn most cases, no clouds can be placed on tiles where a cloud already exists. For example, placing a cloud of smoke will prevent a more dangerous cloud from appearing on that tile. Note that atmospheric-type clouds and [[steam]] clouds can be replaced; no other type can.\n\nRegardless of other factors, players that follow [[Qazlal]] or wear the [[Robe of Clouds]] are immune to the harmful effects of all clouds. Opaque clouds still block sight, though.\n\n==Atmospheric==\nAtmospheric clouds are merely decorative; they have no effect. Several varieties exist, including sparse dust, thin mist, or magical condensation. Non-opaque atmospheric clouds can be replaced by other clouds.\n\nCreated by certain effects, usually part of the Dungeon floor or a [[vault]]. [[Jumping spider]]s leave behind clouds of dust, while [[Xom]] can give followers a trail of magical condensation.\n\n==Opaque==\nOpaque clouds can block [[line of sight]]. Your line of sight stops after two opaque clouds in any direction. Many opaque clouds have no other special effect, but some have extra effects like damage or status effects.\n\nLike atmospheric clouds, there are multiple varieties of opaque clouds, including several colours of smoke, translocational energy, golden dust, salt, white fluffiness, and ink.\n\nThey are somewhat rarer than atmospheric clouds. Translocational energy is created, in small amounts, by [[Translocations]] magic, [[teleport]]s, and [[summon]]s. [[Scrolls of fog]] create smoke, which spreads to adjacent tiles. Many effects like [[Dithmenos]]' Bleed Smoke, [[Wu Jian]]'s Heavenly Storm, and the [[Cloak of the Thief]] create opaque clouds.\n\nUnlike other clouds, a [[kraken]]'s ink will only affect water tiles.\n\n==Damaging==\n===Steam===\nSteam clouds are full of scaldingly hot mist. They inflict [[steam]] damage on anything standing on them. Creatures with rSteam or rF+ are immune to the cloud's damage. In addition, these clouds are [[#Opaque|opaque]] and will block LOS.\n\nSteam clouds are created when [[Fire Magic]] (including a [[wand of flame]]) passes over [[water]], or when icy projectiles pass [[lava]]. It is also created when water is adjacent to lava, or in certain vaults.\n\n*Damage: <code>(2d16)/2 - 1</code> [[steam]] per turn\n:Negated entirely by rSteam or rF+\n\n===Flame===\nClouds of flame are tiles which have caught on fire, which deal [[fire]] damage. Certain icy beams, like [[Bolt of Cold]], will put out flame clouds.\n\nCreated by [[Fire Storm]], red draconian or [[Dragon Form]] breath attack, demonspawn with [[Ignite Blood]], [[Qazlal]] worshippers, or a [[condenser vane]]. [[Ignite Poison]] turns poison clouds into flames, and creates flames from [[Eringya's Noxious Bog]]. The unrand [[salamander hide armour]] constantly creates flames around you.\n\n*Damage: <code>(2d23)/2 + 9</code> fire per turn (against players)\n:<code>(2d16)/2 + 5</code> fire per turn (against monsters)\n:Resisted by rF+. Players with demonspawn mutation, [[Ignite Blood]] are immune.\n\n===Spreading flames===\nSpreading flames are a special type of flame cloud, created when [[tree]]s are set on fire. They act like regular flames, but periodically create new flames in tiles next to them, potentially lighting other trees on fire.\n\n*Damage: Same as clouds of flame.\n\n===Freezing vapour===\nFreezing clouds are tiles filled with brutally cold mist. They deal [[cold]] damage. It can be dispersed by strong [[Fire Magic]], such as [[Fireball]] or [[Bolt of Fire]].\n\nCreated by the spell [[Freezing Cloud]], a [[condenser vane]], [[Qazlal]] worshippers, and the [[unrand]] axe [[Frostbite]]. [[Simulacra]] create an ice cloud when destroyed. For monsters, using [[Bolt of Cold]] over water, or the spell [[Glaciate]], creates frost clouds.\n\n*Damage: <code>(2d23)/2 + 9</code> cold per turn (against players)\n:<code>(2d16)/2 + 5</code> cold per turn (against monsters)\n:Resisted by rC+. Players wielding [[Frostbite]] are immune.\n\n===Acidic fog===\nAcidic fog is a hideously dangerous type which inflicts [[acid]] damage, and causes the [[corrosion]] status. Creatures with corrosion resistance are fully immune. Fortunately, monsters with rCorr are very rare outside of [[the Slime Pits]]\n\nCreated by a [[condenser vane]] at high power.\n\n*Damage: <code>(2d23)/2 + 9</code> acid per turn (against players)\n:<code>(2d16)/2 + 5</code> acid per turn (against monsters)\n:Negated entirely by rCorr.\n\n===Blessed fire===\nClouds of blessed fire burn with [[holy]], cleansing light. Deals more damage to [[demon]]s and the [[undead]]. Only creatures consecrated by or in service to the [[good gods]] are immune to their effects. In addition, these clouds are [[#Opaque|opaque]] and will block LOS.\n\nCreated by [[pearl dragon]]s and [[ophan]]s. Appears in a few [[vault]]s.\n\n*Damage: <code>(2d19)/2 + 7</code> holy per turn (against players)\n:<code>1d12 + 3</code> holy per turn (against monsters)\n:Affected by holy resistance.\n\n===Excruciating misery===\nClouds of excruciating misery deal 10% of the player's max HP (15% for monsters) every turn spent in it. [[Negative energy resistance]] can reduce this to 6.6%, 3.3% and 0% respectively for every level of rN+.\n[[Torment resistance]] has no effect on these clouds, and unlike [[torment]] this damage can be directly lethal.\n\nCreated by the [[condenser vane]], [[March of Sorrows]], [[Mourning Wail]], and [[weeping skull]]s.\n\n*Damage: <code>(10% of player's max health)</code> negative energy per turn (against players)\n:<code>15% of monster's max health</code> negative energy per turn (against monsters)\n:Resisted by rN+.\n\n===Spectral flames===\nSpectral flames burn with the chill fires of undeath. They deal partially-irresistible [[negative energy]] damage. In addition, they summon [[spectral thing]]s, which immediately attack creatures hostile to the cloud's creator. [[Undead]] creatures are immune to the damage.\n\nSpectral flames are only ever created by monsters: [[ghost crab]]s and [[revenant]]s can both create banks of spectral fire.\n\n*Damage per turn: <code>(2d15)/2 + 3</code> partial negative energy\n:Undead and [[Yredelemnul]] worshippers are immune to damage.\n\n===Thunder===\nClouds of thunder (storm clouds) deal electric damage, and are resisted by electricity resistance.\n\nCreated by  [[condenser vane]]s, [[Qazlal]] worshippers, or the [[unrand]] [[robe of Clouds]].\n\n*Damage: <code>?</code> electric per turn (~18 dmg/turn average)\n:Resisted by rElec.\n\n===Blastmotes===\nCreated by the spell, [[Volatile Blastmotes]]. When a creature steps on its tile, or when hit by [[Fire Magic]], it will explode, dealing damage.\n\n*Damage: See [[Volatile Blastmotes]]\n\n===Whirling frost===\nClouds of whirling frost are created by the spell, [[Polar Vortex]]. They deal heavy, partially irresistible cold damage, lift creatures into [[flight]], and cause creatures to move counter-clockwise around the caster. In addition, they can destroy trees.\n\n*Damage: See [[Polar Vortex]]\n:50% resisted by rC+.\n:Creatures who are currently casting Polar Vortex are immune.\n\n==Status==\n\n===Calcifying dust===\nClouds of calcifying dust inflict the [[Petrify]]ing status on any creature that stands on them. [[Nonliving]] or [[insubstantial]] creatures are immune. In addition, these clouds are [[#Opaque|opaque]] and will block LOS.\n\nPlayers can only be affected by these clouds if they end their turn inside one. If you move outside of dust the moment it appears, then you won't get petrified.\n\n[[Catoblepas|Catoblepae]] belch forth clouds of calcifying dust at their prey, affecting friend and foe alike (though are immune to the effects themselves).\n\n===Noxious fumes===\nClouds of noxious fumes (also known as mephitic clouds) are mildly toxic and foul-smelling gases. Anything caught in one is [[confusion|confused]] for several turns; creatures with higher [[HD]] are less likely to be confused. Can be turned into flame clouds via [[Ignite Poison]].\n\nCreated by the [[Mephitic Cloud]] spell, [[condenser vane]], green player [[draconian]] breath, and [[swamp drake]]s.\n\n*Status: <code>(21 - [[HD]]) in 21</code> chance to confuse monsters.\n:rPois gives immunity\n\n===Poison===\nPoison clouds are tiles filled with highly [[poison]]ous gas. Creatures with poison resistance are fully immune. Can be turned into flame clouds via [[Ignite Poison]].\n\nCreated by a [[scroll of poison]], [[condenser vane]]s, or player [[naga]]s with the [[Spit Poison]] 2 mutation. [[Swamp dragon]]s, [[gold dragon]]s, enemy [[green draconian]]s, and [[green death]]s breathe these.\n\n*Damage: <code>1d10 - 1</code> poison (direct damage)\n:Additional poison status\n:rPois gives immunity\n\n===Miasma===\nClouds of miasma (also known as foul pestilence) are dangerous banks of corrupt fog. Vulnerable creatures take damage, are [[poison]]ed, and become [[slow]]ed. [[Nonliving]] and [[undead]] creatures are immune; poison resistance stops the poison, and [[stasis]] stops the slow.\n\nYou can create miasma clouds with [[Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot]] or the demonspawn mutation, [[Foul Stench]]. [[Death drake]]s, [[ushabti]]u, and [[putrid mouth]]s can breathe them. [[Tainted leviathan]]s and some [[pandemonium lord]]s generate a ring of miasma, and [[curse toe]]s leave them behind when moving. They can appear in certain [[Swamp]]:4 vaults.\n\n*Damage: <code>1d12 - 1</code> poison (direct damage)\n:Additional poison status.\n:rMiasma gives immunity, as does demonspawn mutation [[Foul Stench]].\n\n===Mutagenic fog===\nMutagenic fog is composed of raw, uncontrolled magic. These clouds inflict heavy [[magic contamination]] to players, which can cause [[bad mutation]]s. Monsters are instead [[polymorph]]ed every turn they stay inside one.\n\nThese clouds are usually only found in vaults. [[Cigotuvi's Fleshworks]] in particular has several rooms filled with mutagenic fog.\n\n===Seething chaos===\nFormed from the unpredictable forces of pure [[chaos]], clouds of seething chaos produce effects similar to being hit with a weapon of chaos on any creature that enters them.\n\nCreated by [[apocalypse crab]]s, and appear when a [[chaos spawn]] is killed or when you burn a [[wall#Demonic_Trees|demonic tree]].\n\n===Degeneration===\nClouds of degeneration rapidly wither creatures that stand in them, repeatedly inflicting the effects of a [[potion of degeneration]].\n\nSpawns in the [[wizlab]], [[Alistair's Party Mansion]].\n\n===Rain===\nRain clouds create [[water]] over time. Solid ground becomes shallow water, and shallow water becomes deep water. This effect is temporary. Does not harm creatures.\n\nOnly created by [[sky beast]]s, who create rain when turning invisible or becoming visible again.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|clouds of magnetised fragments will be added as a part of the [[Magnavolt]] spell.}}\n*Clouds of [[negative energy]] were replaced with clouds of excruciating misery in [[0.31]]. Also, now no opaque or harmful cloud, except for steam, can be overwritten by other clouds.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], clouds of thunder would create \"strikes of thunder\"; they dealt less damage over time, but caused a damaging thunder strike every so often. This was bugged, where faster actions would trigger lightning strikes less often. Also, the \"smouldering flames\" cloud, created by [[Conjure Flame]], was removed.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], noxious fumes dealt minor poison damage, and clouds of degeneration did not exist. Also, rain and storm clouds would cause rain, which hurt water-vulnerable creatures.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], [[unbreathing]] protected against certain clouds. The [[Hurl Damnation (mutation)|Hurl Damnation]] [[demonspawn mutation]] provided flaming cloud immunity. Thunder clouds would create loud noises. Also, in this version, [[Tornado]]es were replaced with [[Polar Vortex|Polar Vortices]]\n*Prior to [[0.19]], player-created clouds did not vanish instantly when out-of-sight, instead they just dissipated faster.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], clouds of mutagenic fog directly caused mutations rather than causing heavy [[magical contamination]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], clouds could be placed outside of the caster's [[line of sight|LOS]], and lasted normal duration. 0.14 also added clouds of negative energy, thunder, and acid.\n*[[0.13]] added spectral flames.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

Its light is hated by the undead, and can reveal any machinations of those who try to stay invisible.}}\n[[File:Mace_of_brilliance.png]] '''''the +5,+5 mace of Brilliance'''''\n\n+5, +5 [[mace]]\n\n[[Holy wrath]] [[brand]]<br>\n+5 [[AC]]<br>\n+5 INT<br>\nrN+<br>\n[[See invisible]]<br>\n-20 [[Stealth]]<br>\n3 tile halo [[aura]]\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''mace of Brilliance''' is an excellent find early on due to its bonus [[AC]], [[intelligence]], and solid enchantments, and its [[holy wrath]] brand will make short work of any [[undead]] or [[demon]]ic opponents encountered in the early- or mid-game. Unfortunately its significant [[stealth]] penalties coupled with its halo mean you'll never go unnoticed. Maces are weak base weapons, rendering the mace of Brilliance a mediocre choice for the late game unless you're a caster simply using it to enhance their spells and provide some defense.\n\n==History==\nThis mace's base type was changed to a +1 eveningstar and re-named \"[[Brilliance (artefact)|Brilliance]]\" in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete]]"}

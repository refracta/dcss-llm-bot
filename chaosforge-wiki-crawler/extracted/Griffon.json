They are found in the later portions of [[the Dungeon]], [[the Lair]], and [[the Shoals]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nBy the time you face them, most melee characters should have little difficulty soaking their damage output. Despite their decent HP, they have no resistances and low defenses, so casters should have no trouble keeping them at bay. [[Airstrike]] is particularly effective.\n\n==History==\nGriffons were removed in [[0.19]]."}

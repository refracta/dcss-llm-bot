The scroll cannot affect those fully immune to such effects.}}\n\nReading a '''scroll of vulnerability''' inflicts [[Vulnerability (status effect)|vulnerability]] on everything in your [[line of sight]] (including you), reducing [[willpower]] by half for a short duration. Monsters with infinite will are unaffected.\n\n==Strategy==\nScrolls of vulnerability aren't only for [[Hexes]] specialists. For just about any character, vulnerability can be useful:\n*[[Wand]]s - Halving willpower makes [[wand of paralysis|wands of paralysis]], [[Wand of charming|charming]], and [[wand of polymorph|polymorph]] much more likely to succeed. With a few points of Evocations, disabling a dangerous enemy becomes easy. With enough training, even foes like [[the Royal Jelly]] become possible targets.\n*[[Scroll of fear]] - Makes it much more reliable. For reference, vulnerability gives a 50% - 60% chance to fear [[pandemonium lord]]s with Will+++++. Most targets before [[extended]] will have a 90%+ fear chance.\n\nRemember that your own [[willpower]] is also affected! Watch out for enemy hexers, such as [[Erica]], [[Erolcha]], [[merfolk siren]]s, or [[orc sorcerer]]s, when using this scroll. Also watch out for enemies with [[wand]]s - otherwise, an [[orc]] with a [[wand of paralysis]] can outright kill you.\n\nTherefore, the ideal targets are powerful [[unique]]s without hexes in their spell set. Examples include nasty brutes like [[Donald]], [[Bai Suzhen]], [[Frederick]], or [[Sojobo]]. They can also be useful if you're struggling against say, [[hydra]]s or [[demonic crawler]]s, though these scrolls aren't plentiful to use on every hydra you see.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.15]], scrolls of vulnerability would additionally cause all magical [[status effect]]s to immediately expire, and would reduce your current [[magical contamination]] by 1-5 points. Both of these effects were transferred to the [[potion of cancellation]].\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

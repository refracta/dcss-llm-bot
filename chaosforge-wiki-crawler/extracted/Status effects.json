{"title":"Status effects","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Status_effects","type":"markdown","data":"***Version [0.28](/0.28 \"0.28\")**: This article **may not be** up to date for the [latest stable release](/0.32 \"0.32\") of Crawl.*\n\n**Status effects** are temporary enhancements and ailments that both you and the inhabitants of [the Dungeon](/The_Dungeon \"The Dungeon\") can benefit or suffer from. Unlike [mutations](/Mutation \"Mutation\"), status effects will run their course after enough time has passed or after you escape whatever's inflicting the effect. Many status effects can be cured or prevented in a variety of ways; see their individual pages for details. There are also in-game descriptions of statuses available (hit **?**, then **/**, then **t** for sTatus, then type in the indicator text you see).\n\nMost status effects will display a coloured (often abbreviated) word in your character information for as long as they last. Status effects that have a limited duration will often turn a darker colour as the effect nears its end, whereas other status effects use a darker colour to indicate increasing severity of the effect.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Beneficial Status Effects](#Beneficial_Status_Effects)\n\n  - [1.1 Agile](#Agile)\n  - [1.2 Alive](#Alive)\n  - [1.3 Augmentation](#Augmentation)\n  - [1.4 Berserk](#Berserk)\n  - [1.5 Black Mark](#Black_Mark)\n  - [1.6 Bloodless](#Bloodless)\n  - [1.7 Brilliant](#Brilliant)\n  - [1.8 Charging](#Charging)\n  - [1.9 Confusing Touch](#Confusing_Touch)\n  - [1.10 Death Channel](#Death_Channel)\n  - [1.11 Death's Door](#Death.27s_Door)\n  - [1.12 Disjunction](#Disjunction)\n  - [1.13 Divine Protection](#Divine_Protection)\n  - [1.14 Divine Shield](#Divine_Shield)\n  - [1.15 Finesse](#Finesse)\n  - [1.16 Flight](#Flight)\n  - [1.17 Haste](#Haste)\n  - [1.18 Heavenly Storm](#Heavenly_Storm)\n  - [1.19 Heroism](#Heroism)\n  - [1.20 Invisibility](#Invisibility)\n  - [1.21 Leda's Liquefaction](#Leda.27s_Liquefaction)\n  - [1.22 Might](#Might)\n  - [1.23 Olgreb's Toxic Radiance](#Olgreb.27s_Toxic_Radiance)\n  - [1.24 Ozocubu's Armour](#Ozocubu.27s_Armour)\n  - [1.25 Powered by Death](#Powered_by_Death)\n  - [1.26 Quad Damage](#Quad_Damage)\n  - [1.27 Recall](#Recall)\n  - [1.28 Repel Missiles](#Repel_Missiles)\n  - [1.29 Resistance](#Resistance)\n  - [1.30 Ring of Flames](#Ring_of_Flames)\n  - [1.31 Searing Ray](#Searing_Ray)\n    - [1.31.1 Flame Wave](#Flame_Wave)\n  - [1.32 Serpent's Lash](#Serpent.27s_Lash)\n  - [1.33 Silence](#Silence)\n  - [1.34 Slimify](#Slimify)\n  - [1.35 Swiftness](#Swiftness)\n  - [1.36 Teleport](#Teleport)\n  - [1.37 Transmutations](#Transmutations)\n  - [1.38 Vitalisation](#Vitalisation)\n  - [1.39 Polar Vortex](#Polar_Vortex)\n\n- [2 Detrimental Status Effects](#Detrimental_Status_Effects)\n\n  - [2.1 Antimagic](#Antimagic)\n  - [2.2 Bad Forms](#Bad_Forms)\n  - [2.3 Blind](#Blind)\n  - [2.4 Charm](#Charm)\n  - [2.5 Confusion](#Confusion)\n  - [2.6 Constriction](#Constriction)\n  - [2.7 Cooldowns](#Cooldowns)\n  - [2.8 Corona](#Corona)\n  - [2.9 Corrosion](#Corrosion)\n  - [2.10 Dazed](#Dazed)\n  - [2.11 Doom Howl](#Doom_Howl)\n  - [2.12 Drain](#Drain)\n  - [2.13 Engulf](#Engulf)\n  - [2.14 Fast+Slow](#Fast.2BSlow)\n  - [2.15 Fear](#Fear)\n  - [2.16 Fire Vulnerable](#Fire_Vulnerable)\n  - [2.17 Flayed](#Flayed)\n  - [2.18 Frozen](#Frozen)\n  - [2.19 Held](#Held)\n  - [2.20 Horrified](#Horrified)\n  - [2.21 Inner Flame](#Inner_Flame)\n  - [2.22 Lava](#Lava)\n  - [2.23 Leda's Liquefaction](#Leda.27s_Liquefaction_2)\n  - [2.24 Magic Contamination](#Magic_Contamination)\n  - [2.25 Mark](#Mark)\n  - [2.26 Mesmerised](#Mesmerised)\n  - [2.27 No Potions](#No_Potions)\n  - [2.28 No Scrolls](#No_Scrolls)\n  - [2.29 Orb](#Orb)\n  - [2.30 Paralysis](#Paralysis)\n  - [2.31 Petrifying/Petrified](#Petrifying.2FPetrified)\n  - [2.32 Poison](#Poison)\n  - [2.33 Sapped Magic](#Sapped_Magic)\n  - [2.34 Sickness](#Sickness)\n  - [2.35 Silence](#Silence_2)\n  - [2.36 Sleep](#Sleep)\n  - [2.37 Slow](#Slow)\n  - [2.38 Sluggish](#Sluggish)\n  - [2.39 Stat Zero](#Stat_Zero)\n  - [2.40 Sticky Flame](#Sticky_Flame)\n  - [2.41 Still Winds](#Still_Winds)\n  - [2.42 Teleport Prevention](#Teleport_Prevention)\n  - [2.43 Umbra](#Umbra)\n  - [2.44 Vulnerable](#Vulnerable)\n  - [2.45 Water](#Water)\n  - [2.46 Weak](#Weak)\n\n- [3 History](#History)\n\n## Beneficial Status Effects\n\n### Agile\n\nAgil\n\n[Demonspawn](/Demonspawn \"Demonspawn\") with [Powered by Pain](/Powered_by_Pain \"Powered by Pain\") may give you agility, which boosts [dexterity](/Dexterity \"Dexterity\"), [stealth](/Stealth \"Stealth\"), and [evasion](/Evasion \"Evasion\").\n\n### Alive\n\nAlive\n\nAlive [Vampires](/Vampire \"Vampire\") have fast [Regeneration rate](/Regeneration_rate \"Regeneration rate\"), can use [Transformations](/Transformation \"Transformation\"), and can go [berserk](/Berserk \"Berserk\").\n\n### Augmentation\n\nAug Aug Aug\n\n[Demonspawn](/Demonspawn \"Demonspawn\") with the Augmentation [demonspawn mutation](/Demonspawn_mutation \"Demonspawn mutation\") gain [slaying](/Slaying \"Slaying\") and [spell power](/Spell_power \"Spell power\") bonuses as their HP rises. The brighter the colour of the effect, the larger the bonus.\n\n### Berserk\n\nBerserk\n\nYou have gone [berserk](/Berserk \"Berserk\"), gaining a huge boost to [HP](/HP \"HP\"), [melee damage](/Might \"Might\"), and [speed](/Haste \"Haste\"). Just watch out for the crash afterward.\n\n### Black Mark\n\nCreatures with the [black mark](/Black_mark \"Black mark\") status apply [draining](/Draining \"Draining\"), [slowness](/Slow \"Slow\"), or [antimagic](/Antimagic \"Antimagic\") to creatures they hit in melee. The player version from the [demonspawn](/Demonspawn \"Demonspawn\") [mutation](/Black_Mark_\\(mutation\\) \"Black Mark (mutation)\") only activates on 20% of hits.\n\n### Bloodless\n\nBloodless\n\nBloodless [Vampires](/Vampire \"Vampire\") have less maximum health and don't regenerate when monsters are visible. Instead they get a [Stealth](/Stealth \"Stealth\") boost, [vampiric](/Vampiric \"Vampiric\") bite, the full set of [undead](/Undead \"Undead\") resistances, and an ability to turn into a bat.\n\n### Brilliant\n\nBrill\n\nQuaffing a [potion of brilliance](/Potion_of_brilliance \"Potion of brilliance\") will give you a bonus to [spell power](/Spell_power \"Spell power\") and halve the MP cost of spells.\n\n### Charging\n\nCharge-\n\nYou're casting [Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling](/Maxwell%27s_Capacitive_Coupling \"Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling\"); press **.** to keep it coming. The - cycles between (-, /, |, \\\\) in a counterclockwise motion, though where you start with is random.\n\n### Confusing Touch\n\nTouch\n\nCasting [Confusing Touch](/Confusing_Touch \"Confusing Touch\") will imbue your hands with strange energy, causing your melee attacks to [confuse](/Confusion \"Confusion\") the enemy.\n\n### Death Channel\n\nDChan\n\nAny living creature you kill while under the effect of [Death Channel](/Death_Channel \"Death Channel\") will rise as a [spectral thing](/Spectral_thing \"Spectral thing\") to serve you.\n\n### Death's Door\n\nDDoor\n\nCasting [Death's Door](/Death%27s_Door \"Death's Door\") will render you temporarily invulnerable, but reduces your [HP](/HP \"HP\") to almost nothing and leaves you unable to cast again for a short period.\n\n### Disjunction\n\nDisjoin\n\nCasting [Disjunction](/Disjunction \"Disjunction\") causes all enemies around you to [blink](/Blink \"Blink\") away, with a success rate that rises as they approach you.\n\n### Divine Protection\n\nProt\n\n[Elyvilon](/Elyvilon \"Elyvilon\")'s Divine Protection ability will render you invulnerable to any attack that would otherwise kill you, though at a significant cost to [piety](/Piety \"Piety\") each time it triggers.\n\n### Divine Shield\n\n[The Shining One](/The_Shining_One \"The Shining One\") is protecting you from attacks, boosting your [blocking defense](/Shield_\\(stat\\) \"Shield (stat)\") for a brief time.\n\n### Finesse\n\nFinesse\n\n[Okawaru](/Okawaru \"Okawaru\")'s Finesse ability doubles the speed of all of your physical attacks.\n\n### Flight\n\nFly\n\nYou're airborne! You can travel over impassable terrain, take less damage from [Shatter](/Shatter \"Shatter\"), and take more damage from [Airstrike](/Airstrike \"Airstrike\").\n\nFly\n\nYour flight is nearly over. Get to solid ground, or drink another [potion of flight](/Potion_of_flight \"Potion of flight\") to keep going.\n\nFly\n\nYour flight should have ended, but that would've dropped you in some sort of deep liquid and killed you. The strain of staying airborne will keep [draining](/Draining \"Draining\") you until you reach land, so do that pronto!\n\nFly\n\nYour flight is limitless! End it whenever you want.\n\n### Haste\n\nFast\n\nAll actions performed by a [hasted](/Haste \"Haste\") creature take 66% as long as normal to complete.\n\n### Heavenly Storm\n\nStorm (X)\n\nUsing [Wu Jian](/Wu_Jian \"Wu Jian\")'s Heavenly Storm ability gives you a huge [slaying](/Slaying \"Slaying\") bonus (indicated by the number represented by X) and constantly generates opaque [clouds](/Cloud \"Cloud\") around you. Using your martial attacks increases your slaying bonus, but doing anything else decreases the bonus until it reaches 0, at which point the storm expires.\n\n### Heroism\n\nHero\n\n[Okawaru](/Okawaru \"Okawaru\")'s Heroism ability gives you a +5 bonus to all non-magical skills.\n\n### Invisibility\n\nInvis\n\n[Invisible](/Invisible \"Invisible\") characters are given bonuses in combat when fighting monsters that can't [see invisible](/See_invisible \"See invisible\"). Invisible monsters are difficult to detect and gain similar bonuses when attacking you.\n\nInvis\n\nYou turned invisible using a piece of magical equipment. This equipment is reusable, though inflicts [drain](/Drain \"Drain\") in the process.\n\nInvis\n\nYou're technically still invisible, but monsters can still see you because you're [glowing](/Glowing \"Glowing\") or standing in [shallow water](/Shallow_water \"Shallow water\") or [clouds](/Cloud \"Cloud\").\n\n### Leda's Liquefaction\n\nLiquid\n\nCasting [Leda's Liquefaction](/Leda%27s_Liquefaction \"Leda's Liquefaction\") will convert the ground all around you into a soupy mess. This reduces the movement rate and melee attack success rate of anything stuck in it (including you!)\n\n### Might\n\nMight\n\nQuaffing a [potion of might](/Potion_of_might \"Potion of might\") will give you a 1d10 bonus to melee damage.\n\n### Olgreb's Toxic Radiance\n\nToxic\n\nCasting [Olgreb's Toxic Radiance](/Olgreb%27s_Toxic_Radiance \"Olgreb's Toxic Radiance\") [poisons](/Poison \"Poison\") everything in your [LOS](/LOS \"LOS\") each turn for a few turns.\n\n### Ozocubu's Armour\n\nCasting [Ozocubu's Armour](/Ozocubu%27s_Armour \"Ozocubu's Armour\") will cover you in a sheet of protective ice, boosting [AC](/AC \"AC\"). It breaks if you move, though.\n\n### Powered by Death\n\nRegen (X)\n\n[Demonspawn](/Demonspawn \"Demonspawn\") with the Powered by Death [demonspawn mutation](/Demonspawn_mutation \"Demonspawn mutation\") will recover [HP](/HP \"HP\") faster after killing monsters. The number (marked by the 'X') indicates how much faster you heal.\n\n### Quad Damage\n\nQuad\n\nUsing a [quad damage](/Quad_damage \"Quad damage\") will multiply your damage output by 4. Only found in [Dungeon Sprint](/Dungeon_Sprint \"Dungeon Sprint\").\n\n### Recall\n\nRecall\n\nUsing a [Recall](/Recall \"Recall\") ability will cause allied units to [teleport](/Teleport \"Teleport\") to your location over time.\n\n### Repel Missiles\n\nRMsl\n\nCreatures that [repel missiles](/Repel_missiles \"Repel missiles\") are harder to hit with ranged attacks. Players don't see the temporary status effect anymore, but monsters can still have it.\n\nRMsl\n\nThis effect is permanent, usually due to wearing a [scarf](/Scarf \"Scarf\") of repulsion or following [Qazlal](/Qazlal \"Qazlal\").\n\n### Resistance\n\nResist\n\nQuaffing a [potion of resistance](/Potion_of_resistance \"Potion of resistance\") will grant you resistance to [fire](/Fire \"Fire\"), [cold](/Cold \"Cold\"), [electricity](/Electricity \"Electricity\"), [poison](/Poison \"Poison\"), and [acid](/Acid \"Acid\") for a short time.\n\n### Ring of Flames\n\nRoF\n\nWearing the [salamander hide armour](/Salamander_hide_armour \"Salamander hide armour\") will surround you with [fire](/Fire \"Fire\") [clouds](/Cloud \"Cloud\"), boost your fire resistance, and enhance the [spell power](/Spell_power \"Spell power\") of your [Fire Magic](/Fire_Magic \"Fire Magic\"), but renders you very vulnerable to [cold](/Cold \"Cold\").\n\n### Searing Ray\n\nRay Ray+ Ray++\n\nYou're casting [Searing Ray](/Searing_Ray \"Searing Ray\") and still have more turns of laser to dish out. Press **.** to keep it coming.\n\n#### Flame Wave\n\nWave Wave+ Wave++ [Flame Wave](/Flame_Wave \"Flame Wave\") uses the same casting mechanic as Searing Ray.\n\n### Serpent's Lash\n\nLash (X)\n\nUsing [Wu Jian](/Wu_Jian \"Wu Jian\")'s Serpent's Lash ability gives you two turns of free movement (the X represents how many turns you have left). Your martial attacks are much stronger during this period, but you become [exhausted](/Exhausted \"Exhausted\") after the ability ends.\n\n### Silence\n\nWhile you are emitting a [silence](/Silence \"Silence\") [aura](/Aura \"Aura\"), most creatures (including you) caught in its effect will be unable to cast spells, read [scrolls](/Scroll \"Scroll\"), or use divine abilities. Certain abilities can't be silenced, and [demons](/Demon \"Demon\") ignore the effects of silence.\n\n### Slimify\n\nSlime\n\n[Jiyva](/Jiyva \"Jiyva\")'s Slimify ability will make your next melee attack that hits turn your target into a [jelly](/List_of_jellies \"List of jellies\").\n\n### Swiftness\n\nSwift\n\nThe [Swiftness](/Swiftness \"Swiftness\") spell increases your movement speed for a while, but then makes you [sluggish](#Sluggish) for a while.\n\nSwift\n\nYour increased speed is nearly over and you'll start moving slowly soon.\n\nSwift\n\nYou are knee deep in water and slow down to normal wading speed.\n\n### Teleport\n\nTele\n\nYou are going to [teleport](/Teleport \"Teleport\") in the next few turns. Generate another teleport before this one goes off to negate it. Or wear an artefact that negates all teleporting.\n\n### Transmutations\n\nThere are a number of useful alternative forms you can assume, many of which are from [Transmutations](/Transmutations \"Transmutations\") spells:\n\nApp\n\n[Beastly Appendage](/Beastly_Appendage \"Beastly Appendage\")\n\nBlade\n\n[Blade Hands](/Blade_Hands \"Blade Hands\")\n\nSpider\n\n[Spider Form](/Spider_Form \"Spider Form\")\n\nIce\n\n[Ice Form](/Ice_Form \"Ice Form\")\n\nStatue\n\n[Statue Form](/Statue_Form \"Statue Form\")\n\nStorm\n\n[Storm Form](/Storm_Form \"Storm Form\")\n\nDragon\n\n[Dragon Form](/Dragon_Form \"Dragon Form\")\n\nLich\n\n[Necromutation](/Necromutation \"Necromutation\")\n\nBat\n\n[Bat Form](/Bat_Form \"Bat Form\")\n\nTree\n\n[Tree Form](/Tree_Form \"Tree Form\")\n\nShadow\n\n[Shadow Form](/Shadow_Form \"Shadow Form\")\n\n### Vitalisation\n\nVit\n\n[Zin](/Zin \"Zin\") is filling you with divine health, boosting your [stats](/Stat \"Stat\") and protecting you from [stat](/Stat \"Stat\") damage and many negative status effects.\n\n### Polar Vortex\n\nVortex\n\nCasting [Polar Vortex](/Polar_Vortex \"Polar Vortex\") will create a raging storm around you, granting you [flight](/Flight \"Flight\") and brutalizing everything within its reach, damaging them and tossing them around.\n\n## Detrimental Status Effects\n\n### Antimagic\n\nAs monsters are struck by [antimagic](/Antimagic \"Antimagic\") weapons, they become more likely to fail to cast their spells. Players simply lose MP.\n\n### Bad Forms\n\nGetting hit by an enemy's [Polymorph](/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") spell will temporarily force you into one of several less-than-ideal forms:\n\nPig\n\n[Pig Form](/Pig_Form \"Pig Form\")\n\nFungus\n\n[Fungus Form](/Fungus_Form \"Fungus Form\")\n\nPorc\n\n[Porcupine Form](/Porcupine_Form \"Porcupine Form\")\n\nWisp\n\n[Wisp Form](/Wisp_Form \"Wisp Form\")\n\n### Blind\n\n[Blind](/Blind \"Blind\") monsters will treat your character as though it were [invisible](/Invisible \"Invisible\"). This negates any [see invisible](/See_invisible \"See invisible\") it may have.\n\n### Charm\n\n[Charmed](/Charm \"Charm\") monsters will ally with you and fight on your side... for a while.\n\n### Confusion\n\nConf\n\n[Confused](/Confusion \"Confusion\") creatures can't choose which direction to move or attack in and many actions are disabled.\n\n### Constriction\n\nConstr\n\nBeing [constricted](/Constricted \"Constricted\") means that an enemy is crushing you each turn, dealing damage, reducing [evasion](/Evasion \"Evasion\") and preventing you from moving. Kill it or break free by attempting to move away!\n\n### Cooldowns\n\nSeveral abilities can't be used right after you've used them; most of these will wear off given enough time.\n\n-Berserk\n\nYou're too tired to go [berserk](/Berserk \"Berserk\") right now.\n\n-Blink\n\nYou are still too unstable to [blink](/Blink \"Blink\").\n\nBreath\n\nYou can't use any [draconian breath attacks](/Draconian_breath_attacks \"Draconian breath attacks\") or [naga poison spit](/Spit_Poison \"Spit Poison\") for a while.\n\nDDoor\n\nYou're too tired to cast [Death's Door](/Death%27s_Door \"Death's Door\") right now. Be extra careful -- your HP is probably still extremely low!\n\nExh\n\nYou are too tired to use any of [Ru](/Ru \"Ru\")'s abilities or [Wu Jian](/Wu_Jian \"Wu Jian\")'s Serpent's Lash right now.\n\n-Hop\n\nYou're too tired to [Hop](/Barachi \"Barachi\") again at the moment; spend some time without moving to recover.\n\n-Recite\n\nYou can't use [Zin](/Zin \"Zin\")'s Recite ability now.\n\n-Vortex\n\nYou can't start another [Polar Vortex](/Polar_Vortex \"Polar Vortex\") right now.\n\n### Corona\n\nCorona\n\nThe [Corona](/Corona \"Corona\") spell will render its target much easier to hit, reducing [evasion](/Evasion \"Evasion\") and negating [invisibility](/Invisibility \"Invisibility\").\n\n### Corrosion\n\nCorr -X\n\n[Corrosion](/Corrosion \"Corrosion\") is a temporary status effect which gives a stackable -4 to [slaying](/Slaying \"Slaying\") and [AC](/AC \"AC\") (the number represented by X indicates how much these have been reduced) for as long as it lasts. Corrosion will be repaired after enough turns have passed. Corroded monsters simply get a temporary -8 to their AC.\n\n### Dazed\n\nMonsters may become [dazed](/Dazed \"Dazed\") after you recite the word of [Zin](/Zin \"Zin\") at them, causing them to waste their turns as they recover their senses.\n\n### Doom Howl\n\nHowl\n\nA [doom hound](/Doom_hound \"Doom hound\")'s [howl](/Doom_Howl \"Doom Howl\") has called nightmarish creatures to hunt you. Dangerous enemies will spawn near you every few turns until the howl fades.\n\n### Drain\n\nDrain Drain Drain Drain\n\n[Negative energy](/Negative_energy \"Negative energy\") has [withered](/Draining \"Draining\") you, reducing your maximum [HP](/HP \"HP\"), with darker colours indicating worse effects. Gaining XP gradually restores your health. Monsters who get drained have their [HD](/HD \"HD\") lowered instead, reducing their strength and [willpower](/Willpower \"Willpower\").\n\n### Engulf\n\nEngulf\n\nYou're being engulfed by a [water elemental](/Water_elemental \"Water elemental\") or [quicksilver elemental](/Quicksilver_elemental \"Quicksilver elemental\") and can't breathe. You'll take ongoing [asphyxiation](/Asphyxiation \"Asphyxiation\") damage and are functionally [silenced](/Silence \"Silence\") until you pull free.\n\nEngulf\n\nYou're being engulfed, but you [don't need to breathe](/Unbreathing \"Unbreathing\"), so it has no effect.\n\n### Fast+Slow\n\nFast+Slow\n\nYou are both magically [slowed](/Slow \"Slow\") and [hastened](/Haste \"Haste\"), and thus act at normal speed.\n\n### Fear\n\nFear\n\nCharacters suffering from [fear](/Fear \"Fear\") are unable to move toward the source of their terror (they can still attack it, but may flinch away if attacking in melee) and are unable to go [berserk](/Berserk \"Berserk\"). Monsters suffering from fear will flee from you until they hit a dead end, until you attack them, or until enough time passes.\n\n### Fire Vulnerable\n\nrF-\n\nYou're down one rank of [fire resistance](/Fire_resistance \"Fire resistance\"). Watch out for sources of fire damage!\n\n### Flayed\n\nFlay\n\nYou're suffering from the illusory wounds of a [flayed ghost](/Flayed_ghost \"Flayed ghost\"). You'll still die if you hit 0 HP, but you can kill the ghost or escape from its [line of sight](/Line_of_sight \"Line of sight\") for a while to get your HP back.\n\n### Frozen\n\nFrozen\n\n[Frozen](/Frozen \"Frozen\") characters are partially encased in ice, increasing their [movement delay](/Movement_delay \"Movement delay\") by 4 [auts](/Actions \"Actions\") for the duration of the effect.\n\n### Held\n\nHeld\n\nSimilar to constriction, being [held](/Held \"Held\") prevents creatures from moving but doesn't do any damage. Attempt to move or [blink](/Blink \"Blink\") to break free.\n\nHeld\n\nCreatures stuck in a [web](/Web \"Web\") or a [throwing net](/Throwing_net \"Throwing net\") can't move or attack and are vulnerable to stabbing. They may still cast spells.\n\n### Horrified\n\nHorr-X Horr-X\n\nFollowers of [Ru](/Ru \"Ru\") who have sacrificed their courage gain penalties to accuracy, damage, and spellpower when in the presence of dangerous foes.\n\n### Inner Flame\n\nCasting [Inner Flame](/Inner_Flame \"Inner Flame\") on an enemy will cause it to explode violently upon death.\n\n### Lava\n\nLava\n\nYou're flying over [lava](/Lava \"Lava\"). Try not to fall in.\n\n### Leda's Liquefaction\n\nSlowM\n\nCreatures stuck in the liquid ground from [Leda's Liquefaction](/Leda%27s_Liquefaction \"Leda's Liquefaction\") move slowly and have difficulty attacking in melee.\n\n### Magic Contamination\n\nContam Contam Contam Contam Contam\n\nUsing certain beneficial status effects, miscasting spells, standing in [mutagenic fog](/Cloud \"Cloud\"), or stepping in [Zot traps](/Zot_trap \"Zot trap\") can induce [magic contamination](/Magic_contamination \"Magic contamination\"). While a low (dark or light grey) dose of this is harmless, higher amounts make you [glow](/Glow \"Glow\") and can inflict dangerous [miscast effects](/Miscast_effect \"Miscast effect\") and [bad mutations](/Bad_mutations \"Bad mutations\") on you. See the [magic contamination](/Magic_contamination \"Magic contamination\") page for more details.\n\n### Mark\n\nMark\n\nAll conscious monsters on the floor know your location and have an easier time getting to you until the [mark](/Sentinel%27s_Mark \"Sentinel's Mark\") wears off. This can be very dangerous on unexplored floors or floors with powerful bosses. You can get this effect from [alarm traps](/Alarm_trap \"Alarm trap\") and [vault sentinels](/Vault_sentinel \"Vault sentinel\").\n\n### Mesmerised\n\nMesm\n\nWhen [mesmerised](/Mesmerise \"Mesmerise\"), you will be unable to move away from the source of your mesmerisation, until you've killed it, lost sight of it, or broken the effect some other way.\n\n### No Potions\n\n-Potion\n\nYou cannot drink potions for the duration. It is gained from the [Ru](/Ru \"Ru\") sacrifice, being in [Cocytus](/Cocytus \"Cocytus\"), a [pie](/Throw_Klown_Pie \"Throw Klown Pie\") from a [Killer Klown](/Killer_Klown \"Killer Klown\"), or casting [Ozocubu's Refrigeration](/Ozocubu%27s_Refrigeration \"Ozocubu's Refrigeration\").\n\n### No Scrolls\n\n-Scroll\n\nYou cannot use scrolls for several turns. This status mostly comes from a [mutation](/Mutation \"Mutation\"), after taking heavy damage or being hurt while at low HP. The smoke of [Gehenna](/Gehenna \"Gehenna\") also inflicts -Scroll.\n\n### Orb\n\nOrb\n\nYou're in the [Realm of Zot](/Realm_of_Zot \"Realm of Zot\"), or perhaps even carrying the [Orb of Zot](/Orb_of_Zot \"Orb of Zot\") itself. Your [teleports](/Teleport \"Teleport\") are delayed, and [Passage of Golubria](/Passage_of_Golubria \"Passage of Golubria\") will function wildly.\n\n### Paralysis\n\nPara\n\nAnything suffering from [paralysis](/Paralysis \"Paralysis\") will be unable to act for several turns, loses almost all ability to [dodge](/Evasion \"Evasion\") attacks, and is vulnerable to [stabbing](/Stab \"Stab\").\n\n### Petrifying/Petrified\n\nPetr Stone\n\n[Petrification](/Petrification \"Petrification\") is a two-stage status effect. While petrifying, the victim is [slowed](/Slow \"Slow\"). Once fully petrified, the target is rendered incapable of acting or [dodging](/Evasion \"Evasion\") attacks, gains large bonuses to [AC](/AC \"AC\") and [GDR](/GDR \"GDR\"), stops [flying](/Fly \"Fly\"), and becomes vulnerable to [Lee's Rapid Deconstruction](/Lee%27s_Rapid_Deconstruction \"Lee's Rapid Deconstruction\") and [stabbing](/Stabbing \"Stabbing\") for several turns.\n\n### Poison\n\nPois Pois Pois\n\n[Poison](/Poison \"Poison\") causes you to take damage as time progresses. The darker the colour, the more rapidly you'll take damage and the more you'll take overall.\n\nPois\n\nCharacters who enter [Lich Form](/Necromutation \"Necromutation\"), [Statue Form](/Statue_Form \"Statue Form\"), or [vampires](/Vampire \"Vampire\") who become [bloodless](#Starving) while poisoned will delay the progress of the poison until the transformation ends.\n\n### Sapped Magic\n\nSap\n\nYou've had your magic disrupted by a [warmonger](/Warmonger \"Warmonger\"); each time you try casting a spell, there's a chance your spell failure rate will increase.\n\n-Wiz -Wiz -Wiz\n\nYour spells have grown harder to cast.\n\n### Sickness\n\nSick Sick Sick\n\nSickness causes you to stop regenerating [HP](/HP \"HP\").\n\n### Silence\n\nSil\n\nBeing under an enemy's [silence](/Silence \"Silence\") [aura](/Aura \"Aura\") renders you unable to cast spells, read [scrolls](/Scrolls \"Scrolls\"), or use divine abilities.\n\n### Sleep\n\n[Sleeping](/Sleep \"Sleep\") creatures are unable to act, are almost incapable of [dodging](/Evasion \"Evasion\") attacks, and are vulnerable to [stabbing](/Stab \"Stab\"). However, they will eventually wake up on their own, and may wake up early if they hear loud [noises](/Noise \"Noise\") or get injured. Having high [stealth](/Stealth \"Stealth\") makes you less likely to wake up sleeping monsters.\n\n### Slow\n\nSlow\n\nSlow creatures take 150% as long as normal to perform actions.\n\n### Sluggish\n\n-Swift\n\nYour [Swiftness](/Swiftness \"Swiftness\") wore off, and now you have to spend several turns moving slower than normal.\n\n### Stat Zero\n\nCollapse Clumsy Brainless\n\nAt least one of your [stats](/Stats \"Stats\") has hit [zero](/Stat_zero \"Stat zero\") or less. This immediately causes 2-5 turns of [paralysis](/Paralysis \"Paralysis\") and inflicts you with an array of debilitating effects dependent on the stat involved. Try to get it above zero as soon as possible!\n\n### Sticky Flame\n\nFire\n\nCasting [Sticky Flame](/Sticky_Flame \"Sticky Flame\") will cover the target in napalm, causing them to take [fire](/Fire \"Fire\") damage each turn and making them [glow](/Glow \"Glow\"). Standing in [shallow water](/Shallow_water \"Shallow water\") can put the flames out.\n\n### Still Winds\n\n-Clouds\n\nA [servant of whispers](/Servant_of_whispers \"Servant of whispers\") has cast [a spell](/Still_Winds \"Still Winds\") that prevents [clouds](/Cloud \"Cloud\") from forming for the duration.\n\n### Teleport Prevention\n\n-Tele\n\nCertain monsters can cast [Dimension Anchor](/Dimension_Anchor \"Dimension Anchor\"), which will prevent you from [blinking](/Blink \"Blink\") or [teleporting](/Teleport \"Teleport\") for a few turns. Rare [artefact](/Artefact \"Artefact\") weapons also give this effect. This can also occur from high level [Translocation](/Translocation \"Translocation\") miscasts.\n\n### Umbra\n\n[Profane servitors](/Profane_servitor \"Profane servitor\"), followers of [Dithmenos](/Dithmenos \"Dithmenos\"), and the [ring of Shadows](/Ring_of_Shadows \"Ring of Shadows\") emit an [umbra](/Aura#Umbra \"Aura\") which increases stealth and reduces the accuracy of all attacks except from demons, undead, and followers of Dithmenos or [Yredelemnul](/Yredelemnul \"Yredelemnul\").\n\n### Vulnerable\n\nWill/2\n\nReading a [scroll of vulnerability](/Scroll_of_vulnerability \"Scroll of vulnerability\") will reduce the [willpower](/Willpower \"Willpower\") of everything in your [line of sight](/Line_of_sight \"Line of sight\") (including you) by half. [Phantasmal warriors](/Phantasmal_warrior \"Phantasmal warrior\") can attack to make their targets vulnerable.\n\n### Water\n\nWater Water\n\nYou're either standing in, or flying over [shallow water](/Shallow_water \"Shallow water\") or [deep water](/Deep_water \"Deep water\").\n\n### Weak\n\nWeak\n\nPhysical weakness reduces the damage of your melee attacks by 25% (or 33% for monsters).\n\n## History\n\n- [Yred](/Yred \"Yred\")'s pain mirror was removed in [0.28](/0.28 \"0.28\").\n- In [0.27](/0.27 \"0.27\"), [Ashenzari](/Ashenzari \"Ashenzari\")'s active scry was removed, a new cast status for [Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling](/Maxwell%27s_Capacitive_Coupling \"Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling\") was added, and [Tornado](/Tornado \"Tornado\") / -Tornado was replaced with [Polar Vortex](/Polar_Vortex \"Polar Vortex\").\n- Prior to [0.26](/0.26 \"0.26\"), various [Charms](/Charms \"Charms\") spells would give statuses; [Darkness](/Darkness \"Darkness\"), [Deflect Missiles](/Deflect_Missiles \"Deflect Missiles\") (DMsl), [Regeneration](/Regeneration \"Regeneration\"), and [Shroud of Golubria](/Shroud_of_Golubria \"Shroud of Golubria\"). The [food](/Food \"Food\") system also had several different hunger states on the status bar.\n- Prior to [0.20](/0.20 \"0.20\"), casting [Delayed Fireball](/Delayed_Fireball \"Delayed Fireball\") gave you the Delayed Fireball status.\n- Prior to [0.19](/0.19 \"0.19\"), there was a Telepathy status, granted by the [Dowsing card](/Dowsing_card \"Dowsing card\"), and a Stealthy status, bestowed by a high-level [Shadow card](/Shadow_card \"Shadow card\"). Followers of [Jiyva](/Jiyva \"Jiyva\") could gain the Pray status to stop their jellies from consuming items.\n- In [0.18](/0.18 \"0.18\"), a s(T)atus effect lookup has been added to ?/. Prior to 0.18, there were also [Stoneskin](/Stoneskin \"Stoneskin\"), [Condensation Shield](/Condensation_Shield \"Condensation Shield\"), and [Phase Shift](/Phase_Shift \"Phase Shift\").\n- Prior to [0.17](/0.17 \"0.17\"), the [teleport control](/Teleport_control \"Teleport control\") status existed, conferred through either a [spell](/Control_Teleport \"Control Teleport\") or a [ring](/Ring_of_teleport_control \"Ring of teleport control\"). There were also areas which would prevent controlled teleports. In addition, there was a Sure Blade status, granted by the [Sure Blade](/Sure_Blade \"Sure Blade\") spell, and [Bleeding](/Bleeding \"Bleeding\"), an HP-sapping status inflicted by attacking with [claws](/Claws \"Claws\").\n- [Corrosion](/Corrosion \"Corrosion\") was added in [0.15](/0.15 \"0.15\").\n- Prior to [0.12](/0.12 \"0.12\"), there was a Rot status, which inflicted an ongoing reduction to maximum HP.\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\"/>\n<title>Status effects -

effects''' are temporary enhancements and ailments that both you and the inhabitants of [[the Dungeon]] can benefit or suffer from. Unlike [[mutation]]s, status effects will run their course after enough time has passed or after you escape whatever's inflicting the effect. Many status effects can be cured or prevented in a variety of ways; see their individual pages for details. There are also in-game descriptions of statuses available (hit '''?''', then '''/''', then '''t''' for sTatus, then type in the indicator text you see).\n\nMost status effects will display a coloured (often abbreviated) word in your character information for as long as they last. Status effects that have a limited duration will often turn a darker colour as the effect nears its end, whereas other status effects use a darker colour to indicate increasing severity of the effect.\n\n==Beneficial Status Effects==\n===Agile===\n{{LightBlue|Agil}}\n\n[[Demonspawn]] with [[Powered by Pain]] may give you agility, which boosts [[dexterity]], [[stealth]], and [[evasion]].\n\n===Alive===\n{{Green|Alive}}\n\nAlive [[Vampire]]s have fast [[Regeneration rate]], can use [[Transformation]]s, and can go [[berserk]].\n\n===Augmentation===\n{{Blue|Aug}} {{LightBlue|Aug}} {{White|Aug}}\n\n[[Demonspawn]] with the Augmentation [[demonspawn mutation]] gain [[slaying]] and [[spell power]] bonuses as their HP rises. The brighter the colour of the effect, the larger the bonus.\n\n===Berserk===\n{{LightBlue|Berserk}}\n\nYou have gone [[berserk]], gaining a huge boost to [[HP]], [[Might|melee damage]], and [[Haste|speed]]. Just watch out for the crash afterward.\n\n===Black Mark===\nCreatures with the [[black mark]] status apply [[draining]], [[slow]]ness, or [[antimagic]] to creatures they hit in melee. The player version from the [[demonspawn]] [[Black Mark (mutation)|mutation]] only activates on 20% of hits.\n\n===Bloodless===\n{{LightRed|Bloodless}}\n\nBloodless [[Vampire]]s have less maximum health and don't regenerate when monsters are visible. Instead they get a [[Stealth]] boost, [[vampiric]] bite, the full set of [[undead]] resistances, and an ability to turn into a bat.\n\n===Brilliant===\n{{LightBlue|Brill}}\n\nQuaffing a [[potion of brilliance]] will give you a bonus to [[spell power]] and halve the MP cost of spells.\n\n===Charging===\n{{LightBlue|Charge-|}}\n\nYou're casting [[Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling]]; press '''.''' to keep it coming. The - cycles between (-, /, |, \\) in a counterclockwise motion, though where you start with is random.\n\n===Confusing Touch===\n{{LightBlue|Touch}}\n\nCasting [[Confusing Touch]] will imbue your hands with strange energy, causing your melee attacks to [[confusion|confuse]] the enemy.\n\n===Death Channel===\n{{LightMagenta|DChan}}\n\nAny living creature you kill while under the effect of [[Death Channel]] will rise as a [[spectral thing]] to serve you.\n\n===Death's Door===\n{{White|DDoor}}\n\nCasting [[Death's Door]] will render you temporarily invulnerable, but reduces your [[HP]] to almost nothing and leaves you unable to cast again for a short period.\n\n===Disjunction===\n{{LightBlue|Disjoin}}\n\nCasting [[Disjunction]] causes all enemies around you to [[blink]] away, with a success rate that rises as they approach you.\n\n===Divine Protection===\n{{White|Prot}}\n\n[[Elyvilon]]'s Divine Protection ability will render you invulnerable to any attack that would otherwise kill you, though at a significant cost to [[piety]] each time it triggers.\n\n===Divine Shield===\n[[The Shining One]] is protecting you from attacks, boosting your [[Shield (stat)|blocking defense]] for a brief time.\n\n===Finesse===\n{{LightBlue|Finesse}}\n\n[[Okawaru]]'s Finesse ability doubles the speed of all of your physical attacks.\n\n===Flight===\n{{LightBlue|Fly}}\n\nYou're airborne! You can travel over impassable terrain, take less damage from [[Shatter]], and take more damage from [[Airstrike]].\n\n{{Blue|Fly}}\n\nYour flight is nearly over. Get to solid ground, or drink another [[potion of flight]] to keep going.\n\n{{LightRed|Fly}}\n\nYour flight should have ended, but that would've dropped you in some sort of deep liquid and killed you. The strain of staying airborne will keep [[draining]] you until you reach land, so do that pronto!\n\n{{White|Fly}}\n\nYour flight is limitless! End it whenever you want.\n\n===Haste===\n{{LightBlue|Fast}}\n\nAll actions performed by a [[haste]]d creature take 66% as long as normal to complete.\n\n===Heavenly Storm===\n{{White|Storm (X)}}\n\nUsing [[Wu Jian]]'s Heavenly Storm ability gives you a huge [[slaying]] bonus (indicated by the number represented by X) and constantly generates opaque [[cloud]]s around you. Using your martial attacks increases your slaying bonus, but doing anything else decreases the bonus until it reaches 0, at which point the storm expires.\n\n===Heroism===\n{{LightBlue|Hero}}\n\n[[Okawaru]]'s Heroism ability gives you a +5 bonus to all non-magical skills.\n\n===Invisibility===\n{{LightBlue|Invis}}\n\n[[Invisible]] characters are given bonuses in combat when fighting monsters that can't [[see invisible]]. Invisible monsters are difficult to detect and gain similar bonuses when attacking you.\n\n{{LightMagenta|Invis}}\n\nYou turned invisible using a piece of magical equipment. This equipment is reusable, though inflicts [[drain]] in the process.\n\n{{DarkGrey|Invis}}\n\nYou're technically still invisible, but monsters can still see you because you're [[glowing]] or standing in [[shallow water]] or [[cloud]]s.\n\n===Leda's Liquefaction===\n{{LightBlue|Liquid}}\n\nCasting [[Leda's Liquefaction]] will convert the ground all around you into a soupy mess. This reduces the movement rate and melee attack success rate of anything stuck in it (including you!)\n\n===Might===\n{{LightBlue|Might}}\n\nQuaffing a [[potion of might]] will give you a 1d10 bonus to melee damage.\n\n===Olgreb's Toxic Radiance===\n{{LightMagenta|Toxic}}\n\nCasting [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] [[poison]]s everything in your [[LOS]] each turn for a few turns.\n\n===Ozocubu's Armour===\nCasting [[Ozocubu's Armour]] will cover you in a sheet of protective ice, boosting [[AC]]. It breaks if you move, though.\n\n===Powered by Death===\n{{LightMagenta|Regen (X)}}\n\n[[Demonspawn]] with the Powered by Death [[demonspawn mutation]] will recover [[HP]] faster after killing monsters. The number (marked by the 'X') indicates how much faster you heal.\n\n===Quad Damage===\n{{LightBlue|Quad}}\n\nUsing a [[quad damage]] will multiply your damage output by 4. Only found in [[Dungeon Sprint]].\n\n===Recall===\n{{White|Recall}}\n\nUsing a [[Recall]] ability will cause allied units to [[teleport]] to your location over time.\n\n===Repel Missiles===\n{{LightBlue|RMsl}}\n\nCreatures that [[repel missiles]] are harder to hit with ranged attacks. Players don't see the temporary status effect anymore, but monsters can still have it.\n\n{{White|RMsl}}\n\nThis effect is permanent, usually due to wearing a [[scarf]] of repulsion or following [[Qazlal]].\n\n===Resistance===\n{{LightBlue|Resist}}\n\nQuaffing a [[potion of resistance]] will grant you resistance to [[fire]], [[cold]], [[electricity]], [[poison]], and [[acid]] for a short time.\n\n===Ring of Flames===\n{{LightBlue|RoF}}\n\nWearing the [[salamander hide armour]] will surround you with [[fire]] [[cloud]]s, boost your fire resistance, and enhance the [[spell power]] of your [[Fire Magic]], but renders you very vulnerable to [[cold]].\n\n===Searing Ray===\n{{White|Ray}} {{White|Ray+}} {{White|Ray++}}\n\nYou're casting [[Searing Ray]] and still have more turns of laser to dish out. Press '''.''' to keep it coming.\n\n====Flame Wave====\n{{White|Wave}} {{White|Wave+}} {{White|Wave++}}\n[[Flame Wave]] uses the same casting mechanic as Searing Ray.\n\n===Serpent's Lash===\n{{White|Lash (X)}}\n\nUsing [[Wu Jian]]'s Serpent's Lash ability gives you two turns of free movement (the X represents how many turns you have left). Your martial attacks are much stronger during this period, but you become [[exhausted]] after the ability ends.\n\n===Silence===\nWhile you are emitting a [[silence]] [[aura]], most creatures (including you) caught in its effect will be unable to cast spells, read [[scroll]]s, or use divine abilities. Certain abilities can't be silenced, and [[demon]]s ignore the effects of silence.\n\n===Slimify===\n{{LightGreen|Slime}}\n\n[[Jiyva]]'s Slimify ability will make your next melee attack that hits turn your target into a [[list of jellies|jelly]].\n\n===Swiftness===\n{{LightBlue|Swift}} \n\nThe [[Swiftness]] spell increases your movement speed for a while, but then makes you [[#Sluggish|sluggish]] for a while.\n\n{{Blue|Swift}}\n\nYour increased speed is nearly over and you'll start moving slowly soon.\n\n{{DarkGrey|Swift}}\n\nYou are knee deep in water and slow down to normal wading speed.\n\n===Teleport===\n{{LightBlue|Tele}}\n\nYou are going to [[teleport]] in the next few turns. Generate another teleport before this one goes off to negate it. Or wear an artefact that negates all teleporting.\n\n===Transmutations===\nThere are a number of useful alternative forms you can assume, many of which are from [[Transmutations]] spells:\n\n{{LightGreen|App}}\n\n[[Beastly Appendage]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Blade}}\n\n[[Blade Hands]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Spider}}\n\n[[Spider Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Ice}}\n\n[[Ice Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Statue}}\n\n[[Statue Form]]\n\n{{LightBlue|Storm}}\n\n[[Storm Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Dragon}}\n\n[[Dragon Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Lich}}\n\n[[Necromutation]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Bat}}\n\n[[Bat Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Tree}}\n\n[[Tree Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Shadow}}\n\n[[Shadow Form]]\n\n===Vitalisation===\n{{White|Vit}}\n\n[[Zin]] is filling you with divine health, boosting your [[stat]]s and protecting you from [[stat]] damage and many negative status effects.\n\n===Polar Vortex===\n{{White|Vortex}}\n\nCasting [[Polar Vortex]] will create a raging storm around you, granting you [[flight]] and brutalizing everything within its reach, damaging them and tossing them around.\n\n==Detrimental Status Effects==\n===Antimagic===\nAs monsters are struck by [[antimagic]] weapons, they become more likely to fail to cast their spells. Players simply lose MP.\n\n===Bad Forms===\nGetting hit by an enemy's [[Polymorph]] spell will temporarily force you into one of several less-than-ideal forms:\n\n{{LightGreen|Pig}}\n\n[[Pig Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Fungus}}\n\n[[Fungus Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Porc}}\n\n[[Porcupine Form]]\n\n{{LightGreen|Wisp}}\n\n[[Wisp Form]]\n\n===Blind===\n[[Blind]] monsters will treat your character as though it were [[invisible]]. This negates any [[see invisible]] it may have.\n\n===Charm===\n[[Charm]]ed monsters will ally with you and fight on your side... for a while.\n\n===Confusion===\n{{Red|Conf}}\n\n[[Confusion|Confused]] creatures can't choose which direction to move or attack in and many actions are disabled.\n\n===Constriction===\n{{Yellow|Constr}}\n\nBeing [[constricted]] means that an enemy is crushing you each turn, dealing damage, reducing [[evasion]] and preventing you from moving. Kill it or break free by attempting to move away!\n\n===Cooldowns===\nSeveral abilities can't be used right after you've used them; most of these will wear off given enough time.\n\n{{Yellow|-Berserk}}\n\nYou're too tired to go [[berserk]] right now.\n\n{{Yellow|-Blink}}\n\nYou are still too unstable to [[blink]].\n\n{{Yellow|Breath}}\n\nYou can't use any [[draconian breath attacks]] or [[Spit Poison|naga poison spit]] for a while.\n\n{{Yellow|DDoor}}\n\nYou're too tired to cast [[Death's Door]] right now. Be extra careful -- your HP is probably still extremely low!\n\n{{Yellow|Exh}}\n\nYou are too tired to use any of [[Ru]]'s abilities or [[Wu Jian]]'s Serpent's Lash right now.\n\n{{Yellow|-Hop}}\n\nYou're too tired to [[Barachi|Hop]] again at the moment; spend some time without moving to recover.\n\n{{Yellow|-Recite}}\n\nYou can't use [[Zin]]'s Recite ability now.\n\n{{Yellow|-Vortex}}\n\nYou can't start another [[Polar Vortex]] right now.\n\n===Corona===\n{{Yellow|Corona}}\n\nThe [[Corona]] spell will render its target much easier to hit, reducing [[evasion]] and negating [[invisibility]].\n\n===Corrosion===\n{{Red|Corr -X}}\n\n[[Corrosion]] is a temporary status effect which gives a stackable -4 to [[slaying]] and [[AC]] (the number represented by X indicates how much these have been reduced) for as long as it lasts. Corrosion will be repaired after enough turns have passed. Corroded monsters simply get a temporary -8 to their AC.\n\n===Dazed===\nMonsters may become [[dazed]] after you recite the word of [[Zin]] at them, causing them to waste their turns as they recover their senses.\n\n===Doom Howl===\n{{Red|Howl}}\n\nA [[doom hound]]'s [[Doom Howl|howl]] has called nightmarish creatures to hunt you. Dangerous enemies will spawn near you every few turns until the howl fades.\n\n===Drain===\n{{LightGrey|Drain}} {{Yellow|Drain}} {{LightRed|Drain}} {{Red|Drain}}\n\n[[Negative energy]] has [[draining|withered]] you, reducing your maximum [[HP]], with darker colours indicating worse effects. Gaining XP gradually restores your health. Monsters who get drained have their [[HD]] lowered instead, reducing their strength and [[willpower]].\n\n===Engulf===\n{{Red|Engulf}}\n\nYou're being engulfed by a [[water elemental]] or [[quicksilver elemental]] and can't breathe. You'll take ongoing [[asphyxiation]] damage and are functionally [[silence]]d until you pull free.\n\n{{DarkGrey|Engulf}}\n\nYou're being engulfed, but you [[unbreathing|don't need to breathe]], so it has no effect.\n\n===Fast+Slow===\n{{Magenta|Fast+Slow}}\n\nYou are both magically [[slow]]ed and [[haste]]ned, and thus act at normal speed.\n\n===Fear===\n{{Red|Fear}}\n\nCharacters suffering from [[fear]] are unable to move toward the source of their terror (they can still attack it, but may flinch away if attacking in melee) and are unable to go [[berserk]]. Monsters suffering from fear will flee from you until they hit a dead end, until you attack them, or until enough time passes.\n\n===Fire Vulnerable===\n{{Red|rF-}}\n\nYou're down one rank of [[fire resistance]]. Watch out for sources of fire damage!\n\n===Flayed===\n{{Red|Flay}}\n\nYou're suffering from the illusory wounds of a [[flayed ghost]]. You'll still die if you hit 0 HP, but you can kill the ghost or escape from its [[line of sight]] for a while to get your HP back.\n<div id=\"frozen\"></div>\n\n===Frozen===\n{{Red|Frozen}}\n\n[[Frozen]] characters are partially encased in ice, increasing their [[movement delay]] by 4 [[actions|auts]] for the duration of the effect.\n\n===Held===\n{{Yellow|Held}}\n\nSimilar to constriction, being [[held]] prevents creatures from moving but doesn't do any damage. Attempt to move or [[blink]] to break free.\n\n{{Red|Held}}\n\nCreatures stuck in a [[web]] or a [[throwing net]] can't move or attack and are vulnerable to stabbing. They may still cast spells.\n\n===Horrified===\n{{Yellow|Horr-X}} {{Red|Horr-X}}\n\nFollowers of [[Ru]] who have sacrificed their courage gain penalties to accuracy, damage, and spellpower when in the presence of dangerous foes.\n\n===Inner Flame===\nCasting [[Inner Flame]] on an enemy will cause it to explode violently upon death.\n\n===Lava===\n{{Red|Lava}}\n\nYou're flying over [[lava]]. Try not to fall in.\n\n===Leda's Liquefaction===\n{{Brown|SlowM}}\n\nCreatures stuck in the liquid ground from [[Leda's Liquefaction]] move slowly and have difficulty attacking in melee.\n\n===Magic Contamination===\n{{DarkGrey|Contam}} {{LightGrey|Contam}} {{Yellow|Contam}} {{LightRed|Contam}} {{Red|Contam}}\n\nUsing certain beneficial status effects, miscasting spells, standing in [[cloud|mutagenic fog]], or stepping in [[Zot trap]]s can induce [[magic contamination]]. While a low (dark or light grey) dose of this is harmless, higher amounts make you [[glow]] and can inflict dangerous [[miscast effect]]s and [[bad mutations]] on you. See the [[magic contamination]] page for more details.\n\n===Mark===\n{{LightMagenta|Mark}}\n\nAll conscious monsters on the floor know your location and have an easier time getting to you until the [[Sentinel's Mark|mark]] wears off. This can be very dangerous on unexplored floors or floors with powerful bosses. You can get this effect from [[alarm trap]]s and [[vault sentinel]]s.\n\n===Mesmerised===\n{{Red|Mesm}}\n\nWhen [[mesmerise]]d, you will be unable to move away from the source of your mesmerisation, until you've killed it, lost sight of it, or broken the effect some other way.\n\n===No Potions===\n{{Red|-Potion}}\n\nYou cannot drink potions for the duration. It is gained from the [[Ru]] sacrifice, being in [[Cocytus]], a [[Throw Klown Pie|pie]] from a [[Killer Klown]], or casting [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]].\n\n===No Scrolls===\n{{Red|-Scroll}}\n\nYou cannot use scrolls for several turns. This status mostly comes from a [[mutation]], after taking heavy damage or being hurt while at low HP. The smoke of [[Gehenna]] also inflicts -Scroll.\n\n===Orb===\n{{LightMagenta|Orb}}\n\nYou're in the [[Realm of Zot]], or perhaps even carrying the [[Orb of Zot]] itself. Your [[teleport]]s are delayed, and [[Passage of Golubria]] will function wildly.\n\n===Paralysis===\n{{Red|Para}}\n\nAnything suffering from [[paralysis]] will be unable to act for several turns, loses almost all ability to [[Evasion|dodge]] attacks, and is vulnerable to [[stab]]bing.\n\n===Petrifying/Petrified===\n{{LightRed|Petr}} {{Red|Stone}}\n\n[[Petrification]] is a two-stage status effect. While petrifying, the victim is [[slow]]ed. Once fully petrified, the target is rendered incapable of acting or [[Evasion|dodging]] attacks, gains large bonuses to [[AC]] and [[GDR]], stops [[fly]]ing, and becomes vulnerable to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] and [[stabbing]] for several turns.\n\n===Poison===\n{{Yellow|Pois}} {{LightRed|Pois}} {{Red|Pois}}\n\n[[Poison]] causes you to take damage as time progresses. The darker the colour, the more rapidly you'll take damage and the more you'll take overall.\n\n{{DarkGrey|Pois}}\n\nCharacters who enter [[Necromutation|Lich Form]], [[Statue Form]], or [[vampire]]s who become [[#Starving|bloodless]] while poisoned will delay the progress of the poison until the transformation ends.\n\n===Sapped Magic===\n{{Red|Sap}}\n\nYou've had your magic disrupted by a [[warmonger]]; each time you try casting a spell, there's a chance your spell failure rate will increase.\n\n{{Yellow|-Wiz}} {{LightRed|-Wiz}} {{Red|-Wiz}}\n\nYour spells have grown harder to cast.\n\n===Sickness===\n{{Yellow|Sick}} {{LightRed|Sick}} {{Red|Sick}}\n\nSickness causes you to stop regenerating [[HP]].\n\n===Silence===\n{{LightMagenta|Sil}}\n\nBeing under an enemy's [[silence]] [[aura]] renders you unable to cast spells, read [[scrolls]], or use divine abilities.\n\n===Sleep===\n[[Sleep]]ing creatures are unable to act, are almost incapable of [[Evasion|dodging]] attacks, and are vulnerable to [[stab]]bing. However, they will eventually wake up on their own, and may wake up early if they hear loud [[noise]]s or get injured. Having high [[stealth]] makes you less likely to wake up sleeping monsters.\n\n===Slow===\n{{Red|Slow}}\n\nSlow creatures take 150% as long as normal to perform actions.\n\n===Sluggish===\n{{Red|-Swift}}\n\nYour [[Swiftness]] wore off, and now you have to spend several turns moving slower than normal.\n\n===Stat Zero===\n{{Red|Collapse}} {{Red|Clumsy}} {{Red|Brainless}}\n\nAt least one of your [[stats]] has hit [[stat zero|zero]] or less. This immediately causes 2-5 turns of [[paralysis]] and inflicts you with an array of debilitating effects dependent on the stat involved. Try to get it above zero as soon as possible!\n\n===Sticky Flame===\n{{Red|Fire}}\n\nCasting [[Sticky Flame]] will cover the target in napalm, causing them to take [[fire]] damage each turn and making them [[glow]]. Standing in [[shallow water]] can put the flames out.\n\n===Still Winds===\n{{Brown|-Clouds}}\n\nA [[servant of whispers]] has cast [[Still Winds|a spell]] that prevents [[cloud]]s from forming for the duration.\n\n===Teleport Prevention===\n{{Red|-Tele}}\n\nCertain monsters can cast [[Dimension Anchor]], which will prevent you from [[blink]]ing or [[teleport]]ing for a few turns. Rare [[artefact]] weapons also give this effect. This can also occur from high level [[Translocation]] miscasts.\n\n===Umbra===\n[[Profane servitor]]s, followers of [[Dithmenos]], and the [[ring of Shadows]] emit an [[Aura#Umbra|umbra]] which increases stealth and reduces the accuracy of all attacks except from demons, undead, and followers of Dithmenos or [[Yredelemnul]].\n\n===Vulnerable===\n{{Red|Will/2}}\n\nReading a [[scroll of vulnerability]] will reduce the [[willpower]] of everything in your [[line of sight]] (including you) by half. [[Phantasmal warrior]]s can attack to make their targets vulnerable.\n\n===Water===\n{{LightBlue|Water}} {{Blue|Water}}\n\nYou're either standing in, or flying over [[shallow water]] or [[deep water]].\n\n===Weak===\n{{Red|Weak}}\n\nPhysical weakness reduces the damage of your melee attacks by 25% (or 33% for monsters).\n\n==History==\n*[[Yred]]'s pain mirror was removed in [[0.28]].\n*In [[0.27]], [[Ashenzari]]'s active scry was removed, a new cast status for [[Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling]] was added, and [[Tornado]] / -Tornado was replaced with [[Polar Vortex]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], various [[Charms]] spells would give statuses; [[Darkness]], [[Deflect Missiles]] (DMsl), [[Regeneration]], and [[Shroud of Golubria]]. The [[food]] system also had several different hunger states on the status bar.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], casting [[Delayed Fireball]] gave you the Delayed Fireball status.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], there was a Telepathy status, granted by the [[Dowsing card]], and a Stealthy status, bestowed by a high-level [[Shadow card]]. Followers of [[Jiyva]] could gain the Pray status to stop their jellies from consuming items.\n*In [[0.18]], a s(T)atus effect lookup has been added to ?/. Prior to 0.18, there were also [[Stoneskin]], [[Condensation Shield]], and [[Phase Shift]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], the [[teleport control]] status existed, conferred through either a [[Control Teleport|spell]] or a [[ring of teleport control|ring]]. There were also areas which would prevent controlled teleports. In addition, there was a Sure Blade status, granted by the [[Sure Blade]] spell, and [[Bleeding]], an HP-sapping status inflicted by attacking with [[claws]].\n*[[Corrosion]] was added in [[0.15]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], there was a Rot status, which inflicted an ongoing reduction to maximum HP.\n\n[[Category:Status effects]]"}

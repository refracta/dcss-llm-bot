They can be found in the [[Pandemonium]] and guarding it's portals in the [[Depths]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nTry to get them in an area without [[corpse]]s, as nearby corpses will increase their regeneration rate. Try not to use poison against them unless you have access to lethal poison, since they have weak [[poison resistance]]. Like all demonspawn, they are also vulnerable to holy weapons and [[silver]], so use those if you have them.\n\n==History==\n*Putrid demonspawn were removed in [[0.19]]\n*Putrid demonspawn were added in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Demonspawn]]"}

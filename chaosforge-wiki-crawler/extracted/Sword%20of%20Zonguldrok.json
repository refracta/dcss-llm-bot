Those slain in its presence are reanimated by its power and forced to fight on.\n\nAny living foe damaged by it may be reanimated upon death as a zombie friendly to the wielder, with an increasing chance as more damage is dealt}}\n[[File:Sword_of_zonguldrok.png]] '''''the +9 Sword of Zonguldrok'''''<br>\n\n+9 [[double sword]]\n\n[[Reaping]] brand<br>\n[[Evil]]\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''sword of Zonguldrok'''<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|art-data.txt|325}}</ref> is a good weapon, but not a amazing one. Without a damage-dealing brand, it is less consistent than a well-enchanted/branded [[demon blade]] or [[double sword]]. The friendly zombies can be useful, but if you aren't wearing heavy armour, [[Animate Dead]] can replicate that effect. The lack of corpses also means the lack of [[dragon scales]] or [[troll leather armour]], though you can swap weapons if need be.\n\nThe sword of Zonguldrok can always be found in [[Zonguldrok's Shrine]] if it has not already generated elsewhere.\n\n===Prevents===\n*Due to the fact that it passively uses a [[Necromancy|necromantic]] effect each turn, even wielding it is enough to offend the [[good god]]s.\n*[[Yredelemnul]] already reaps zombies, so the reaping brand is useless.\n*[[Gozag]] and [[Okawaru]] prevent reaping entirely.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], reaping did not deny [[death drop]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.26]] and the removal of the food/hunger system, having all slain monsters turned into zombies could create food problems.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the sword created hostile undead in your LOS, was [[cursed]], and would recurse itself when wielded (33.3% chance). \n*Prior to [[0.9]], this artefact was a [[long sword]].\n\n== References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Long blades]]"}

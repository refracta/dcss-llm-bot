It can also be used as a melee weapon, with magical effects.\n\n==Useful Info==\nMagical staves are [[spell enhancer]]s, increasing [[spell power]] of a given school by up to x150%. Due to a [[Spell power#Stepdown|stepdown]] in calculations, you'll generally receive less than x150%, especially if power is already high. This stacks multiplicatively with other spell enhancers, up to 3.\n\nUnlike normal weapons, magical staves cannot be enchanted or [[brand]]ed in any way. Instead, they can deal elemental damage, based on skill in [[Evocations]] and the corresponding [[magic school]].\n\n{{crawlquote|'''Damage Dealt''': 0 to 1.25×(School+[Evocations/2])<br>'''Chance to Activate''': (Evocations + School/2)×6.66% per hit}}\n\n*[[Staff of fire]] ([[Fire Magic]]): [[Fire]] damage, grants [[fire resistance|rF+]].\n*[[Staff of cold]] ([[Ice Magic]]): [[Cold]] damage, grants [[cold resistance|rC+]].\n*[[Staff of earth]] ([[Earth Magic]]): Physical damage (+20% more than usual), which [[fly]]ing enemies resist.\n*[[Staff of air]] ([[Air Magic]]): [[Electricity]] damage, grants [[electricity resistance|rElec]].\n*[[Staff of poison|Staff of alchemy]] ([[Alchemy]]): <code>50 + [[Alchemy]]×12.5</code>% chance to [[poison]] the target (can even affect poison-resistant living targets, but has to pass a Skill/16 chance), grants [[poison resistance|rPois]].\n*[[Staff of death]] ([[Necromancy]]): <code>12.5 + [[Necromancy]]×12.5</code>% chance of [[negative energy]] damage (does not affect targets with [[negative energy resistance]] or [[drain]] the target), grants [[negative energy resistance|rN+]].\n*[[Staff of conjuration]] ([[Conjurations]]): Irresistible damage. No resistance.\n\n[[Randart]] staves can boost multiple different types of spells.\n\n[[Unrandart]] staves are classified as weapons in the inventory screen rather than magical staves, whether or not they add any enhancers.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Standard''' || [[File:Magic staff 1.png]] [[File:Magic staff 2.png]] [[File:Magic staff 3.png]] [[File:Magic staff 4.png]] [[File:Magic staff 5.png]]<br>[[File:Magic staff 6.png]] [[File:Magic staff 7.png]] [[File:Magic staff 8.png]] [[File:Magic staff 9.png]] [[File:Magic staff 10.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artefact''' || [[File:Artefact magic staff 1.png]] [[File:Artefact magic staff 2.png]] [[File:Artefact magic staff 3.png]] [[File:Artefact magic staff 4.png]] [[File:Artefact magic staff 5.png]]<br>[[File:Artefact magic staff 6.png]] [[File:Artefact magic staff 7.png]]\n|-\n! ||  '''[[Unrandarts|Unrandart]]'''\n|-\n| '''[[Staff of Olgreb]]''' || [[File:New staff of olgreb.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Elemental Staff]]''' || [[File:New elemental staff.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], randart magical staves couldn't boost multiple spell schools.\n*Prior to [[0.30]], magical staves could not be [[randart]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], magical staves could be [[cursed]], like other weapons.\n*In [[0.26]], [[staff of summoning|staves of summoning]], [[staff of wizardry|wizardry]], and [[staff of energy|energy]] were removed. Staves of conjuration got the melee effect of staves of earth (irresistible damage that's reduced by [[AC]] once); staves of earth got a higher base damage, but with the shrapnel effect of being affected 3 times by [[AC]].\n*In [[0.25]], [[staff of power|staves of power]] were removed.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], staves of fire, earth, air, and cold would act as negative [[spell enhancer]]s for their opposing elemental school.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], staves of summoning granted the [[warding]] property.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], staves of summoning could abjure summoned creatures in melee.\n*In [[0.13]], the [[Staff of channeling]] was removed. Its ability to channel MP was given to [[Staff of energy|staves of energy]].\n*In [[0.12]], the [[Staff of enchantment]], which enhanced the power of [[Hexes]] and [[Charms]], was removed.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], the chance of a magical staff auto-identifying when wielded depended on the skill of the wielder in its corresponding school (or [[Spellcasting]] if none applied).\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Staves]]\n*[[Rods]] and [[List of rods]]\n*[[Evocable items#Staves|Evocable staves]]\n*[[List_of_unrands#Staves|Unrandart staves]]\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Items]] [[Category:Magic]] [[Category:Magical staves]]"}

It will place 16-22 butterflies within a 2-tile radius from you, and 12-28 butterflies within a 5-tile radius.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-summoning.cc|1058}}</ref> It also knocks back nearby enemies.\n\nThis scroll is [[alternate items|mutually exclusive]] with the [[scroll of summoning]]; only one of the two scrolls may spawn in any given game.\n\n==Tips and Tricks==\n*Butterflies are great at blocking attacks and distracting enemies. Note that butterflies are [[ev]]asive, for better or worse. E.g. monsters with ranged weapons may miss your butterflies, hitting you anyways. \n*Since the scroll blows enemies away, it allows you to disengage without facing [[attacks of opportunity]].\n*Like all summons, butterflies can be affected by a [[scroll of immolation]], but their sporadic movement means that you always run the risk of taking a few fiery explosions to the face.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], scrolls of butterflies alternated with the [[scroll of fog]] rather than the scroll of summoning. The scroll was more common, but created fewer butterflies (10-20 butterflies total) and did not knock back enemies.\n*Scrolls of butterflies were introduced in [[0.29]]. They replicate the effects of the removed spell [[Summon Butterflies]], though the scroll spawns more butterflies.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

{"title":"Obsidian statue","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Obsidian_statue","type":"raw","data":"{{version023}}\n\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Obsidian statues''' are stationary monsters that attack by summoning [[Tier-3 demon|3]], [[Tier-4 demon|4]] and [[Tier-5 demon|5]] [[demon]]s when you enter their [[LOS]]. They are highly resistant to most forms of attack, but can be quickly dispatched through use of the spells [[Shatter]] or [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]]. Their ability to summon demons is unaffected by [[silence]]. Fortunately, they are very rare, appearing only to guard the occasional treasure vault.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Aura of Abjuration]] can help with the hordes of summoned demons.\n*Although obsidian statues are very resistant to elemental magic, powerful Earth Magic spells can take them out quickly. [[Iron Shot]] and [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] are especially effective.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], obsidian statues could not cast [[Mesmerise]], nor could they [[See Invisible]].\n*Obsidian statues were added in [[0.16]], replacing [[silver statue]]s."}

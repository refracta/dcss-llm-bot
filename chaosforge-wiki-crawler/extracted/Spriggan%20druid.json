They can enrage [[tree]]s in their vicinity, damaging foes that stay adjacent to a tree. Druids can also bring animals to their location, and attack you with magic of their own. They can be found in [[the Swamp]], as well as in spriggan-themed vaults.\n\nWhen a spriggan druid dies, 3-6 [[monster intelligence|animal-intelligence]] monsters in its sight are healed for 3d11 HP and gain the [[might]] effect for 10-16 turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-death.cc|1285}}</ref>\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Fighting a spriggan druid near trees can be dangerous. If possible, try to lure it away from trees, or burn them down with powerful [[Fire Magic]].\n*Druids are relatively fragile; try to kill them quickly, before they can bring animals with Druid's Call.\n*If at all possible, try to kill druids without any animals in its sight. [[Might]]ed [[hydra]]s and [[bunyip]]s can really hurt.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], you could meet several '''young spriggan druids''' in the spriggan forest end vault. They had lower [[HD]], but could cast the same spells as regular druids. They were replaced with [[boggart]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], spriggan druids knew [[Sunray]] and [[Haste Plants]] in place of Stone Arrow, and they did not buff nearby animals upon death.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], they had [[Summon Caniforms]] in place of [[Druid's Call]] and [[Haste Plants]]. \n*Spriggan druids were added in [[0.7]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Spriggan]]"}

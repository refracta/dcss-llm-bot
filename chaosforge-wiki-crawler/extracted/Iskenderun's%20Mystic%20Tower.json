{"title":"Iskenderun's Mystic Tower","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Iskenderun%27s_Mystic_Tower","type":"raw","data":"{{version025}}\nSuitable for a master of pure [[Conjurations]], '''Iskenderun's Mystic Tower''' is a [[Wizlab]] which reflects her taste for raw devastation. Among the [[cloud]]s of purple fog reside deep elven and draconian students of the destructive arts, along with magically imbued statues capable of casting powerful magic.\n\n==Layout==\nThis Wizlab consists of a large rectangular room with rock walls, a wide open area in the middle, and the eponymous Mystic Tower in the center of the chamber. Purple smoke billows out from the walls, which are built in a checkerboard pattern that offers easy access to cover when needed. Both the entrance and exit are located in one of the corners of the outer wall, out of any immediate harm's way. If you don't feel up to handling this area, don't be afraid to turn and run, particularly if you aren't able to benefit from the caster-centric loot at the end.\n\nEight [[conjurer statue]]s stand guard in the open area, evenly spaced around the tower and hurling [[Orbs of Destruction]] at any intruder that gets within their [[line of sight]]. They are assisted by a horde of [[deep elf mage]]s and [[purple draconian]]s (roughly equal in composition) which will blast you with arcane forces once they spot you. Beyond these foes, there is a [[door]] leading into the tower found roughly opposite the corner you entered from. Inside you'll find one more conjurer statue, a few more draconians, and the Wizlab's loot: two [[Conjurations]]-themed [[artefact]] [[spell book]]s, four mundane and random spell books, a [[robe of the Archmagi]], and a couple miscellaneous good-quality items.\n\n==Monsters==\n{{monsterlink|Deep elf mage}}- Unlike the deep elf mages found in the [[Elven Halls]], these mages only generate with their Conjurations-focused spell set: [[Magic Dart]] (3d5), [[Force Lance]] (3d13), and [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere]]. They're relatively weak for Wizlab entrance depth, but are densely packed throughout the border of the tower.\n\n{{monsterlink|Purple draconian}}- Lacking in magic but possessing a buff-dispelling breath attack, these comprise the main threat of the vault. Their breath deals a significant, irresistible 3d20, and they possess passable melee damage and high health. Losing buffs while attempting to destroy the conjurer statues can be lethal, so picking the draconians off first from the level border is highly recommended.\n\n===Conjurer Statues===\n{{flavour|A statue able to harness the mightiest of pure Conjurations ever devised by Iskenderun.}}\n\n{{monsterlink|Conjurer statue}}- The conjurer statues spread throughout the laboratory can cast [[Orb of Destruction]] (9d13) against you from any range within their line of sight. This produces a fast-moving projectile that ignores EV and deals immense damage, especially if it's cast at long range. The Orb must actually travel the distance from the caster to you, usually taking a few turns to do so, and will pursue you if you attempt to dodge it. Outrunning it is impossible, but hiding behind walls destroys it.\n\n==Strategy==\nAll damage you'll sustain here is non-elemental and subject to [[AC]] and [[SH]]; as such, heavily armoured thugs should have an easy time of it, so long as they go slowly, luring enemies into combat a few at a time and not spending more time in the line of sight of the conjurer statues than they have to. [[EV]]-based fighters will have a harder time of things, as Orbs of Destruction ignore EV entirely. Clearing the tower as an EV fighter is still possible, but caution is advised, and you may wish to [[blink]] into melee range with a statue to greatly reduce its opportunities to kill you. Elemental spellcasters of all stripes should be able to easily out-blast the wandering mages and draconians, but be aware that purple draconian breath will regularly strip you of your buffs, and the conjurer statues are very resistant to most elemental magic. Straight [[Conjurations]] or [[Earth Magic]] (particularly [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]]) should carve them up quite easily, however. In all cases, remember: '''you cannot outrun an Orb of Destruction''', but you ''can'' duck safely behind cover.\n\nIn general, this Wizlab is only truly dangerous if you fail to take your time. Conjurer statues are deadly if allowed to hit you multiple times or while fighting other foes. A single Orb of Destruction, however, is unlikely to one-shot even the weakest (reasonably leveled) character, and since you can always just walk away from them, there's little excuse to get killed by them. Explore the level, keeping to the wall edges and avoiding the deadly open space, killing off mages and draconians as you go and exploring further when you run out of opponents. They aren't terribly dangerous individually, but a large enough group can deal heavy ranged damage quickly, especially for low-AC, low-HP characters; keep your buffs up to minimize the [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]]s and don't abandon cover carelessly. If you have [[Silence]] and feel comfortable in your melee skills, killing off the deep elves is easy, but the draconians and statues will still be trouble. [[Invisibility]] works well against everything here. Finally, if you have a [[scroll of fog]], you can cut line of sight to all attackers, stopping ''most'' attack spells briefly. This has no effect on any Orbs of Destruction already in flight, however.\n\nOnce you've cleared out the mobile forces, take out the statue guarding the entrance, heal up, and head inside. The final statue isn't any different than the others you've faced so far, but it is several tiles away; blinking into melee or to avoid its shots is advisable here. Once you've cleared that, take out the last few purple draconians and the loot is yours.\n\n==Recommendations==\n*High [[HP]], [[AC]], [[SH]]\n*[[Reflection]]\n*[[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]]\n*[[Blink]] or [[Controlled Blink]] as an emergency Orb dodge\n*[[Invisibility]]\n*[[Haste]]\n*[[Silence]] (vs. deep elves)\n\n==Map==\nThe symbols in the map below are defined as follows:\n\n'''v''' Metal wall\n\n'''x''' Rock wall\n\n'''.'''

The level was more rectangular and the outside was fringed with stone walls, which made it resistant to the statues' Orbs of Destruction. The top- and bottom-most statues weren't present, and statues would dilute their casting slots with [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]]. The entry door was fixed at the point where the = is on the above map, the robe of the archmagi was absent from specific definition, and all of the '''1'''s had equal odds of being draconians, deep elves, or nothing (as an artifact from before purple draconians got their dispelling breath). All told, the vault was significantly less dangerous.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Branches]]"}

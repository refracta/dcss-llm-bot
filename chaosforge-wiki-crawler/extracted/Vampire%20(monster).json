{"title":"Vampire (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Vampire_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version|030}}\n''This article is about the monster. For the player [[species]], see [[vampire]]. For a list of all vampires, see [[list of vampires]].''\n{{monster info|Vampire}}\n==Useful Info==\n'''Vampires''' are [[undead]] opponents who focus on nefarious, backhanded attacks to defeat their enemies. They are occasionally found in the middle floors of [[the Dungeon]].\n\n{{monster spells|Vampire}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*An invisible vampire can be difficult to fight. They are hard to hit, constantly steal health, and deal moderately high damage. Being [[confuse]]d only makes it harder for you to hit one. High [[willpower]] and [[see invisible]] are both helpful when vampires are around.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.12]], vampires had the [[Vampire Summon]] spell, a monster-only version of [[Summon Small Mammals]] that could potentially produce [[orange rat]]s."}

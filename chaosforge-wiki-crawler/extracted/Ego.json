{"title":"Ego","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ego","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Egos''' are special abilities and [[intrinsic]]s found on [[weapons]], [[armour]], and other character items. When an item name shows as \"+x foo of barring\", the \"of barring\" is the ego. For example: boots ''of rampaging'', war axe ''of electrocution''. \n\nEgos on [[weapons]] are often referred to as [[brand]]s. This page focuses only on non-weapon egos; see the [[brand]] page for weapon egos.\n\n==Egos==\n\n===Armour egos===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Name\n!Effect\n!Inscription\n!Found On\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Resistance (ego)|Resistance]]\n| Gain 1 rank in [[fire resistance]] and [[cold resistance]].\n| {rF+ rC+}\n| Body armour (only [[robe]]s), [[shields]], [[scarves]]\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Fire resistance|Fire Resistance]]\n| Gain 1 rank of [[fire resistance]].\n| {rF+}\n| All [[body armour]], [[barding]], [[shields]]<br><small>Cloaks found in [[Volcano]]</small>\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Cold Resistance]]\n| Gain 1 rank of [[cold resistance]].\n| {rC+}\n| All [[body armour]], [[barding]], [[shields]]<br><small>Cloaks found in an [[Ice cave]]</small>\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Poison Resistance]]\n| Gain [[poison resistance]].\n| {rPois}\n| All [[body armour]] (other than [[robe]]s), [[cloak]]s, [[shields]]\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Life Protection|Positive Energy]]\n| Gain 1 level of [[life protection]].\n| {rN+}\n| All [[body armour]], [[shields]]\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Preservation]]\n| Gain [[corrosion resistance]]\n| {rCorr}\n| [[Cloak]]s\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Protection]]\n| Shield: gain +3 AC.<br>Weapon: temporarily gain +7 [[AC]] after striking an enemy.\n| {Protect} or {AC+3}\n| [[Shields]], [[weapons]] \n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Willpower]]\n| Gain +40 [[willpower]].\n| {Will+}\n| All [[body armour]], [[cloak]]s, [[hat]]s\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Strength]]\n| Gain +3 [[strength]].\n| {Str+3}\n| [[Gloves]]\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Dexterity]]\n| Gain +3 [[dexterity]].\n| {Dex+3}\n| [[Gloves]]\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Intelligence]]\n| Gain +3 [[intelligence]].\n| {Int+3}\n| [[Hat]]s, [[helmet]]s\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Rampaging]]\n| Adds an additional tile of movement when moving directly towards an enemy.\n| {rampage}\n| [[Boots]], [[barding]]\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Flight (ego)|Flight]]\n| Can be [[evoke]]d for indefinite [[fly|flight]].\n| {+Fly}\n| [[Boots]], [[barding]]\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Stealth]]\n| Gain +50 [[stealth]].\n| {Stlth+}\n| [[Boots]], [[barding]], [[cloak]]s\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[See Invisible]]\n| Gain [[see invisible]].\n| {SInv}\n| [[Hat]]s, [[helmet]]s\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Archmagi (ego)|Archmagi]]\n| Boosts [[spell power]] for all spells.\n| {Archmagi}\n| Body armour (only [[robe]]s)\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Ponderousness]]\n| Increases [[Movement#Character_Speed|movement delay]] by 0.1 (10% slower for most species).\n| {ponderous}\n| Body armour (only [[chain mail]], [[plate armour]])\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Reflection]]\n| [[Reflection|Reflects]] any [[Shields#Blocking|blocked]] physical or magical ranged attacks back at the attacker.\n| {reflect}\n| [[Shields]]\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|[[Hurling]]\n| +4 [[slaying]] to [[Throwing]] weapons.\n| {hurl}\n| [[Gloves]]\n|}\n\n[[Animal skin]]s and [[crystal plate armour]] won't generate with egos outside of certain [[vault]]s.

Spells are learned from the [[spell memorisation|spell library]] ('''M''').\n\n==Useful Info==\nEvery spell has the following:\n*A '''spell level'''. This determines:\n**If you can learn the spell at all. In order to memorize a spell, your [[experience level]] must be greater or equal to a spell's level. \n**How difficult a spell is to cast. Higher levels of spells require more [[skill]] training to reduce their failure.\n**How much [[MP]] a spell costs, where <code>MP Cost = Spell Level</code>. Some spells, like [[Dragon's Call]], can use extra MP after being cast.\n:In addition, characters can only memorize so many spell levels at a time. A given character can learn up to <code>(2 Ã— [[Spellcasting]]) + ([[XL]] - 1)</code> spell levels at once. E.g. an XL 11 character with 5 Spellcasting would have a total of 20 spell levels; they could learn four level 5 spells, or two level 9 spells and one level 2 spell.\n\n*One or multiple '''[[magic school]]s''' (\"'''spell schools'''\"). For example, [[Summon Ice Beast]] is a [[Summonings]] / [[Ice Magic]] spell. Both \"Summonings\" and \"Ice Magic\" are skills that boost the strength and success rate of the spell. Spells with multiple schools will take more XP to train.\n\nIn the spells menu ('''[[M]]'''), a spell will be shown in red if your [[god]] prohibits it. Otherwise a spell is shown in white if you can learn it (i.e. your XL is high enough, and you have enough spell levels) and grey if you cannot.\n\nIn any case, you can only learn up to 21 spells:\n{{crawlquote|\"Your head is already too full of spells!\"}}\n\n==Casting spells==\nSpells are cast by pressing '''[[z]]''' and selecting one of the learned spells. A spell is shown in white if casting it is possible and would achieve something (e.g. if you can affect something with an attack, heal MP with [[Sublimation of Blood]]...). Otherwise, it is greyed out and can only be cast by pressing '''[[Z]]'''. The game's assessment of whether it would achieve something is not always accurate; for example, you might cast a [[Fireball]] at a spot where you suppose there is an invisible monster.\n\nOnce a player has learned a spell, that spell gains a new set of player-dependent properties:\n\n*[[Spell power]]: how powerful the spell will be if cast successfully. For example, more powerful Conjuration spells do more damage, more powerful summoning spells can summon stronger monsters or last longer (depending on the spell).\n*[[Spell failure]]: how likely you are to [[miscast]] the spell.\n*Range: how far the spell can be cast, if the spell has a ranged effect.\n\n==Monsters casting spells==\nMonsters can also cast many of the spells available to players (as well as many that are not), but the mechanics are very different:\n\n*Monsters don't have MP.\n*Monsters can't miscast spells, but they can fail while under the [[antimagic]] status effect.\n*Monsters can only cast spells when there is an enemy in their LOS. The exceptions to this rule are [[Dig]], [[Minor Healing]], and [[Major Healing]].\n*Most monsters can cast up to 6 different spells, though [[player ghost]]s can have even more.\n*Polymorphed [[unique]]s won't retain their spells in their new form. Shapeshifters don't get spells.\n*Monsters don't cast spells less often when they are able to attack in melee, unlike with ranged weapons or wands.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Spell memorisation]]\n*[[Spell success]]\n*[[Spell power]]\n*[[List of spells]]\n*[[List of spells by flag]]\n*[[List of spells by school]]\n*[[Spell book]]s\n*[[List of attack spells and beams by maximum damage]]\n*[[Table of attack spells and beams by maximum range]]\n*[[Table of spell popularity among winners]]\n*[[Miscast effect]]\n*[[Magic contamination]]\n*[[Willpower]]\n*[[Spell noise]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.20]], [[uniques]] would keep their spells when polymorphed into a different form of [[:Category: Human intelligence|human intelligence]], unless the poly target had innate spells (e.g. naga spit).\n*Prior to [[0.10]], it was necessary to have one level in [[Spellcasting]] to be able to memorize spells.\n\n[[Category:Magic]]\n[[Category:Spells]]"}

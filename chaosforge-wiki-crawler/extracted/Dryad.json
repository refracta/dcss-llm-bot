{"title":"Dryad","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dryad","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Dryads''' are aggressive tree spirits which seek to tear apart any who desecrate the woods they live in. Although almost harmless physically, they can awaken the [[tree]]s of the forest and create [[constrict]]ing vines. The trees immediately calm down when the dryad dies.\n\nThey do not generate naturally; if you find one it is most likely a [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]]. However, you can summon one with [[Summon Forest]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Dryads are strong. Aggressive trees can deal a surprising amount of damage, and the vines can [[constrict]] monsters for even more.\n*Only one Awaken Forest effect can be active at a time. If your dryad is active, it'll prevent any [[spriggan druid]]s from using this spell.\n*You can '''[[t]]'''ell your dryad to '''r'''etreat, so that it doesn't die. Otherwise, it will charge in as if it was a melee summon.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|dryads will be [[cautious]].}}\n*Dryads were added in [[0.13]], but were not used until [[Summon Forest]] was introduced in [[0.14]]."}

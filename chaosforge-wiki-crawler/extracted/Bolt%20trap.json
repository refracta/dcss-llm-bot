It is the most damaging of the traps that fire damaging ammunition, followed by the [[spear trap]].\n\nBolt traps can fire 3-11 times before running out of ammo, dealing up to 40 damage to the player, or up to 18 damage to a monster.\n\n[[Repel Missiles#Player sources|Repel Missiles]] reduces the chance of this trap being able to hit the player.\n\n==History==\n*Bolt traps, and all mechanical traps, were removed in [[0.27]].\n*Prior to [[0.15]], activating a bolt trap would produce usable bolt ammunition.\n\n[[Category:Traps]]"}

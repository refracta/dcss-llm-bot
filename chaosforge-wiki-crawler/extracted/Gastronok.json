{"title":"Gastronok","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Gastronok","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of|gastropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Gastronok the Ponderous''' is a [[unique]] [[elephant slug]] with access to dangerous spells. He's... sluggish, as you might expect, but can slow you down and speed himself up. His Airstrikes are brutal, though the slug is no slouch in melee, either. And with a massive [[HP]] pool, good [[willpower]], and 20 [[HD]], he's tough to take down. On the plus side, he is almost guaranteed to drop an enchanted [[hat]] (10% for the [[Hat of Pondering]]).\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:8-12 (Rare)\n*[[The Orcish Mines]]:1 (Rare)\n*[[The Lair]]:1-3\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Gastronok is slow. As long as you yourself aren't slowed, you can just run away.\n*In a sufficiently clear level, [[kiting]] is very effective. Ranged attackers can keep him just barely within [[line of sight]]. So long as you move back out of LOS before he can act, the slug can never cast a spell. Just make sure to have enough of empty floor available to retreat into.\n**Anything that lets you deal damage from outside his [[line of sight]] is perfect for kiting Gastronok. [[Fulminant Prism]] and [[Poison Magic]] are great options. Just be sure to have ample room to retreat to, as it'll take a while to whittle him down.\n**Not a caster? A stack of [[poisoned]] [[dart]]s (or [[curare]] if you have them), and a few skill levels in [[Throwing]] will make you fast enough to shoot him and then take a step back in the time it takes him to pursue you. \n*Try not to fight Gastronok in the open: his Airstrike can deal 2d34 unavoidable damage when you're in totally empty space. That's enough to one-shot [[Spriggan]]s, and mangle all sorts of characters. One misstep when kiting can mean taking 70 damage to the face.\n*Although he shakes off most [[Hexes]] easily enough, powerful [[Conjurations]] still get the job done. [[Necromancer]]s may want to use [[Agony]]; although he may resist it a few times before it lands, it's still a huge amount of damage dealt.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], Gastronok's Airstrike could deal significantly less damage, 8-37 instead of 2d(18-34). \n*Prior to [[0.14]], Gastronok could eat [[food]] and [[corpse]]s from the floor.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], Gastronok had [[Magic Dart]]."}

{"title":"Tainted leviathan","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tainted_leviathan","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|giants}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Tainted leviathans''' are found in [[Tartarus]]. They carry [[large rock]]s for throwing, are always surrounded in clouds of [[miasma]], and can easily hex you with a mesmerization spell aided by Tartarusâ€™s Willpower-shattering atmosphere.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Most characters heading into Tartarus will have enough resistances to make their miasma aura trivial, but mind that you do not get mesmerized by one while another behind you pelts you with their high damage rocks. A [[scroll of fog]] can assist in dispelling the Mesmerized effect.\n*[[Clarity]] can block mesmerization.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], it was possible to create [[derived undead]] from tainted leviathans.\n*Tainted leviathans were added in [[0.28]]."}

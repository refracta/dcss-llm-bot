You may come across occasional enemies with negative damage, such as [[jorogumo]]s, [[deep elf death mage]]s or [[shadow dragon]]s, so it's nice to keep a source of rN+ handy.\n\nIn [[extended]], negative energy and [[torment]] are much more common; having good amounts of rN+ is more important. However, dedicating an entire ring slot to a single source of rN+ isn't the greatest. Note that [[The Shining One]] provides rN+++ to pious followers, making this ring redundant.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.13]], these rings were known as rings of life protection.\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

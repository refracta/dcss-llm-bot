This cone begins as a 4x4 area, but grows larger with increasing [[Evocations]].\n\nPossible clouds include, in ascending order of power:\n*[[Cloud#Noxious fumes|Noxious Fumes]]\n*[[Cloud#Poison|Poisonous Gas]]\n*[[Cloud#Flame|Flame]] / [[Freezing vapour]]s\n*[[Cloud#Negative energy|Negative Energy]]\n*[[Cloud#Thunder|Thunder]]\n*[[Cloud#Acidic fog|Acidic Fog]]\n\nAt low levels of Evocations, you'll get noxious fumes with bursts of poison, fire, ice. As the skill is leveled up, the other types of clouds become more likely.\n\n[[Good god]]s will inflict [[penance]] if and only if you get negative energy clouds. Penance is inflicted each time a monster is hurt by negative energy.\n\n==Strategy==\nA wand of clouds can be devastatingly strong. Even if you have 0 (or otherwise low) Evocations, it offers powerful effects. Flaming & freezing clouds deal significant damage, enough to melt mid-game enemies in a few turns. Noxious fumes, the weakest cloud, inflict [[confusion]] against anything without rPois. It is best used against groups of tough enemies. \n\nIn the late game, using a wand of clouds at high Evocations is similarly strong. This mainly comes from acidic fog, which deals fairly high damage and significantly lowers enemy [[AC]].\n\nThere is always a risk that you roll a cloud that enemies are immune to, wasting a charge and a turn. But if targets are vulnerable, it can be very strong. If you have low Evocations, avoid using this wand against monsters with poison resistance.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*It takes a minimum of 6 Evocations skill to get negative energy clouds. So long as you have less than 6 Evocations, this wand is safe to use for [[good god]] worshippers.\n\n==History==\n*Wands of clouds were replaced by [[condenser vane]]s in [[0.26]].\n*Prior to [[0.24]], monsters couldn't use this wand.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], Dithmenos worshippers had to be careful when using this wand, as their god hated fire.\n*The wand of clouds was added in [[0.20]], replacing the [[rod of clouds]].\n\n{{wands}}"}

For reference, most species burn 3 per turn. Such rings are not automatically identified when first put on, but are always cursed and are identified the next time you change satiation levels.\nBy contrast, a ring of sustenance decreases hunger by 40%, with the resultant hunger rate being rounded down. Thus, for most races it reduces hunger from 3 to 1 per turn.\n\n==Desirability==\nThis ring has absolutely no use. If you need to get hungry quickly, it is almost always more efficient to cast high-level spells or wield vampiric weapons. This ring does not hunger you quickly enough to be useful in such situations. Don't bother picking them up.\n\n==History==\nRings of hunger were retired in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Ring]]\n[[Category:Hunger]]"}

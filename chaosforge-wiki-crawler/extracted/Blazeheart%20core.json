{"title":"Blazeheart core","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Blazeheart_core","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Blazeheart cores''' are left behind when a non-dormant [[blazeheart golem]] dies. When it generates, after exactly 1 player action (no matter how fast or slow), it explodes in a 3x3 fire explosion. The explosion deals 3d11 - 3d20 damage, depending on [[Summon Blazeheart Golem]]'s spell power, and leaves behind flaming [[cloud]]s.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|blazeheart cores will be [[stationary]], so monsters won't be able to [[trample]] or knock cores back. Also, blazeheart core explosions will be able to light [[tree]]s on fire.}}\n*In [[0.31]], this monster was introduced as a part of the [[Summon Blazeheart Golem]] spell."}

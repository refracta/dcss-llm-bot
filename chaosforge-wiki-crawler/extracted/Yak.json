{"title":"Yak","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Yak","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Yaks''' (''bos grunniens'') are long-haired pack bovines that are often underestimated. They have decent health, a tendency to swarm, and surprisingly painful melee attacks that take out careless, inexperienced spell casters with frightening ease. They are often found in the middle portions of [[the Dungeon]], and are common throughout [[the Lair]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you're new to the game and haven't yet faced a yak, try to remember that they're actually quite dangerous. Use hallways and [[stair dancing]] to prevent the pack from surrounding you, or better yet, retreat to an explored area after attracting the attention of a single yak. Unless you've got easy access to [[Fireball]] or other AoE attacks, you'll want to break up the pack and limit their ability to gore you.\n*Yaks are quite durable, so [[Poison Magic]] comes in handy against them if you don't have the strength to take them with brute force. [[Mephitic Cloud]] in particular works well, as confused yaks will turn on each other and do the job for you."}

{"title":"Elf (species)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Elf_(species)","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n'''Elves''' (also called plain or common elves, when they weren't looking) were a race in early versions of Crawl.  Their aptitudes were generally similar to those of [[High Elves]], but less pronounced.  This made them more versatile than HE, in fact easily the most versatile of all of the five original elven races.  However, they paid for this by having fewer strong aptitudes: they only really excelled at [[Bows]], [[Air Magic]], and [[Enchantments]] (and were fairly good with bladed weapons and [[Spellcasting]]).  They also leveled faster than the other elven races, though still noticeably slower than humans.\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 [[MP]] every 3 levels.\n*-1 [[HP]] 2 out of every 3 levels.\n*+1 [[intelligence]] or [[dexterity]] (equal chance) every 4th level.\n\n==Available Classes==\nElves can be [[Fighter]]s, [[Wizard]]s, [[Priest]]s, [[Thief|Thieves]], [[Assassin]]s, [[Hunter]]s, [[Conjurer]]s, [[Enchanter]]s, [[Fire Elementalist]]s, [[Ice Elementalist]]s, [[Summoner]]s, [[Air Elementalist]]s, [[Crusader]]s, [[Chaos Knight]]s, [[Transmuter]]s, [[Healer]]s, [[Reaver]]s, [[Stalker]]s, [[Monk]]s and [[Warper]]s.\n\n{{Old_Apts\n|air=70\n|arm=120\n|axs=120\n|bws=60\n|coj=105\n|crb=100\n|drt=90\n|div=100\n|ddg=80\n|ear=130\n|enc=70\n|exp=130\n|evo=80\n|fgt=120\n|fir=100\n|ice=100\n|inv=100\n|lbl=80\n|m&f=130\n|nec=120\n|poi=110\n|pla=130\n|ran=80\n|shd=120\n|sbl=80\n|slg=120\n|spc=80\n|stb=100\n|stv=100\n|sth=80\n|sum=100\n|thr=80\n|trl=100\n|trm=100\n|t&d=100\n|u_c=110\n}}\n\n==History==\n\nThe [[Elf]] [[species]] was removed in ''Stone Soup'' version 0.3 due to lack of differentiation from the other elven races.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete species]]"}

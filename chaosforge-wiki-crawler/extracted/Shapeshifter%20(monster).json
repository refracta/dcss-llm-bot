George Chapman, 1857.}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Shapeshifters''' are unique and potentially deadly monsters with the ability to transform into almost any other monster in the game, though they usually pick monsters with [[HD]] similar to their own. \n\nThis transformation is more than just cosmetic; the shapeshifter's stats and special abilities will match whatever they become, and [[XP]] will be adjusted as well. The only differences between an actual monster and a shapeshifter in its form are the corpse left behind (shapeshifters return to their natural form upon death) and the fact that the monster may change form again at any moment, becoming something new and healing significantly in the process. Shapeshifters can be found in the middle floors of [[the Dungeon]].\n\nIf a shapeshifter dies, any of its [[derived undead]] will be of the form it last took.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*No matter what you're facing, shapeshifters should always be one of your first priorities to kill. Although they're often harmless, they can always surprise you by becoming something you're just not prepared for at the worst possible moment.\n**Even low HD shapeshifters can turn into [[hornet]]s, [[moths of wrath]], [[shining eye]]s, or even [[floating eye]]s. Not something you want to underestimate!\n*If you don't want to face a shapeshifter's current form, you can flee and face it later on once it's shifted. Alternatively, hitting it with a [[wand of polymorph]] will force it to change form immediately (ignoring willpower).\n*Shapeshifters often choose odd or extremely rare monsters as their form. If you come across a random [[elf]], [[dwarf]], or uncolored [[draconian (monster)|draconian]] outside of a special [[vault]], expect it to be a shapeshifter.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], shapeshifter [[corpse]]s could not be turned into [[zombie]]s or [[skeleton]]s. However, they ''could'' be turned into [[simulacrum]], using the stats of the shapeshifter base monster."}

According to legend, this mutated creature is the otherworldly spawn of a wizard's breeding experiment. Yuck.\n----\n“Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty. One person may even perceive deformity, where another is sensible of beauty; and every individual ought to acquiesce in his own sentiment, without pretending to regulate those of others.”<br>\n-David Hume}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ugly things''' are fast, strangely-shaped, nauseating monsters that usually appear in groups. They are found mid-game in the [[Dungeon]] and in some [[branch]]es, particularly [[the Vaults]]. They come in a rainbow of colours, each of which has its own elemental attributes. Their attack types also vary: some ugly things bite, some headbutt, and others still will slap you with tentacles.\n\n'''Ugly Thing Varieties'''\n*{{Red|u}} [[File:Ugly thing.png]] Red: [[Fire]] attack, rF+\n*{{White|u}} [[File:Ugly thing5.png]] White: [[Cold]] attack, rC+\n*{{Cyan|u}} [[File:Ugly thing3.png]] Cyan: [[Electricity]] attack, rElec+\n*{{Brown|u}} [[File:Ugly thing1.png]] Brown: [[Acid]] attack, rAcid+\n*{{Green|u}} [[File:Ugly thing2.png]] Green: [[Poison]] attack, rPois+\n*{{Magenta|u}} [[File:Ugly thing4.png]] Purple: Extra damage\n\nUgly things may change colour each turn they spend adjacent to other ugly things or a character with [[magic contamination]]. Using [[Irradiate]] or a [[wand of polymorph]] (which will always succeed) will also cause a colour change.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Packs of ugly things will spontaneously change their damage and resistance types mid-fight. If you rely on elemental damage, keep track of what you're up against before attacking.\n**Poisoned ugly things that switch to green will still be poisoned. They will also still be confused if they ran into a mephitic cloud.\n*They move faster than a normal speed character. If they are at the edge of your sight and you can see stairs in the opposite direction, you'll probably be able to escape, but prolonged kiting is not possible.\n*Despite their animal-level [[intelligence]], they are capable of opening doors.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Very ugly thing]]"}

{"title":"Weapon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Weapon","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n\n'''Weapons''' are items which you can wield to improve your ability to attack enemies. In most cases, they deal non-elemental damage, making them suitable for dealing with any threat. Weapons are divided into two main categories:\n*[[Melee weapon]]s\n**[[Magical staves]]\n*[[Ranged weapon]]s\n**[[Throwing]]\n__NOTOC__\n===Useful Info===\nAll weapons are subject to [[skill]]; increasing skill increases [[weapon damage]], [[accuracy]], and decreases the [[attack delay]]. The heaviest weapon is not always the best, as an unskilled user will swing inaccurately and slowly, potentially giving monsters two turns for your one. Certain weapons also take two [[handedness|hands]] to use, which restricts the use of a [[shield]]. Both skill and strength are multipliers to a weapon's base damage.\n\nWeapons are not required for melee combat; [[Unarmed Combat]] is available at any time and uses similar damage formulas to weapons.\n\n===Weapon Properties===\n*Base damage: The damage done, before modifiers and adjustments. This is multiplied by strength and skill bonuses.\n*[[To-hit]]: Accuracy. Larger weapons have less accuracy, though skill and enchantment increase it.\n*Delay: How fast the weapon swings naturally, in [[decaAut]].\n**[[Minimum delay]]: How fast the weapon can possibly swing, once you reach a certain skill level. Most weapons have a mindelay of (Delay/2) or 0.7, whichever is lower. Every 2 skill levels decrease base delay by 0.1 until you reach mindelay.\n*[[Handedness]]: Weapons that require two hands restrict the use of a [[shield]] and the [[auxiliary attack|offhand punch]] ([[Octopode]]s can still offhand slap). [[Size|Smaller]] species may find certain weapons requiring two hands and normally large weapons completely unusable.\n*Type: Each weapon has its own designated weapon type ([[Short Blades]], [[Polearms]]...), and each weapon type has its own skill and potential quirks.\n\n===Weapon Modifiers===\n*[[Enchant]]: A higher enchanted weapon will be more [[to-hit|accurate]] and deal more damage.\n*[[Brand]]: Brands generally help with combat, increasing damage and/or causing elemental effects.\n\nMagical staves do not have either. [[Artefact]]s may also come with special properties not found on regular weapons, though are not necessarily better.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Weapon choice]] - Strategy for which weapon to pick\n*[[Weapon damage]] - Damage formulas\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.14]], there were elven, dwarven, and orcish variants of weapons which had small additional benefits, and [[demonspawn]] characters received a damage bonus when using demonic weapons - see [[Racial weapon variants]]. Also, several weapons were renamed: [[sabre]] to cutlass, [[double sword]] to bastard sword, and [[triple sword]] to claymore.\n\n{{Weapons}}\n[[Category:Items]]"}

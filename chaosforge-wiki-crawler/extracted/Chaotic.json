{"title":"Chaotic","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Chaotic","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Chaotic''' is an attribute that, among other things, makes a creature extremely susceptible to [[silver]] weapons.\n\n==Useful Info==\nChaotic monsters are vulnerable to the [[silver]] brand, taking 175% extra damage.\n\n[[Zin]] despises chaos, and worshippers who dare employ chaotic items or magic will find themselves undergoing [[penance]]. Worshippers who leave to [[Xom]] or [[Jiyva]] will also incur [[wrath]] (the other chaotic gods are [[evil]] and upset all three [[good god]]s, including Zin). On the other hand, Zin will reward followers who slay chaotic monsters with additional piety.\n\nPlayers can never be chaotic themselves, though they are considered \"shapeshifted\" during a [[transformation]], taking the same damage from silver weapons. Worshiping a chaotic god has no effect, if you have not worshipped Zin. Chaotic spells and items are similarly inconsequential, though the abilities of some may amuse [[Xom]].\n\n==Chaotic monsters==\n*[[shapeshifter (monster)|Shapeshifter]]s, all [[ugly thing]]s, [[abomination]]s [[large abomination|large]] and [[small abomination|small]], [[Killer Klown|killer klown]]s, [[The Royal Jelly]], [[Tiamat]]. \n*A creature with innate \"Mutate\" or \"Chaos\" [[attack flavour]]s (as opposed to simply having a [[chaos]]-[[brand]]ed weapon, like [[Crazy Yiuf]]).\n*A creature having an intrinsic chaotic spell/ability, such as [[Mnoleg]] (as opposed to simply casting chaos spells; spells with the wizard [[spell slot flags|spell slot flag]], like [[Kirke]]'s Porkalator, don't count).\n\n==Chaotic spells==\n*[[Banishment]]\n*[[Beastly Appendage]]\n*[[Blade Hands]]\n*[[Call of Chaos]]\n*[[Chain of Chaos]]\n*[[Dragon Form]]\n*[[Ice Form]]\n*[[Irradiate]]\n*[[Major Destruction]]\n*[[Malign Gateway]]\n*[[Malmutate]]\n*[[Necromutation]]\n*[[Polymorph]]\n*[[Porkalator]]\n*[[Spider Form]]\n*[[Statue Form]]\n*[[Storm Form]]\n*[[Summon Horrible Things]]\n*[[Wereblood]]\n*[[Yara's Violent Unravelling]]\n\nIn addition, random [[Hell]] effects are considered chaotic.\n\n==Chaotic gods==\n*[[Jiyva]]\n*[[Lugonu]]\n*[[Makhleb]]\n*[[Xom]]\n\n==Chaotic items==\n*Weapons of [[chaos]]\n*Mutagenic [[unrands]] or [[randarts]], like the [[Plutonium Sword]] or the [[Glaive of Prune]]\n*[[Wands of polymorph]] and [[piece from Xom's chessboard|pieces from Xom's chessboard]]\n*[[Potions of mutation]] and [[potion of lignification|lignification]]"}

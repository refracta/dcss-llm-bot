For the removed card, see [[Flame card]]''\n{{flavour|It burns victims, dealing an additional one-quarter of any damage that pierces defenders' armour. Big, fiery blades are also staple armaments of hydra-hunters.}}\n\nThe '''flaming''' [[brand]] does the following:\n*Adds an average of roughly +25% [[fire]] damage (0% - 50%) to attacks, applied after [[AC]] and all damage factors (including [[slaying]]).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|attack.cc|1585}}<br>Specifically, if you dealt damage, flaming adds <code>(1d<damage_dealt>/2) + 0.5</code> fire damage, rounded down. Therefore, flaming's boost is slightly bigger than 25%. This is more noticeable on weak attacks, e.g. if you dealt 1 damage, you'd always get +1 flaming damage (for an average of +100%).</ref>\n*When an edged weapon of flaming ([[Long Blades]], [[Axes]], 2-handed [[Polearms]], [[lajatang]]s) cuts [[hydra]] heads, flaming will cauterize the wound, preventing the hydra from regrowing heads, for a net loss of 1 head.\n\n==Sources==\nAlong with finding flaming weapons as random loot, or using a [[scroll of brand weapon]], flaming can be found on a few monsters:\n*[[Efreet]]s, as well as the uniques [[Erica]] and [[Azrael]], often carry [[scimitar]]s of flaming.\n*[[Fire giant]]s usually generate with flaming [[great sword]]s.\n*[[Nessos]] is always generated with a flaming [[longbow]].\n*[[Trog]] often gifts weapons of flaming.\n\n==Strategy==\nFlaming is one of a couple percentage-based brands that's good enough to beat a 3-rune game. For edged-weapon users, flaming is very desirable against hydras, who are often difficult to take out otherwise.\n\nAs flaming applies its percentage boost after AC reduction, it is no better or worse when considering strength, weapon type, slaying, or AC. An [[executioner's axe]] of freezing receives the same +25% boost to final damage as a [[quick blade]] of freezing. It's just that a quick blade's base damage is weak, so a brand like [[electrocution]] or [[pain (brand)|pain]] will be stronger for it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.15]], you could temporarily apply a flaming brand to your (unbranded) weapon with the spell [[Fire Brand]], which could be made permanent with a [[scroll of vorpalize weapon]]. Also, [[ranged weapon]]s had the \"flame\" brand, which was identical other than its name.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{brands}}\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

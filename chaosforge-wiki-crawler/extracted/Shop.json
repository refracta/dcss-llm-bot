{"title":"Shop","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shop","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{Flavour|A shop in the dungeon, beyond sight of the world above, manned by a secretive and reclusive shopkeeper who cannot be bargained with, grants no refunds, and is interested in nothing you may have to sell. Some shops hawk antiques of unknown provenance, and offer little hint as to the quality or nature of their goods.}}\n\nCourageous merchants have opened '''shops''' throughout the [[Dungeon]] and its [[branch]]es. \n\n==Useful Info==\nYou can enter a shop by using the same keys for going up and down stairs ('''<''' and '''>'''). Shops let you buy items for [[gold]] (press the item's respective lowercase letter, then confirm your choice with '''Enter'''). Buying items is an instant action. You cannot sell items to shops, and there's no way to rob them.\n\nShops naturally generate in [[Dungeon]], [[Orcish Mines]], [[Elven Halls]], [[Snake Pit]], [[Shoals]], [[the Vaults]], and [[Depths]]. Each floor has roughly a 20% chance of containing at least one shop and a 4% chance of multiple shops. Shops can (rarely) be placed in other areas as part of [[vault]] code, such as \"Island Escapes\" in [[Swamp]] or \"[[Pandemonium#The_Demonic_Rune|Demonic Rune Warehouse]]\" (along with other shops) in [[Pandemonium]].\n\nShops are given a random multiplier for their prices when defined ('greed'), so prices for the same item will vary between shops. Shops at a deeper Dungeon depth tend to have better items available.\n\nSpecial locations for shops:\n*[[Orcish Mines|Orc:2]] has 4 guaranteed shops, placed via [[vault]] code.\n*You can find [[Bazaar]]s, which always contain a few shops, but can only be entered once.\n*[[Gozag]] worshippers can create shops with the Call Merchant ability. These shops scale with [[XL]] rather than Dungeon depth.\n\n==Types of Shops==\nShops fall broadly into two categories. Most of the shops you'll find are randomly placed by the dungeon generator. There are also [[vault]]-defined shops; these only appear in specific vaults and usually contain an unusual or themed array of goods.\n\nThere is some degree of overlap, in that a vault-defined shop can vary from being simply in a vault that calls for a specific type of normal shop (e.g. a bazaar that has a guaranteed armour shop, or the guaranteed random shops on Orc:2) to a shop that is of a completely new type, with mostly pre-defined items. However, for the purposes of this article, vault-defined shops are those that appear as a completely new type of shop.\n\n===Normal Shops===\n'''Regular'''\n*'''General shops''' sell a random selection of [[item]]s, all identified.\n*'''Book shops''' sell identified [[spellbooks]] and occasionally [[manual]]s.\n*'''Armour shops''' sell identified [[armour]] (sometimes magical or [[artefact]]s).\n*'''Weapon shops''' sell identified [[weapon]]s (sometimes [[brand]]ed or artefacts).\n*'''Jewellery shops''' sell identified [[ring]]s and [[amulet]]s (sometimes artefacts).\n*'''Distilleries''' sell identified [[potions]].\n*'''Scroll shops''' sell identified [[scroll]]s.\n\n'''Antique'''\n*'''Assorted antique shops''' are similar to general shops, but their items are unidentified. To compensate, unidentified items are cheaper, and these shops are more likely to have [[brand]]ed and/or [[artefact]] equipment.\n**For weapons, armour, and jewellery, you will see the item's base type, but their specific properties are unknown. Buying the item will identify it.\n**For potions and scrolls, you will only see the item's descriptor (e.g. ''orange potion''), unless you have already [[identification|identified]] that item type. If you have identified the item, it becomes more expensive - even if you saw the shop's inventory before identifying the item.\n*'''Antique armour shops''' are antique shops which only have armour.\n*'''Antique weapon shops''' are antique shops which only have weapons.\n\n===Vault-Defined Shops===\n*Alphabet shops sell items that all begin with the same letter. They have alliterative names.\n*'''Alliterative Armaments''' sell items with alliterative names. \n*'''Blood Bar''' sells [[vampiric]] weapons and [[Necromancy]] spell books.\n*'''CLEARANCE SALE!''' has major discounts for the last few items left.\n*'''Changing Room''' sells items related to [[shapeshifting]] and [[transformation]], such as [[talismans]], [[potions of mutation]], and [[wands of polymorph]].\n*'''Demolitions Depot''' sells [[Conjurations]]-heavy books and destructive [[wand]]s.\n*'''Dragon-Slaying Spoils''' sells dragon scales.\n*'''Ea-nāṣir's Fine Metal Goods''' sells metal items which may or may not be damaged.  As it is an antique store, there's no way to tell for sure.\n*'''Elemental Accessories''' sells four items, each related to one of the four elements.\n*'''Blasphemy Boutique''' / '''Evil Emporium''' / '''Profane Products''' / '''Sacrilege Store''' / '''Wicked Wares''' sell [[Evil#Evil items|evil items]] such as weapons of [[draining]], demon weapons, and Necromancy spell books.\n*'''Hallowed Reliquary''' sells good items such as weapons of [[holy wrath]], [[silver]] ammunition, and sources of healing.\n*'''Fire Supplies''' sells [[fire]]-related items.\n*'''Firing Range''' sells [[ammunition]] and [[ranged weapons]].\n*'''Gadget Gallery''' sells wands and miscellaneous items.\n*'''Globular Garage''' / '''Orb Outfitters''' / '''Round Resellers''' / '''Spherical Supermarket''' sells [[orb]]s (usually of artifact quality) and orb-related things.\n*'''Granny Wiglaf's Hat Hut / Humble Haberdashery / Magnificent Millinery''' sells [[hat]]s and occasionally a spellbook containing only [[Hellfire Mortar]].\n*'''Hydra Hut''' sells [[flaming]]-branded weapons.\n*'''Island Escapes''' sells various items useful for fleeing from fights, such as [[scrolls of teleportation]] and [[potions of haste]].\n*'''Magical Supplies''' sells magical items.\n*'''Mail-Order Catalogue''' sells [[ring mail]], [[chain mail]], [[scale mail]], and the [[lajatang of Order]].\n*'''Mass Market''' sells items that would probably be really heavy.\n*'''Mayhem Merchandise''' sells items that damage multiple targets.\n*'''Neck Hole''' sells [[cloak]]s, [[amulet]]s, and [[scarves]].\n*'''Last-Chance Deals''' sells amazing [[artefact]]s for one gold piece... on [[Zot:5]].\n*'''Lightly-Used Armory''' sells rare item types with negative enchantments for cheap.\n*'''One-of-a-Kind Books''' sells [[randart]] books.\n*'''One-of-a-Kind Rings''' sells [[randart]] rings and rings with different + values than usual.\n*'''Overcharged Wands''' sells costly wands with more charges than usual.\n*'''Pet Rocks''' sells [[stone]]s, [[Earth Magic]] books, and miscellaneous other earth-related items. \n*'''Self-Improvement Boutique''' sells four manuals.\n*'''Serpentskin Sales''' sells items pertaining to the infliction of and resistance to [[poison]].\n*'''Specialty Armours''' sell [[barding]]s.\n*'''Superior Scales''' sells [[randart]] [[scale mail]]s, and has a dragon behind it.\n*'''The Oracle's Delphic Readings''' is a reference to the Oracle from NetHack, and sells [[book]]s and [[scroll]]s.\n*'''Tiny Tomes''' sells [[spellbook]]s with only one [[spell]] each.\n*'''Tremendous Tomes''' sells many [[spellbook]]s with eight [[spell]]s each.\n*'''Vocational Training''' sells [[manual]]s of [[Invocations]] and [[Evocations]].\n*Some shops appear near [[altar]]s:\n**'''Cheibriados's Comfort Zone''' sells highly enchanted armour of [[ponderousness]].\n**'''Gozag's Platinum Reserve''' sells outrageously expensive [[artefact]]s.\n**'''Zin's Purification Station''' sells [[potions of curing]].\n*[[Xom]] may \"banish\" you to a Bazaar with three special shops:\n**'''Party Supplies''' sells risky [[potions]] and [[scrolls]], as well as some [[darts]].\n**'''Ever-Affordable Forbidden Knowledge / Easily-Learnt Chaos Theory / Trivially-Accessible Secrets / Fathomable Mysteries''' sells a manual, wands, talismans, and Xom-themed spellbooks.\n**'''Avant-Garde Galleria / Bespoke Boutique / Haute Couture Collection / Ready-To-Wear Runway''' sells chaotic and risky weapons, rings, orbs, and scarves.\n*A few shops can be found in \"grated communities\":\n**'''Legendary Smithy''' sells poor-quality weapons and armour (though they may be rare equipment like [[quick blade]]s or [[demon blade]]s).\n**'''Miraculous Elixirs''' sells [[potions of mutation]].\n\nIn addition, there are two things that appear to be shops, but aren't:\n*'''Shop [[mimic]]s''' resemble shops, and disappear as soon as you step adjacent to them.\n*[[File:Abandoned shop.png]]'''Abandoned shops''' sell no items and cannot be entered. They are very rarely generated, mostly found in [[the Abyss]] or in bazaars, but also appear when you buy out the entire stock of any other shop, or abandon [[Gozag]]. There is no way to interact with them, and they will never be restocked.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*When you buy items from a non-antique shop, they become [[identification|identified]], so you can use this to ID potions/scrolls. This saves you from having to read a [[scroll of identify]] or having to blind-use the item first.\n**Antique shops let you buy unidentified items at a discount.\n*If you lack the gold to buy something in a shop, you can use the menu to add it to your shopping list. The game will then remind you about the item when you've acquired enough gold. You can use the '''$''' command at any time to review your current shopping list.\n*You can examine what's for sale at any shop you've already visited. Simply press '''CTRL'''+'''f''', search for \"shop\", press '''!''' to look into descriptions, and then press the letter of the shop you're interested in.\n*If you get messages about a \"tolling bell\" when exploring, that means a [[bazaar]] portal is on your level - hurry up and find it, as it will not stay open forever. It's usually best to enter immediately if you have a moderate amount of gold (around 1000-2000); this will let you buy just about any awesome item or a large number of consumables, and the potential benefit to immediate survivability is usually well worth the tiny risk of losing out on particularly awesome (un)randart because you didn't have enough gold.\n*If you have cleared all locations where shops can spawn naturally, and you aren't worshipping (or planning to worship) [[Gozag]] or [[Zin]], feel free to spend all your gold.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.32]], untimed bazaars were removed, and Xom bazaars were added.\n*In [[0.28]], the average number of items in a shop was reduced; from <code>4 + 3d12/3</code> to <code>4 + 3d8/3</code>.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], the first three floors of [[the Dungeon]] couldn't have shops. Also, gadget shops were removed in this version.\n*In [[0.14]], wand shops were merged into gadget shops. Gadget shops could also sell rods.\n*Gadget shops were added in [[0.13]].\n*Prior to [[0.9]], all undesirable scrolls and potions cost 1 gold.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

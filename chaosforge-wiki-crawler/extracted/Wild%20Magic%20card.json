{"title":"Wild Magic card","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wild_Magic_card","type":"raw","data":"{{Version021}}\n{{flavour|The card depicts a pointy wizard's hat, scorched and resting on a pile of ashes.}}\nDrawing the '''Wild Magic card''' affects all enemies in your line of sight, hitting them with random [[miscast effect]]s, and restores your [[MP]] slightly for each enemy affected. The higher the power of the card, the more powerful the miscast effect. If there are no enemies in sight, nothing happens.\n\nThe miscast effects have the potential to be explosions which can also hit the player - therefore you should be careful drawing from destruction decks at low [[HP]].\n\nThe Wild Magic card could be found in the following [[Decks|decks]] over the past several versions.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.11]]\n![[0.12]]\n![[0.13]]\n![[0.14]]\n![[0.15]]\n![[0.16]]\n![[0.17]]\n![[0.18]]\n![[0.19]] and beyond\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of punishment|Punishment]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of punishment|Punishment]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of punishment|Punishment]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of punishment|Punishment]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of punishment|Punishment]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of destruction|Destruction]]\n|----\n|}\n\n==History==\nIn the simplification of decks in [[0.19]], this card was one of 23 to be kept, and in the process was moved to the deck of destruction.\n\nPrior to [[0.16]], the Wild Magic card affected you rather than enemies.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n{{cards}}\n\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

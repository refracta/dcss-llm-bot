For the obsolete player race, see [[Hill Dwarf]]''\n\n'''Hit dice''' ('''HD''') is roughly equivalent to a monster's [[experience level]]; it is ''not'' the same as [[hit points]]. \n\n==Useful Info==\nEach monster has a set HD value. It has an effect on the following:\n\n*Monster accuracy. Melee [[to-hit]] equals <code>18 + HD * 1.5</code>, or <code>18 + HD * 2.5</code> with the [[Fighter flag]]. Beam to-hit is <code>12 * HD</code>.\n*Monster [[spell power]]. The more HD, the stronger the spell. The exact effect depends on the spell in question.\n*Some [[attack flavour]]s are modified by HD. For example, the \"cold\" attack flavour deals more damage if the attacker has more HD.\n*Certain player effects, like [[Dazzling Flash]], [[Mephitic Cloud]], and [[atropa]] / [[datura]] [[dart]]s, check the target's HD directly. The way HD is checked depends on the effect itself.\n\nMaximum HP and [[willpower]] are also determined by HD in an indirect way. Monsters have a predefined HP/will value, independent from their HD (e.g. two monsters with the same HD can have different will). However, lowering HD will lower a monster's HP/will, while increasing HD has the opposite effect.\n\nSome examples: [[hobgoblin]]s and most other D:1 monsters have 1 HD, [[ogre (monster)|ogre]]s have 5, [[ancient lich]]es have 27. [[Cerebov]] only has 21, despite its fearsome spells. The highest-HD monsters are [[orb of fire|orbs of fire]], at 30: this is why they deal so much damage with their spells.\n\n===Modifying===\nThe player can temporarily reduce monsters' HD by [[draining]] them (weapons of [[draining (brand)|draining]], certain other [[negative energy]]-based attacks), or by [[Malmutate|malmutating]] them (such as from [[Irradiate]]). \n\nFor [[Summonings]] spells, you can increase HD of your [[summon]]s by increasing [[spell power]].\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]"}

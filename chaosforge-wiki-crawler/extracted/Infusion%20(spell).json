{"title":"Infusion (spell)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Infusion_(spell)","type":"raw","data":"{{Obsolete}}\n''For the glove [[ego]] based on this spell, see [[Infusion (ego)]].''\n{{Spell\n|name=Infusion\n|level=1\n|school1={{Charms}}\n|school2=\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Battle]] \n</div>\n|castingnoise=1\n|spellnoise=0\n}}\n'''Infusion''' was a level 1 [[Charms]] spell which granted additional melee damage costing [[MP]] with each strike. [[Skald]]s start with the Infusion spell memorised.\n\n==Effect==\nWhile Infusion status is active melee attacks deal <code>2 + <power> / 12</code> more damage<ref>{{source ref|0.25.1|melee-attack.cc|432}}</ref> at a cost of 1 [[MP]] per hit. This additional damage is reduced by [[AC]] separately from your normal attack.\n\nInfusion will not activate as long as you have 0 MP remaining, but will resume its effect once you've regenerated at least 1 MP.\n\nStatus lasts for <code>8 + 2d<power></code> turns<ref>{{source ref|0.25.1|spl-selfench.cc|162}}</ref>, and can be extended by casting the spell again.\n\nThe effect triggers on any successful melee attack, including attacks not explicitly controlled by the player (riposte and cleaving).\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile it's nice to have a level 1 spell that gives you a pseudo-[[slaying]] bonus, be aware that it can chew through your MP reserves quickly, and that the additional damage will have little impact against enemies with even modest [[AC]]. It can help you deal quick damage to threats in the early game, but don't expect it to help much against [[orc warrior]]s and the like.\n\n==History==\n*Infusion was removed in [[0.26]].\n*In [[0.18]], the power cap was lowered allowing scaling more quickly to the same damage bonus as before.\n*Infusion was added in [[0.13]].\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

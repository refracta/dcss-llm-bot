It has been specially enchanted to protect against the desiccating effects of salt.}}\n[[File:Hat_of_pondering.png]] '''''the +3 hat of Pondering'''''\n\n+3 [[hat]]\n\n[[Ponderousness]] ego<br>\n+40 [[Willpower]] (Will+)<br>\n+5 [[Intelligence]]<br>\n+10 [[MP]]\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''hat of Pondering'''<ref>{{source ref|0.32.0|art-data.txt|1154}}</ref> provides great bonuses to spellcasting, and a useful will bonus on top. However, the movement penalty can be dangerous - it makes retreat more difficult. Luckily, this hat is most beneficial to those who are likely to have the means to speed themselves up, i.e. mages with spells like [[Swiftness]] or [[Blink]]. \n\nCharacters which are faster or slower than usual have unique interactions with the Hat of Pondering:\n*[[Cheibriados]] worshippers, [[Barachim]], and [[Naga]]s are already slower than usual; they don't mind being slower (as much as others).\n*[[Armataur]]s wearing the [[lightning scales]] move fast; having ponderousness puts them back at normal speed.\n*[[Spriggan]]s can still outrun normal-speed monsters, but are unable to outrun [[haste]]d normal-speed monsters. Wearing this hat drops Spriggans from 166% to 142% move speed, making them slower than certain enemies (such as [[centaur]]s, [[juggernaut]]s, [[Mennas]], and [[orbs of fire]]).\n\nTrue to its lore, the hat of Pondering is sometimes found on [[Gastronok]] (10% chance).\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Headgear]]"}

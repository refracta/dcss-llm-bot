Like all bears, when near death they often go [[berserk]], enhancing their damage output tremendously. While they hit hard normally, they are stronger than [[stone giant]]s when berserk. Coupled with significant [[HP]] and [[fire resistance|rF+]], they can often survive long enough to get some heavy hits in. They can be found in the [[Enchanted Forest]].\n\n<!--spl-bot-begin-->\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster\n|number=\n|slot1=''none''\n|slot2=''none''\n|slot3=''none''\n|slot4=''none''\n|slot5=''none''\n|slot6=[[Berserker Rage]]\n}}\n{{clear}}\n<!--spl-bot-end-->\n\n==History==\nAncient bears were never included in a stable release of ''Crawl''. They were considered for inclusion in [[0.14]], but with the removal of the Enchanted Forest, it was decided to remove them entirely."}

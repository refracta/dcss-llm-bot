{"title":"Blessed weapon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Blessed_weapon","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n'''Blessed weapons''' are powerful weapons that have been enhanced by the will of [[the Shining One]]. They always bear a [[holy wrath]] brand, and always have slightly better base stats than their non-blessed counterparts.\n\n==Types==\nMost types of blessed weapons are '''blessed''' blades, that is, [[Long Blades]] that have slightly enhanced stats and a holy wrath brand. Blessed [[demon blade]]s are called [[eudemon blade]]s. \n\nIn addition, there are [[trishula]]s and [[sacred scourge]]s, which are blessed versions of [[demon trident]]s and [[demon whip]]s, respectively.\n\n==Obtaining==\nBlessed blades (as well as scourges and trishulas) are never found as random loot, but can be acquired in two ways:\n\n===The Shining One===\nOnce you've achieved ****** piety with [[the Shining One]], he gives you the option to have a single weapon blessed at his [[altar]]. Such a weapon will have its existing brand (if any) replaced with a [[holy wrath]] [[brand]], and is also affected as though you'd just read a [[scroll of enchant weapon]] III. Additionally, any [[demon]]ic weapon you bless will become its [[holy]] counterpart:\n\n*Demon blade -> Eudemon blade\n*Demon whip -> Sacred scourge\n*Demon trident -> Trishula\n\nFinally, if the blessed weapon is a long blade, it will have its base stats enhanced as it becomes a blessed blade. The weapon will have the \"blessed\" prefix attached to it, turning it into, for example, a \"blessed scimitar of holy wrath.\"\n\n===Holy Monster Drops===\nYou can also find blessed blades by killing certain [[holy]] monsters. [[Angel]]s have a 25% chance to be generated with a scared scourge, while [[daeva]]s and [[Mennas]] will carry either a eudemon blade, a blessed scimitar, a blessed long sword, or a blessed falchion. No other monster can generate with any type of blessed weapon. Notably, this means trishulas will never naturally appear anywhere in the dungeon: they must be created by blessing a demon trident.\n\n==Blessed Blade Stats==\nBlessed blades are generally superior to the weapons they are created from, though the loss of the original brand may be undesirable in certain situations. The stats of all possible blessed blades are shown in the table below. The final stats of the blessed blade are shown, with the blessing adjustments on the base stats shown in parentheses (if any).\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n! Long Blade || Damage || Accuracy || Delay || Min Delay\n|-\n| [[Falchion]] || 9 (+1) || +2 || 120% (-10%) || 60%\n|-\n| [[Long sword]] || 11 (+1) || +0 (-1) || 130% (-10%) || 60% (-10%)\n|-\n| [[Scimitar]] || 13 (+1) || -1 (-1) || 130% (-10%) || 60% (-10%)\n|-\n| [[Demon blade]] ([[Eudemon blade]]) || 14 (+1) || -2 (-1) || 120% (-10%) || 60%\n|-\n| [[Bastard sword]] || 16 (+1) || -2 (-1) || 140% (-10%) || 70%\n|-\n| [[Great sword]] || 17 (+1) || -4 (-1) || 150% (-10%) || 70%\n|-\n| [[Claymore]] || 20 (+1) || -5 (-1) || 180% (-10%) || 70%\n|}\n\nTwo of these weapons in particular stand out:\n\n*A blesssed scimitar has the same stats as a [[demon blade]], making it a respectable one-handed weapon, especially considering how useful the holy wrath brand can be in the extended endgame. Obviously a eudemon blade is better, and any TSO worshiper planning to make a one-handed holy long blade should bless a demon blade. However, a blessed scimitar dropped by a daeva or Mennas is a very nice find for a non-TSO worshiper who wishes to tackle the extended endgame.\n*A blessed claymore has the highest base damage of any weapon wieldable by normal sized races. It does as much damage as a [[giant club]], not to mention the holy wrath brand. Unfortunately, it will never be found randomly, as no holy monster will drop one. It is a very worthwhile thing to make for a shields-free TSO worshiper, however.\n\n==Destroying Blessed Weapon==\nYou can convert any blessed blade (or TSO-blessed demonic weapon) back into its non-blessed counterpart by having [[Kikubaaqudgha]] or [[Lugonu]] \"bless\" it at their altars. This is rarely, if ever, a good trade.\n\n==When to Make a Blessed Weapon==\nDespite what one might think, it is not always best for a TSO player to choose a long blade or a demon weapon to bless at an altar.  Those who do not use long blades, polearms, or maces and flails will most likely want to bless a good weapon in whatever category they use (likely an [[executioner's axe]], [[lajatang]], or [[quick blade]]).  Even those who use maces and flails or polearms may want to consider blessing a [[giant spiked club]]/[[great mace]] or [[bardiche]] instead.  Even though their base stats won't be enhanced, the greater damage from these two-handed weapons is often a better choice, especially in view of the fact that many late-game threats (such as [[torment]] and [[hellfire]]) bypass shields entirely.\n\nCharacters who are likely to choose to bless a demon weapon include some types of magic-melee hybrids, and of course small characters who cannot effectively wield larger weapons anyway.  Also, characters who have yet to find a better weapon in their school (most likely long blades users who have yet to find a claymore) may want to go ahead and bless a demon weapon.\n\n==History==\n* In [[0.16]], blessed blades were removed. TSO can still convert demon weapons into their blessed versions, and can bless any weapon with the [[holy wrath]] brand (just not with a a unique base type).\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Weapons]]\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

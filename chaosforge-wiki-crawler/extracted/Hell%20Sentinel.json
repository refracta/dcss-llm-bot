{"title":"Hell Sentinel","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hell_Sentinel","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Hell Sentinels''' are massive demonic constructs, immune to all elemental damage except for [[holy]] and [[acid]] and boasting very high AC. Although they lack the ability to [[torment]] you, they can still deal heavy damage in melee or at range. Between their durability and irresistible damage output, they are some of the deadliest normal enemies in the game. They can be found in [[Pandemonium]] and the [[Hell]]s, particularly [[the Iron City of Dis]], as well as rarely appearing in [[the Abyss]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Unlike with [[fiend]]s, merely being within LOS of one of these is not an extreme emergency. They are unable to inflict torment, and they have only normal speed. So long as you aren't a [[naga]], [[barachi]], or [[Cheibriados]] worshiper, simply walking away from one may be the best option.\n*All of their attacks require a clear line of fire, so characters capable of flooding them with summoned units can eventually defeat them in safety, hiding in the background. Their massive damage output will chew through your summons quickly, however, so a source of [[MP]] [[channeling]] may be necessary.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Hell Sentinels were [[spiny]], damaging players who hit them in melee.\n*Hell Sentinels were added in [[0.11]], replacing [[pit fiend]]s as the iron-themed [[tier-1 demon]]."}

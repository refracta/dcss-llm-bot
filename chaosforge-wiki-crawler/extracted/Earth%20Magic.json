{"title":"Earth Magic","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Earth_Magic","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n'''Earth Magic''' skill determines how easily you can use spells that shape or use earth, stone, iron and other such materials. \n\nEarth Magic spells deal physical damage, having no elemental resistance. Its [[Conjurations]] abuse this fact, being single target spells with good damage, but relatively poor accuracy. The school also has a variety of supportive spells, namely [[Transmutations]].\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n{{spell table by level|Earth}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{spell sources|Earth|Book of Annihilations,Book of Armaments,Book of the Earth,Book of Geomancy,Book of Iron}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Earth Elementalist]]\n\n==History==\n*[[0.28]] Only monsters can cast [[Bolt of Magma]].\n*[[0.27]] Added [[Animate Armour]].\n*[[0.21]] Added [[Borgnjor's Vile Clutch]].\n*[[0.18]] Removed [[Stoneskin]].\n*[[0.8]] Added [[Leda's Liquefaction]].\n*[[0.5]] Added [[Petrify]].\n\n{{Skills}}\n[[Category:Earth Magic|*]]\n[[Category:Magic skills]]"}

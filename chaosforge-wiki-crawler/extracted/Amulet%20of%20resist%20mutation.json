While [[potions of cure mutation]] can get rid of them, they are very rare. Thus, resist mutation is extremely helpful in [[Slime Pits]], [[Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], and [[Zot]], where malmutation is common. In other places, malmutation is generally too rare to be worth thinking about.\n\nCharacters that use [[Haste]], [[Invisibility]], and/or [[Controlled Blink]] may want to keep one on hand, in case they get too much magical contamination. Even though resist mutation is less effective for these cases, it's better than nothing. You can swap in the amulet after you finish a fight.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.18]], amulets of resist mutation was removed. Remaining sources of mutation resistance include [[Zin]] worship, the mutation resistance mutation, and certain artefacts such as the [[Lajatang of Order]] and [[Hat of the Alchemist]].\n\n{{amulets}}"}

With even a small amount of training in [[Short Blades]], its [[Pain brand]] can wreak havoc in melee very quickly, and the [[intelligence]] and [[willpower]] boosts it provides are useful as well. Other spellcasters may want it simply for the intelligence bonus, but without skill in Necromancy, you really won't get much combat use out of it. Even with Necromancy skill, don't expect this little dagger to be of use against anything with [[negative energy]] resistance.\n\nThis artefact is more likely to spawn in the early game, where it is more likely to be useful.\n\nAlthough once owned by the [[unique]] [[lich]] [[Boris]], Morg can now only be found as random loot; he will never drop it when killed. Bringing it to him has no special effect.\n\n==History==\n*Morg was removed in [[0.30]].\n*In [[0.28]], Morg was made more likely to spawn in the early-game (and less likely to spawn in other areas).\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Short blades]]"}

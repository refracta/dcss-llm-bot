Mosquitoes are weak but fast, the come in swarms, and they can heal themselves with their bites.\n\n==Strategy==\n[[Dispel Undead]] is very handy against them. [[Airstrike]] also works very well. If you have neither, at least try to fight them in a corridor, so they can't surround you.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], it was possible to create [[derived undead]] from vampire mosquitoes.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], they had a weaker vampiric attack but an additional [[sickness]] attack.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], they were called '''giant mosquitoes''' and were significantly weaker."}

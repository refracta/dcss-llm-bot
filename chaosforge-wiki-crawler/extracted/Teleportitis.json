{"title":"Teleportitis","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Teleportitis","type":"raw","data":"{{version022}}\n'''Teleportitis''' is a condition which causes your character to involuntarily [[teleport]] next to, or near monsters.\n\nTeleportitis only triggers when it would land the player in [[LOS]] of enemies. It will not trigger in [[Labyrinth]]s or the [[Abyss]].\n\n[[Formicid]]s, possessing innate stasis, cannot be affected by teleportitis. Items possessing the property '''-TELE''' (typically found in [[randart]]s) will also prevent this from occurring, or if the player is affected by the [[Dimension Anchor]] spell.\n\nThere are three sources of teleportitis:\n*The [[Bad mutations#Teleport|Teleport]] [[mutation]] (frequency and distance teleported rises with mutation ranks)\n*Wearing a [[ring of teleportation]] (these normally generate [[cursed]])\n*Wearing or wielding an [[artefact]] with the *Tele property.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.15]], the random teleports from teleportitis could be controlled with [[teleport control]].\n\n[[Category:Threats]]"}

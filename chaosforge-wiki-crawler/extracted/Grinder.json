{"title":"Grinder","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Grinder","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Grinder''' is a dangerous [[unique]] [[shadow imp]] who tortures her victims, paralyzing them and then inflicting pain until the subject dies. She is notorious for killing characters long before they have the means of facing her.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:3-6\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Encountering an early Grinder can be extremely dangerous, as her paralysis is almost guaranteed to end the game for very low-level characters. Definitely consider ignoring her for the time being and coming back when you're a little better prepared. She's normal speed, so if you turn around and flee while she's at the edge of your [[line of sight]], you'll probably be able to reach a staircase safely. Return to the floor through a different staircase and come back for her when you're more experienced.\n*If you decide you do want to kill her immediately, use whatever tools you have access to. Don't be afraid to drink those [[potions of heal wounds]] you just identified if you get badly injured. Any sources of [[willpower]] and [[negative energy]] resistance you can wear are strongly recommended.\n*Consider using a [[potion of lignification]] if you have one. [[Tree form]] is immune to Pain and has a high AC in case you get paralysed. Just be careful of other enemies in the area. A [[potion of attraction]] can bring her back into range of your tree fists.\n*Grinder is a bad target for a [[wand of polymorph]]. As demons can only turn into other demons, she is very likely to turn into something even more dangerous.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Grinder could [[see invisible]].\n*Grinder was male before version [[0.19]]\n*Prior to [[0.8]], Grinder would spawn on D:6-12, wield a (sometimes [[pain brand]]ed) [[club]], and knew [[Brain Feed]] instead of [[Paralyse]]."}

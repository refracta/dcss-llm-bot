{"title":"Seal Doors","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Seal_Doors","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Imparts seals on nearby doors and stairs, preventing those not allied with the caster from traversing them.}}\n'''Seal Doors''' is a monster-only spell which seals shut not only [[door]]s, but [[stairs]] as well, making them impassible/unusable by the player until the duration of the effect ends, the [[vault warden]] which created the seal is killed, or the seal has been destroyed. The seal lasts for 8-15 turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-cast.cc|2309}}</ref> A door that is sealed shut will immediately shove any items, creatures, or even players out of the way in the process of closing; there is no way to prevent the effect. Even broken doors can be sealed -- this will leave behind a functional door once the seal wears off.\n\nNormally it affects all doors and stairs in an 8-tile radius around the vault warden, but there is a [[tension]] mechanic that tries to avoid trapping dangerous monsters behind an affected door, and a door that the vault warden is standing in will not be affected.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n===Opening or destroying a sealed door===\nThere are a few ways to destroy a sealed door:\n*[[Shatter]]\n*[[Lugonu]]'s ''Corrupt'' ability\n*[[Fedhas]]' ''Overgrow'' ability\n\nSealed staircases cannot be destroyed (and in any event that would be useless).\n\nSealed doors can, however, be opened by monsters, usually because they were aware of you but on the other side of the door when it closed. This breaks the seal, but the tension mechanic makes this unlikely. It is possible to leave via the door when this happens, but it is likely the vault warden will recast the spell soon.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.22]], [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] could be used to destroy sealed doors.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], [[wands of disintegration]] and [[Orb of Destruction]] could destroy doors.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], Seal Doors was not able to seal stairways, and sealed doors could be affected by [[digging]] and [[disintegration]]. \n*Seal Doors was added in [[0.12]] along with the vault wardens.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

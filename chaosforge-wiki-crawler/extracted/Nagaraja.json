{"title":"Nagaraja","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Nagaraja","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | nagas}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Nagaraja''' are the most powerful members of the [[list of nagas|naga]] race, and are found guarding the chamber of the serpentine [[rune of Zot]] in the [[Snake Pit]]. They are capable opponents with both melee and magic and have far more endurance than lesser nagas.\n\n{{monster spells|nagaraja}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nTheir combat spells are difficult to fully resist against; [[poison resistance]] will take the worst of the sting out of Poison Arrow, while high [[AC]] can somewhat reduce damage from their physical attacks. [[Repel Missiles]], if you have it, will give you a decent chance of avoiding their ranged attacks entirely. In any case, try not to let more than one have line of fire to you at a time, and don't charge headlong into the rune chamber.\n\nHigh willpower will allow you to resist [[Dimension Anchor]] and prevent you from getting locked into a dangerous fight.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], nagarajas could cast [[Force Lance]] and had [[Teleport Other]] instead of [[Dimension Anchor]].\n*Prior to [[0.25]], nagarajas had [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]] instead of [[Force Lance]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], they were known as greater nagas.\n\n[[Category:Naga]]"}

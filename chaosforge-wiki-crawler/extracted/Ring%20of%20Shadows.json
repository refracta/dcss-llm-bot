{"title":"Ring of Shadows","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ring_of_Shadows","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|A black ring that can make its wearer one with the shadows. It surrounds you with an aura of shadow, increasing your stealth and reducing the accuracy of all others within it.}}\n\n[[File:Ring_of_shadows.png]] '''''the ring of Shadows'''''<br>\nGenerates a 3-tile [[umbra]]<br>\nAllows the wearer to turn [[Invisibility (ego)|invisible]]<br>\n+50 [[Stealth]]<br>\n__NOTOC__\n==Mechanics==\nThe [[umbra]] increases the wearer's stealth score by +50%, applied after the ring's +50 bonus.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|player.cc|3135}}</ref> Also, any affected monster inside the umbra has its [[accuracy]] reduced by avg. 3.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|attack.h|17}}</ref> [[Undead]] and [[demonic]] monsters are immune to the accuracy penalty, as well as [[death knight]]s.\n\nIf you are worshipping [[Dithmenos]], only the higher of the two umbra stealth bonuses are used. So a 6* Dithmenos worshipper will get a total of x2 stealth from their god; a 1* worshiper will get x1.5 from the ring of Shadows.\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''ring of Shadows'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|1084}}</ref> is a nice find for stealthy characters. The umbra boosts stealth, and even for 0 stealth brutes, it increases your chance to dodge attacks. However, a [[ring of evasion]] or [[ring of protection|protection]] will offer better defense once an enemy notices you.\n\nAny character can keep this ring around as a swapout, in case you want to evoke invisibility. Due to the [[drain]] this ability causes (even if you fail), it is recommended to have good [[Evocations]] before evoking it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], the ring's umbra penalized the wearer's accuracy.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], evoking invisibility did not [[drain]] the user.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], it had [[see invisible]] and rN+ instead of a +50 Stealth bonus.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], it had +4 EV and -4 accuracy instead of umbra.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Ring]]"}

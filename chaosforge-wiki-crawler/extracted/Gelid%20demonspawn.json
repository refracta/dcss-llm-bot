{"title":"Gelid demonspawn","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Gelid_demonspawn","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{List of | demonspawn}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Gelid demonspawn''' are demonspawn with 10 extra points of [[AC]] thanks to their [[Icemail]] passive ability. They can be found in the [[Pandemonium]] and guarding it's portals.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nSince they are not particularly different from a normal demonspawn, just with Icemail and a resistance to cold, use fire attacks on them, since their Icemail will melt, leaving them rather weak. Like all demonspawn, they are also vulnerable to holy weapons and [[silver]], so use those if you have them.\n\n==History==\n*Monstrous, gelid, infernal, and torturous demonspawn were removed in [[0.28]].\n*Gelid demonspawn were added in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Demonspawn]]"}

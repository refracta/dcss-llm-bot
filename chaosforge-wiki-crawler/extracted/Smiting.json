{"title":"Smiting","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Smiting","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n:''This page is about the monster-only spell.  For the targeting mode, see [[Smite-targeted]].''\n{{Flavour|This spell smites your foe with divine wrath.}}\n\n'''Smiting''' is a monster-only spell which instantly and unavoidably deals 7-17 damage to a single target. This spell can affect any target within the caster's [[line of sight]] regardless of obstacles in the way (except for transparent [[wall]]s), ignores [[AC]], and cannot miss its target. Its distinct targeting method has led to the term \"smite-targeted\" to refer to any unavoidable LOS-targetable effect.\n\nSmiting is also used by various [[god]]s during [[divine retribution]], while players who worship [[Beogh]] can invoke Smiting for themselves.\n\n==Monster Version==\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\nIt is a notorious killer of early game characters, since [[orc priest]]s can be found as early as D:2, where 7-17 damage is quite a big deal. Mid- and late-game characters can better survive the spell, but smiters often come in great numbers, able to wear you down or finish you off. No matter how skilled or well-equipped you are, there is only one thing in the game capable of reducing the damage from Smiting: [[Death's Door]]. As such, most players consider smite-capable enemies to be high priorities, killing them quickly or fleeing behind a corner to lure them into a more manageable range.\n\nNote that smite targeting treats [[Wall#Transparent rock|transparent walls]] as solid for targeting, but it will ignore other [[wall|dungeon feature]]s, like [[iron grate]]s.\n\n==Divine Smiting==\nCertain [[god]]s may smite those who have [[divine retribution|angered them]]. When this occurs, it deals 4 + 1d10 + 4d(your experience level) damage, which can potentially be quite devastating. However, there is a Piety/400 chance that your ''current'' god will shield you from this, negating it entirely. Whether the smite hits you or not, this event still decreases your penance counter.\n\n==Player Version==\nAlthough you cannot learn the spell Smiting, worshipers of [[Beogh]] are given a Smite power. This functions identically, except that its damage is determined by your [[Invocations]] skill:\n\n{{crawlquote|Damage <nowiki>=</nowiki> 7 + 33 * (1d(30 + 6 * Invocations) - 1)/191}}\n\nAt 27 Invocations, this allows for a maximum of roughly 40 damage, though low to mid 20's are much more common. Also, each use of this ability consumes some [[piety]] as well as [[MP]], making it impossible to spam for long.\n\nWorshipers of [[Zin]] may also occasionally call down Smiting upon their foes by using his Recite ability (Abominations, Ablutions, or Apostates).\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], the only other way to resist Smiting, damage shaving from playing a [[Deep Dwarf]], was removed.\n*Prior to [[0.11]], players could gain access to smiting through a [[rod of smiting]].\n*During [[Linley's Dungeon Crawl]], the [[holy spell school]] existed, which included the Smiting player spell."}

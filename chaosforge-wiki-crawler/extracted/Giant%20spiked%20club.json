It is a two handed weapon.}}\n\n'''Giant spiked clubs''' are the largest, most powerful melee weapons in the game. Only [[Troll]]s, [[Oni]], and [[Formicid]]s have the strength to wield them at all. Either way, it requires two hands to wield (or all four, for Formicids) and very high skill to swing quickly.\n\nAlthough very rare to find on the floor, [[ogre (monster)|ogres]] will often carry these, making them available in the early [[Dungeon]]. They are never [[brand]]ed normally, but can be affected by a [[scroll of brand weapon]], and [[Trog]] or [[Okawaru]] may gift you [[randart]] giant spiked clubs (including ones with the much-coveted [[speed brand]]).\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!  || Mundane || Magical || Artifact\n|-\n| Image || [[File:Giant spiked club.png]] || [[File:Giant spiked club2.png]] || [[File:Giant spiked club3.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*From [[0.17]] to [[0.20]], giant spiked clubs had a base delay of 19, and so reached minimum delay at 24 skill.\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

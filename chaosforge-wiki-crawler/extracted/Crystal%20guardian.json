{"title":"Crystal guardian","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Crystal_guardian","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{list of|constructs}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Crystal guardians''' are moderately durable [[list of golems|golems]] capable of launching powerful bolts of crystal at anything they encounter. These bolts are unusual in that they can make the target [[fragile]]. Crystal guardians can be found in [[the Vaults]] (usually with a [[peacekeeper]]), the [[Desolation of Salt]], and some [[vault]]s.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Their bolts can make you [[fragile]], so try not to let them hit you when other monsters are around.\n*They have infinite [[willpower]] and resistances to most elements. [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] will obliterate them (and anything nearby). Other sorts of [[Earth Magic]] and pure [[Conjurations]] are also effective.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], crystal guardians had [[Crystal Bolt]] instead of [[Crystallizing Shot]].\n*Crystal guardians were added in [[0.14]], replacing [[crystal golem]]s."}

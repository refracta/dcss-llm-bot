{"title":"Demonspawn","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Demonspawn","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n''This page refers to the player [[species]]. For the monster, see [[Demonspawn (monster)]]. For a list of all monstrous demonspawn, see [[List of demonspawn]]. For a list of their mutations, see [[Demonspawn mutations]].''\n{{flavour|Demonspawn are horrible half-mortal, half-infernal creatures. Demonspawn can be created in any number of ways: magical experiments, breeding, unholy pacts, etc. Although many Demonspawn may initially be indistinguishable from those of pure mortal stock, they will inevitably grow horns, scales or other unusual features. Powerful members of this class of beings also develop a range of unholy abilities, which are listed as mutations.\n\nDemonspawn advance slowly in experience and learn most skills slightly slower than Humans, although they are talented at some forms of magic. They learn Invocations especially quickly, although the good gods will not accept their worship due to their unholy nature.}}\n\n==Innate Abilities==\n*Demonspawn are considered '''[[evil]]''' - they cannot worship any of the good gods ([[Zin]], [[Elyvilon]], or [[The Shining One]]), they have vulnerability to [[holy|holy damage]] and [[holy wrath]], and the [[holy wrath]] brand is disabled for them. However, they aren't true [[demon]]s, so they don't get any of the demonic resistances by default (e.g. no poison/torment resistance without a mutation).\n\nDemonspawn have a base [[Strength]] of 8, [[Intelligence]] of 8 and [[Dexterity]] of 8 (before Background modifiers).\n\n==Preferred Backgrounds==\n*'''Warriors:''' [[Gladiator]]\n*'''Zealots:''' [[Berserker]]\n*'''Mages:''' [[Hedge Wizard]], [[Necromancer]], [[Fire Elementalist]], [[Ice Elementalist]], [[Venom Mage]]\n\n==Level Bonuses==\n*+1 to a random [[stat]] every 4th level.\n*Average [[HP]] and [[MP]].\n*+3 [[willpower]] per level.\n*Gain more of your \"demonic ancestry\" (random [[demonspawn mutations]]) as you rise in level. The levels this occurs at are randomized, but will include at least five full-ranked mutations by level 27. Some of these mutations are available only to Demonspawn. Note that demonspawn mutations will increase the damage you take from [[silver]] weaponry.\n\n==Starting Skills and Equipment==\nDemonspawn begin with the equipment and skills listed for their background, adjusted for their aptitudes.\n\n==Difficulty of Play==\n{{Moderate}}\n\nDemonspawn can be a moderately difficult race to play. They are similar to [[Human]]s, but with worse aptitudes and leveling. To compensate, you'll get random mutations over time - these vary from irritating, to interesting, to game-changing. See the [[demonspawn mutation]] page if you want to figure out the ways your character can grow. It can take a while for these mutations to really develop, so their early game can be difficult.\n\nSince Demonspawn can't worship [[good god]]s or wield [[holy wrath]] weapons, their options in [[extended]] are more limited. However, by the time you reach extended, you'll have a full gamut of mutations to take advantage of.\n\n{{species_aptitudes|Demonspawn}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nSome combinations of demonspawn mutations have great synergy with some character types:\n*Casters with knowledge of [[Freezing Cloud]] will greatly enjoy having [[Icemail]]; dropping a cloud around you will cancel out most fire based spells.\n*[[Powered by Pain]] / [[Powered by Death]] and [[Mana Shield]] can give you fantastic mana regeneration and durability.\n\n==Trivia==\nDemonspawn are by far the most popular species, judging from the number of online games played. Note that, due to the prevalence of [[scumming|start scumming]] for a 'good' mutation set, this number is most likely inflated.\n\n==History==\nDemonspawn are as unstable as they are in game. For changes in their mutation set, see [[Demonspawn mutations#History|Demonspawn mutation's History]].\n\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Demonspawn had 1 more intelligence, for base attributes of 8 Str / 9 Int / 8 Dex.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Demonspawn dealt more damage than normal while wielding demonic weapons ([[demon trident]]s, [[demon whip]]s, and [[demon blade]]s).\n\n{{species}}"}

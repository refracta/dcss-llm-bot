{"title":"Dancing weapon","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dancing_weapon","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Dancing weapons''' are [[weapon]]s animated into life, fast enemies that hit relatively hard. While they have pathetic HP, they have high [[EV]] and a wide array of resistances, making them annoying to fight. Be aware that their stats vary based on the weapon type; dancing [[dagger]]s are much less of a threat than dancing [[giant spiked club]]s. Dancing weapons can have [[enchant]]ment and [[brand]]s, which work as normal.\n\nInstead of leaving [[corpse]]s, dancing weapons simply become their base weapons when killed (unless they were [[summon]]ed). Unless the weapon was animated by [[Tukima's Dance]], [[Gozag]] turns these weapons into gold.\n\nFriendly weapons can appear via:\n*[[Tukima's Dance]]\n*[[Xom]] action\n\nHostile weapons can appear via:\n*Wandering the [[Elven Halls]] (especially in the Hall of Blades on Elf:2)\n*[[Zenata]]'s [[Sheza's Dance]] spell\n*In [[Tukima's Studio]]\n*[[Xom]] action\n*[[Beogh]]'s and [[Wu Jian]]'s wrath.\n\nDancing [[Ranged Weapons]] may appear, but only in certain [[vault]]s or as a result of Tukima's Dance.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Spells that deal non-elemental damage, such as [[Airstrike]], [[Stone Arrow]], or [[Iskenderun's Mystic Blast]], are very effective against dancing weapons.\n*Dancing weapons also lack [[see invisible]], so [[stabbing]] specialists with access to [[invisibility]] should have an easy time with them.\n*In console, dancing weapons are distinguishable at a glance from normal melee weapons since they are \"reversed\": dancing weapons are represented by {{Black|(}}, while normal weapons are represented by {{Black|)}}.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.27]], ranged dancing weapons were added."}

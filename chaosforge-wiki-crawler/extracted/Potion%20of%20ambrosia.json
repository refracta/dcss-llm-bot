Consuming it causes regeneration of health and magic, along with total befuddlement. The two effects are fundamentally linked - the regeneration ends the moment the confusion does.}}\n{{item\n |itemtype=Potion\n |name=Potion of ambrosia\n}}\n\nQuaffing a '''potion of ambrosia''' inflicts 3-10 turns of [[confusion]] (bypassing [[clarity]]), but during this time, you'll quickly regenerate [[HP]] and [[MP]] (+3-5 HP and MP/turn). Ending the confusion ends the ambrosia effect, but extending confusion does not extend ambrosia.\n\nAmbrosia bypasses -Regen from [[Inhibited Regeneration]]. However, the potion's HP regeneration is reduced by the [[No Potion Heal]] mutation and stopped by the [[Robe of Vines]].\n\n==Strategy==\nAmbrosia offers decent healing and great MP regen, but is dubious to use during combat. It is best used in situations where [[rest]]ing is difficult/unsafe, such as:\n*When you 1. kill all threatening monsters in sight, 2. suspect/know that more are incoming, and 3. can't retreat upstairs.\n**[[Shaft]]s are a prime example. When you're shafted, there could be any number of monsters approaching. Due to [[noise]], that's likely. You might not have the time to rest to 100% before another threat appears; that's where ambrosia can help.\n**Another example is [[Vaults]]:5, when teleporting away from the center. The density of monsters make it hard to rest: ambrosia lets you recover a bit before the next encounter. Similarly, in the [[Tomb]], where outright escape can be problematic.\n**A [[scroll of fog]] blocks LOS, forcing distant monsters to spend a few turns to approach you. During this time, you can drink ambrosia, get some extra MP, and [[potion of curing|cure]] it after.\n*[[The Abyss]], or during the [[orb run]]. The monster spawns make it difficult/impossible to rest safely.\n*For healing through lethal [[poison]], if you haven't identified [[potions of curing]] yet.\n\nAlso, for the first few floors of the Dungeon (D:2 or so), it's unlikely for monsters to outdamage the ambrosia effect. For example, [[Monk]]s can use this potion to win fights they otherwise wouldn't.\n\nIf you can [[blink]] and are in a near-death situation where you need HP/MP, cannot outrun your opponents, and ambrosia is your only practical source of healing: blink, quaff the ambrosia, benefit from a few turns of ambrosial healing, then quaff a [[potion of curing]] to end your confusion.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Note that confusion will set your [[SH]] to zero. A two-handed [[axe]] user won't mind, but most characters shouldn't use this in combat.\n*While [[Vine Stalker]]s receive no HP benefit, their MP will still regenerate as normal, which works with their innate [[spirit shield]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.18]], clarity made potions of ambrosia useless.\n*Potions of ambrosia were added in [[0.16]]. They are based upon the [[ambrosia]] food item found in [[0.14]] and earlier.\n\n{{potions}}"}

{"title":"Daeva","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Daeva","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{list of | holy monsters}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Daevas''' are militant servants of [[the Shining One]], wielding weapons of [[holy wrath]] and occasionally [[shields]]. They are slower than [[angel]]s, but more durable and able to [[smite]] their foes. Daevas are very rare, appearing only in [[the Abyss]], holy [[Ziggurat]] floors, holy [[Pan]] levels, and in the occasional [[Dungeon]] vault hidden behind transparent walls.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*While individual smites are not terribly dangerous by the time you find one, a few daevas can hit you with enough smites over a few turns to quickly make things sour. Avoid being in line of sight if you aren't going to dispatch it.\n*It's easy to avoid daevas while wandering the Abyss. Just turn around when you see their 5-tile halo effect hit the edge of your [[LOS]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], daevas could [[see invisible]]."}

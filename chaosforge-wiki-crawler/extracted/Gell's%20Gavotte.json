{"title":"Gell's Gavotte","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Gell%27s_Gavotte","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Gell's Gavotte''' is a level 6 [[Translocations]] spell that lets the caster temporarily reorient gravity in a cardinal direction of their choices, moving everything that isn't tied down 4 tiles in that direction, potentially falling into walls and each other. This includes the caster, so the spell can be used for repositioning in some situations. Note that players in [[Tree Form]] and players with [[stasis]] cannot be moved by the spell.\n\nEnemies only take collision damage if they move at least one space from this effect.\n\nCasting this spell gives a short {{Yellow|-Gavotte}} cooldown, which lasts from <code>5 - power/50</code> to <code>9 - power/50</code> turns. This prevents the spell being used as a repeatable controlled [[blink]]. \n\n==Useful Info==\nThis spell is cast in a given direction by targeting the tile one space in that direction. \n\nThe targeter of this spell highlights monsters that will be damaged by casting the spell in a particular direction according to your knowledge of terrain and other monsters. Terrain the player has not seen yet, the presence of [[invisible]] monsters and those outside your line of sight may result in the spell having unexpected effects when cast. \n\n==Strategy==\n\n==History==\n*Added in [[0.32]] as a thematic replacement for [[Gell's Gravitas]]."}

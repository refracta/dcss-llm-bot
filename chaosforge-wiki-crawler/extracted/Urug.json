{"title":"Urug","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Urug","type":"raw","data":"{{version|025}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Urug the Orcish Ballista''' is a [[unique]] [[list of orcs|orc]] who often carries [[javelin]]s and wields a heavy weapon. Although she lacks any particularly unique traits, she can be a danger in melee or at range.\n\nIf you worship [[Beogh]], she may join you as a follower.\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Dungeon]]:10-13\n*The [[Orcish Mines]]\n*[[The Lair]]\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Fragile characters should try not to get stuck at range with her any longer than they have to, as her javelins can deal brutal damage. Try to kill her as quickly as possible or run and come back later. She only has so much ammunition, and will eventually run out, but trying to lure her into using them all up in one attempt is extremely dangerous.\n*If you have a source of [[Repel Missiles#Player sources|RMsl]], this is a good time to have it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Urug's weapons were much less nasty for her depth.\n*Urug was made significantly more dangerous in [[0.11]].\n\n[[Category:Orc]]"}

{"title":"Gargoyle (monster)","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Gargoyle_(monster)","type":"raw","data":"{{version|026}}\n''This page is about the Gargoyle [[monster]]. For the player race, see [[gargoyle]]. For a list of all gargoyles, see [[list of constructs]].''\n{{monster info|gargoyle}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Gargoyles''' are dangerous early-game [[list of constructs|constructs]] that have high [[AC]] and some resistances, but little [[HP]]. They come armed with various [[Maces & Flails|blunt weapons]], but much more deadly is their ability to cast [[Stone Arrow]], which they will use often. They can be found in the early- to middle-floors of [[the Dungeon]].\n\n{{monster spells|gargoyle}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Gargoyles can shrug off most light attacks, proving aggravating to [[short blades]]-specialists. Hit hard, quaffing a [[potion of might]] if necessary to cut through their AC and bring them down.\n*For [[Earth Elementalist]]s, gargoyles are very vulnerable to [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]], exploding into shrapnel that damages nearby opponents. Meanwhile, [[Sandblast]] is almost useless against them, as the gargoyle's high AC is applies three times against the damage output.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.14]], gargoyles were extremely rare monsters found almost exclusively in [[vault]]s. They knew no spells, wielded no weapons, and were mostly harmless."}

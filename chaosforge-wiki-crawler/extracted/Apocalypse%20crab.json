{"title":"Apocalypse crab","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Apocalypse_crab","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Apocalypse crabs''' are unpleasant [[demonic]] crustaceans who breathe huge [[Cloud#Seething chaos|clouds]] of seething chaos at you, inflicting [[chaos]] effects on you and anything standing inside. They can also inflict chaos in melee, and have resistances to fire and cold. They can usually be found in [[the Abyss]] and chaos-themed [[Ziggurat]] floors, though some Abyss- or crab-themed vaults can have them too.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Chaos can include very dangerous effects, such as [[paralysis]], so you'll want to avoid the clouds of chaos if you can.\n**Placing a cloud (such as [[scroll of fog]] or [[Mephitic Cloud]]) will prevent new clouds from being placed on the tile.\n**If you find yourself standing in one and see a chaos-free space adjacent to you, immediately step clear. Random [[Blink]] can be risky in the Abyss, so walking out as quickly as possible is your best bet.\n**[[Qazlal]] worshippers are immune to all clouds.\n*Even if you can avoid the clouds, you'll want to take them out ASAP. Their breath inflicts chaos on impact (regardless of [[cloud immunity]]), and the clouds can [[haste]] and [[berserk]] monsters standing inside. If you have some Throwing skill, [[silver]] [[javelin]]s are especially effective.\n*They have low HD and [[poison]] vulnerability. [[Wand]]s, [[Hexes]], and [[Mephitic Cloud]] are likely to disable the crab, preventing it from spewing chaos.\n\n==History==\n*Apocalypse crabs were added in [[0.12]]."}

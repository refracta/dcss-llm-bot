{"title":"Spellcasting","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spellcasting","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\nThe [[Spellcasting]] skill determines how proficient a character is at casting [[spell]]s from memory. A higher Spellcasting level gives your character more [[spell level]]s and increases your max [[MP]]. It also has a minor effect on your [[spell power]] and [[spell success]] rate (equivalent to having 1/4 of a level in every other spell school).\n\nNote that the max MP increase granted by Spellcasting is not cumulative with that of [[Invocations]]; only the higher bonus of the two is used. For this purpose, each level of Spellcasting is twice as effective as Invocations.\n\n[[Djinn]] do not get any HP or MP bonus from Spellcasting; they only benefit from the increase to power and success rate.\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.26]], Spellcasting lowered your [[spell hunger]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], this skill had a hidden cost in experience points of +30% XP; all [[species]] had their aptitudes adjusted down to account for this.\n\n{{Skills}}\n\n[[Category:Magic skills]]"}

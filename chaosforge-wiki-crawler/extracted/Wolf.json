{"title":"Wolf","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wolf","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | canines}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Wolves''' are very fast canines that travel in packs, slightly stronger than [[hound]]s but generally not too threatening so long as you don't fight a lot of them at once. They can be found wild in [[the Lair]] and the [[Ice Cave]], and appear elsewhere tamed by [[Grum]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*As with all pack monsters, try not to fight more wolves than you have to at a time. The Lair might not always have good choke points available, but you can generally at least get your back to a wall.\n*Wolves are ''extremely'' fast -- faster than everything except [[spriggan]]s, and even then, a spriggan can only keep pace and can't actually outrun them. Even a [[potion of haste]] isn't enough to allow a normal-speed character to outrun wolves on its own. If you absolutely have to escape, either combine haste and [[Swiftness]], blink to a stairway, or just read a [[scroll of teleportation]].\n*Be careful when fighting them off in a [[spriggan druid]]'s forest. Slugging it out with a pack of wolves becomes ''much'' more dangerous when someone casts [[Awaken Forest]] in the middle of the fight.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], players could summon them via [[Call Canine Familiar]].\n*[[War dog]]s were removed in [[0.13]], and wolves' stats were bumped up to compensate. Grum's pack of war dogs became a pack of wolves in that version."}

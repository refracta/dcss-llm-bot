{"title":"Wand of invisibility","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wand_of_invisibility","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{item\n |itemtype = Wand\n |name = Wand of invisibility\n |cost = ?\n}}\n\nZapping a '''wand of invisibility''' causes the target to temporarily become [[invisible]]. It is essentially identical to the [[Invisibility]] spell, and if used on the player, causes 1-2 points of immediate [[magic contamination]] followed by slow accumulation for the duration of the effect. [[Wand]]s of invisibility are slightly inferior to [[potions of invisibility]], as these inflict no initial contamination. They are very uncommon. A wand of invisibility can hold at most 9 charges.\n\n==History==\nWands of invisibility were removed in [[0.18]]."}

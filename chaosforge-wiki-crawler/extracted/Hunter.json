{"title":"Hunter","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hunter","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{flavour|The Hunter is a type of fighter who specialises in missile weapons. A Hunter starts with a shortbow, a scroll of butterflies, and a set of leathers.}}\n\n==Preferred Species==\n[[Hill Orc]], [[Minotaur]], [[Gnoll]], [[Kobold]], and [[Spriggan]] are the recommended races if you pick a Hunter background.\n\n==Racial Restrictions==\n[[Felid]]s are forbidden from becoming Hunters, as they cannot use ranged weapons.\n\n==Starting Equipment==\nSome [[species]] may receive different items based on their unique restrictions.\n*+0 [[shortbow]]\n*+0 [[leather armour]]\n*[[Scroll of butterflies]]\n\n==Starting Skills and Stats==\nThese are adjusted by your species' [[aptitude]]s.\n\n*[[Fighting]]: 2\n*[[Ranged Weapons]]: 4\n*[[Dodging]]: 2\n*[[Stealth]]: 1\n\nChoosing Hunter adds 3 to your starting [[Strength]], 1 to your starting [[Intelligence]] and 8 to your starting [[Dexterity]].\n\n==Strategy==\nHunter is your archetypical ranged combat background. Shortbows are a strong earlygame weapon, essentially a [[trident]] with 7 tiles of reach instead of 2. Fast species, namely [[Spriggan]]s, can continuously retreat and [[kiting|kite]] with the bow.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], Hunters started with a [[scroll of immolation]] instead of butterflies.\n*In [[0.29]], [[Ranged Weapons]] were reworked. Prior to this version:\n**Hunters started with a choice of [[hunting sling]], [[hand crossbow]], shortbow, or [[throwing]] weapons. Launchers were +1 and started with 20 of their respective ammo. Throwing started with 6 [[javelin]]s (adjusted for species) and 2 [[throwing net]]s.\n**Hunters had 4 strength / 3 intelligence / 5 dexterity.\n**Hunters started with a [[short blade]].\n**This version gave almost all backgrounds a consumable: hunters now start with a [[scroll of immolation]].\n*Prior to [[0.24]], small hunters started with [[tomahawk]]s instead of boomerangs.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Hunters that chose javelins started with only 5 and did not have throwing nets.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Hunters started with 20 [[gold]].\n\n{{backgrounds}}\n[[Category:Backgrounds]]"}

Monsters with this spell are exceptionally dangerous to characters that are [[undead]] (either naturally or through use of a [[talisman of death]]) because there is no way to avoid or resist the spell's damage. Kill them quickly and try to keep other creatures between you.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*The ranged version of Dispel Undead was introduced in [[0.25]]. Prior to this version, the player and monsters could cast regular Dispel Undead from range 5.\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

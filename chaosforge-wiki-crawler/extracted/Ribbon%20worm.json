{"title":"Ribbon worm","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ribbon_worm","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ribbon worms''' are early-game monsters. They are slow, but they can [[ensnare]] you in [[web]]s.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Ensnare traps you in webs, which can be ''brutal''. While stuck in a web, you can't move, go up stairs, or use weapons/unarmed combat. Plus, the webbing can last up to 8 turns. If a ribbon worm shows up as you're fighting other monsters, it can quickly become dangerous. If a worm shows up as you're trying to escape up stairs, it's extra dangerous.\n*Thankfully, ribbon worms are slow. If the worm is distant, you can usually just walk away. \n**Ensnare can be an issue - if you get trapped for too long, the worm can catch up. However, monsters cannot attack or use spells when outside your [[line of sight]]. So if the worm is at the edge of your LOS (7 tiles away for most species), you're 100% safe if you retreat. \n**[[Poison]] is effective. Poisoned [[dart]]s, even at 0 [[Throwing]] skill, can take out these worms just fine.\n*Ensnare requires a direct line of fire in order to hit you. If there's a monster in the way, it can't trap you.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], this monster was added to the game, replacing regular [[worm]]s."}

{"title":"Electricity","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Electricity","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Electricity''' is one of the rarer elemental forces in the Dungeon. Both players and monsters can take advantage of electricity through spells or specially [[brand]]ed weapons, though some monsters also possess innate electric abilities.\n\n==Electricity Damage==\nThe player has a lot of ways to inflict electricity damage: weapons, spells, god abilities, and an [[evocable]] item. Also, [[Storm Form]] adds electricity damage to your [[Unarmed Combat]] attacks.\n\nSeveral [[Air Magic]] spells deal electric damage, while weapons of [[electrocution]] have a flat chance to inflict extra damage regardless of your weapon skill. A [[lightning rod]] is another common source of electric damage. Followers of [[Nemelex]] can create electrical explosions by drawing the [[Storm card]], and followers of [[Qazlal]] have access to Upheaval and Disaster Area abilities.\n\n\"BEAM_ELEC\" damage, comprising most (but not all) electric attacks, ignores 1/2 of the target's [[AC]].\n\n==Electricity Resistance==\nElectricity resistance reduces electric damage by 66% (to x33%). \n\nIt can be acquired from a number of sources:\n\n'''Item:'''\n*[[Staff of air]]\n*[[Storm dragon scales]]\n*[[Potion of resistance]] (temporary)\n*Various [[randart]]s and [[unrand]]s\n\n'''Character:'''\n*Black [[Draconian]]s and [[Gargoyle]]s have innate rElec.\n*[[Good mutations#Electricity Resistance|Electricity Resistance]] [[mutation]]\n*The [[demonspawn mutation]], [[Good mutations#Thin Metallic Scales|Thin Metallic Scales]] 3\n*[[Statue Form]] and [[Storm Form]]\n\n===Vulnerability===\nElectric vulnerability increases electric damage taken by +50%.\n\nIt can be given as part of [[Qazlal]]'s [[divine retribution|wrath]], but is not found anywhere else. No monsters are vulnerable to electric damage.\n\n==See Also==\n[[:Category:Electricity resistance|List of electricity resistant monsters]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.18]], rElec reduced damage by 75%.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the [[electrocution]] brand would spread electricity through [[shallow water]], dealing damage to nearby creatures standing in water.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], being airborne gave immunity to the [[electrocution]] brand and resistance to [[Static Discharge]].\n\n[[Category: Air Magic]]"}

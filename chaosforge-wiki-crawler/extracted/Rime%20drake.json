They are usually found in [[the Lair]], and can be created by monsters with the [[Summon Drakes]] spell.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n* Their [[Flash Freeze]] breath deals significant damage, ignores [[EV]], and applies Frozen, slowing movement speed. [[Cold resistance]] is helpful. Fortunately, they cannot spam Flash Freeze: this spell cannot affect creatures that are Frozen.\n* They are fast, but have low AC, a moderate amount of EV and low willpower. Try to take them out quickly.\n\n==History==\n*Rime drakes were added in [[0.18]]."}

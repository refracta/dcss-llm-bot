The sludge damages and poisons all monsters, even those resistant to poison.}}\n\n'''Hurl Sludge''' is a monster-only spell that deals damage. It creates a short-lived tile of [[Eringya's Noxious Bog|toxic sludge]] where it lands, which deals heavy poison damage to non-[[flying]] creatures (and otherwise acts like [[shallow water]]). Sludge lasts for 2-3 turns. It can replace staircases and certain other dungeon features.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*This spell was added in [[0.26]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

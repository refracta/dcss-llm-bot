{"title":"The Lair","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/The_Lair","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Most adventurers find the Lair of Beasts to be an exciting change of climate. And indeed, there is something to be said about getting gored, mauled and eaten rather than sliced, burnt or stabbed.\n\nThe Lair contains the entrances to one of the Swamp or the Shoals, one of the Snake Pit or the Spider Nest, and to the Pits of Slime.\n\nThe entrance to this branch can be found between levels 8 and 11 of the Dungeon.\n\nThis branch is 5 levels deep.}}\n[[File:Lair entry.png]] '''The Lair of Beasts''' (commonly known as '''the Lair''') is a [[branch]] filled with natural beasts. While the Lair itself doesn't have a [[Rune of Zot]], it features entrances to three themed branches that do. There is one [[poison]]-themed branch ([[the Snake Pit]] or [[the Spider's Nest]]), one [[water]]-themed branch ([[the Swamp]] or [[the Shoals]]), and the [[acid]]-themed [[Slime Pits]]. \n\nThe staircase to the Lair is located on D:8-11, and is often surrounded by [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], or occasionally an [[oklob plant]]. There may also be multiple denizens of the Lair scattered around the entrance, like [[yak]]s, [[basilisk]]s, or a [[komodo dragon]].\n\n==Layout==\nThe Lair is 5 levels deep. Floor layouts vary significantly, including wide open chambers with almost no cover, series of interconnected small chambers with narrow hallways between them, and open areas dotted with either small forests or ponds. The topography of the Lair is quite irregular; while narrow passages exist, often there will be few true one-tile-wide tunnels, ensuring the various pack animals have ways to swarm passersby. In any case, there will often be pools of [[shallow water]], [[deep water]], and occasionally [[lava]] placed throughout.\n\nWhile there are very few [[altar]]s found in the Lair, those wishing to worship [[Jiyva]] can often (66%) find an altar immediately outside of the Slime Pits on Lair:4 or 5.\n\n===Lair:5===\nThe bottom floor of the Lair is generally fairly open, but will always contain one or two end [[vault]]s that contain both an assortment of stronger monsters and a selection of treasure. These vaults may range from a secluded set of caves to a forest containing a temple or perhaps several bands of spriggans. See the [[#Lair:5 vaults]] section below for what to expect from the different options.\n\nLike other branch ends, Lair:5 is usually more dangerous than the preceding floors, so explore it carefully.\n\n==Strategy==\nThis branch is generally worth doing, at least for the XP and items. The Lair, when compared to late [[Dungeon]] (D:13+) and [[Orcish Mines]], is usually easier and/or safer to do. The other branches are more likely to have nasty [[out-of-depth]] monsters: Dungeon can have [[banish]]ing [[wizard]]s, even [[storm dragon]]s if you're unlucky. Orc can host brutish [[ettin]]s and [[stone giant]]s.\n\nLair is filled with animals. A good chunk of enemies ([[cane toad]]s, [[blink frog]]s, [[black mamba]]s) are fast - and each one is surprisingly deadly. [[Hydra]]s can be obscenely strong melee threats, depending on the number of heads. [[Elephant]]s can shove you off the [[stairs]], [[lindwurm]]s and [[rime drake]]s can fire elemental ranged attacks, and [[death yak]]s are tough pack enemies with high [[willpower]].\n\n[[Poison resistance]] is helpful, due to the amount of venomous creatures, but not necessary. Most other resistances aren't necessary, though having swappable resistances (rF+ for lindwurms, rC+ for rime drakes, rCorr for [[oklob plant]]s...) won't hurt. \n\nThe Lair's sub-branches are significantly more difficult than Lair itself. At the ''very'' least, you'll want to clear Lair:1-5 before entering any of the branches. Many players will additionally clear Dungeon and Orc before attempting any of the branches. Also, note that the [[Slime Pits]] is much more difficult than the other possible branches, often saved for much later in the game.\n\n==Monsters==\n===Common Monsters===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Yak}} || {{monsterlink|Death yak}} || {{monsterlink|Dream sheep}} || {{monsterlink|Elephant}} || {{monsterlink|Catoblepas}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Polar bear}} || {{monsterlink|Black bear}} || {{monsterlink|Water moccasin}} || {{monsterlink|Black mamba}} || {{monsterlink|Boulder beetle}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Torpor snail}} || {{monsterlink|Hydra}} || {{monsterlink|Cane toad}} || {{monsterlink|Blink frog}} || {{monsterlink|Rime drake}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Steam dragon}} || {{monsterlink|Electric eel}} || {{monsterlink|Lindwurm}} || {{monsterlink|Skyshark}}\n|}\n\nMonsters native to a lair branch may reside at its entrance; [[list of merfolk|merfolk]] for the [[Shoals]], [[redback]]s for the [[Spider's Nest]], etc. \n<br>There are also many pregenerated [[vault]]s with monsters inside (ex. a [[Hive]] filled with [[killer bee]]s and a [[queen bee]]).\n\n===Uniques===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n| {{monsterlink|Amaemon}}\n| {{monsterlink|Erica}}\n| {{monsterlink|Fannar}}\n| {{monsterlink|Gastronok}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Grum}}\n| {{monsterlink|Harold}}\n| {{monsterlink|Joseph}}\n| {{monsterlink|Josephine}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Kirke}}\n| {{monsterlink|Maggie}}\n| {{monsterlink|Nergalle}}\n| {{monsterlink|Nessos}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Prince Ribbit}}\n| {{monsterlink|Rupert}}\n| {{monsterlink|Snorg}}\n| {{monsterlink|Sonja}}\n|-\n| {{monsterlink|Urug}}\n|}\n\n==Lair:5 vaults==\nThe last level of the Lair is more difficult than the previous levels.

Past the wizard is a room containing a gateway to the [[Vestibule of Hell]] guarded by several [[demon]]s. Entering the gate at this point is a fast way to die -- at least wait until you're ready for the [[Depths]].\n*'''minmay_lair_end_frog_pond''': A large pond containing many frogs, [[vampire mosquito]]es, some [[electric eel]]s, and a few [[tyrant leech]]es.\n*'''evilmike_catoblepas_cave''': A series of caves full of [[yak]]s, [[death yak]]s, and [[catoblepae]] signified by the presence of petrified plants and statues around the entrance.\n*'''grunt_lair_end_beastmaster''': A [[deep troll shaman]] has tamed some beasts including a [[catoblepas]], a pack of [[death yak]]s, and one the following: [[hydra]], [[lindwurm]] or [[dire elephant]].\n*'''gammafunk_lair_ancient_temple''': An open stone structure that has been flooded.

The central chamber contains a [[fire dragon]] and its hoard.\n\n===Small lair end vaults===\n*'''wormcave''': A cave full of [[tyrant leech]]es, [[torpor snail]]s, [[hornet]]s, and [[lindwurm]]s. There's also a single [[fire dragon|fire]] or [[ice dragon]] guarding a room full of piles of gold, but that fight is optional (don't open the [[runed door]] if you aren't ready to face it).\n*'''hangedman_lair_caniforms_friends''': An assortment of [[list of canines|hound]]- and [[list of bears|bear]]-type monsters. Expect fire damage from [[hell hound]]s, electricity damage from [[raiju]], and heavy physical damage from angry [[polar bear]]s.\n*'''guppyfry_lair_end_dragon''': A grove of trees surrounded by a small lake. Full of [[list of reptiles and amphibians|lizards]] and [[list of dragons|lesser dragons]], with one proper dragon in the center.\n*'''hangedman_lair_in_review''' (S): A series of ruined rooms. This vault is a review of the Lair's monster set: you'll be seeing a variety of different monsters found in the Lair, plus a few more dangerous creatures like [[manticore]]s.\n*'''hangedman_lair_tendril_chambers''': A circular area cut into several wedge-shaped sections full of fast, often venomous monsters ([[wyvern]]s, [[black mamba]]s, [[cane toad]]s, etc.). One or two of the wedges lead to a central chamber that in turn leads to a stone room that contains the treasure and a more dangerous assortment of monsters like [[wolf spider]]s, [[redback]]s, and a [[guardian serpent]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the Lair had 6 levels; Slime spawned from Lair:5-6, and the other branches from Lair:2-4. [[Jiyva]]'s altar near the entrance to Slime was about 50% (based on [[vault]] choice) instead of 66%.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the Lair had 8 levels.\n*[[Fire drake]]s were replaced by [[rime drake]]s in [[0.18]], [[trapdoor spider]]s, [[brain worm]]s were removed.\n*[[Raven]]s, [[giant mite]]s, [[boring beetle]]s and [[goliath beetle]]s were removed in [[0.17]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the Lair's entrance was located on D:8-13.\n*In [[0.12]], the dragon-themed and deep troll shaman ending vaults on the eighth floor were added.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], a scroll of magic mapping would reveal the secret rooms of the temple on Lair:8.\n\n{{branches}}"}

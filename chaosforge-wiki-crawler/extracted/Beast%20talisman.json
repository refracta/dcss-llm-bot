Entering or exiting a form takes 5 turns.\n\nBeast Form has the following effects:\n\n'''Combat Bonuses'''\n*'''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' 3 base damage (''no boost'').\n*'''[[Slaying]] Bonus:''' adds 0-4 [[slaying]] to melee combat (including weapons), throwing and ranged weapons, increasing your damage and accuracy. Scales linearly with Shapeshifting skill.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|transform.cc|1045}}</ref> (+0.57 slay per level)\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n*'''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' All [[armour]] ''except'' for [[body armour]] and [[shield]]s. (This includes [[helmet]]s/[[hat]]s, [[cloak]]s, [[gloves]], and [[boots]]/[[barding]]s.)\n\nBeast Form does not block any [[mutation]]s, does not change your [[size]], and gives no innate bonus to HP / [[AC]].\n\nBeast Form has no minimum [[Shapeshifting]] skill. It has a maximum skill of 7; further skill has no further impact.\n\n==Strategy==\nNote that Beast Form ''sets'' your base Unarmed damage to 3 - it does not boost your base damage by +3. Thus, Beast Form has identical UC damage as your base form. The only boost comes from the slaying, which applies to all melee, including weapons. Therefore, don't hesitate to use any strong weapons you find. For example, if you find a [[dagger]] of [[venom]] on D:2, it's probably worth using.\n\n===Skill Analysis===\nEven [[Shapeshifter]]s might not want to train Shapeshifting skill right away. When considering Beast Form alone: each level of Shapeshifting offers less return than a level of Unarmed Combat, but more return than a level of weapon skill.\n\nBenefits of each skill:\n*1 Shapeshifting skill, assuming Beast Form, gives +0.57 slay per level, equivalent to +0.57 damage and [[accuracy]].\n*1 Unarmed Combat skill gives +1 base damage, +0.5 accuracy, and slightly faster attacks.\n*1 weapon skill will give benefits depending on the weapon itself. Examples:\n**A [[short sword]] gets +0.1 base damage, +0.5 accuracy, and -0.05 [[attack delay]] (5% to 10% faster) per [[Short Blades]] level (not including [[stabbing]] bonuses).\n**A [[mace]] gets +0.16 base damage, +0.5 accuracy, and -0.05 [[attack delay]] (4% to 9% faster) per [[Maces & Flails|M&F]] level.\n:'''N.B.''' Base damage is somewhat more effective than slaying, since the former benefits from skill and stat bonuses. However, in the early game, these bonuses are too small to matter: 0.16 base damage is not better than 0.57 slay.\n\nTherefore, early levels of Unarmed Combat are more important than the same levels of Shapeshifting. As levels get more expensive, eventually a level of 2 of Shapeshifting becomes more cost-effective. A similar comparison can be made with Shapeshifting and weapon skill. \n\nIf you decide to abandon Shapeshifting, a weapon skill is the more lasting choice. But if you want to go for [[Flux Form]], Shapeshifting is obviously more important.\n\n==History==\n*Beast talismans were introduced in [[0.31]], along with talismans themselves. Beast Form is analogous to [[Beastly Appendage]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Forms}}"}

Entering or exiting a form takes 5 turns.\n\nSerpent Form has the following effects:\n\n'''Combat Bonuses'''\n*'''HP Bonus:''' 120% HP\n*'''Innate AC:''' Linearly scales from the following points, rounding down:\n**Below minimum: 1 AC (0 skill) - 9 AC (10 skill)\n**Above minimum: 9 AC (10 skill) - 15 AC (19 skill) ; +1 AC per 1.67 levels\n*'''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' 10 base damage.\n*'''[[Constriction]]:''' When making a melee attack, you initiate [[constriction]]. You can constrict 1 [[large]] (or smaller) foe at a time.\n*'''[[Strength|Stat Bonus]]:''' +5 strength.\n\n'''Resistances'''\n*[[Poison resistance|rPois]]\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n*'''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' All [[armour]], [[weapon]] and [[shield]]. (Can only wear [[jewellery]])\n*You cannot [[throw]] items.\n\n'''Other'''\n*'''[[Cold-blooded]]:''' You will be [[slow]]ed when hit by certain cold attacks. Negated by any amount of [[cold resistance]].\n*'''[[Amphibious]]:''' Can swim in [[water]], immune to [[drowning]] damage. Note that, unless your species is already amphibious, you can't recover items in [[deep water]].\n*Serpent Form is '''[[large]]'''-sized. Species smaller than large will have reduced [[EV]] in this form. (Being large also lets you constrict large opponents)\n*Suppresses many [[mutation]]s. Species [[movement delay]] set to 1.0.\n\nSerpent Form has a minimum [[Shapeshifting]] skill of 10, below which you get an [[Talisman#Skill|HP penalty]], and the AC bonus scales down. It has a maximum skill of 19, where skill has no further impact.\n\n==Strategy==\nConstriction is a very strong effect. It reduces enemy [[EV]] by ''at least'' 50% and deals extra damage. Unlike base [[Octopode]]s, Serpent Form can constrict [[large]] creatures, including things like [[list of centaurs|centaurs]], [[yak]]s, and [[hydra]]s. \n\nSerpent Form also gives a fair bit of AC. For many characters first entering [[the Lair]], it offers slightly more AC than lighter armours, without the [[encumbrance]] of heavy armour. When combined with the 120% HP, it's a moderately durable form. However, the lack of [[shield]] will reduce your defense in the long run.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*This form can be very useful for [[Naga]]s (fittingly enough), as it lets them move at normal speed. [[Barachim]] can also move normally, though they'll lose their hop.\n*Being cold-blooded can be risky when fighting monsters with [[freezing]] weapons or other types of cold damage. Note what activates cold-blooded and what doesn't; e.g. certain spells like [[Flash Freeze]] won't cause the mutation to activate.\n\n==History==\n*Serpent talismans were introduced in [[0.31]], along with talismans themselves. Serpent Form had no previous counterpart, but is similar in role to [[Ice Form]].\n\n{{Forms}}\n\n[[Category: Transformation]]"}

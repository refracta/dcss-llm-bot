When it hits a wall, Shock will reflect off the wall, allowing you to potentially [[doublezap|hit an opponent twice]], or hit opponents at an angle. Each hit from this spell ignores 1/2 of the target's [[AC]].\n\nShock can reflect off most solid features, including rock / stone / crystal / unbreakable [[wall]]s, inanimate [[statue]]s, and closed [[door]]s. Shock ''cannot'' reflect off metal walls, [[iron grate]]s, or trees.\n\n[[Air Elementalist]]s begin with this spell memorized.\n\n==Strategy==\n''See also: [[Doublezap]]''\n\nAt base, Shock is weaker and less accurate than the other level 1 spells. However, it can hit multiple targets in a row (e.g. a pack of foes lined up in a hallway). In addition, when bouncing off a wall, Shock can hit a target twice. See the [[doublezap]] article for how you can do this.\n\nNote that you are NOT immune to your own reflected Shock spell. Be aware that it may be difficult to cast this against foes in cramped quarters (the game warns you if you are about to accidentally shoot yourself)."}

{"title":"Caustic shrike","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Caustic_shrike","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | birds}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Caustic shrikes''' are devastatingly powerful flying pack hunters that swarm their victims and tear them apart with brutal [[corrosive]] attacks. Flocks of caustic shrikes can be found in [[the Depths]] and [[Dis]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Shrikes are justification for carrying a form of [[ring of resist corrosion|resist corrosion]] around while exploring the Depths. They can prove devastating if you allow several of them to attack you at once; use narrow hallways (of your [[wand of digging|own making]] if need be) to prevent this, especially if you lack acid resistance.\n*Shrikes aren't resistant to [[corrosion]] or even [[poison]]. A [[scroll of poison]] can deal significant amounts of damage. A [[wand of acid]] can lower their defense, assuming you can hit them in the first place.\n*Caustic shrikes have decent [[willpower]], but Evocations or Hexes experts can affect them fairly reliably. You can also use a [[scroll of vulnerability]] to improve the chance of [[hexes|hexing]] them. [[wand of charming|Charmed]] shrikes make good allies. \n*Even as a very dangerous late-game enemy, they cannot see [[invisible]]. Invisibility is powerful -- just don't expect a [[potion of invisibility|potion]] to be a one-stop solution to a shrike pack. \n*For those who worship [[Okawaru]], kills of caustic shrikes tend to award maximum piety per kill even well after you've achieved a fairly routine ability to dispatch them. Keep that in mind if you need a boost to take out one or more - if you invoke ''heroism'' and/or ''finesse'', odds are you'll recover much of the piety you spent upon your victory.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], caustic shrikes could [[see invisible]].\n*Caustic shrikes were introduced in [[0.16]]."}

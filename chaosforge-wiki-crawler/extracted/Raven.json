They are occasionally a welcome sight, as they sometimes spawn in a small [[vault]] that contains a few pieces of shiny [[jewellery]] they've collected, but they also appear as an accompaniment to various [[list of tengu|tengu]] or in defense of a [[shambling mangrove]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Ravens are generally less dangerous than the monsters they accompany, but don't let that fool you into thinking they're harmless -- lightly armored characters in particular should watch out for them.\n*Try to limit how much of the flock can reach you at one time by retreating to a chokepoint. Area-of-effect spells like [[Fireball]] or the cloud spells can help take them down more swiftly.\n\n==History==\nRavens were removed in [[0.17]]."}

{"title":"Spit Acid","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spit_Acid","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|Spits acid at a targeted creature.}}\n\n'''Spit Acid''' is a monster-only ability that launches a blob of [[acid]] at a creature, dealing 3d14 acid damage and possibly corroding the target if it hits. As a natural ability, Spit Acid is unaffected by conditions such as [[Silence]] or [[antimagic]].\n\n[[Acid Splash]] is a similar ability unique to [[yellow draconian]]s that also splashes onto creatures adjacent to the target. [[Breathe Acid]] is the player version of said ability.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Spit Acid only dealt 3d7 damage, but there was an extra 4d5 damage against players from \"[[Acid#Acidic_Melee_Attacks|acid splash]]\". Monsters took 2d4 damage from acid splash instead."}

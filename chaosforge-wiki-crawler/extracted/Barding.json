It fills the feet slot in place of [[boots]], which these species cannot wear. \n\nWhile they give significantly more AC than normal boots, bardings give a flat penalty of -2 [[EV]]. This cannot be reduced by strength or Armour skill. This will not penalize spellcasting, stealth, etc.\n\nBardings can be maximally enchanted to +4 using [[scrolls of enchant armour]].\n\n===Egos===\nBardings can carry the following [[ego]]s:\n*[[Fire resistance]]\n*[[Cold resistance]]\n*[[Flight (ego)|Flight]]\n*[[Stealth]]\n\n[[Artefact]] bardings can also spawn with these egos:\n*[[See invisible]]\n*[[Rampaging]]\n\n==Sources==\nBardings are moderately rare items:\n*The [[unique]]s [[Nessos]] and [[Vashnia]] always wear bardings.\n*A [[scroll of acquirement]] is likely to give bardings if you haven't found one yet. \n*[[Okawaru]] gifts a choice of armour, which is very likely to have a barding available.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], artefact bardings couldn't spawn with the [[see invisible]] or [[rampaging]] egos.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], there were two types of barding: [[centaur barding]] and [[naga barding]]. Each species could only wear one of the two types.\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[Image:Barding 1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[Image:Barding 2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[Image:Barding 4.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]] barding\n|-\n| '''[[Black Knight's barding]]''' || [[File:New bk barding.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Lightning scales]]''' || [[File:New lightning scales.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n\n[[Category:Barding]]"}

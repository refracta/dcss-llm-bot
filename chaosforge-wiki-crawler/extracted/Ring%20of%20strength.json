Strength boosts the damage of most weapons, and reduces the encumbrance of both [[encumbrance rating|armour]] and [[shields]]. Overall, a ring of strength is a good find for early characters wearing heavy armour. As you progress through the game, however, a resistance-boosting ring may be more useful.\n\n===Comparison to Slaying===\nEvery point of strength adds a +2.5% multiplier to your base damage, or a 15% boost from a base ring of strength. For the sole purpose of weapon damage: if <code><weapon base dmg> * <[[Weapon damage#Damage formula|skill multipliers]]></code> is above 26.7, then +6 strength offers more damage than a +4 [[ring of slaying]]. Overall, 1 strength = <code>0.025 * <base dmg> * <skill multiplier></code> slaying.\n\nNote that each stat has its other bonuses: strength reduces [[encumbrance]] of armour and shields. Slaying increases accuracy, which is good for [[dexterity]]-based weapons too. Also, slaying can be better when considering [[auxiliary attack]]s (both strength and slaying boost aux attacks, but as aux attacks usually have low base damage, slaying becomes relatively better.) \n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], you could find rings of strength with a -4 enchantment; such rings were always [[curse]]d.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], enchantment values ranged from 2 to 6 (positive and negative).\n\n{{jewellery}}"}

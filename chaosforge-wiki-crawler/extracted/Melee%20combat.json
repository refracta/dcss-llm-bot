The latter is defined as [[unarmed combat]]. This usually requires the moster to be adjacent to the player, but polearms allow the attack to be performed from a distance using their [[reaching]] ability.\n\n==Commands==\nThe commands used by the player to perform melee attacks are:\n*Attempting to [[Movement|move]] into a monster's tile will attack it.\n*[[Tab]]: Attack the nearest monster, moving if necessary.\n*Shift-[[Tab]]: Attack the nearest monster without moving.\n*[[v]]: Evoke the reaching ability when wielding a polearm.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Melee weapon]]\n*[[Weapon damage]]\n*[[Weapon speed]]\n*[[Unarmed combat]]\n\n[[Category:Combat]]"}

{"title":"Asmodeus","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Asmodeus","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Asmodeus''' is a [[demon]] lord who guards the obsidian [[rune]] on the last level of [[Gehenna]]. In addition to his spells, all tiles adjacent to Asmodeus fill with persistent [[flame cloud]]s. He can be found in the back room of his castle, usually accompanied by a pair of [[brimstone fiend]]s.\n\nAsmodeus always wields the [[Sceptre of Asmodeus]], though he cannot summon demons from its melee attacks (his spells can, though).\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Asmodeus can quickly fill up the room with fire-related summons. He and his summons can toss a lot of fire and damnation your way; just standing next to Asmodeus places you in a column of flame. Needless to say, rF++ or rF+++ is a prerequisite here.\n*Asmodeus has a lot of HP and [[AC]], so killing him will be tough. One strategy is to gain his attention and lure him into one of the smaller vaults nearby. Then, buff yourself, summon a few allies, and once he's in your LOS try to kill him as quickly as possible.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Asmodeus had a base damage of 50, but his [[Sceptre of Asmodeus|Sceptre]] was a weaker melee weapon."}

{"title":"Ghost moth","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Ghost_moth","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Ghost moths''' are speedy, [[invisible]] monsters with an [[MP]]-draining gaze and [[stat]]-draining melee attacks.  If you can't see invisible, you'll \"feel you are being watched by something\" whenever a ghost moth is around. They can be found in the [[Spider's Nest]] (particularly in Spider:4), rarely in [[the Realm of Zot]], and in a special \"eye of draining\" [[Pandemonium]] rune vault.\n\nA ghost moth's [[Draining Gaze|gaze]] causes you to lose 0-19 MP, weighted towards the average. Since moths cast Draining Gaze on 50% of their actions,<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-spell.h|44}}<br>Monsters cast spells, if valid, at a X/200 chance.</ref> and as the gaze takes up no time, they can rapidly drain your MP.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*The loss of MP is ''very'' fast. Even if you're not a spellcaster, be wary that some [[god]] abilities require MP to invoke.\n*Ghost moths are a good reason to keep a source of [[see invisible]] around. When fighting an invisible enemy you can't see - even if you detect their location - you get harsh penalties to [[accuracy]], [[EV]], and [[SH]]. If you receive the message \"You feel you are being watched by something,\" swap to a source of see invisible immediately. Keep in mind they fly faster than most characters run, so escaping without items is not an option.\n*Ghost moths themselves cannot see invisible. If you are invisible, ghost moths can't drain your MP.\n*If you're a caster, the following can work (depending on the character):\n**Damage-over-time effects. [[Freezing Cloud]], despite their cold resistance, can kill if the moth spends enough time in the cloud. [[Sticky Flame]] is usually too weak to kill in 1 cast, but it does negate their invisibility.\n**[[Summon Cactus Giant]]. While cactus giants lack SInv, the spines can do a lot. If the giant is in the moth's way, the moth will attack the giant, causing the moth to take heavy damage (possibly killing it). If needed, '''[[t]]'''ell the giant to '''r'''etreat towards a desired direction.\n**For [[Kiku]] worshippers, [[Death Channel]]'s spectres can see invisible. You can use Unearth Wretches multiple times for each ghost moth; it's a cheap 1* ability, so don't worry about piety too much.\n**Failing that, [[evocable]]s are good MP-less ways of dealing damage. Even at 0 Evocations, using 4 charges of a [[lightning rod]] will take a huge chunk of the moth's HP. With good Evocations training, a [[condenser vane]], [[tin of tremorstones]], or attack [[wand]]s can kill / finish off a moth.\n*Ghost moths make for great [[Yredelemnul]] souls. When Draining Gaze hits a monster, it inflicts [[antimagic]], which is brutally effective against spellcasters.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], ghost moths would heal themselves when draining MP.\n*Prior [[0.28]], ghost moths' melee attacks could inflict strong poison, making stat drain less likely.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], ghost moths could drain for 5-17 MP.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

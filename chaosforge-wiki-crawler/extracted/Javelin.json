It will pass through the targets it hits, potentially hitting all targets in its path until it reaches maximum range.}}\n\n'''Javelins''' are the strongest [[Throwing]] weapons that [[size#medium|medium]]-sized species can use. \n\nJavelins [[penetration|penetrate]] through enemies, able to hit every enemy in its path (with no penalty to damage). They may also come with the [[silver]] brand, which deals extra damage, especially to [[chaotic]] enemies.\n\nJavelins have a 5% chance of [[mulch]]ing when thrown. This destroys the javelin and prevents it from piercing targets, though gives a bonus of +33% damage.\n\n==Strategy==\nJavelins penetrate, which is a ''very'' powerful trait.\n*They can be used to snipe pesky enemies like [[boggart]]s, [[vault warden]]s, and [[shining eye]]s in the backlines. \n*In a hallway, javelins can hit multiple enemies for 100% damage, when only 1-2 enemies can hit you back. For comparison, [[Axes]] can hit multiple enemies, but at only 70% damage, and every enemy you hit can hit you back. \n*Javelins cannot be blocked by enemy [[shield]]s.\n*Silver javelins are especially effective against chaotic enemies, like [[malmutate]]rs, [[The Royal Jelly]], and [[orbs of fire]]. \nAnd, because [[Throwing]] skill gives more damage than any other weapon skill, a trained thrower can hit multiple enemies at high power. Expect an endgame thrower (20+ skill) to two-shot orbs of fire with silver javelins, for example.\n\nHowever, javelins are greatly limited by quantity. Use javelins for every fight, and you'll run out quickly. Save them for situations where penetration is actively helpful, and use [[boomerang]]s otherwise.\n\n[[Okawaru]] can gift throwing implements. If you venture into a [[Gauntlet]], then its [[minotaur (monster)|minotaur]] always carries a stack of javelins. [[Urug]] also carries a large stack of javelins. The [[Shoals]] is a good place for throwables in general; [[merfolk javelineer]]s carry a small stack of javelins (around 1-3).\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Any type of character can benefit from javelins in the early game. They can be used to soften up enemies like [[adder]]s and [[ogre (monster)|ogres]]. However, without much skill, you will throw javelins slowly (i.e. don't throw if an enemy is 1 tile away from you).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], javelins did not get a damage bonus when mulched, but could pierce targets even if mulched.\n*In [[0.28]], javelins were made much less common. [[0.29]] further nerfed the javelin gifting rate of [[Okawaru]].\n*Prior to [[0.25]], [[Trog]] could gift ammunition, including javelins.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], javelins did not inherently have the [[penetration]] property. Penetration was one of the potential brands they could have, as well as [[poisoned]], [[returning]], and [[steel]].\n*Prior to [[0.18]], javelins' throwing speed did not depend on Throwing skill.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

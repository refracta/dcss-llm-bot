{"title":"Water card","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Water_card","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|The card depicts a tsunami destroying a peaceful coastal village.}}\nThe Water card turns nearby dungeon floor into open [[water]]. The floor at the player's feet will remain unchanged.\n* Power level 0: Each floor square within four squares of the player has a 50% chance of becoming [[shallow water]].\n* Power level 1: Each floor square within six squares of the player has a 25% chance to be turned into [[shallow water]] and 25% chance to be turned into [[deep water]]. The same six-square-radius area will then be \"deepened\" twice, increasing the proportion of the area that is water, and the proportion of the water that is deep.\n* Power level 2: All visible floor is turned into water, destroying traps in the process. Each floor square converted that is not the player's current square has a 50% chance of being [[deep water]].\n\nThe Water card could be found in the following [[Decks|decks]]:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.11]]\n![[0.12]]\n![[0.13]]\n![[0.14]]\n![[0.14]]\n![[0.16]]\n![[0.17]]\n![[0.18]]\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of dungeons|Dungeons]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of dungeons|Dungeons]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of dungeons|Dungeons]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of dungeons|Dungeons]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of summoning|Summoning]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of summoning|Summoning]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of summoning|Summoning]]\n|----\n|}\n==History==\nThis card was removed in the simplification of decks in [[0.19]].\n\nIt was removed in [[0.15]] and added back in [[0.16]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

It can never miss or be [[SH|blocked]], but [[AC]] reduces its damage like any other attack.\n\n[[Hedge Wizard]]s and [[Conjurer]]s begin with this spell memorized.\n\n==Strategy==\nMagic Dart deals less damage than other level 1 spells, but it has excellent range and can't miss. It can get you by the first floor or two. Since it has full [[LOS]] range, it can be used to soften up enemies that your other spells (e.g. [[Searing Ray]]) can't reach.\n\nBecause it only costs 1 MP, Magic Dart has a few other uses:\n*Activating [[Iskenderun's Battlesphere]]\n*Detonating [[Conjure Ball Lightning|ball lightnings]] early\n*Getting an enemy's attention without [[shout]]ing yourself (note that the enemy can still shout).\n\nBy the mid game, it's impractical to use Magic Dart as a damage spell - the damage is simply too low. You may want to [[scroll of amnesia|forget]] it, especially if you aren't using Battlesphere.\n\n==Monsters Version==\nThe monster version is similar to the player version, but generally deals more damage.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}"}

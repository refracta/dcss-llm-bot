It is a favoured weapon of the Shining One's servants.}}\n\n'''Trishulas''' are a blessed weapon, slightly stronger than the [[demon trident]] it was formed from. Like [[eudemon blade]]s and [[sacred scourge]]s, it always has the [[holy wrath]] brand.\n\nYou can create a trishula through [[the Shining One]]'s 6* ability. You can turn a trishula back into a demon trident by using [[Kikubaaqudgha]]'s or [[Lugonu]]'s final ability to replace its brand with [[pain (brand)|pain]] or [[distortion]], though this is rarely a good trade.\n\nUnlike other blessed weapons, you can't find trishulas on [[angel]]s or [[daeva]]s, although [[Mennas]] may spawn with one. Trishulas are the only blessed weapon that can spawn as a [[randart]], but only if the unrand [[Condemnation]] fails to spawn.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

Its exact symbolism varies from story to story, but it repeatedly sees use as a divine weapon wielded by numerous gods.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.29]], the [[Condemnation]] [[unrandart]] was introduced. This allowed [[randart]] trishulas to (very rarely) appear randomly as a fallback for it.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], these had 14 base damage but lacked [[reaching]].\n\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Polearms]]"}

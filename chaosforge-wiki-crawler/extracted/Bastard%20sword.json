A grown-up human or elf can manage to wield it in one hand, while anyone of a weaker race will need to grip it with two. In fact, it is the heaviest and most damaging weapon anyone other than certain humanoid insects can use with a shield. And meeting a sharp blade this long spells doom for any opponent.}}\n\nThe rare '''bastard sword''' is an extremely desirable weapon for any character looking to wear a [[shield]] while still doing heavy damage in melee combat, as it does the most base damage of any one-handed weapon (barring its [[blessed weapon|blessed counterpart]]). Although unskilled fighters will find them slow and inaccurate, they shine in the late game once you've mastered [[Long Blades]], especially once you've given yours a [[freezing]] brand or had it blessed by [[the Shining One]]. A [[blessed blade|blessed]] bastard sword of [[holy wrath]] outperforms even a [[eudemon blade]], but unfortunately they're much harder to come across.\n\nBastard swords are two-handed for [[Halfling]]s, [[Kobold]]s, and [[Spriggan]]s.  A [[demon blade]] will be one-handed for these races, and is usually preferable for them if they choose to go for long blades.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

Its demonic power burns away some of the fire resistance of those it strikes.}}\n[[File:Sword_of_cerebov.png]] '''''the +6 sword of Cerebov'''''\n\n+6 flamberge (modified [[great sword]]: 18 damage, -2 accuracy)\n\n[[Flaming]] brand<br>\nInflicts rF- on hit<br>\n[[Evil]]\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''sword of Cerebov'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|334}}</ref> is an [[unrand]] sword wielded by [[Cerebov]], a [[unique]] [[pandemonium lord]]. Foes struck by the sword lose 1 rank of [[fire resistance]], which can even make fire-immune foes vulnerable.\n\nOn its own, this sword can be a strong weapon. But by the time you kill Cerebov, there's usually better options available. Even [[Long Blades]] users may prefer a +9 [[triple sword]] or one-handed sword. [[Fire Magic]] specialists will often want to blast enemies with big AOE ([[Ignition]], [[Fire Storm]]), leaving no time to swing in melee. Therefore, it is generally carried as a prize more than anything.\n\n==History==\n*From [[0.19]] to [[0.28]], the sword of Cerebov had 16 base damage and [[riposte]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], the sword of Cerebov was a regular [[great sword]], and its special effect only ignored fire resistance for the sword's own damage.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Long blades]]"}

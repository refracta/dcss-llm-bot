It creates a fiery explosion of 3-4 tile radius (including the center tile), fills it with [[flame cloud]]s, and summons a handful of [[fire vortex|fire vortices]]. Higher [[spellpower]] increases damage, and the chance of a 4-tile explosion.\n\nThe [[fire vortex|vortices]] Fire Storm creates are weak and confused friendly monsters that wander around, meleeing enemies for a bit of additional damage. They have low HP and die after scoring a single hit, but can serve as a distraction and even get in the way of projectiles or spells. They will be hostile if you worship [[Okawaru]] or have [[Ru#Sacrifices|Sacrificed Love]].\n\n==Strategy==\nFire Storm is one of the strongest spells in the game, [[smite-targeted]], and only 50% resistible. Even monsters immune to fire, such as [[orbs of fire]], can be destroyed in a few casts. However, as a level 9 dual-school spell, it's very difficult to learn in a 3-rune game. Both [[Ashenzari]] and [[Vehumet]] can expedite the process, but even with these gods, Fire Storm is a hefty investment.\n\nThis spell has minor downsides:\n* It causes a real [[noise|ruckus]], akin to shouting at the targeted location. You could get swarmed when you really don't want to.\n* It has a random radius, which makes it difficult to target adjacent monsters without hitting yourself. Even with rF+++, a player takes around 8d8 damage, and that's before power boosts. [[Blink]], [[Dispersal]], or [[Disjunction]] can create a distance from enemies.\n\nKeep some single-target damage spells in your repertoire for monsters that don't deserve 9 MP worth of fiery death.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n* Fire Storm can be used to attack targets from outside [[LOS]]. Under normal circumstances, this requires a 4-tile radius explosion.\n: You can consistently attack outside LOS with [[Vehumet]]'s range increase, a [[scarf]] of [[shadows]], or the innate LOS radius of [[Kobold]]s. You can also attack monsters around corners, no matter the character.\n\n==Gallery==\n[[Image:Fire_storm.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Casting Fire Storm. Notice the friendly fire vortices.]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Fire Storm was 55% resistible.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Fire Storm's blast was circular rather than square. The chance for a radius-4 blast was slightly lower as a result, and not possible if power was less than 76."}

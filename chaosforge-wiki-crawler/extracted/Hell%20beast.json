{"title":"Hell beast","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hell_beast","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Hell beasts''' are bestial [[tier-2 demon]]s with randomized attributes. While their attacks are always fairly powerful and can [[trample]] you back a square, their [[AC]], [[EV]], [[HD]], and [[willpower]] are low, and they have few resistances. They can be encountered in [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], or the [[Hell]]s (particularly when summoned by [[Geryon]]); they may also appear in one ending of [[The Lair]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Evoking the [[horn of Geryon]] will summon 1-4 hell beasts at no cost (though you will not be able to do so again until you have gained a considerable amount of experience). Their friendliness and duration depend on your [[Evocations]] skill.\n*Unlike most demons, they lack [[poison resistance]]. [[Mephitic Cloud]] and the combo of [[Olgreb's Toxic Radiance]] and [[Ignite Poison]] affect them very well.\n*Be wary of their trampling ability if you expect to stair dance away. They may push you off the stairs and leave you extremely vulnerable, a common way to die in the [[Vestibule of Hell]].\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|hell beasts will be renamed to '''sin beasts''', and their bite will have [[antimagic]]. Additionally, their HD will be increased from 7->12.}}\n*Prior to [[0.17]], hell beasts varied in speed, from \"fast\" to \"faster\".\n*Prior to [[0.14]], the Horn of Geryon only summoned a single hell beast, and it was always hostile.\n*Prior to [[0.9]], they were simply called \"beasts.\"\n*Prior to [[0.8]], they could not trample.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

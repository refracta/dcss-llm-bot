{"title":"Corpse","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Corpse","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n'''Corpses''' are the deceased remains of [[monster]]s, and may be left behind (50% chance<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|mon-death.cc|547}}</ref>, or 100% in certain [[vault]]s) when you kill them. They are not randomly generated on the floor. Like [[skeleton]]s, these items cannot be picked up. Corpses will eventually decompose into skeletons, which will decompose themselves into nothing. The corpse of any [[unique monster]] you kill will retain its name.\n\nCorpses are mostly cosmetic, but are still used for a few mechanics in the game.\n\n==Uses==\n*Followers of [[Beogh]] can resurrect their allies only if they leave a corpse.\n*[[Cigotuvi's embrace]] converts corpses into an AC bonus.\n\n===Death Drops===\nCertain enemies may drop items if they leave behind a corpse, first. Effects like [[Gozag]]'s gold touch and [[Yredelemnul]]'s reaping will prevent corpses and their drops from appearing at all. Note that all displayed chances are effectively halved due to requiring a corpse in the first place.\n\n*Slain [[list of dragons|dragons]] may leave behind scales (66% chance<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|mon-death.cc|512}}</ref>), which can be worn as a [[List of dragons#Dragon Armour|body armour]]. \n*Killing [[list of trolls|trolls]] may leave behind a [[troll leather armour]] (66% chance, like scales).\n*Slain [[eleionoma]]e and [[fenstrider witch]]es leave [[wands]] (100% chance<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|mon-death.cc|516}}</ref>).\n\nThese monsters will still drop items, even if their body has otherwise exploded (such as from a [[wand of mindburst]]).\n\n==Corpse Destroying Effects==\nWhile most effects are no longer tied to corpses directly, some require that the corpse isn't \"destroyed\". The following effects conflict with each other, in order of highest priority to lowest:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|mon-death.cc|1401}}</ref>\n\n: '''1.''' The monster spell, [[Bind Souls]], takes priority over all player effects. [[Gozag]] prevents this effect from happening, however.\n: '''2.''' The [[Infestation]] spell takes priority over all other player effects, even those granted by [[god]]s.\n: '''3.''' [[Gozag]]'s gold touch. Gozag turns flesh into gold, preventing the corpse from being used.\n: '''4.''' Kills from a [[wand of mindburst]], [[orb of destruction]], and deaths during [[Inner Flame]] will cause monsters to explode, leaving gory bits and an unusable corpse. Followers of Gozag spray gold all over the place. Does ''not'' prevent any form of [[#Death Drops|death drop]].\n: '''5.''' [[Yredelemnul]]'s zombie reaping. If the corpse is intact, a [[zombie]] is made. If the corpse was destroyed, or the monster couldn't drop a corpse, a [[spectral thing]] is made instead.\n: '''6.''' Other [[Necromancy]] effects, in the following order:\n:* [[Simulacrum]]\n:* [[Animate Dead]] and the [[reaping]] brand\n:* [[Necrotise]]\n: '''7.''' There's a 50% chance for a corpse item to be created on the floor, creating [[#Death Drops|death drops]] if a monster can leave one.\n: '''8.''' [[Cigotuvi's embrace]] absorbs corpses on the floor, increasing the armour's AC bonus.\n\nThese do ''not'' rely on the corpse itself dropping. Effects like Infestation and Gozag's gold touch will work on monsters that won't ever leave a corpse.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.29]], corpses could be used for [[Necromancy]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], you could but''''c''''her corpses for [[comestible|food]]. See below for more details.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], [[vampire]]s could either immediately \"'''e'''at\" corpses, draining the blood out of them, or \"but'''c'''her\" them, bottling their blood to save for later.\n*Prior to [[0.24]], [[Fedhas Madash]] appreciated allowing corpses to decay and allowed its followers to grow [[toadstool]]s and [[ballistomycete spore]]s from them.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], followers of [[Lugonu]] or [[Trog]] could sacrifice corpses for piety by '''p'''raying over a fresh corpse..\n*Prior to [[0.16]], corpses would become rotten after some time had passed, but before they decayed into skeletons. Also, followers of [[Okawaru]] or [[Makhleb]] could sacrifice corpses for piety.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], players were able to pick up and transport corpses. Also, contaminated and contaminated + poisonous corpses existed.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], corpses also sprouted [[toadstool]]s even when the player was not a worshiper of [[Fedhas]].\n*In [[0.8]], contaminated + poisonous corpses were added.\n\n===Butchering===\n*Prior to [[0.23]], butchering a corpse did not always leave a skeleton.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], butchering dragon or troll corpses sometimes left behind hides, which could then be turned into proper armour with a [[scroll of enchant armour]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], butchering took 4 turns instead of 1.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], players in [[Wisp Form]] or [[Fungus Form]] could not butcher corpses.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], players could not butcher corpses while in [[Spider Form]], [[Pig Form]], or [[Porcupine Form]].\n*Prior to [[0.12]], the player character was unable to butcher corpses while wielding [[curse]]d blunt weapons. Although, there were many exceptions: players with a [[beak]] and [[talons]] could always chop corpses, as players with [[fangs]]-3 (but not [[Vampires]]), and players with [[claws]] (unless they had [[curse]]d gloves).\n*Prior to [[0.9]], you needed to carry an edged weapon to butcher.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Items]]\n[[Category:Hunger]]"}

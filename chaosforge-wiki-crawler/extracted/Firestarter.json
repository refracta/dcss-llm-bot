It fills those it strikes with inner flame, and offers protection against the resulting devastation as well as immunity to clouds of flame.}}\n[[File:Firestarter.png]] '''''the +7 great mace \"Firestarter\"'''''\n\n+7 [[great mace]]\n\n[[Flaming]]<br>\nAdds [[Inner Flame]] enchantment on strike<br>\n[[Fire resistance|rF++]]<br>\nGrants immunity to [[clouds]] of flame<br>\n\n==Desirability==\nUnless you're facing foes resistant to [[fire]], '''Firestarter'''<ref>{{source ref|0.26.1|art-data.txt|1235}}</ref> is an exceptionally powerful weapon, combining a solid and well-enchanted base weapon, a decent [[brand]], an extremely useful defense (any source of rF++ is worth consideration), and one of the most brutal melee crowd-control methods in the game. \n\nThe massive amount of [[noise]] it generates along the way has the benefit of waking up lots of monsters around you. \n\nWhile this is often seen as a threat, your previous actions and the fiery clouds they left behind have created deadly terrain for your enemies they first have to cross before they can reach you. This means that any monster not immune to fire will be damaged already as you engage it in melee combat.\n\n==Strategy==\nCombine it with a [[potion of attraction]] to ensure pesky casters or ranged enemies hovering around the edges of your cloud carpet get pulled into the flames as well.\n\nAnd if a fire immune enemy appears, switch to another weapon. Only takes half a turn - but mind that you lose the fire cloud immunity when you unwield Firestarter.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Firestarter did not grant immunity to clouds of flame.\n*Firestarter was added in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

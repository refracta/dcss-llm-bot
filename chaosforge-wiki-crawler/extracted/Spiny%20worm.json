Acidic venom drips from its toothy maw.\n----\n“No sooner had I reached the place than I began to vomit, during which there came from my stomach a hairy worm about a quarter of a cubit in length: the hairs were long, and the worm was very ugly, speckled of divers colours, green, black, and red. They kept and showed it to the doctor, who said he had never seen anything of the sort before...”<br>\n-Benvenuto Cellini, _Autobiography_. 1563.<br>\ntrans.

They also inflict strong [[poison]] in melee, but this is usually less of an issue. They are often found in \"worm [[vault]]s\" along with [[worm]]s, [[brain worm]]s, [[rock worm]]s, and [[lindwurm]]s, as well as occasionally in the [[Slime Pits]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Although dangerous, they are just barely slow enough for most characters to flee.\n*If you have to go into melee with them, follow the usual rules for fighting acidic creatures. [[Resist corrosion]] will mostly protect your equipment from [[corrosion]], [[artifact]] and heavily-enchanted gear resists more often than average gear, and having all your equipment slots filled will drop the acid damage you take drastically.\n==History==\nSpiny worms were removed in [[0.14]]\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

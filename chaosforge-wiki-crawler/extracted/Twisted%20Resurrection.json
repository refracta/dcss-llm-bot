More and larger corpses result in more powerful creations.}}\n\n'''Twisted Resurrection''' is a monster only spell that creates [[crawling corpse]]s or [[macabre mass]]es. They cannot attack, but they will combine into [[small abomination]]s and eventually [[large abomination]]s with enough of them, or merge with small abominations to make them large.  If a corpse is not large enough to create a crawling corpse, it is reduced to a pulpy mess (i.e. destroyed). \n\nThe following enemies cast Twisted Resurrection:\n*{{monsterlink|Deep elf death mage}}\n*{{monsterlink|Deep elf high priest}}\n\n==History==\n{{spell\n |name=Twisted Resurrection\n |level=5\n |school1={{Necromancy}}\n |school2=\n |school3=\n |sources=<div>\n* [[Book of Unlife]]</div>\n|castingnoise=4\n|spellnoise=0\n}}\n*The monster version of Twisted Resurrection was removed in [[0.27]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], it was a Level 5 [[Necromancy]] spell available to players.\n*Prior to [[0.10]] Twisted Resurrection did not produce crawling corpses. You woul have to place several corpses on a single tile, cast it while standing over them, and there was a chance that a small or large abomination would form.\n\n===Mechanics (Player)===\nCreates [[crawling corpse]]s or [[macabre mass]]es, based on [[corpse]] size. For every 20-60 [[aum]] of a corpse, 1 HD worth of monster is created (half effectiveness past 15 HD).\n\nMonsters created by Twisted Resurrection can \"merge\" with each other, combining their HD and potentially creating a stronger monster. [[Small abomination]]s require 6 HD and 2 corpses; [[large abomination]]s require 11 HD and 3 corpses. Abominations will heal when merging with other monsters.\n\nUnlike [[derived undead]], monsters created by Twisted Resurrection can follow you up and down stairs."}

And all of this you get in exchange for – almost nothing! Sure, the [HP](/HP \"HP\") are somewhat low, but otherwise the Gargoyle brings along formidable stats for melee fighting and decent offensive magic. Indeed the Gargoyle is the first character that got me to a 15-rune victory. The Gargoyle [Wizard](/Wizard \"Wizard\") even let me clear out my first Ziggurat together with the 15 runes.\n\n[Poison](/Poison \"Poison\") immunity, [electricity](/Electricity \"Electricity\") resistance, [rN](/Negative_energy \"Negative energy\")+, [torment](/Torment \"Torment\") resistance and immunity to [rotting](/Rot \"Rot\") eliminate or at least soften some of the most pesky threats a player must face during the game, on top of the mid-game ability to [fly](/Fly \"Fly\") permanently. Then add the amazing [AC](/AC \"AC\") and [GDR](/GDR \"GDR\") bonus, and you have a character that, if carefully played, can handle all situations the game throws at you. Having all these resistances allows you to pile on other resistances and lots of [INT](/INT \"INT\"), without any headaches about choosing which slink in your armour you have to leave open to your enemies’ attacks.\n\nGargoyles’ base stats allow you to go for the big offensive spells – as a wizard you start out with 18 intelligence, and none of the other stats below 8. That means that you can pour every stat increase into further intelligence, which will get you (together with the uncontrolled stat increases) around or even above 30 by the time you reach XL 27. Add then the odd INT brands on armour or [jewellery](/Jewellery \"Jewellery\"), and you have high-powered end-game spells with little or no hunger cost. But this does not leave you a glass cannon, such as [Deep Elves](/Deep_Elves \"Deep Elves\") or [Spriggans](/Spriggan \"Spriggan\") – you do all this with AC way above 40, even wearing a [large shield](/Large_shield \"Large shield\"), with obscenely high SH rates!\n\nAs an illustration, you may want to look at [Majang's Gargoyle Wizard of Vehumet Diary](/Majang%27s_Gargoyle_Wizard_of_Vehumet_Diary \"Majang's Gargoyle Wizard of Vehumet Diary\") for a somewhat unlucky specimen of this build, which in spite of very poor equipment made it beyond [Zot](/Zot \"Zot\"):5, even clearing out [Cocytus](/Cocytus \"Cocytus\") before getting killed in [Dis](/Dis \"Dis\"):7.\n\n## Basic strategy outline\n\nYou start out as a pure caster, switching off almost all skills until your [Magic Dart](/Magic_Dart \"Magic Dart\") reaches #### power. This should happen pretty soon, and then you start your transformation into a versatile hybrid fighter/caster. While you develop your Conjurations, [Fire Magic](/Fire_Magic \"Fire Magic\") and [Air Magic](/Air_Magic \"Air Magic\") skills (yes, Air Magic, in spite of Gargoyle’s apparent weakness here), you also get your defensive skills up, and pick a weapon category. My weapon of choice would be an air or fire elemental [magical staff](/Magical_staff \"Magical staff\"), as these are one-handed and do not interfere with a [shield](/Shield \"Shield\"). Until you find one, you may want to use a two-handed [quarterstaff](/Quarterstaff \"Quarterstaff\") without a shield, or use [Maces & Flails](/Maces_%26_Flails \"Maces & Flails\") which cross-train with [staves](/Staves \"Staves\").\n\nDuring the mid-to-late game, when you already have decent melee and defensive skills, you again start focusing on your attack magic skills, until you get [Fire Storm](/Fire_Storm \"Fire Storm\") online, and not much later [Tornado](/Tornado \"Tornado\"). When these two spells work for you ([Vehumet](/Vehumet \"Vehumet\") will help considerably with that), you can tackle any branch of the game, with a few equipment changes here or there.\n\nBut let’s look into all these factors in detail!\n\n## Details of this character\n\n### Background choice\n\nWizard is not a recommended background for gargoyles. You probably have a safer early game by going straight for a [Fire Elementalist](/Fire_Elementalist \"Fire Elementalist\"): the advantage would be guaranteed access early on to [Sticky Flame](/Sticky_Flame \"Sticky Flame\") and [Fireball](/Fireball \"Fireball\"). As wizard you’ll have to do without these spells for longer than you might care for. On the plus side you have considerably more intelligence, and also spells to deal with these pesky [crimson imps](/Crimson_imp \"Crimson imp\"), to which Fire Elementalists don’t really have an answer. Hopefully luck or Vehumet will fill your spell gaps soon. The wizard spell book also contains [Mephitic Cloud](/Mephitic_Cloud \"Mephitic Cloud\"), which has the double benefit of making your early game a lot more survivable, and of getting you access to the Air Magic spell school, which will become quite important for you.\n\n### God choice\n\nHere, too, there are other options, or at least one other option, [Cheibriados](/Cheibriados \"Cheibriados\"). His amazing stat bonuses make you extremely powerful after a very short time. The downside to this deity is not so much the speed penalty, but the lack of [MP](/MP \"MP\") restoration and the lack of guaranteed access to [Fire Storm](/Fire_Storm \"Fire Storm\") and even [Tornado](/Tornado \"Tornado\"), the two spells around which your end-game revolves. In case these don’t materialize before you enter places like [Zot:5](/Zot:5 \"Zot:5\") or [Vaults](/Vaults \"Vaults\"):5, your irresistible melee capacity may compensate for this somewhat, but I still prefer to be able to rely on the late-game nukes when I need them.\n\nOutside of Chei, Vehumet would be the only god I’d consider for the character. His spell gifts (you are likely to get Fire Storm and/or Tornado as his final spell gifts), coupled with his MP restoration and spell aid abilities, make him the logical choice for a gargoyle wizard. Since you can add each stat increase exclusively to intelligence, you will not need Chei’s stat boosts to reach the intelligence levels you need to cast the high-end spells.\n\n### Weapon choice\n\nAs a gargoyle wizard, you will probably dispose of most of your enemies by attack spells, but once in a while you may find it useful to swing a weapon to do this. Gargoyle’s weapon of choice is a [mace](/Mace \"Mace\"), [whip](/Whip \"Whip\") or [flail](/Flail \"Flail\"), but you also have a good aptitude for staves. You may find a [quarterstaff](/Quarterstaff \"Quarterstaff\") long before you find your first [buckler](/Buckler \"Buckler\"), and that may already give you the opportunity to train the [Staves](/Staves \"Staves\") skill. But you really hope to find a staff of fire or a staff of air. Since you are training these two spell schools throughout the game, and to pretty high levels, and you are training evocations, the originally timid +5,+5 staff turns into a devastating weapon with its additional elemental damage output. Train a few levels of Staves (up to 12), and you can swing your staff as nimbly as Gandalf in *The Return of the King*. It may be worth trying to get a staff through a [scroll of acquirement](/Scroll_of_acquirement \"Scroll of acquirement\"); even if it is not an elemental staff, it will be something useful, such as a [staff of energy](/Staff_of_energy \"Staff of energy\") or [wizardry](/Staff_of_wizardry \"Staff of wizardry\"). If you have trained some levels of [Maces & Flails](/Maces_%26_Flails \"Maces & Flails\"), however, the scroll may provide you with some rather useless rods.\n\nIf you find a [buckler](/Buckler \"Buckler\") early on, and don’t have the one-handed staff you need, you can settle for a good mace, flail, [morningstar](/Morningstar \"Morningstar\"), or (if you're lucky) [eveningstar](/Eveningstar \"Eveningstar\"), and train the appropriate skill. This then cross-trains with staves when you can finally switch.\n\n### Armour choice\n\nYou have a good shields aptitude, and it would be a pity to let this go to waste. When you find a buckler, use it! You will need a skill of 5 to use it without penalty, but don’t stop there! With a skill of 15, you can use a regular shield, but even much earlier the penalty will not stop you from using any of your spells, until you get to the level 9 spells. I usually go all the way to using large shields, but you may find some amazing [artefact](/Artefact \"Artefact\") smaller shield, and that may be a good reason to save you the experience investment needed for using large shields.\n\nThe most useful main body armor for you is probably the [mottled dragon armour](/Mottled_dragon_armour \"Mottled dragon armour\"). It barely affects your spell casting, but gives you 12 AC when fully enchanted. A [swamp dragon armour](/Swamp_dragon_armour \"Swamp dragon armour\") is comparable in AC, but its brand is useless to you. [Fire](/Fire_dragon_armour \"Fire dragon armour\") or [ice dragon armour](/Ice_dragon_armour \"Ice dragon armour\") have useful brands, but they require you to invest quite a lot into [Armour skill](/Armour_skill \"Armour skill\") before you can use them comfortably. Anything beyond that will be too heavy for you. In any case, the mottled dragon armor will give you a whopping 42 % GDR. You may still want to train some Armour skill levels for it, but can stop at about 6 or so. Unfortunately, it may be quite a while before you find a [mottled dragon hide](/Mottled_dragon_hide \"Mottled dragon hide\") (in one game I did not find a single one until the end), so any other light armor will have to do until this happy moment. If you are lucky, you’ll find some nice artefact [leather armour](/Leather_armour \"Leather armour\") or [ring mail](/Ring_mail \"Ring mail\"). Don’t throw them away just because they may be negatively enchanted – with your massive AC boost you can afford to let go of a few points here, if it gives you some nice [intrinsics](/Intrinsic \"Intrinsic\") instead.\n\n### Spells to learn\n\nFrom the starting spell book you learn [Repel Missiles](/Repel_Missiles \"Repel Missiles\"), [Conjure Flame](/Conjure_Flame \"Conjure Flame\") and [Mephitic Cloud](/Mephitic_Cloud \"Mephitic Cloud\"). These will get you into the Fire and Air Magic spell schools, and provide you with the firepower to make it through the game until Vehumet gifts you more potent Conjurations spells. Mephitic Cloud is particularly useful against [ogres](/Ogre_\\(monster\\) \"Ogre (monster)\") and [orc priests](/Orc_priest \"Orc priest\"), who can otherwise be serious threats for you. You will want to get Fire and Air spells as soon as possible, particularly [Airstrike](/Airstrike \"Airstrike\"), [Sticky Flame](/Sticky_Flame \"Sticky Flame\") and [Fireball](/Fireball \"Fireball\"). With this under your belt, you will make it through [the Lair](/The_Lair \"The Lair\"), the [Orcish Mines](/Orcish_Mines \"Orcish Mines\"), and the two Lair side [branches](/Branch \"Branch\"). Although you have a very good aptitude for [Earth Magic](/Earth_Magic \"Earth Magic\"), you should leave this alone until much later. One of your keys to success later on is the Tornado, which in combination with Fire Storm clears out any concentration of bad guys, including the worst of the [Hells](/Hell \"Hell\"), [Pandemonium](/Pandemonium \"Pandemonium\"), and the [Ziggurats](/Ziggurat \"Ziggurat\"). [Shatter](/Shatter \"Shatter\") just isn’t half as useful, and [Lehudib's Crystal Spear](/Lehudib%27s_Crystal_Spear \"Lehudib's Crystal Spear\") only hits single targets at a very high cost. You can actually get LCS later on with pretty low skill investment, once Conjurations and [Spellcasting](/Spellcasting \"Spellcasting\") are maxed out (but that will be very late in the game).\n\nOther useful spells: [Blink](/Blink \"Blink\") (already in your starting spell book), [Apportation](/Apportation \"Apportation\"), [Bolt of Fire](/Bolt_of_Fire \"Bolt of Fire\"), [Orb of Destruction](/Orb_of_Destruction \"Orb of Destruction\") (you will need this against dangerous [uniques](/Unique \"Unique\") such as [Boris](/Boris \"Boris\"), [Mara](/Mara \"Mara\") or [Norris](/Norris \"Norris\")), and [Regeneration](/Regeneration \"Regeneration\"). Later on you may want to replace Repel Missiles with [Deflect Missiles](/Deflect_Missiles \"Deflect Missiles\").\n\n### Skill management\n\nIn the beginning, your starting spells are rather pathetic, and you need to work particularly at Conjurations and Spellcasting to make them more powerful. When your Magic Dart reaches #### in spell power, you need to branch out broadly to train all the following skills: [Fighting](/Fighting \"Fighting\") (maybe initially up to 6 before switching it off again), your melee weapon skill to what it takes to reach minimum delay for your weapon of choice (12 for a staff), Armour (up to 6 if you are aiming for a mottled dragon armor), [Dodging](/Dodging \"Dodging\") (initially up to 10 or so), Fire Magic and Air Magic (never switch those off), and [Evocations](/Evocations \"Evocations\") (up to 10 initially). Don’t ever train [Stealth](/Stealth \"Stealth\") (you won’t be stealthy, forget it), and leave all non-elemental magic skills except Conjurations switched off. What you need here, you get through your Spellcasting skill.\n\nOnce you have cleared out the Lair, the Orcish Mines and the other Lair branches, it is again time to focus on your magic skills. Switch off all the support skills (except if you still have to train some Armour or Shield skill to eliminate casting penalties), and focus on Spellcasting, Conjurations, Fire Magic and Air Magic until you can cast Fire Storm and Tornado with good reliability. Use enhancer staves or jewellery, and if you have to, drink [potions of brilliance](/Potions_of_brilliance \"Potions of brilliance\") before a big fight.\n\nIn the end-game, you may max out some of your skills. Train Fighting, Armour, Shields and Dodging instead – these will all increase your survivability in the late game branches. The most important of them will be Fighting, as the HP increase will help you against the irresistible damage of late-game [hellfire](/Hellfire \"Hellfire\"). If you are so inclined, you may also want to dip into [Necromancy](/Necromancy \"Necromancy\") to use some of those spells. I like to then go into [Earth Magic](/Earth_Magic \"Earth Magic\"), giving me other options to make some [pan lords](/Pan_lord \"Pan lord\") keel over.\n\n### What can kill you\n\nAs long as you do not attract too many enemies at once, you should be pretty safe in almost all situations. But there are some monsters which can be lethal even for you gargoyle: In the beginning those are [orc priests](/Orc_priest \"Orc priest\"), whose [smite](/Smite \"Smite\") attacks don’t care about your armour protection. A few of those encountered at the same time can kill you fast. Use [Mephitic Cloud](/Mephitic_Cloud \"Mephitic Cloud\") against them, then run. [Confused](/Confused \"Confused\") orc priests don’t smite! Later on you need to fear the following: [unseen horrors](/Unseen_horror \"Unseen horror\") are fast and eat quickly through your armour - try to find a source for [see invisible](/See_invisible \"See invisible\") before you get too deep into the dungeon; uniques ([Wiglaf](/Wiglaf \"Wiglaf\"), [Mara](/Mara \"Mara\"), [Norris](/Norris \"Norris\"), and their likes) can easily overpower you. Monsters with [Earth Magic](/Earth_Magic \"Earth Magic\") spells such as [Shatter](/Shatter \"Shatter\") or [Lee's Rapid Deconstruction](/Lee%27s_Rapid_Deconstruction \"Lee's Rapid Deconstruction\") find a particularly soft target in you. Kill them fast! And finally, [hellfire](/Hellfire \"Hellfire\") can burn through your [HP](/HP \"HP\") in no time at all. When you see hellfire-capable monsters, prioritize them quickly, as you have no protection whatsoever against them, except killing them before they kill you.\n\nYour [torment](/Torment \"Torment\") resistance, and your immunity against [rotting](/Rot \"Rot\") allow you to spend more time in the [hells](/Hell \"Hell\") than other characters. You may want to explore all the levels to collect the experience. But you do need a [ring of sustain attributes](/Ring_of_sustain_attributes \"Ring of sustain attributes\"), or you may end up with [stat zero](/Stat_zero \"Stat zero\") in very inopportune places.\n\nAnd you may also want to avoid getting yourself into [the Abyss](/The_Abyss \"The Abyss\"), unless you are really, really strong. I would not volunteer to go there before I'm ready to enter [the Realm of Zot](/The_Realm_of_Zot \"The Realm of Zot\"). That place is just too unpredictable, particularly for casters, who may find themselves surrounded by foes and out of energy, with nowhere to go.\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html

And all of this you get in exchange for – almost nothing! Sure, the <a href=\"/HP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HP\">HP</a> are somewhat low, but otherwise the Gargoyle brings along formidable stats for melee fighting and decent offensive magic. Indeed the Gargoyle is the first character that got me to a 15-rune victory. The Gargoyle <a href=\"/Wizard\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wizard\">Wizard</a> even let me clear out my first Ziggurat together with the 15 runes.\n</p><p><a href=\"/Poison\" title=\"Poison\">Poison</a> immunity, <a href=\"/Electricity\" title=\"Electricity\">electricity</a> resistance, <a href=\"/Negative_energy\" title=\"Negative energy\">rN</a>+, <a href=\"/Torment\" title=\"Torment\">torment</a> resistance and immunity to <a href=\"/Rot\" title=\"Rot\">rotting</a> eliminate or at least soften some of the most pesky threats a player must face during the game, on top of the mid-game ability to <a href=\"/Fly\" title=\"Fly\">fly</a> permanently. Then add the amazing <a href=\"/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a> and <a href=\"/GDR\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"GDR\">GDR</a> bonus, and you have a character that, if carefully played, can handle all situations the game throws at you. Having all these resistances allows you to pile on other resistances and lots of <a href=\"/INT\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"INT\">INT</a>, without any headaches about choosing which slink in your armour you have to leave open to your enemies’ attacks.\n</p><p>Gargoyles’ base stats allow you to go for the big offensive spells – as a wizard you start out with 18 intelligence, and none of the other stats below 8. That means that you can pour every stat increase into further intelligence, which will get you (together with the uncontrolled stat increases) around or even above 30 by the time you reach XL 27. Add then the odd INT brands on armour or <a href=\"/Jewellery\" title=\"Jewellery\">jewellery</a>, and you have high-powered end-game spells with little or no hunger cost. But this does not leave you a glass cannon, such as <a href=\"/Deep_Elves\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Deep Elves\">Deep Elves</a> or <a href=\"/Spriggan\" title=\"Spriggan\">Spriggans</a> – you do all this with AC way above 40, even wearing a <a href=\"/Large_shield\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Large shield\">large shield</a>, with obscenely high SH rates!\n</p><p>As an illustration, you may want to look at <a href=\"/Majang%27s_Gargoyle_Wizard_of_Vehumet_Diary\" title=\"Majang&#39;s Gargoyle Wizard of Vehumet Diary\">Majang's Gargoyle Wizard of Vehumet Diary</a> for a somewhat unlucky specimen of this build, which in spite of very poor equipment made it beyond <a href=\"/Zot\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Zot\">Zot</a>:5, even clearing out <a href=\"/Cocytus\" title=\"Cocytus\">Cocytus</a> before getting killed in <a href=\"/Dis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dis\">Dis</a>:7.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Basic_strategy_outline\">Basic strategy outline</span></h2>\n<p>You start out as a pure caster, switching off almost all skills until your <a href=\"/Magic_Dart\" title=\"Magic Dart\">Magic Dart</a> reaches #### power. This should happen pretty soon, and then you start your transformation into a versatile hybrid fighter/caster. While you develop your Conjurations, <a href=\"/Fire_Magic\" title=\"Fire Magic\">Fire Magic</a> and <a href=\"/Air_Magic\" title=\"Air Magic\">Air Magic</a> skills (yes, Air Magic, in spite of Gargoyle’s apparent weakness here), you also get your defensive skills up, and pick a weapon category. My weapon of choice would be an air or fire elemental <a href=\"/Magical_staff\" title=\"Magical staff\">magical staff</a>, as these are one-handed and do not interfere with a <a href=\"/Shield\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield\">shield</a>. Until you find one, you may want to use a two-handed <a href=\"/Quarterstaff\" title=\"Quarterstaff\">quarterstaff</a> without a shield, or use <a href=\"/Maces_%26_Flails\" title=\"Maces &amp; Flails\">Maces &amp; Flails</a> which cross-train with <a href=\"/Staves\" title=\"Staves\">staves</a>.\n</p><p>During the mid-to-late game, when you already have decent melee and defensive skills, you again start focusing on your attack magic skills, until you get <a href=\"/Fire_Storm\" title=\"Fire Storm\">Fire Storm</a> online, and not much later <a href=\"/Tornado\" title=\"Tornado\">Tornado</a>. When these two spells work for you (<a href=\"/Vehumet\" title=\"Vehumet\">Vehumet</a> will help considerably with that), you can tackle any branch of the game, with a few equipment changes here or there.\n</p><p>But let’s look into all these factors in detail!\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Details_of_this_character\">Details of this character</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Background_choice\">Background choice</span></h3>\n<p>Wizard is not a recommended background for gargoyles. You probably have a safer early game by going straight for a <a href=\"/Fire_Elementalist\" title=\"Fire Elementalist\">Fire Elementalist</a>: the advantage would be guaranteed access early on to <a href=\"/Sticky_Flame\" title=\"Sticky Flame\">Sticky Flame</a> and <a href=\"/Fireball\" title=\"Fireball\">Fireball</a>. As wizard you’ll have to do without these spells for longer than you might care for. On the plus side you have considerably more intelligence, and also spells to deal with these pesky <a href=\"/Crimson_imp\" title=\"Crimson imp\">crimson imps</a>, to which Fire Elementalists don’t really have an answer. Hopefully luck or Vehumet will fill your spell gaps soon. The wizard spell book also contains <a href=\"/Mephitic_Cloud\" title=\"Mephitic Cloud\">Mephitic Cloud</a>, which has the double benefit of making your early game a lot more survivable, and of getting you access to the Air Magic spell school, which will become quite important for you.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"God_choice\">God choice</span></h3>\n<p>Here, too, there are other options, or at least one other option, <a href=\"/Cheibriados\" title=\"Cheibriados\">Cheibriados</a>. His amazing stat bonuses make you extremely powerful after a very short time. The downside to this deity is not so much the speed penalty, but the lack of <a href=\"/MP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"MP\">MP</a> restoration and the lack of guaranteed access to <a href=\"/Fire_Storm\" title=\"Fire Storm\">Fire Storm</a> and even <a href=\"/Tornado\" title=\"Tornado\">Tornado</a>, the two spells around which your end-game revolves. In case these don’t materialize before you enter places like <a href=\"/Zot:5\" title=\"Zot:5\">Zot:5</a> or <a href=\"/Vaults\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vaults\">Vaults</a>:5, your irresistible melee capacity may compensate for this somewhat, but I still prefer to be able to rely on the late-game nukes when I need them.\n</p><p>Outside of Chei, Vehumet would be the only god I’d consider for the character. His spell gifts (you are likely to get Fire Storm and/or Tornado as his final spell gifts), coupled with his MP restoration and spell aid abilities, make him the logical choice for a gargoyle wizard. Since you can add each stat increase exclusively to intelligence, you will not need Chei’s stat boosts to reach the intelligence levels you need to cast the high-end spells.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapon_choice\">Weapon choice</span></h3>\n<p>As a gargoyle wizard, you will probably dispose of most of your enemies by attack spells, but once in a while you may find it useful to swing a weapon to do this. Gargoyle’s weapon of choice is a <a href=\"/Mace\" title=\"Mace\">mace</a>, <a href=\"/Whip\" title=\"Whip\">whip</a> or <a href=\"/Flail\" title=\"Flail\">flail</a>, but you also have a good aptitude for staves. You may find a <a href=\"/Quarterstaff\" title=\"Quarterstaff\">quarterstaff</a> long before you find your first <a href=\"/Buckler\" title=\"Buckler\">buckler</a>, and that may already give you the opportunity to train the <a href=\"/Staves\" title=\"Staves\">Staves</a> skill. But you really hope to find a staff of fire or a staff of air. Since you are training these two spell schools throughout the game, and to pretty high levels, and you are training evocations, the originally timid +5,+5 staff turns into a devastating weapon with its additional elemental damage output. Train a few levels of Staves (up to 12), and you can swing your staff as nimbly as Gandalf in <i>The Return of the King</i>. It may be worth trying to get a staff through a <a href=\"/Scroll_of_acquirement\" title=\"Scroll of acquirement\">scroll of acquirement</a>; even if it is not an elemental staff, it will be something useful, such as a <a href=\"/Staff_of_energy\" title=\"Staff of energy\">staff of energy</a> or <a href=\"/Staff_of_wizardry\" title=\"Staff of wizardry\">wizardry</a>. If you have trained some levels of <a href=\"/Maces_%26_Flails\" title=\"Maces &amp; Flails\">Maces &amp; Flails</a>, however, the scroll may provide you with some rather useless rods.\n</p><p>If you find a <a href=\"/Buckler\" title=\"Buckler\">buckler</a> early on, and don’t have the one-handed staff you need, you can settle for a good mace, flail, <a href=\"/Morningstar\" title=\"Morningstar\">morningstar</a>, or (if you're lucky) <a href=\"/Eveningstar\" title=\"Eveningstar\">eveningstar</a>, and train the appropriate skill. This then cross-trains with staves when you can finally switch.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Armour_choice\">Armour choice</span></h3>\n<p>You have a good shields aptitude, and it would be a pity to let this go to waste. When you find a buckler, use it! You will need a skill of 5 to use it without penalty, but don’t stop there! With a skill of 15, you can use a regular shield, but even much earlier the penalty will not stop you from using any of your spells, until you get to the level 9 spells. I usually go all the way to using large shields, but you may find some amazing <a href=\"/Artefact\" title=\"Artefact\">artefact</a> smaller shield, and that may be a good reason to save you the experience investment needed for using large shields.\n</p><p>The most useful main body armor for you is probably the <a href=\"/Mottled_dragon_armour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mottled dragon armour\">mottled dragon armour</a>. It barely affects your spell casting, but gives you 12 AC when fully enchanted. A <a href=\"/Swamp_dragon_armour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Swamp dragon armour\">swamp dragon armour</a> is comparable in AC, but its brand is useless to you. <a href=\"/Fire_dragon_armour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fire dragon armour\">Fire</a> or <a href=\"/Ice_dragon_armour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ice dragon armour\">ice dragon armour</a> have useful brands, but they require you to invest quite a lot into <a href=\"/Armour_skill\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Armour skill\">Armour skill</a> before you can use them comfortably. Anything beyond that will be too heavy for you. In any case, the mottled dragon armor will give you a whopping 42&#160;% GDR. You may still want to train some Armour skill levels for it, but can stop at about 6 or so. Unfortunately, it may be quite a while before you find a <a href=\"/Mottled_dragon_hide\" title=\"Mottled dragon hide\">mottled dragon hide</a> (in one game I did not find a single one until the end), so any other light armor will have to do until this happy moment. If you are lucky, you’ll find some nice artefact <a href=\"/Leather_armour\" title=\"Leather armour\">leather armour</a> or <a href=\"/Ring_mail\" title=\"Ring mail\">ring mail</a>. Don’t throw them away just because they may be negatively enchanted – with your massive AC boost you can afford to let go of a few points here, if it gives you some nice <a href=\"/Intrinsic\" title=\"Intrinsic\">intrinsics</a> instead.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spells_to_learn\">Spells to learn</span></h3>\n<p>From the starting spell book you learn <a href=\"/Repel_Missiles\" title=\"Repel Missiles\">Repel Missiles</a>, <a href=\"/Conjure_Flame\" title=\"Conjure Flame\">Conjure Flame</a> and <a href=\"/Mephitic_Cloud\" title=\"Mephitic Cloud\">Mephitic Cloud</a>. These will get you into the Fire and Air Magic spell schools, and provide you with the firepower to make it through the game until Vehumet gifts you more potent Conjurations spells. Mephitic Cloud is particularly useful against <a href=\"/Ogre_(monster)\" title=\"Ogre (monster)\">ogres</a> and <a href=\"/Orc_priest\" title=\"Orc priest\">orc priests</a>, who can otherwise be serious threats for you. You will want to get Fire and Air spells as soon as possible, particularly <a href=\"/Airstrike\" title=\"Airstrike\">Airstrike</a>, <a href=\"/Sticky_Flame\" title=\"Sticky Flame\">Sticky Flame</a> and <a href=\"/Fireball\" title=\"Fireball\">Fireball</a>. With this under your belt, you will make it through <a href=\"/The_Lair\" title=\"The Lair\">the Lair</a>, the <a href=\"/Orcish_Mines\" title=\"Orcish Mines\">Orcish Mines</a>, and the two Lair side <a href=\"/Branch\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Branch\">branches</a>. Although you have a very good aptitude for <a href=\"/Earth_Magic\" title=\"Earth Magic\">Earth Magic</a>, you should leave this alone until much later. One of your keys to success later on is the Tornado, which in combination with Fire Storm clears out any concentration of bad guys, including the worst of the <a href=\"/Hell\" title=\"Hell\">Hells</a>, <a href=\"/Pandemonium\" title=\"Pandemonium\">Pandemonium</a>, and the <a href=\"/Ziggurat\" title=\"Ziggurat\">Ziggurats</a>. <a href=\"/Shatter\" title=\"Shatter\">Shatter</a> just isn’t half as useful, and <a href=\"/Lehudib%27s_Crystal_Spear\" title=\"Lehudib&#39;s Crystal Spear\">Lehudib's Crystal Spear</a> only hits single targets at a very high cost. You can actually get LCS later on with pretty low skill investment, once Conjurations and <a href=\"/Spellcasting\" title=\"Spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a> are maxed out (but that will be very late in the game).\n</p><p>Other useful spells: <a href=\"/Blink\" title=\"Blink\">Blink</a> (already in your starting spell book), <a href=\"/Apportation\" title=\"Apportation\">Apportation</a>, <a href=\"/Bolt_of_Fire\" title=\"Bolt of Fire\">Bolt of Fire</a>, <a href=\"/Orb_of_Destruction\" title=\"Orb of Destruction\">Orb of Destruction</a> (you will need this against dangerous <a href=\"/Unique\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Unique\">uniques</a> such as <a href=\"/Boris\" title=\"Boris\">Boris</a>, <a href=\"/Mara\" title=\"Mara\">Mara</a> or <a href=\"/Norris\" title=\"Norris\">Norris</a>), and <a href=\"/Regeneration\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Regeneration\">Regeneration</a>. Later on you may want to replace Repel Missiles with <a href=\"/Deflect_Missiles\" title=\"Deflect Missiles\">Deflect Missiles</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Skill_management\">Skill management</span></h3>\n<p>In the beginning, your starting spells are rather pathetic, and you need to work particularly at Conjurations and Spellcasting to make them more powerful. When your Magic Dart reaches #### in spell power, you need to branch out broadly to train all the following skills: <a href=\"/Fighting\" title=\"Fighting\">Fighting</a> (maybe initially up to 6 before switching it off again), your melee weapon skill to what it takes to reach minimum delay for your weapon of choice (12 for a staff), Armour (up to 6 if you are aiming for a mottled dragon armor), <a href=\"/Dodging\" title=\"Dodging\">Dodging</a> (initially up to 10 or so), Fire Magic and Air Magic (never switch those off), and <a href=\"/Evocations\" title=\"Evocations\">Evocations</a> (up to 10 initially). Don’t ever train <a href=\"/Stealth\" title=\"Stealth\">Stealth</a> (you won’t be stealthy, forget it), and leave all non-elemental magic skills except Conjurations switched off. What you need here, you get through your Spellcasting skill.\n</p><p>Once you have cleared out the Lair, the Orcish Mines and the other Lair branches, it is again time to focus on your magic skills. Switch off all the support skills (except if you still have to train some Armour or Shield skill to eliminate casting penalties), and focus on Spellcasting, Conjurations, Fire Magic and Air Magic until you can cast Fire Storm and Tornado with good reliability. Use enhancer staves or jewellery, and if you have to, drink <a href=\"/Potions_of_brilliance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Potions of brilliance\">potions of brilliance</a> before a big fight.\n</p><p>In the end-game, you may max out some of your skills. Train Fighting, Armour, Shields and Dodging instead – these will all increase your survivability in the late game branches. The most important of them will be Fighting, as the HP increase will help you against the irresistible damage of late-game <a href=\"/Hellfire\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hellfire\">hellfire</a>. If you are so inclined, you may also want to dip into <a href=\"/Necromancy\" title=\"Necromancy\">Necromancy</a> to use some of those spells. I like to then go into <a href=\"/Earth_Magic\" title=\"Earth Magic\">Earth Magic</a>, giving me other options to make some <a href=\"/Pan_lord\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pan lord\">pan lords</a> keel over.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What_can_kill_you\">What can kill you</span></h3>\n<p>As long as you do not attract too many enemies at once, you should be pretty safe in almost all situations. But there are some monsters which can be lethal even for you gargoyle: In the beginning those are <a href=\"/Orc_priest\" title=\"Orc priest\">orc priests</a>, whose <a href=\"/Smite\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Smite\">smite</a> attacks don’t care about your armour protection. A few of those encountered at the same time can kill you fast. Use <a href=\"/Mephitic_Cloud\" title=\"Mephitic Cloud\">Mephitic Cloud</a> against them, then run. <a href=\"/Confused\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Confused\">Confused</a> orc priests don’t smite! Later on you need to fear the following: <a href=\"/Unseen_horror\" title=\"Unseen horror\">unseen horrors</a> are fast and eat quickly through your armour - try to find a source for <a href=\"/See_invisible\" title=\"See invisible\">see invisible</a> before you get too deep into the dungeon; uniques (<a href=\"/Wiglaf\" title=\"Wiglaf\">Wiglaf</a>, <a href=\"/Mara\" title=\"Mara\">Mara</a>, <a href=\"/Norris\" title=\"Norris\">Norris</a>, and their likes) can easily overpower you. Monsters with <a href=\"/Earth_Magic\" title=\"Earth Magic\">Earth Magic</a> spells such as <a href=\"/Shatter\" title=\"Shatter\">Shatter</a> or <a href=\"/Lee%27s_Rapid_Deconstruction\" title=\"Lee&#39;s Rapid Deconstruction\">Lee's Rapid Deconstruction</a> find a particularly soft target in you. Kill them fast! And finally, <a href=\"/Hellfire\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hellfire\">hellfire</a> can burn through your <a href=\"/HP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HP\">HP</a> in no time at all. When you see hellfire-capable monsters, prioritize them quickly, as you have no protection whatsoever against them, except killing them before they kill you.\n</p><p>Your <a href=\"/Torment\" title=\"Torment\">torment</a> resistance, and your immunity against <a href=\"/Rot\" title=\"Rot\">rotting</a> allow you to spend more time in the <a href=\"/Hell\" title=\"Hell\">hells</a> than other characters. You may want to explore all the levels to collect the experience. But you do need a <a href=\"/Ring_of_sustain_attributes\" title=\"Ring of sustain attributes\">ring of sustain attributes</a>, or you may end up with <a href=\"/Stat_zero\" title=\"Stat zero\">stat zero</a> in very inopportune places.\n</p><p>And you may also want to avoid getting yourself into <a href=\"/The_Abyss\" title=\"The Abyss\">the Abyss</a>, unless you are really, really strong. I would not volunteer to go there before I'm ready to enter <a href=\"/The_Realm_of_Zot\" title=\"The Realm of Zot\">the Realm of Zot</a>. That place is just too unpredictable, particularly for casters, who may find themselves surrounded by foes and out of energy, with nowhere to go.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time:

guide assumes that you want to win relying on high-end [[Conjurations]] spells, getting you to a 15 rune victory (including [[Ziggurat]]s) with a highly survivable character.\n\n==Why a [[Gargoyle]] [[Wizard]]?==\nIt seemed too good to be true when 0.13 introduced the [[Gargoyle]] – there never has been a character remotely as survivable as this one. And all of this you get in exchange for – almost nothing! Sure, the [[HP]] are somewhat low, but otherwise the Gargoyle brings along formidable stats for melee fighting and decent offensive magic. Indeed the Gargoyle is the first character that got me to a 15-rune victory. The Gargoyle [[Wizard]] even let me clear out my first Ziggurat together with the 15 runes.\n\n[[Poison]] immunity, [[electricity]] resistance, [[negative energy|rN]]+, [[torment]] resistance and immunity to [[rot]]ting eliminate or at least soften some of the most pesky threats a player must face during the game, on top of the mid-game ability to [[fly]] permanently. Then add the amazing [[AC]] and [[GDR]] bonus, and you have a character that, if carefully played, can handle all situations the game throws at you. Having all these resistances allows you to pile on other resistances and lots of [[INT]], without any headaches about choosing which slink in your armour you have to leave open to your enemies’ attacks.\n\nGargoyles’ base stats allow you to go for the big offensive spells – as a wizard you start out with 18 intelligence, and none of the other stats below 8. That means that you can pour every stat increase into further intelligence, which will get you (together with the uncontrolled stat increases) around or even above 30 by the time you reach XL 27. Add then the odd INT brands on armour or [[jewellery]], and you have high-powered end-game spells with little or no hunger cost. But this does not leave you a glass cannon, such as [[Deep Elves]] or [[Spriggan]]s – you do all this with AC way above 40, even wearing a [[large shield]], with obscenely high SH rates!\n\nAs an illustration, you may want to look at [[Majang's Gargoyle Wizard of Vehumet Diary]] for a somewhat unlucky specimen of this build, which in spite of very poor equipment made it beyond [[Zot]]:5, even clearing out [[Cocytus]] before getting killed in [[Dis]]:7.\n\n==Basic strategy outline==\nYou start out as a pure caster, switching off almost all skills until your [[Magic Dart]] reaches #### power. This should happen pretty soon, and then you start your transformation into a versatile hybrid fighter/caster. While you develop your Conjurations, [[Fire Magic]] and [[Air Magic]] skills (yes, Air Magic, in spite of Gargoyle’s apparent weakness here), you also get your defensive skills up, and pick a weapon category. My weapon of choice would be an air or fire elemental [[magical staff]], as these are one-handed and do not interfere with a [[shield]]. Until you find one, you may want to use a two-handed [[quarterstaff]] without a shield, or use [[Maces & Flails]] which cross-train with [[staves]].\n\nDuring the mid-to-late game, when you already have decent melee and defensive skills, you again start focusing on your attack magic skills, until you get [[Fire Storm]] online, and not much later [[Tornado]]. When these two spells work for you ([[Vehumet]] will help considerably with that), you can tackle any branch of the game, with a few equipment changes here or there.\n\nBut let’s look into all these factors in detail!\n\n==Details of this character==\n===Background choice===\nWizard is not a recommended background for gargoyles. You probably have a safer early game by going straight for a [[Fire Elementalist]]: the advantage would be guaranteed access early on to [[Sticky Flame]] and [[Fireball]]. As wizard you’ll have to do without these spells for longer than you might care for. On the plus side you have considerably more intelligence, and also spells to deal with these pesky [[crimson imp]]s, to which Fire Elementalists don’t really have an answer. Hopefully luck or Vehumet will fill your spell gaps soon. The wizard spell book also contains [[Mephitic Cloud]], which has the double benefit of making your early game a lot more survivable, and of getting you access to the Air Magic spell school, which will become quite important for you.\n\n===God choice===\nHere, too, there are other options, or at least one other option, [[Cheibriados]]. His amazing stat bonuses make you extremely powerful after a very short time. The downside to this deity is not so much the speed penalty, but the lack of [[MP]] restoration and the lack of guaranteed access to [[Fire Storm]] and even [[Tornado]], the two spells around which your end-game revolves. In case these don’t materialize before you enter places like [[Zot:5]] or [[Vaults]]:5, your irresistible melee capacity may compensate for this somewhat, but I still prefer to be able to rely on the late-game nukes when I need them.\n\nOutside of Chei, Vehumet would be the only god I’d consider for the character. His spell gifts (you are likely to get Fire Storm and/or Tornado as his final spell gifts), coupled with his MP restoration and spell aid abilities, make him the logical choice for a gargoyle wizard. Since you can add each stat increase exclusively to intelligence, you will not need Chei’s stat boosts to reach the intelligence levels you need to cast the high-end spells.\n\n===Weapon choice===\nAs a gargoyle wizard, you will probably dispose of most of your enemies by attack spells, but once in a while you may find it useful to swing a weapon to do this. Gargoyle’s weapon of choice is a [[mace]], [[whip]] or [[flail]], but you also have a good aptitude for staves. You may find a [[quarterstaff]] long before you find your first [[buckler]], and that may already give you the opportunity to train the [[Staves]] skill. But you really hope to find a staff of fire or a staff of air. Since you are training these two spell schools throughout the game, and to pretty high levels, and you are training evocations, the originally timid +5,+5 staff turns into a devastating weapon with its additional elemental damage output. Train a few levels of Staves (up to 12), and you can swing your staff as nimbly as Gandalf in ''The Return of the King''. It may be worth trying to get a staff through a [[scroll of acquirement]]; even if it is not an elemental staff, it will be something useful, such as a [[staff of energy]] or [[staff of wizardry|wizardry]]. If you have trained some levels of [[Maces & Flails]], however, the scroll may provide you with some rather useless rods.\n\nIf you find a [[buckler]] early on, and don’t have the one-handed staff you need, you can settle for a good mace, flail, [[morningstar]], or (if you're lucky) [[eveningstar]], and train the appropriate skill. This then cross-trains with staves when you can finally switch.\n\n===Armour choice===\nYou have a good shields aptitude, and it would be a pity to let this go to waste. When you find a buckler, use it! You will need a skill of 5 to use it without penalty, but don’t stop there! With a skill of 15, you can use a regular shield, but even much earlier the penalty will not stop you from using any of your spells, until you get to the level 9 spells. I usually go all the way to using large shields, but you may find some amazing [[artefact]] smaller shield, and that may be a good reason to save you the experience investment needed for using large shields.\n\nThe most useful main body armor for you is probably the [[mottled dragon armour]]. It barely affects your spell casting, but gives you 12 AC when fully enchanted. A [[swamp dragon armour]] is comparable in AC, but its brand is useless to you. [[Fire dragon armour|Fire]] or [[ice dragon armour]] have useful brands, but they require you to invest quite a lot into [[Armour skill]] before you can use them comfortably. Anything beyond that will be too heavy for you. In any case, the mottled dragon armor will give you a whopping 42 % GDR. You may still want to train some Armour skill levels for it, but can stop at about 6 or so. Unfortunately, it may be quite a while before you find a [[mottled dragon hide]] (in one game I did not find a single one until the end), so any other light armor will have to do until this happy moment. If you are lucky, you’ll find some nice artefact [[leather armour]] or [[ring mail]]. Don’t throw them away just because they may be negatively enchanted – with your massive AC boost you can afford to let go of a few points here, if it gives you some nice [[intrinsic]]s instead.\n\n===Spells to learn===\nFrom the starting spell book you learn [[Repel Missiles]], [[Conjure Flame]] and [[Mephitic Cloud]]. These will get you into the Fire and Air Magic spell schools, and provide you with the firepower to make it through the game until Vehumet gifts you more potent Conjurations spells. Mephitic Cloud is particularly useful against [[ogre (monster)|ogres]] and [[orc priest]]s, who can otherwise be serious threats for you. You will want to get Fire and Air spells as soon as possible, particularly [[Airstrike]], [[Sticky Flame]] and [[Fireball]]. With this under your belt, you will make it through [[the Lair]], the [[Orcish Mines]], and the two Lair side [[branch]]es. Although you have a very good aptitude for [[Earth Magic]], you should leave this alone until much later. One of your keys to success later on is the Tornado, which in combination with Fire Storm clears out any concentration of bad guys, including the worst of the [[Hell]]s, [[Pandemonium]], and the [[Ziggurat]]s. [[Shatter]] just isn’t half as useful, and [[Lehudib's Crystal Spear]] only hits single targets at a very high cost. You can actually get LCS later on with pretty low skill investment, once Conjurations and [[Spellcasting]] are maxed out (but that will be very late in the game).\n\nOther useful spells: [[Blink]] (already in your starting spell book), [[Apportation]], [[Bolt of Fire]], [[Orb of Destruction]] (you will need this against dangerous [[unique]]s such as [[Boris]], [[Mara]] or [[Norris]]), and [[Regeneration]]. Later on you may want to replace Repel Missiles with [[Deflect Missiles]].\n\n===Skill management===\nIn the beginning, your starting spells are rather pathetic, and you need to work particularly at Conjurations and Spellcasting to make them more powerful. When your Magic Dart reaches #### in spell power, you need to branch out broadly to train all the following skills: [[Fighting]] (maybe initially up to 6 before switching it off again), your melee weapon skill to what it takes to reach minimum delay for your weapon of choice (12 for a staff), Armour (up to 6 if you are aiming for a mottled dragon armor), [[Dodging]] (initially up to 10 or so), Fire Magic and Air Magic (never switch those off), and [[Evocations]] (up to 10 initially). Don’t ever train [[Stealth]] (you won’t be stealthy, forget it), and leave all non-elemental magic skills except Conjurations switched off. What you need here, you get through your Spellcasting skill.\n\nOnce you have cleared out the Lair, the Orcish Mines and the other Lair branches, it is again time to focus on your magic skills. Switch off all the support skills (except if you still have to train some Armour or Shield skill to eliminate casting penalties), and focus on Spellcasting, Conjurations, Fire Magic and Air Magic until you can cast Fire Storm and Tornado with good reliability. Use enhancer staves or jewellery, and if you have to, drink [[potions of brilliance]] before a big fight.\n\nIn the end-game, you may max out some of your skills. Train Fighting, Armour, Shields and Dodging instead – these will all increase your survivability in the late game branches. The most important of them will be Fighting, as the HP increase will help you against the irresistible damage of late-game [[hellfire]]. If you are so inclined, you may also want to dip into [[Necromancy]] to use some of those spells. I like to then go into [[Earth Magic]], giving me other options to make some [[pan lord]]s keel over.\n\n===What can kill you===\nAs long as you do not attract too many enemies at once, you should be pretty safe in almost all situations. But there are some monsters which can be lethal even for you gargoyle: In the beginning those are [[orc priest]]s, whose [[smite]] attacks don’t care about your armour protection. A few of those encountered at the same time can kill you fast. Use [[Mephitic Cloud]] against them, then run. [[Confused]] orc priests don’t smite! Later on you need to fear the following: [[unseen horror]]s are fast and eat quickly through your armour - try to find a source for [[see invisible]] before you get too deep into the dungeon; uniques ([[Wiglaf]], [[Mara]], [[Norris]], and their likes) can easily overpower you. Monsters with [[Earth Magic]] spells such as [[Shatter]] or [[Lee's Rapid Deconstruction]] find a particularly soft target in you. Kill them fast! And finally, [[hellfire]] can burn through your [[HP]] in no time at all. When you see hellfire-capable monsters, prioritize them quickly, as you have no protection whatsoever against them, except killing them before they kill you.\n\nYour [[torment]] resistance, and your immunity against [[rot]]ting allow you to spend more time in the [[hell]]s than other characters. You may want to explore all the levels to collect the experience. But you do need a [[ring of sustain attributes]], or you may end up with [[stat zero]] in very inopportune places.\n\nAnd you may also want to avoid getting yourself into [[the Abyss]], unless you are really, really strong. I would not volunteer to go there before I'm ready to enter [[the Realm of Zot]]. That place is just too unpredictable, particularly for casters, who may find themselves surrounded by foes and out of energy, with nowhere to go.\n\n[[Category:Character guides]]"}

It can only bring creatures to within a three-square radius of the caster, so don't expect to pull entire armies into cramped hallways. In an open area (at least 7-by-7, with the caster in the middle), it can recall at most 48 creatures.\n\nThis spell will also recall zombies created by the [[Animate Dead]] spell, but only if the caster is on the same floor that they were created. Zombies will not be recalled across different floors.\n\n==History==\n*The player spell was removed in [[0.26]]. [[Beogh]], [[Hepliaklqana]], and [[Yredelemnul]] still have recall abilities for their specific minions.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], it was impossible to recall flying monsters over [[lava]] or [[deep water]].\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

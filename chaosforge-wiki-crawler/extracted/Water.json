{"title":"Water","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Water","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\nThere are several occurrences of '''water''' in Crawl:\n\n* [[Shallow water]], a type of terrain which randomly slows the actions of most species, and a home for [[aquatic]] and [[amphibious]] creatures. \n* [[Deep water]], a type of terrain that is deadly to most species, with the exception of aquatic, amphibious, and [[Size#Giant|giant]] monsters.\n\n[[Flight]] allows all species (and monsters) to ignore the effects of both water tiles. [[Size#Large|Large]] creatures move and attack normally in shallow water; [[Size#Giant|Giant]] creatures can also wade in deep water.\n\nIn addition, there are numerous things such as [[steam]], [[ice]], [[mist]], and [[Primal Wave]] that are forms of water, though not floor tiles.  These are all covered on their own pages.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Phial of floods]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.24]], followers of [[Fedhas]] could convert dungeon floor into water by using the Rain ability. Also, they could remove shallow and deep water tiles via the Sunlight ability.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], the player could convert floor tiles into water by drawing the [[Water card]]."}

This frees up [[spell level]]s, allowing you to memorise other spells. The spell remains in your [[spell memorisation|spell library]], so you can relearn it if so desired.\n\n==Strategy==\nScrolls of amnesia can be essential to casters. It lets you learn an early game spell, say, [[Searing Ray]], then forget it once it's no longer useful. Or, it can let you forget a useful spell to get a better one. They serve no combat purpose, so you don't need to keep them in your inventory.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*You may press  '''Esc''' after reading to cancel the scroll's effect. If you've already identified the scroll, it won't be used.\n*Even worshippers of [[Sif Muna]] might find these scrolls useful, because the Forget Spell ability costs piety.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], it was possible to forget spells by destroying [[spell book]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], forgetting spells would restore [[MP]] equal to the spell's level, and the scroll would only identify if you knew a spell to forget.\n\n{{scrolls}}"}

{"title":"Monstrous Menagerie","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Monstrous_Menagerie","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Monstrous Menagerie''' is a level 7 [[Summonings|Summoning]] spell which summons an exotic, ranged creature.\n\n==Useful Info==\nOne beast is summoned. Possible summons include:\n*{{monsterlink|Manticore}}\n*{{monsterlink|Lindwurm}}\n*{{monsterlink|Sphinx}}\n\nHigher [[spell power]] increases a chance to summon a [[sphinx]], and boosts the strength of the creature. \n*Chance of a sphinx is equal to <code>(1 - 61 / <power>) / 2</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-summoning.cc|233}}</ref> Otherwise, there's an equal chance of a manticore or lindwurm.\n*Summoned monsters gain from 0 to 6 additional [[HD]] based on spell power. The summon gains <code>(<power> - 50) / 25</code> HD, rounded in a weighted fashion.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-summoning.cc|241}}</ref>\n\nDuration of the summons is around 36 turns; it does not depend on the spell power.\n\nThere is a summon limit of 2; additional summons will cause the oldest to very quickly time out.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe most standard of the level 7 Summonings spells. All monsters from this spell can attack from range, a distinct advantage compared to the lower level summons. Having a summon cap of 2 is also nice.\n\n==Monster Version==\nThe monster version functions like the player version, except no HD bonus is given to the summoned creatures.\n\n{{monsters with spell}}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Monstrous Menagerie had a summon cap of 4.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Monstrous Menagerie could summon 1-3 harpies.\n*Prior to [[0.22]], for followers of [[Dithmenos]], lindwurms were replaced by manticores.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], Monstrous Menagerie was a level 6 spell.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], this spell was found in the [[Book of Beasts]] and [[Book of Summonings]], but not the [[Grand Grimoire]].\n*Prior to [[0.16]], this spell had a summon cap of 5.\n*Monstrous Menagerie was added in [[0.14]].\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

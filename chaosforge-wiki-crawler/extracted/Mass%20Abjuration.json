Affected monsters have their remaining duration in this world drastically reduced; if this reduces the duration to zero or less, the monster is unsummoned entirely. Casting it at higher [[spell power]] reduces enemy duration to a greater extent. Be aware that summoned enemies visible through transparent [[wall]]s are unaffected by this spell.\n\nA weaker version of this spell, [[Abjuration]], is a level 3 Summonings spell that affects a single targeted creature.\n\n==Monster Version==\nStrictly speaking, there is no distinct monster-version of the Mass Abjuration spell. Instead, all high-level monster-version Summonings spells have an ''inherent'' 33% chance of a Mass Abjuration effect that ''replaces'' the effect of the previously intended spell. (This replacement only occurs if there are valid summons, hostile to the monster, in its [[LOS]].) The high-level Summonings spells which have this inherent Mass Abjuration are:\n*[[Summon Demon]]\n*[[Summon Greater Demon]]\n*[[Summon Drakes]]\n*[[Summon Elemental|Summon Water Elemental]]\n*[[Summon Iron Elemental]]\n*[[Shadow Creatures]]\n*[[Summon Ugly Thing]]\n*[[Summon Scorpions]]\n*[[Summon Mushrooms]]\n*[[Summon Caniforms]]\n*[[Summon Eyes|Summon Eyeballs]]\n*[[Summon Dragon]]\n*[[Summon Hydra]]\n*[[Fire Summon]]\n<!-- *[[Summon Holies]] (Blessed toes not implemented yet)-->\n<!-- *[[Summon Greater Holy]] (NOT USED BY ANY MONSTER YET) -->\n\n==History==\nPlayer Mass Abjuration was removed in [[0.14]], with [[Aura of Abjuration]] taking its place.\n\nPrior to [[0.14]], monsters had a 50% chance of casting Mass Abjuration instead of summoning.\n\nPrior to [[0.10]], only the level 3 Abjuration spell existed, and it had the effect of the current Mass Abjuration spell.\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

Instead, they can make a gaze attack against you, irresistibly draining 5-17 [[MP]], healing themselves in the process.\n\nThey are quite rare outside eye-infested vaults or the [[Slime Pits]]. But you may encounter them in midgame from Dungeon:8 downwards.\n\n==Spells==\n\n{{Spellcaster1\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Draining Gaze]]\n|flags1={{Magical slot flag}}\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*A spellcaster meeting an eye of draining may wish to immediately cast his most powerful spells in an attempt to quickly overwhelm it. The MP would be devoured anyway, so there's no sense in being frugal.\n*While largely harmless for melee-based characters, remember to re-assess the priority in which you target them should you find such a character relying upon an [[amulet of guardian spirit]].\n\n==History==\n*Eyes of draining were removed in [[0.27]]."}

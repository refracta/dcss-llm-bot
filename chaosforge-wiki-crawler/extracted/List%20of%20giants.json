{"title":"List of giants","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_giants","type":"raw","data":"{{version|031}}\n'''Giants''' are enormous humanoids who rely primarily on brute force, but often have powerful ranged attacks as well. Although their immense size allows them to endure heavy abuse before falling, they have terrible [[ev]]asion and are generally easy to hit. Several subspecies of giant inhabit the lower portions of the [[Dungeon]], growing more common in the [[Vaults]] and the [[Depths]].\n\n==Giant Types==\n{{monsterlink|Cyclops}} - Slow, territorial agrarian giants, they protect their herds of [[dream sheep]] and [[yak]]s by viciously hurling boulders at their foes.\n\n{{monsterlink|Ettin}} - A larger and stronger version of the [[two-headed ogre]]. Will happily crush wandering adventurers into paste with its two massive weapons.\n\n{{monsterlink|Fire giant}} - Incendiary hulks armed with [[flaming]] [[great sword]]s that can roast you at any distance with their [[fireball]]s.\n\n{{monsterlink|Frost giant}} - Like fire giants, but cooler and with [[battleaxe]]s.\n\n{{monsterlink|Stone giant}} - These monstrous creatures have the strength of mountains and hurl powerful bolts of earth at you (they're really just [[large rock]]s).\n\n{{monsterlink|Titan}} - A divine giant which has developed mastery over storm magic.\n\n{{monsterlink|Iron giant}} - Exceptionally huge giants that can [[Throw Ally|throw their allies at you]] or [[Harpoon Shot|bring you to their allies]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Tainted leviathan}} - [[Undead]] giants cursed to roam [[Tartarus]] for eternity. They can [[mesmerise|force foes to stay close]], forcing you into their rotting miasma clouds.\n\n{{monsterlink|Juggernaut}} - A swift-moving and extremely powerful giant that must rest after each colossal punch.\n\n{{monsterlink|Protean progenitor}} - Ancient shapeless beings that were the precursors of [[shapeshifter]]s. Will [[irradiate]] you and split into various monsters upon death.\n\n{{monsterlink|Cactus giant}} - Desert-dwelling giants that can be [[Summon Cactus Giant|summoned]] to the [[Dungeon]]. They might not be particularly strong or swift of blows, but their [[spiny|spines]] are quite painful.\n\n===Uniques===\n{{monsterlink|Polyphemus}}- An exceptionally successful cyclops shepherd; only he knows the secret to taming [[death yak]]s and [[catoblepas|catoblepae]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Antaeus}}- The largest giant of them all, Antaeus rules as demon lord over the icy realm of [[Cocytus]].\n\n{{monsterlink|Chuck}}- A unique stone giant found only in [[Dungeon Sprint]]; notable for his large rock of [[chaos]] and his stylish [[hat]].\n\n===Retired Giants===\n{{monsterlink|Hill giant}} - The smallest of the giants, they were barely enormous, but still packed a punch with their [[giant club]]s. Removed in [[0.20]].\n\n{{monsterlink|The Iron Giant}}- A massive, rusting hulk that called [[iron elemental]]s to his aid. Found only in Dungeon Sprint. Was converted into a [[iron giant|normal enemy]] in [[0.18]].\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

{"title":"Fire Magic","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fire_Magic","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n\nThe '''Fire Magic''' school determines how easily you can manipulate fire. \n\nFire magic focuses almost single-mindedly on dealing direct damage to enemies; most fire spells are also [[Conjurations]], though a few spells offer slightly more subtlety. Practitioners should have no difficulty due to a lack of firepower, whether they be single targets or large groups. Damage from Fire Magic is generally reduced by [[fire resistance]].\n\n{{skill aptitudes}}\n\n{{spell table by level|Fire}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{spell sources|Fire|Book of Annihilations,Book of Fire,Book of Flames,Book of Scorching,Everburning Encyclopedia}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Most Fire spells aren't weaker against foes standing in [[water]] - they're stronger. When fiery beams pass over water, they create [[steam]] clouds, which deal extra damage. Steam can also be used to block [[line of sight]]. (The exception is [[Sticky Flame]], which gets extinguished by water.)\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Fire Elementalist]]\n\n==History==\n*[[0.30]] added [[Plasma Beam]] and [[Volatile Blastmotes]], removed [[Conjure Flame]].\n*[[0.28]] added [[Scorch]] and [[Flame Wave]].\n*[[0.26]] removed [[Ring of Flames]].\n*[[0.25]] removed [[Flame Tongue]], [[Throw Flame]], and [[Bolt of Fire]] as part of the spell rework, adding [[Foxfire]] and in return [[Starburst]].\n\n{{Skills}}\n\n[[Category:Fire Magic|*]]\n[[Category:Magic skills]]"}

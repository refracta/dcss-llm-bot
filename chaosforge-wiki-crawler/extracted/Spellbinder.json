Antimagic hinders the casting of magical opponents, including [[silence]]-immune creatures like [[demon]]s and [[orbs of fire]]. On top of that, the miscasts cause additional damage, which more than makes up for its lower enchantment.\n\nIt doesn't do anything special against mundane opponents or those with [[god|divine abilities]]. For them, Spellbinder is a +5 demon whip that lowers your max MP: decent, but a regular demon whip or [[eveningstar]] is better. Overall, you'll want another weapon for 'general' use, but Spellbinder is a great swap for its antimagic.\n\nAs an [[evil]] weapon, worshipers of the [[good gods]] will be penalized if they attack with it.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], miscast effects in general were different. Some effects could harm creatures other than their target.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Spellbinder's enchantment level was +3, +6.\n*\"Spellbinder\" was added in [[0.14]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Maces & Flails]]"}

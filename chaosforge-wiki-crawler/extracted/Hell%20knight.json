As humans, they aren't vulnerable to [[holy wrath]] or resistant to [[negative energy]], though they are immune to fire. Hell knights usually travel in packs. Their appearance often signifies the presence of [[Margery]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Even characters specialized in melee combat should try not to face more than one at a time. Hell Knights often carry powerful [[brand]]ed weapons, and they can cast [[Bolt of Fire]] through each other.\n*Fire resistance will help keep you from being roasted at range.\n*Make sure to check out their gear; demonic weapons are very common.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], they could have one of two possible spell sets:\n**[[Pain]] (d14), [[Bolt of Fire]] (3d18), and [[Blink]]\n**[[Pain]] (d14), [[Throw Flame]] (3d8), and [[Haste]]\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

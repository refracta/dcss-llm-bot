{"title":"Dispater","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dispater","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Dispater''' is a [[demon]] lord who wields the [[Orb of Dispater]] and guards of the iron [[rune]] on the last floor of [[the Iron City of Dis]]. As the iron lord, Dispater can cast brutal [[Earth Magic]], use [[damnation]], and summon waves of [[hell sentinel]]s. Dispater is usually accompanied by [[hell sentinel]]s, [[ice fiend]]s, [[brimstone fiend]]s, and/or [[cacodemon]]s.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Like with many hell lords, explore the outside of the rune chamber before entering.  There will be plenty of reinforcements wandering around, and if you can take them out before the fight, the fight be much less brutal.\n*Dispater, like any demon lord, is someone you want to kill as quickly as possible. The summons can get out of control, though.\n*Though not very useful in the rest of Dis, [[cold resistance]] is helpful here, as ice fiends deal terrifying amounts of damage without it.\n\n==Trivia==\nOriginally a chthonic god of riches, fertile agricultural land and underground mineral wealth, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dis_Pater Dis Pater] was later commonly equated with the Roman deities Pluto and Orcus, becoming an underworld deity. His form in ''Crawl'' was likely inspired by the villainous Dispater found in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispater_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons) Dungeons and Dragons].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Dispater had 40 base AC, but wielded the [[staff of Dispater]] instead of the [[orb of Dispater]]. (The orb of Dispater gives +5 AC when wielded). Also, they were immune to fire and cold damage, but not acid.\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Dispater used [[Summon Greater Demon]] instead of [[Summon Hell Sentinel]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Dispater was considered male."}

{"title":"Player ghost","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Player_ghost","type":"raw","data":"{{version029}}\n{{flavour|The apparition of an unfortunate adventurer.}}\n\nA '''player ghost''' is generated when your character dies, unless your character is [[undead]] or you die in one of the following areas: [[Dungeon]] level 1 or 2, the [[Ecumenical Temple]], [[the Abyss]], a [[Wizard Laboratory]], or the [[Desolation of Salt]]<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|ghost.cc|878}}</ref>.\n\n==Ghost Vaults==\nAll player ghosts spawn locked inside ghost [[vault]]s, which can only appear in the following branches:<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|dat/des/variable/ghost.des|63}}</ref>\n*[[Dungeon]], except for Dungeon:1-2\n*[[Lair]]\n*[[Orcish Mines]]\n*[[Elven Halls]]\n*[[Swamp]], [[Shoals]], [[Snake Pit]], and [[Spider's Nest]]\n*[[Vaults]]\n*[[Depths]]\n*[[Crypt]]\n*[[Zot]]\n\nEach of these floors has a 10% chance to spawn a ghost vault, which contains one or more ghosts from a player that previously died on that floor and possibly other monsters defined by that specific vault. Ghost vaults will never spawn on floors with floor-wide \"encompass\" vaults, such as Vaults:5. \nA variety of different ghost vaults exist, which can be found in the [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crawl/crawl/master/crawl-ref/source/dat/des/variable/ghost.des ghost.des] file of the source.\n\nThese ghost vaults also often contain loot, dependent on how far into the dungeon the vault generates and the difficulty of the vault's monsters. The monsters and loot are always found behind either a [[transporter]] or [[runed door]], and will be visible through transparent walls, allowing the player to make an informed decision about when they wish to tackle the vault.\n\nPlayer ghosts can also spawn in a [[Ziggurat]] negative energy floor, though out and about rather than in a vault.\n\n===Ghost Selection===\nWhen a ghost vault is generated, up to five ghosts are placed (depending on the vault). These ghosts are selected as follows:\n*If there is an available ghost file for that floor, from a previous death on the same installation (offline) or the same online server, use that ghost file. If the player subsequently kills this ghost, the ghost file is deleted.\n*Otherwise, if there is a ghost file available for that branch in the \"permastore\", use that ghost file. The permastore consists of a number of generic ghosts that were initially taken from deaths on some online servers in 0.22 â€” ghosts generated from the permastore always have randomly generated names. The permastore stores ghosts by branch, not by floor.\n*In extremely rare cases, if no ghost is available from the ghost files for that floor or permastore for that branch, use a clone of the player with the properties described in the below Ghost Properties section. If this happens, the ghost's description will include the text, \"It looks just like you. Spooky...\".\n\n==Ghost Properties==\nWhen your ghost is created, its stats are defined as follows:\n\n*Its max [[HP]], [[AC]] and [[EV]] are equal to yours when you died.\n*Its number of [[hit dice]] is equal to your experience level.\n*Its [[cold]], [[fire]], and [[electricity]] resistances are equal to yours when you died.\n*It becomes [[undead]], gaining immunity to [[poison]], [[negative energy]], and [[torment]], as well as vulnerability to [[holy]] attacks and [[Dispel Undead]].\n*It becomes [[insubstantial]], gaining immunity to [[constriction]] and [[Sticky Flame]].\n*If you were able to see invisible, so can the ghost.\n*Its base speed is equal to 10, regardless of the [[species]] you were playing.\n*Its damage is determined by the weapon you were wielding and your skill levels:\n**If you had a weapon in hand, the base damage is equal to the weapon's base damage, increased by 4% per skill level you had for this weapon. In addition, the attacks will have the weapon's brand (unless you were wielding a weapon of [[chaos]], in which case no brand will be used).\n**If you had no weapon in hand, the base damage is 4 plus your [[Unarmed Combat]] skill, plus your experience level if you were a Troll.\n**This base damage is then increased by 3.3% per level of [[Fighting]] skill, then increased by 0.25 times your Strength. Total base damage is capped at 50.\n*If you knew spells, the ghost will be able to cast some of your spells as per the algorithm below.\n\nThe experience level of a ghost is indicated in their description with one of the following adjectives:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n!Ghost description\n!Experience level\n|-\n|weakling\n|1 to 3\n|-\n|amateur\n|4 to 6\n|-\n|novice\n|7 to 10\n|-\n|journeyman\n|11 to 15\n|-\n|adept\n|16 to 21\n|-\n|veteran\n|22 to 25\n|-\n|master\n|26\n|-\n|legendary\n|27\n|}\n\n===Spell Selection===\nPlayer ghosts copy spells from the player if a monster version of the spell exists and the spell isn't flagged as a non-ghost spell. The chance of a ghost having a spell is based off the player's [[spell success]] rate: <code>([50-failure]/50)^2</code>. For example, a spell with a 20% fail rate is ([50 - 20]/50)^2, which is 900/2500 or a 36% chance of being added to your ghost. A spell with a 0% fail rate will always be added, while spells above 50% chance of failure cannot be added. Player ghosts can learn any number of spells in this way.\n\nAdditionally some spells change slightly when learned by player ghosts: [[Dragon's Call]] will change to [[Summon Dragon]] and [[Swiftness]] will change to [[Sprint]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nGhost vaults and the player ghosts within them can be extremely dangerous, often on a par with the most dangerous [[unique]]s for a given dungeon depth. There are a number of strategies for dealing with them:\n* First and foremost, don't open the runed door/enter the transporter of a ghost vault until you are ready to fight the ghost(s) and other enemies in the vault. Once you open the door, you will have to deal with the ghost, who like normal monsters can follow you through [[transporter]]s or [[stairs]]. You can always come back to a ghost vault later in the game to retrieve the loot when you have much better HP, equipment and damage.\n* You can e'''x'''amine the ghost to get its species, class, HP, defenses, resistances, damage, weapon brand and spells before you enter the vault. This will help you decide how difficult the ghost will be to fight, and to weigh up when it is safe to enter the vault.\n* If you have it, [[Dispel Undead]] will make short work of ghosts, bypassing their defenses entirely. This can be particularly useful against later ghosts, who will often have much higher defenses than most monsters. Some ghost vaults are also themed around undead; the other enemies in these vaults can also be made significantly easier with this spell.\n* Look at the loot in the vault to see whether it could be worth it to use a consumable or two to fight the ghost vault. If there's a scroll of acquirement or [[artefact]] weapon or armour that you really want in it, it could be worth it to enter the ghost vault prematurely and use a few consumables to fight it. If, on the other hand, there's just a few stones and useless items in the vault, it's a lot less likely to be worth entering anytime soon.\n* You can check the morgue of the dead character if you wish to see exactly spells/abilities/defenses a ghost has.  On local games, just search through your /morgue folder to find it; on public servers, you can usually use one of the IRC bots to find the morgue.\n* If you're worshipping [[Xom]], be very careful around ghost vaults with [[runed door]]s, as Xom is likely to open them if you approach them, letting the ghost out. Use the '''e'''xclusion tool if you need to.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.25]], there were no player ghost-themed floors in [[ziggurat]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.23]], followers of [[Elyvilon]] could pacify player ghosts.\n*[[0.22]] overhauled the ghost system. In previous versions, ghost vaults did not exist and player ghosts spawned unenclosed on floors, with a 33% chance to spawn a ghost on any valid floor with an available ghost file. This made ghosts much more common in the early dungeon and [[Lair]] than anywhere else, since most players die there and most ghost files are created in the early part of the game. Additionally, ghosts could not use stairs. No \"permastore\" of ghosts with random names existed, which meant that if no ghost files were available, no ghosts would generate. (This was most commonly the case on a fresh install of the offline game.)\n*Prior to [[0.21]], player ghosts' speed was affected by the player's species, and ghosts could wield chaos weapons.\n*Prior to [[0.20]], ghosts of adult [[draconian]]s had a [[draining]] breath weapon.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], [[Deep Dwarf]] player ghosts did not regenerate.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Featured_Article]]"}

{"title":"Will-o-the-wisp","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Will-o-the-wisp","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Will-o-the-wisps''' are intangible puffs of flames found primarily in the [[Swamp]]. Their [[Marshlight]] spell behaves exactly like [[Foxfire]] - it creates 2 foxfires, which quickly rush towards you, dealing damage on contact.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Having [[fire resistance]] is recommended, due Marshlight's high damage output. \n*Wisps have many resistances themselves, so elemental spells are less effective. If you rely on elemental spells, you can use [[Alternate items#Wands|bolt wands]] (wisps don't resist [[acid]]), a [[tin of tremorstones]], or irresistible spells like [[Airstrike]] to take them out.\n*Foxfires require an open path in order to hit you, so you can potentially use corridors and monsters to block it. Unfortunately, it's hard to take advantage of this quirk in the Swamp, which is very open.\n\n==History==\n*Will-o-the-wisps were added in [[0.26]]."}

{"title":"Shaft card","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shaft_card","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{flavour|The card depicts a traveler plummeting into a chasm that has opened beneath them.\nDrawing this card will create a shaft beneath the user, and possibly beneath their enemies.}}\n\nThe '''Shaft card''' creates a [[shaft]] beneath the player or a monster. The player has to stand on a floor tile, because the card  cannot create a shaft in [[water]] and beneath [[shop]]s, [[fountain]]s, or other [[dungeon features]]. The card has no effect on the final level of a branch, in single-floor branches, in the [[Abyss]], [[Hell]], [[Pandemonium]], or [[Ziggurat]]s; drawing it will only waste a turn.\n\nThe chance to shaft a hostile monster depends on the card's power, equal to <code><power> / 3</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.25.0|decks.cc|1039}}</ref> Note that the card can shaft all monsters in your [[line of sight]], even the [[invisible]] ones.\n\nIt could be found in the following [[Decks|decks]]:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n![[0.15]]\n![[0.16]]\n![[0.17]]\n![[0.18]]\n![[0.19]] and beyond\n|----\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of changes|Changes]]\n<br>[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n<br>[[Deck of wonders|Wonders]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of defence|Defence]]\n<br>[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n!style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-weight:normal\"|\n[[Deck of escape|Escape]]\n|----\n|}\n\n==History==\n*The Shaft card was removed in [[0.26]].\n*This card was one of 23 cards to be kept in the deck simplification of [[0.19]]; however, the deck of defence was removed in this version.\n*The Shaft card was added in [[0.15]] to replace the [[Flight card]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cards]]\n*[[Decks]]\n\n[[Category: Deck]]"}

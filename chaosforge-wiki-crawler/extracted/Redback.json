{"title":"Redback","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Redback","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{list of | arthropods}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Redbacks''' are wickedly venomous arachnids, capable of sending you from healthy to severely [[poison]]ed in a single bite. Poison resistance is only partially effective against their bites, reducing the poison effect but not negating it entirely. They are thankfully fairly fragile, but move very quickly and can deal decent damage with their bites even if you resist the poison. They can be found in the [[Spider's Nest]].\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Redbacks make it extremely easy to wind up in the dark red poisoned status. If you insist on exploring the Spider's Nest without poison resistance, bring [[potions of curing]] and try to shoot them down from a distance.\n\n==History==\nPrior to [[0.11]], redback venom was almost completely negated by poison resistance.\n\n[[Category:Arachnid]]"}

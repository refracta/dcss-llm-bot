{"title":"Briar patch","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Briar_patch","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Briar patches''' are short lived obstacles created by [[thorn hunter]]s and [[Fedhas]]' Wall of Briars ability. Although they won't attack you, briars are [[spiny]] - attacking them in melee causes you to take 5d4 damage. Like [[bush]]es, briars do not block ranged attacks. Briars created by thorn hunters will expire quickly after you kill their creator.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Ranged attacks and spells can be fired past briars. [[Penetration|Penetrating]] attacks can damage both the briar patch and thorn hunter at the same time. Keep in mind that monsters can also attack you through briars.\n*[[Reaching]] melee weapons can attack briars safely.\n\n==History==\n*Briar patches were added in [[0.14]]."}

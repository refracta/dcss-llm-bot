In a few branches, or when holding the [[Orb of Zot]], monsters will spawn over time. \n__NOTOC__\n==Useful Info==\nCertain areas have a monster generation rate (MGR). Every 5 turns, there is a <code>5 / MGR</code> chance of a monster spawning somewhere on the level; a higher value means a slower spawn rate. The monster will usually fit the branch it was spawned in. Depending on circumstance, monsters may be forced to spawn near the player.\n\nOutside of these areas, monster generation is disabled. This does not count [[summon]]s, [[doom hound]]s, or other effects.\n\n==Where Monsters Spawn==\n*[[Pandemonium]]: starts at 50. After 3k turns, it gradually rises until reaching 300 (at 15k turns).\n\n*[[Abyss]]: set to 5, so there is always a monster spawn every 5 turns.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-place.cc|284}}</ref>\n**From Abyss:1-5, there is a <code>Floor/5</code> chance that two monsters spawn.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|timed-effects.cc|293}}</ref> In Abyss:6, three monsters always spawn, and in Abyss:7, four monsters always spawn. Also, spawns in A:6-7 may be forced to spawn near you.\n\n*When holding the [[Orb of Zot]]: set to 18.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|mon-place.cc|287}}</ref> Monsters spawn near you, with a special monster set (see [[Orb of Zot#Monster Spawns]]). \n\nFor worshippers of [[Cheibriados]], the MGR in the Abyss or while holding the [[Orb of Zot]] is doubled (halving the spawn rate).\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.23]], the Orb run's spawn set was more likely to spawn weak monsters, but at a faster rate.\n*Prior to [[0.21]], most of the permanent branches in the [[Dungeon]] naturally spawned monsters over time. Spawns would turn [[out of depth]], mostly [[out-of-depth timer|after 3k turns]] have passed. Monster spawns stopped after 15k turns.\n*Orb run spawns were changed in [[0.13]]: the most notable additions were [[Orb Guardian]]s and [[list of eyeballs|eyeball monsters]].\n*Prior to [[0.6]], there was no [[out-of-depth timer|special function to create out of depth monsters]] when staying in one area.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Game mechanics]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]"}

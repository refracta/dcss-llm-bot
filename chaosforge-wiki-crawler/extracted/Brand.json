See the [[ego]] page for armour brands.''\n\n'''Brands''' are special properties that [[weapon]]s can have, granting the weapon additional effects. Usually, these effects amount to increasing the damage they deal, but others do exist.\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen looking at a ''+9'' broad axe ''of flaming'', the \"of flaming\" is the weapon's brand (and the \"+9\" is the [[enchant]]ment level). In general, brands are harder to change than enchantment.\n\nUnder no circumstances can a normal weapon have more than one brand. However, some [[unrand]]s, such as [[Maxwell's Thermic Engine]] and the [[storm bow]], have multiple.\n\nBrands are one of the biggest differences between [[Unarmed Combat]] and weaponry: without using a [[transformation]], unarmed fighters have no access to brands.\n\n===Sources===\n*Reading a [[scroll of brand weapon]] will give a weapon a randomly selected brand, replacing any existing brand if there is one.\n*All [[randart]]s are guaranteed to have a brand, and cannot have their brand modified.\n\n'''Divine'''\n*Worshipers of [[the Shining One]], [[Kikubaaqudgha]], and [[Lugonu]] can have one weapon \"blessed\" per game, which will apply the [[holy wrath]], [[Pain (brand)|pain]], or [[distortion]] brands, respectively.\n*Worshipers of [[Xom]] may randomly \"receive\" [[chaos]]-branded weapons. However, they often arrive in the hands of enemies in your [[line of sight]].\n\n==List of Brands==\n===Melee Weapons===\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0;\n!

Brand !! Description \n|-\n| [[Dispersal (brand)|Dispersal]] || [[Blink]]s the target when struck. Only appears on [[boomerang]]s.\n|-\n| [[Silver]] || Adds 30% extra damage to most monsters and roughly 75% more to [[:Category:Silver vulnerability|monsters weak to silver]].\n|}\n\nOnly [[boomerang]]s and [[javelin]]s can have brands; [[stone]]s and [[large rock]]s are all unbranded. (Exception: one of the [[Dungeon Sprint]] maps offers a large rock of chaos. Naturally, it's being used ''against'' you.).\n\nAdditionally, both boomerangs and javelins have inherent properties that act much like brands -- boomerangs have the [[returning]] property, while javelins have the [[penetration]] property.\n\n====Darts====\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin-left:0px; padding:0;\n!

The effectiveness of darts is based on both your [[Throwing]] and [[Stealth]] skills, and is resisted by monster [[hit dice]].\n*The chance of success is: <code>100 - 100 * (HD - 2) / (4 + pow)</code>, where <code>pow = (Throwing + Stealth) * 2 / 3</code>\n*There is an additional 3% chance of affecting any monster with 14 or lower HD\n*No darts can affect monsters that are [[undead]], [[nonliving]], or resistant to poison\n\nSome statistics: with no skill you’re still at 100% to succeed on monsters with HD1 or HD2 ([[gnoll (monster)|gnoll]], most D:1 monsters), 75% on HD3 ([[Sigmund]]), 50% on HD4 ([[Duvessa]]), and 25% on HD5 ([[ogre (monster)|ogre]]). With a combined skill of 6 as a starting [[Brigand]], you’re up to 62.5% on an ogre, or 50% on a [[yak]].\n\n==Strategy==\nSome brands are more desirable on certain weapons than others:\n*Brands like [[venom]], [[electrocution]], and [[pain (brand)|pain]] deal 'flat' damage. They are better on fast weapons, like [[demon whip]]s and [[quick blade]]s, as these weapons activate the brand more often.\n*Brands like [[flaming]], [[freezing]], and [[spectral]] deal percentage damage. A [[dagger]] of flaming receives the ''same +25% benefit'' as a [[giant club]] of flaming, even after you account for [[slaying]] and [[AC]]. (However, due to rounding error, the dagger receives a smaller boost on average.)\n**Do note that a dagger of venom is stronger than a dagger of flaming, since daggers are fast weapons with low base damage.\n\nAll added brand damage is calculated after AC reduction, and are not further reduced by AC.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], the [[vorpal]] brand (+16.7% average dmg) existed instead of [[heavy]]. Also, Ranged Weapons could have [[venom]] instead of [[draining]].\n*Prior to [[0.24]], throwing weapons could generate with the [[exploding]] and [[steel]] brands. Additionally, [[tomahawk]]s were reworked into [[boomerang]]s (which innately have the [[returning]] property), all [[javelin]]s were given the [[penetration]] property, [[blowgun]]s were removed and [[needle]]s were reworked into the new version of [[dart]]s, removing the [[confusion (brand)|confusion]], [[frenzy (brand)|frenzy]], and [[paralysis (brand)|paralysis]], and [[sleep (brand)|sleep]] brands. Silver gained the boost once given by steel.\n*Prior to [[0.18]], ranged weapon ammo could have brands, but they would be overridden by launcher brands other than Vorpal, Speed, or Penetration.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], drawing a [[Blade card]] would apply one of several temporary brands to your weapon.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], there was a [[reaching]] brand for [[whip]]s and [[demon whip]]s, allowing them to make reaching attacks.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], [[Polearms]] needed the reaching brand to make reaching attacks.\n*All needle types except \"poisoned\" were introduced in version [[0.6]].\n\n{{brands}}\n\n[[Category:Items]]\n[[Category:Weapons]]\n[[Category:Brands]]"}

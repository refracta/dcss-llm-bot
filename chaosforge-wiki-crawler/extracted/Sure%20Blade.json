It has no impact on any other weapon type. The size of this accuracy bonus is dependent on the remaining duration of the spell, which is determined by [[spell power]]. Casting it repeatedly will also extend the duration, however. While short blades are already very accurate, this is a fairly cheap spell, and missing less often means fewer turns wasted in combat. Sure Blade's effect ends immediately if you unwield the affected weapon for any reason.\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.17]] this spell was removed."}

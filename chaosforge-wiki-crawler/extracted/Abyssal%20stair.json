{"title":"Abyssal stair","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Abyssal_stair","type":"raw","data":"{{version026}}\n{{flavour|A strangely calm gateway amid the roiling landscape of the Abyss. It leads further into the depths of the Abyss.}}\n[[File:Abyssal stair.png]] '''Abyssal Stairs''' are a form of [[stair]]case unique to [[the Abyss]]. Functioning much like an [[escape hatch]], taking an Abyssal Stair down will send you one floor deeper into the Abyss, placing you in a random patch of the chaotic plane with no return staircase available.\n\n{{flavour|A gateway out of the Abyss, shimmering and shifting in the impermanent landscape.}}\n[[File:Abyss exit.png]] Taking an Abyssal Stair back up, however, will cause you to immediately exit the Abyss, no matter how deep in you were.\n\nThey can be found generated randomly in [[the Abyss]], but are also generated after the player gains a sufficient amount of [[experience]] in the Abyss.\n\nAs you can only find the abyssal [[rune of Zot]] on Abyss:3 or deeper, you'll want to seek these out while exploring the hellish terrain. The deeper you go, the higher the chance of finding the rune, but the monsters you face will get progressively more numerous and dangerous.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.18]] onward, both Abyssal Stairs and exits can appear after getting enough XP.\n*Abyssal Stairs were added in [[0.12]] when the Abyss became a multi-floor [[branch]], but they existed as a notorious practical joke in earlier versions of ''Crawl''. Supposedly, after spending 100,000 turns in the Abyss, a portal to the Abyssal Stair could be found. While the exact contents of this realm were never quite clear, most versions of the story involved unique bosses, [[rune]]s, and a secret entrance to [[the Realm of Zot]] at the very bottom. In reality, it merely made a lot of na√Øve players extremely bored and frustrated.\n\n[[Category:Dungeon Features]]"}

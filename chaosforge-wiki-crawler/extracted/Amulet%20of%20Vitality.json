Its greatest notoriety came from its use by the dread necromancer Borgnjor, who relied upon it to maintain her slender hold on life. After her final demise, the amulet vanished from the pages of history.}}\n[[File:Amulet_of_vitality.png]] '''''the amulet of Vitality'''''\n\n[[Amulet of regeneration|Regen]]++ (+1.6 HP/turn)<br>\n[[Amulet of magic regeneration|MPRegen]]++ (+0.8 MP/turn)<br>\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''amulet of Vitality'''<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|art-data.txt|1208}}</ref> is twice as powerful as a normal [[amulet of regeneration]] while also having the effect of two [[amulet of magic regeneration|amulets of magic regeneration]]. These are already strong amulets on their own, so having ''more'' of their effect is extremely respectable. While the increased MPRegen helps casters more, almost any character can appreciate a doubled regeneration amulet.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], this amulet was considered [[evil]].\n*Prior to [[0.29]], the amulet of Vitality had only Regen+ and HP+15, but no MPRegen. It was also not evil.\n*The amulet of Vitality was added in [[0.16]], replacing the [[ring of Vitality]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Amulets]]"}

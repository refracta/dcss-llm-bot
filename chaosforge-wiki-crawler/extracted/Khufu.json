{"title":"Khufu","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Khufu","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{list of|mummies}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Khufu the Undying Pharaoh''' is a [[unique]] mummy. He has all the spells of a [[royal mummy]], including [[Symbol of Torment]], with extra [[HP]], the ability to [[Blink]], and the worst [[death curse]] in the game. He is accompanied by an entourage of [[mummy (monster)|mummies]] and [[royal mummy|royal mummies]].\n\n==Location==\n*[[The Crypt]]\n*[[The Tomb]]\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Unless you manage to lure away individual mummies very carefully, you'll be facing an army of extremely dangerous monsters that can injure you no matter what you do. Bring as much torment resistance as you can get to avoid being decimated in the first few rounds. A [[scroll of blinking]] will help you get out of their [[line of sight]] quickly should everything start to fall apart.\n*A [[potion of lignification]] grants torment immunity, poison resistance for the scorpions, and a significant bonus to HP, but also renders you immobile. In the sorts of areas Khufu can be found, being unable to flee from dangerous opponents can be lethal. Try to use this strategy in an area you have already cleared, so reinforcements don't stumble upon you mid-fight, and most certainly do not lignify in the open where 8 enemies can surround you.\n*Try to lure Khufu into a narrow corridor (or better yet, a [[kill hole]], though you probably won't be able to create your own in the Crypt or Tomb). Doing so cuts down on the number of reinforcements he can call in, as well as how many of his entourage will be able to reach you.\n*Khufu is a good target for attacks that can bypass the front lines. Piercing attacks like [[javelin]]s or [[bolt spell]]s, smite-targeted attacks like [[Portal Projectile]] or some gods' [[Invocations]], [[Polearms]] to reach past his summons...\n**If you have a [[condenser vane]] and some Evocations training, this is the time to use it. Bathing Khufu's army in a sea of flames is best, but freezing clouds will at least soften them up a little. For those with extensive Evocations training, a blast of thunderclouds or especially [[acid]] will also prove effective (though poison and excruciating misery will be useless).\n*[[Silence]] stops up his spellcasting capabilities very effectively, assuming you can get close enough to him.\n*Upon killing him, you have a great chance to be [[slow]]ed or tormented. Beware of nearby undead!\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Khufu had the [[Tomb of Doroklohe]] instead of [[Blink]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Khufu had [[Summon Undead]] instead of [[Summon Scarabs]].\n\n[[Category:Mummy]]"}

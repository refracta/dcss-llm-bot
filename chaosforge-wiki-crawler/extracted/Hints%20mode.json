{"title":"Hints mode","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Hints_mode","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n'''Hints Mode''' is a version of ''Dungeon Crawl'' which gives tips every so often, helping newcomers play their first few games. It assumes you've played the [[tutorial]] (or read the manual), the former of which goes over controls and basic mechanics in a more controlled manner. Specifically, hints mode starts up a usual game of Crawl, with some alterations.\n\nCharacter selection is limited, consisting of 3 archetypes:\n*[[Hill Orc]] [[Berserker]] (Melee character, with [[Trog]] and a [[hand axe]])\n*[[Deep Elf]] [[Conjurer]] (Magic oriented character)\n*[[Minotaur]] [[Hunter]] (Ranged fighter, with a [[bow]])\n\nHints mode is rather simplistic; whenever you find an item, monster, or other interesting thing for the first time, the game will give you a few lines of text about it. It'll even give a hint if you die! A few [[skill]] menu-related options are also disabled for simplicity's sake. Otherwise, the game is generated just like a normal ''Crawl'' game; with the same difficulty and all. \n\nOnce you reach [[XL]] 7, you'll get 1 final hint, then hints mode ends. You'll then be left to playing a normal game all by yourself.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], [[Minotaur]] Berserker and [[Halfling]] Hunter were the melee and ranged characters, respectively.\n*Prior to [[0.26]], [[Centaur]] Hunter was the ranged character.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], hints mode was called the [[tutorial]]."}

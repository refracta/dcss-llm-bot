This effect has to overcome the target's [[magic resistance]] to succeed, but having a high [[Evocations]] skill will increase your odds of success. In general, this wand is best used to disable dangerous natural animals with low MR or to trick opponents into drowning in [[deep water]] or [[lava]] ([[orc knight]]s in the [[Bailey]], for example). It can have at most 48 charges.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nThe random behavior of a monster does not rule out the chance that it will randomly attack the tile you're in. Trying to stab a confused opponent in a one-tile hallway leaves it with a 50% chance of attacking you. Try to lure opponents into the open before confusing them if possible.\n\n==History==\nWands of confusion were removed in [[0.21]].\n\n{{wands}}"}

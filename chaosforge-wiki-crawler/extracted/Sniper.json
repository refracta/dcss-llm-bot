At 27 skill, you'll have a delay of 1.725 - this equates to a 75% of shooting at 1.7 turns, and 25% of shooting at 1.8. You'll also have a 34.5 base damage weapon enchanted to +27. For overall damage per turn, this is roughly equal to a +9 [[brand]]ed triple crossbow.\n\nAttacking slow comes with a big risk. For every bolt you shoot, enemies will often get 2 turns to move. Fast enemies, like [[orbs of fire]], can move thrice. Be wary of using this against especially fast enemies, or foes with dangerous ranged abilities. In dangerous situations, use [[potions of haste]] or [[Okawaru]]'s Finesse to speed up your shots as much as possible.\n\nOn the flip side, perfect accuracy is valuable against monsters with high EV, like [[list of spriggans|spriggans]] or [[Ereshkigal]]. If nothing else, you can use Sniper as a swapout. Like all weapons, it takes only 0.5 turn to swap from Sniper to a different ranged weapon.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Sniper was a +9 [[vorpal]] triple crossbow, with base delay 27. \n*Prior to [[0.18]], Sniper had an enchantment of +15 and lacked perfect accuracy.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Sniper was a standard [[crossbow (item)|crossbow]] with a +15 enchantment and the [[vorpal]] brand, but it was given a slower-than-normal rate of fire.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], Sniper had a +10,+0 enchantment level and the [[venom]] brand.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Crossbows]]"}

{"title":"ARCHIVED Nabalzbhf's Merfolk Ice Elementalist Guide","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/ARCHIVED_Nabalzbhf%27s_Merfolk_Ice_Elementalist_Guide","type":"markdown","data":"The following article is a [**character guide**](/Character_guides \"Character guides\"). This article contains advice from other players, which *may be subjective, outdated, inaccurate or ill-advised*. Read at your own risk and alter to fit your play style as necessary!\n\n***Version [0.15](/0.15 \"0.15\")**: This article **may not be** up to date for the [latest stable release](/0.32 \"0.32\") of Crawl.*\n\nIf you choose a [Merfolk](/Merfolk \"Merfolk\") [Ice Elementalist](/Ice_Elementalist \"Ice Elementalist\"), you get to play with a lot of different options. You're already an excellent melee fighter with your [Polearms](/Polearms \"Polearms\")/[Dodging](/Dodging \"Dodging\") aptitudes, but you also have [great](/Ozocubu%27s_Armour \"Ozocubu's Armour\") [buffs](/Condensation_Shield \"Condensation Shield\") for defense, a [summon](/Summon_Ice_Beast \"Summon Ice Beast\") for backup, and some [Conjuration](/Throw_Frost \"Throw Frost\") [spells](/Throw_Icicle \"Throw Icicle\") for dealing with enemies at a distance!\n\nIf you haven't already, read the [walkthrough](/Walkthrough \"Walkthrough\") and [strategy guides](/Strategy_guides \"Strategy guides\"). This guide assumes at least some familiarity with Crawl, and therefore doesn't cover extremely general aspects of the game.\n\nThis guide is partially based on [Vigrid's Hill Orc Fighter Guide](/Vigrid%27s_Hill_Orc_Fighter_Guide \"Vigrid's Hill Orc Fighter Guide\"), so if you're looking for something with less spellcasting and more smashing stuff with shiny weapons, definitely check that out. If anyone wants to edit *this guide*, I only ask that you do two things: Replace incorrect information rather than outright removing it, and keep things general so that players can adapt it to suit their needs.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Skills](#Skills)\n\n  - [1.1 Major Skills](#Major_Skills)\n  - [1.2 Minor Skills](#Minor_Skills)\n  - [1.3 Other](#Other)\n\n- [2 Stats](#Stats)\n\n- [3 Spells](#Spells)\n\n  - [3.1 Starting Spells](#Starting_Spells)\n  - [3.2 Later Spells](#Later_Spells)\n\n- [4 Equipment](#Equipment)\n\n  - [4.1 Weapons](#Weapons)\n  - [4.2 Armour](#Armour)\n\n- [5 Gods](#Gods)\n\n- [6 General Tips](#General_Tips)\n\n## Skills\n\nThese are the skills you should be considering, and some information as to why. Visit the [skill](/Skill \"Skill\") page for information on any I didn't cover.\n\n### Major Skills\n\n- **[Polearms](/Polearms \"Polearms\"):** Focus this immediately! Once you reach [minimum delay](/Minimum_delay \"Minimum delay\") with your current weapon, you can begin to focus on other skills.\n- **[Fighting](/Fighting \"Fighting\"):** This increases your accuracy, and your [HP](/HP \"HP\"). Good if you don't want to die from one hit.\n- **[Dodging](/Dodging \"Dodging\"):** Your most important defensive skill. Keep it high, and stay away from heavy armour.\n- **[Charms](/Charms \"Charms\"):** Used by everything from [Ozocubu's Armour](/Ozocubu%27s_Armour \"Ozocubu's Armour\") to [Haste](/Haste \"Haste\"). Definitely keep an eye on this.\n- **[Ice Magic](/Ice_Magic \"Ice Magic\"):** Obviously you should raise this, all of your starting spells use it.\n\n### Minor Skills\n\n- **[Shields](/Shields \"Shields\"):** Extra protection at the cost of decreased damage. Read the \"armour\" section below for more information.\n- **[Armour](/Armour \"Armour\"):** You'll put XP into this eventually, especially if you end up wearing [fire dragon armour](/Fire_dragon_armour \"Fire dragon armour\"). Just don't start off too fast.\n- **[Spellcasting](/Spellcasting \"Spellcasting\"):** This mainly gives you extra spell slots, level this if you need more spells.\n- **[Conjurations](/Conjurations \"Conjurations\"):** This can help get spells like [Throw Icicle](/Throw_Icicle \"Throw Icicle\") castable, but it's not too important.\n- **[Summoning](/Summoning \"Summoning\"):** A few levels for [Summon Ice Beast](/Summon_Ice_Beast \"Summon Ice Beast\") is fine, but don't invest in this much.\n\n### Other\n\n- **[Evocations](/Evocations \"Evocations\"):** An early [ring of invisibility](/Ring_of_invisibility \"Ring of invisibility\") or [amulet of rage](/Amulet_of_rage \"Amulet of rage\") is very useful. Level this as needed.\n- **[Invocations](/Invocations \"Invocations\"):** You'll want at least enough to bring your god abilities' failure rates into the single digits, possibly more depending on the god.\n- **[Stealth](/Stealth \"Stealth\"):** Being able to run away before a fight even begins is always good. Invest a few levels in this.\n\n## Stats\n\nYou'll want [Dexterity](/Dexterity \"Dexterity\") for increased [evasion](/Evasion \"Evasion\") most of the time, but if you move on to heavier armours, [Strength](/Strength \"Strength\") can help offset the spellcasting and evasion penalties. For instance, you'll want **at least** 11 strength if you're wearing [fire dragon armour](/Fire_dragon_armour \"Fire dragon armour\"). Your starting [Intelligence](/Intelligence \"Intelligence\") is more than enough, just don't assume you'll ever be casting [Glaciate](/Glaciate \"Glaciate\").\n\n## Spells\n\nIf you never use spells, your character will almost certainly die, it's as simple as that. If you don't want to cast, go play a Berserker. By the end of your game you'll want a wide selection, but it's best to start off slow, getting your most important spells castable. Then you can branch out.\n\n### Starting Spells\n\n**[Freeze](/Freeze \"Freeze\")** will be your primary form of attack until you've raised your pole-arm skill. It ignores AC/EV, and slows cold-blooded enemies like [adders](/Adder \"Adder\"), but the damage caps out fairly quick.\n\n**[Ozocubu's Armour](/Ozocubu%27s_Armour \"Ozocubu's Armour\")** should be the second or third spell you learn. It offers AC, helping to offset your poor armour aptitude, and could last you well into the late game!\n\n**[Throw Frost](/Throw_Frost \"Throw Frost\")** is good for taking out stuff at a range. Grab it when you get the chance, either before or after Ozo's.\n\nAt this point, you have a few options. Pick up **[Condensation Shield](/Condensation_Shield \"Condensation Shield\")** for more defense, **[Throw Icicle](/Throw_Icicle \"Throw Icicle\")** for increased ranged damage, or **[Summon Ice Beast](/Summon_Ice_Beast \"Summon Ice Beast\")** for allies that can help you fight and [escape](/Pillar_dancing \"Pillar dancing\")! All of these are good, so pick up whichever you want, whenever you need it.\n\n### Later Spells\n\nFurther ice spells you can learn include [Bolt of Cold](/Bolt_of_Cold \"Bolt of Cold\"), [Freezing Cloud](/Freezing_Cloud \"Freezing Cloud\") and [Ozocubu's Refrigeration](/Ozocubu%27s_Refrigeration \"Ozocubu's Refrigeration\"). All of these are very effective against groups of enemies, but none of them are necessary, so I would advise being choosy about which ones you memorize.\n\nMeanwhile, charms are definitely recommended. [Repel Missiles](/Repel_Missiles \"Repel Missiles\"), [Regeneration](/Regeneration \"Regeneration\"), [Shroud of Golubria](/Shroud_of_Golubria \"Shroud of Golubria\"), [Spectral Weapon](/Spectral_Weapon \"Spectral Weapon\"), [Deflect Missiles](/Deflect_Missiles \"Deflect Missiles\"), and [Haste](/Haste \"Haste\") are all excellent spells.\n\nSome cheap but useful spells from other schools include [Animate Skeleton](/Animate_Skeleton \"Animate Skeleton\"), [Apportation](/Apportation \"Apportation\"), [Blink](/Blink \"Blink\"), [Cure Poison](/Cure_Poison \"Cure Poison\"), and [Summon Butterflies](/Summon_Butterflies \"Summon Butterflies\").\n\n## Equipment\n\nEquipment is very important for any class, but it's especially so for a melee heavy one like MfIE. Thankfully, [polearms](/Polearms \"Polearms\") are abundant in the dungeon, and decent armour isn't rare by any means.\n\n### Weapons\n\nWhen you start, you'll have to use whatever polearms are available. This means even if you plan on using a shield later, it's fine to use a good two-handed weapon early on. Just swing your weapon a few times to check its current [delay](/Weapon_speed \"Weapon speed\"), and be very cautious if it's anything above 1.0. Never bother with scythes, unless they're an especially good artefact.\n\nFor quick weapons like [spears](/Spear \"Spear\") and [tridents](/Trident \"Trident\"), flat brands like [draining](/Draining \"Draining\"), [electrocution](/Electrocution \"Electrocution\"), and [venom](/Venom \"Venom\") are good. Venom is especially good for kiting! For two-handed weapons like [halberds](/Halberd \"Halberd\") and [glaives](/Glaive \"Glaive\"), scaling brands like [frost](/Frost \"Frost\"), [flame](/Flame \"Flame\"), and [vorpal](/Vorpal \"Vorpal\") are also good. If your two-handed weapon doesn't have a [flame](/Flame \"Flame\") brand, make sure to keep a spear or trident for hydras.\n\nIn all cases, if you find a good weapon with a [holy wrath](/Holy_wrath \"Holy wrath\"), [speed](/Speed_\\(brand\\) \"Speed (brand)\"), or [vampiric](/Vampiric \"Vampiric\") brand, hold onto it! [Protection](/Protection \"Protection\") weapons can also be good, since your armour's AC value will be low throughout the early-mid game.\n\nEventually you'll want a [demon trident](/Demon_trident \"Demon trident\") if you're using shields, and a [bardiche](/Bardiche \"Bardiche\") if you aren't. While you can't use a [demon trident](/Demon_trident \"Demon trident\") while worshipping a [good god](/Good_god \"Good god\"), [The Shining One](/The_Shining_One \"The Shining One\") will transform one into the even better [trishula](/Trishula \"Trishula\").\n\n### Armour\n\nYou'll want to stick to robes, leather, or troll leather armour at first, since [Ozocubu's Armour](/Ozocubu%27s_Armour \"Ozocubu's Armour\") requires armour with an [encumbrance rating](/Encumbrance_rating \"Encumbrance rating\") of 4 or lower. If you absolutely need a particular [resistance](/Resistance \"Resistance\") (such as [poison resistance](/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\") for [Swamp](/Swamp \"Swamp\")), it might be worth wearing ring mail to get it, if you have no other option (such as a ring).\n\nEventually you might move on to a heavier armour. [Dragon armour](/Dragon_armour \"Dragon armour\") is popular in the late game, especially [fire dragon armour](/Fire_dragon_armour \"Fire dragon armour\") for [Zot](/Zot \"Zot\"). Anything heavier than that is not recommended, as it will heavily impede your [evasion](/Evasion \"Evasion\").\n\nShields are popular for their extra defense, at the cost of a lower damage output. Playing with and without a shield is acceptable, so often it's best to decide based on what spawns in your game. If you run across a \"[shield](/Shield \"Shield\") of [resistance](/Resistance_\\(ego\\) \"Resistance (ego)\")\" early on, definitely use shields. If you run across a [vampiric](/Vampiric \"Vampiric\") [bardiche](/Bardiche \"Bardiche\"), use that instead!\n\n## Gods\n\n- **[Okawaru](/Okawaru \"Okawaru\"):** The invocations Heroism and Finesse are both simple yet powerful additions to your toolbox, and he will give you weapons and armour of variable usefulness as you progress through the dungeon. While you can easily complete the game with Oka, if you want to collect all 15 [Runes of Zot](/Rune_of_Zot \"Rune of Zot\"), swapping to another god is recommended ([The Shining One](/The_Shining_One \"The Shining One\") is a popular choice).\n\n* **[Makhleb](/Makhleb \"Makhleb\"):** Health on kills, piety-powered destructive blasts and the ability to summon demons. His summons are much more powerful than ice-beasts, and HP is always useful, so Makhleb is a good choice. The one catch is you absolutely have to level Invocations, or risk summoning hostile demons.\n\n- **[Yredelemnul](/Yredelemnul \"Yredelemnul\"):** Perhaps the absolute best god if all you want to do is win. He allows you to raise the dead to fight by your side, and gifts undead allies, all of which become more powerful once you can [hasten](/Haste \"Haste\") them. In addition to that, Pain Mirror is a great panic button, Drain Life can heal you when you need it most, and Enslave Soul allows to make any unique in the game your permanent servant.\n\n* **[The Shining One](/The_Shining_One \"The Shining One\"):** A poor choice for the early game due to his restrictions, but one of the absolute strongest gods for the extended game. He has so many useful abilities, I'm not even going to try and list them all here. If you want to swap to TSO later, make sure to save [Crypt](/Crypt \"Crypt\") until you've swapped.\n\n## General Tips\n\n- *Remember your buffs*. Casting Ozocubu's Armour and Condensation Shield before a tough fight can be the difference between life and death.\n- *Use your ranged attacks*. Trolls, giants, and any other highly-competent melee combatant should get some ice to the face before they get too close. Never engage them in straight melee.\n- *Know thy enemy*. Examine every foe you encounter. If they look dangerous, they probably are, and you shouldn't wade into an entire horde of them.\n- *Merfolks love water*. It makes you faster, better at dodging, and deep water can keep away plenty of enemies.\n- *Better them than you*. If you have allies, such as [ice beasts](/Ice_beast \"Ice beast\"), generally you want them to take hits for you, or at the very least, distract the weaker enemies while you mop up the rest. The game will continue if they're dead. It'll stop if you're dead. Besides, you have a reaching weapon perfectly suited for combat from the back row.\n- *Items, Items, Items*. If you have less than 5 varieties of scroll, wand, ring, amulet and potion on your person, chances are you're woefully under-prepared for the challenges ahead. When you believe a situation has a decent chance of getting you killed, don't make the mistake of being too conservative - use those consumables!\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html

Just don't start off too fast.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"/Spellcasting\" title=\"Spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a>:</b> This mainly gives you extra spell slots, level this if you need more spells.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"/Conjurations\" title=\"Conjurations\">Conjurations</a>:</b> This can help get spells like <a href=\"/Throw_Icicle\" title=\"Throw Icicle\">Throw Icicle</a> castable, but it's not too important.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"/Summoning\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Summoning\">Summoning</a>:</b> A few levels for <a href=\"/Summon_Ice_Beast\" title=\"Summon Ice Beast\">Summon Ice Beast</a> is fine, but don't invest in this much.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other\">Other</span></h3>\n<ul><li><b><a href=\"/Evocations\" title=\"Evocations\">Evocations</a>:</b> An early <a href=\"/Ring_of_invisibility\" title=\"Ring of invisibility\">ring of invisibility</a> or <a href=\"/Amulet_of_rage\" title=\"Amulet of rage\">amulet of rage</a> is very useful. Level this as needed.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"/Invocations\" title=\"Invocations\">Invocations</a>:</b> You'll want at least enough to bring your god abilities' failure rates into the single digits, possibly more depending on the god.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"/Stealth\" title=\"Stealth\">Stealth</a>:</b> Being able to run away before a fight even begins is always good. Invest a few levels in this.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stats\">Stats</span></h2>\n<p>You'll want <a href=\"/Dexterity\" title=\"Dexterity\">Dexterity</a> for increased <a href=\"/Evasion\" title=\"Evasion\">evasion</a> most of the time, but if you move on to heavier armours, <a href=\"/Strength\" title=\"Strength\">Strength</a> can help offset the spellcasting and evasion penalties. For instance, you'll want <b>at least</b> 11 strength if you're wearing <a href=\"/Fire_dragon_armour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fire dragon armour\">fire dragon armour</a>. Your starting <a href=\"/Intelligence\" title=\"Intelligence\">Intelligence</a> is more than enough, just don't assume you'll ever be casting <a href=\"/Glaciate\" title=\"Glaciate\">Glaciate</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spells\">Spells</span></h2>\n<p>If you never use spells, your character will almost certainly die, it's as simple as that. If you don't want to cast, go play a Berserker. By the end of your game you'll want a wide selection, but it's best to start off slow, getting your most important spells castable. Then you can branch out.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Starting_Spells\">Starting Spells</span></h3>\n<p><b><a href=\"/Freeze\" title=\"Freeze\">Freeze</a></b> will be your primary form of attack until you've raised your pole-arm skill. It ignores AC/EV, and slows cold-blooded enemies like <a href=\"/Adder\" title=\"Adder\">adders</a>, but the damage caps out fairly quick.\n</p><p><b><a href=\"/Ozocubu%27s_Armour\" title=\"Ozocubu&#39;s Armour\">Ozocubu's Armour</a></b> should be the second or third spell you learn. It offers AC, helping to offset your poor armour aptitude, and could last you well into the late game!\n</p><p><b><a href=\"/Throw_Frost\" title=\"Throw Frost\">Throw Frost</a></b> is good for taking out stuff at a range. Grab it when you get the chance, either before or after Ozo's.\n</p><p>At this point, you have a few options. Pick up <b><a href=\"/Condensation_Shield\" title=\"Condensation Shield\">Condensation Shield</a></b> for more defense, <b><a href=\"/Throw_Icicle\" title=\"Throw Icicle\">Throw Icicle</a></b> for increased ranged damage, or <b><a href=\"/Summon_Ice_Beast\" title=\"Summon Ice Beast\">Summon Ice Beast</a></b> for allies that can help you fight and <a href=\"/Pillar_dancing\" title=\"Pillar dancing\">escape</a>! All of these are good, so pick up whichever you want, whenever you need it.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Later_Spells\">Later Spells</span></h3>\n<p>Further ice spells you can learn include <a href=\"/Bolt_of_Cold\" title=\"Bolt of Cold\">Bolt of Cold</a>, <a href=\"/Freezing_Cloud\" title=\"Freezing Cloud\">Freezing Cloud</a> and <a href=\"/Ozocubu%27s_Refrigeration\" title=\"Ozocubu&#39;s Refrigeration\">Ozocubu's Refrigeration</a>. All of these are very effective against groups of enemies, but none of them are necessary, so I would advise being choosy about which ones you memorize.\n</p><p>Meanwhile, charms are definitely recommended. <a href=\"/Repel_Missiles\" title=\"Repel Missiles\">Repel Missiles</a>, <a href=\"/Regeneration\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Regeneration\">Regeneration</a>, <a href=\"/Shroud_of_Golubria\" title=\"Shroud of Golubria\">Shroud of Golubria</a>, <a href=\"/Spectral_Weapon\" title=\"Spectral Weapon\">Spectral Weapon</a>, <a href=\"/Deflect_Missiles\" title=\"Deflect Missiles\">Deflect Missiles</a>, and <a href=\"/Haste\" title=\"Haste\">Haste</a> are all excellent spells.\n</p><p>Some cheap but useful spells from other schools include <a href=\"/Animate_Skeleton\" title=\"Animate Skeleton\">Animate Skeleton</a>, <a href=\"/Apportation\" title=\"Apportation\">Apportation</a>, <a href=\"/Blink\" title=\"Blink\">Blink</a>, <a href=\"/Cure_Poison\" title=\"Cure Poison\">Cure Poison</a>, and <a href=\"/Summon_Butterflies\" title=\"Summon Butterflies\">Summon Butterflies</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Equipment\">Equipment</span></h2>\n<p>Equipment is very important for any class, but it's especially so for a melee heavy one like MfIE. Thankfully, <a href=\"/Polearms\" title=\"Polearms\">polearms</a> are abundant in the dungeon, and decent armour isn't rare by any means.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapons\">Weapons</span></h3>\n<p>When you start, you'll have to use whatever polearms are available. This means even if you plan on using a shield later, it's fine to use a good two-handed weapon early on. Just swing your weapon a few times to check its current <a href=\"/Weapon_speed\" title=\"Weapon speed\">delay</a>, and be very cautious if it's anything above 1.0. Never bother with scythes, unless they're an especially good artefact.\n</p><p>For quick weapons like <a href=\"/Spear\" title=\"Spear\">spears</a> and <a href=\"/Trident\" title=\"Trident\">tridents</a>, flat brands like <a href=\"/Draining\" title=\"Draining\">draining</a>, <a href=\"/Electrocution\" title=\"Electrocution\">electrocution</a>, and <a href=\"/Venom\" title=\"Venom\">venom</a> are good. Venom is especially good for kiting! For two-handed weapons like <a href=\"/Halberd\" title=\"Halberd\">halberds</a> and <a href=\"/Glaive\" title=\"Glaive\">glaives</a>, scaling brands like <a href=\"/Frost\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Frost\">frost</a>, <a href=\"/Flame\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Flame\">flame</a>, and <a href=\"/Vorpal\" title=\"Vorpal\">vorpal</a> are also good. If your two-handed weapon doesn't have a <a href=\"/Flame\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Flame\">flame</a> brand, make sure to keep a spear or trident for hydras.\n</p><p>In all cases, if you find a good weapon with a <a href=\"/Holy_wrath\" title=\"Holy wrath\">holy wrath</a>, <a href=\"/Speed_(brand)\" title=\"Speed (brand)\">speed</a>, or <a href=\"/Vampiric\" title=\"Vampiric\">vampiric</a> brand, hold onto it! <a href=\"/Protection\" title=\"Protection\">Protection</a> weapons can also be good, since your armour's AC value will be low throughout the early-mid game.\n</p><p>Eventually you'll want a <a href=\"/Demon_trident\" title=\"Demon trident\">demon trident</a> if you're using shields, and a <a href=\"/Bardiche\" title=\"Bardiche\">bardiche</a> if you aren't. While you can't use a <a href=\"/Demon_trident\" title=\"Demon trident\">demon trident</a> while worshipping a <a href=\"/Good_god\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Good god\">good god</a>, <a href=\"/The_Shining_One\" title=\"The Shining One\">The Shining One</a> will transform one into the even better <a href=\"/Trishula\" title=\"Trishula\">trishula</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Armour\">Armour</span></h3>\n<p>You'll want to stick to robes, leather, or troll leather armour at first, since <a href=\"/Ozocubu%27s_Armour\" title=\"Ozocubu&#39;s Armour\">Ozocubu's Armour</a> requires armour with an <a href=\"/Encumbrance_rating\" title=\"Encumbrance rating\">encumbrance rating</a> of 4 or lower. If you absolutely need a particular <a href=\"/Resistance\" title=\"Resistance\">resistance</a> (such as <a href=\"/Poison_resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Poison resistance\">poison resistance</a> for <a href=\"/Swamp\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Swamp\">Swamp</a>), it might be worth wearing ring mail to get it, if you have no other option (such as a ring).\n</p><p>Eventually you might move on to a heavier armour. <a href=\"/Dragon_armour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dragon armour\">Dragon armour</a> is popular in the late game, especially <a href=\"/Fire_dragon_armour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fire dragon armour\">fire dragon armour</a> for <a href=\"/Zot\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Zot\">Zot</a>. Anything heavier than that is not recommended, as it will heavily impede your <a href=\"/Evasion\" title=\"Evasion\">evasion</a>.\n</p><p>Shields are popular for their extra defense, at the cost of a lower damage output. Playing with and without a shield is acceptable, so often it's best to decide based on what spawns in your game. If you run across a \"<a href=\"/Shield\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield\">shield</a> of <a href=\"/Resistance_(ego)\" title=\"Resistance (ego)\">resistance</a>\" early on, definitely use shields. If you run across a <a href=\"/Vampiric\" title=\"Vampiric\">vampiric</a> <a href=\"/Bardiche\" title=\"Bardiche\">bardiche</a>, use that instead!\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gods\">Gods</span></h2>\n<ul><li><b><a href=\"/Okawaru\" title=\"Okawaru\">Okawaru</a>:</b> The invocations Heroism and Finesse are both simple yet powerful additions to your toolbox, and he will give you weapons and armour of variable usefulness as you progress through the dungeon. While you can easily complete the game with Oka, if you want to collect all 15 <a href=\"/Rune_of_Zot\" title=\"Rune of Zot\">Runes of Zot</a>, swapping to another god is recommended (<a href=\"/The_Shining_One\" title=\"The Shining One\">The Shining One</a> is a popular choice).</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b><a href=\"/Makhleb\" title=\"Makhleb\">Makhleb</a>:</b> Health on kills, piety-powered destructive blasts and the ability to summon demons. His summons are much more powerful than ice-beasts, and HP is always useful, so Makhleb is a good choice. The one catch is you absolutely have to level Invocations, or risk summoning hostile demons.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b><a href=\"/Yredelemnul\" title=\"Yredelemnul\">Yredelemnul</a>:</b> Perhaps the absolute best god if all you want to do is win. He allows you to raise the dead to fight by your side, and gifts undead allies, all of which become more powerful once you can <a href=\"/Haste\" title=\"Haste\">hasten</a> them. In addition to that, Pain Mirror is a great panic button, Drain Life can heal you when you need it most, and Enslave Soul allows to make any unique in the game your permanent servant.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b><a href=\"/The_Shining_One\" title=\"The Shining One\">The Shining One</a>:</b> A poor choice for the early game due to his restrictions, but one of the absolute strongest gods for the extended game. He has so many useful abilities, I'm not even going to try and list them all here. If you want to swap to TSO later, make sure to save <a href=\"/Crypt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crypt\">Crypt</a> until you've swapped.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"General_Tips\">General Tips</span></h2>\n<ul><li><i>Remember your buffs</i>. Casting Ozocubu's Armour and Condensation Shield before a tough fight can be the difference between life and death.</li>\n<li><i>Use your ranged attacks</i>. Trolls, giants, and any other highly-competent melee combatant should get some ice to the face before they get too close. Never engage them in straight melee.</li>\n<li><i>Know thy enemy</i>. Examine every foe you encounter. If they look dangerous, they probably are, and you shouldn't wade into an entire horde of them.</li>\n<li><i>Merfolks love water</i>. It makes you faster, better at dodging, and deep water can keep away plenty of enemies.</li>\n<li><i>Better them than you</i>. If you have allies, such as <a href=\"/Ice_beast\" title=\"Ice beast\">ice beasts</a>, generally you want them to take hits for you, or at the very least, distract the weaker enemies while you mop up the rest. The game will continue if they're dead. It'll stop if you're dead. Besides, you have a reaching weapon perfectly suited for combat from the back row.</li>\n<li><i>Items, Items, Items</i>. If you have less than 5 varieties of scroll, wand, ring, amulet and potion on your person, chances are you're woefully under-prepared for the challenges ahead. When you believe a situation has a decent chance of getting you killed, don't make the mistake of being too conservative - use those consumables!</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time:

guide}}\n{{version015}}\n\nIf you choose a [[Merfolk]] [[Ice Elementalist]], you get to play with a lot of different options. You're already an excellent melee fighter with your [[Polearms]]/[[Dodging]] aptitudes, but you also have [[Ozocubu's Armour|great]] [[Condensation Shield|buffs]] for defense, a [[Summon Ice Beast|summon]] for backup, and some [[Throw Frost|Conjuration]] [[Throw Icicle|spells]] for dealing with enemies at a distance!\n\nIf you haven't already, read the [[walkthrough]] and [[strategy guides]]. This guide assumes at least some familiarity with Crawl, and therefore doesn't cover extremely general aspects of the game.\n\nThis guide is partially based on [[Vigrid's Hill Orc Fighter Guide]], so if you're looking for something with less spellcasting and more smashing stuff with shiny weapons, definitely check that out. If anyone wants to edit ''this guide'', I only ask that you do two things: Replace incorrect information rather than outright removing it, and keep things general so that players can adapt it to suit their needs.\n\n==Skills==\nThese are the skills you should be considering, and some information as to why. Visit the [[skill]] page for information on any I didn't cover.\n\n===Major Skills===\n*'''[[Polearms]]:''' Focus this immediately! Once you reach [[minimum delay]] with your current weapon, you can begin to focus on other skills.\n*'''[[Fighting]]:''' This increases your accuracy, and your [[HP]]. Good if you don't want to die from one hit.\n*'''[[Dodging]]:''' Your most important defensive skill. Keep it high, and stay away from heavy armour.\n*'''[[Charms]]:''' Used by everything from [[Ozocubu's Armour]] to [[Haste]]. Definitely keep an eye on this.\n*'''[[Ice Magic]]:''' Obviously you should raise this, all of your starting spells use it.\n\n===Minor Skills===\n*'''[[Shields]]:''' Extra protection at the cost of decreased damage. Read the \"armour\" section below for more information.\n*'''[[Armour]]:''' You'll put XP into this eventually, especially if you end up wearing [[fire dragon armour]]. Just don't start off too fast.\n*'''[[Spellcasting]]:''' This mainly gives you extra spell slots, level this if you need more spells.\n*'''[[Conjurations]]:''' This can help get spells like [[Throw Icicle]] castable, but it's not too important.\n*'''[[Summoning]]:''' A few levels for [[Summon Ice Beast]] is fine, but don't invest in this much.\n\n===Other===\n*'''[[Evocations]]:''' An early [[ring of invisibility]] or [[amulet of rage]] is very useful. Level this as needed.\n*'''[[Invocations]]:''' You'll want at least enough to bring your god abilities' failure rates into the single digits, possibly more depending on the god.\n*'''[[Stealth]]:''' Being able to run away before a fight even begins is always good. Invest a few levels in this.\n\n==Stats==\nYou'll want [[Dexterity]] for increased [[evasion]] most of the time, but if you move on to heavier armours, [[Strength]] can help offset the spellcasting and evasion penalties. For instance, you'll want '''at least''' 11 strength if you're wearing [[fire dragon armour]]. Your starting [[Intelligence]] is more than enough, just don't assume you'll ever be casting [[Glaciate]].\n\n==Spells==\nIf you never use spells, your character will almost certainly die, it's as simple as that. If you don't want to cast, go play a Berserker. By the end of your game you'll want a wide selection, but it's best to start off slow, getting your most important spells castable. Then you can branch out.\n\n===Starting Spells===\n'''[[Freeze]]''' will be your primary form of attack until you've raised your pole-arm skill. It ignores AC/EV, and slows cold-blooded enemies like [[adder]]s, but the damage caps out fairly quick.\n\n'''[[Ozocubu's Armour]]''' should be the second or third spell you learn. It offers AC, helping to offset your poor armour aptitude, and could last you well into the late game!\n\n'''[[Throw Frost]]''' is good for taking out stuff at a range. Grab it when you get the chance, either before or after Ozo's.\n\nAt this point, you have a few options. Pick up '''[[Condensation Shield]]''' for more defense, '''[[Throw Icicle]]''' for increased ranged damage, or '''[[Summon Ice Beast]]''' for allies that can help you fight and [[pillar dancing|escape]]! All of these are good, so pick up whichever you want, whenever you need it.\n\n===Later Spells===\nFurther ice spells you can learn include [[Bolt of Cold]], [[Freezing Cloud]] and [[Ozocubu's Refrigeration]]. All of these are very effective against groups of enemies, but none of them are necessary, so I would advise being choosy about which ones you memorize.\n\nMeanwhile, charms are definitely recommended. [[Repel Missiles]], [[Regeneration]], [[Shroud of Golubria]], [[Spectral Weapon]], [[Deflect Missiles]], and [[Haste]] are all excellent spells.\n\nSome cheap but useful spells from other schools include [[Animate Skeleton]], [[Apportation]], [[Blink]], [[Cure Poison]], and [[Summon Butterflies]].\n\n==Equipment==\nEquipment is very important for any class, but it's especially so for a melee heavy one like MfIE. Thankfully, [[polearms]] are abundant in the dungeon, and decent armour isn't rare by any means.\n\n===Weapons===\nWhen you start, you'll have to use whatever polearms are available. This means even if you plan on using a shield later, it's fine to use a good two-handed weapon early on. Just swing your weapon a few times to check its current [[weapon speed|delay]], and be very cautious if it's anything above 1.0. Never bother with scythes, unless they're an especially good artefact.\n\nFor quick weapons like [[spear]]s and [[trident]]s, flat brands like [[draining]], [[electrocution]], and [[venom]] are good. Venom is especially good for kiting! For two-handed weapons like [[halberd]]s and [[glaive]]s, scaling brands like [[frost]], [[flame]], and [[vorpal]] are also good. If your two-handed weapon doesn't have a [[flame]] brand, make sure to keep a spear or trident for hydras.\n\nIn all cases, if you find a good weapon with a [[holy wrath]], [[Speed (brand)|speed]], or [[vampiric]] brand, hold onto it! [[Protection]] weapons can also be good, since your armour's AC value will be low throughout the early-mid game.\n\nEventually you'll want a [[demon trident]] if you're using shields, and a [[bardiche]] if you aren't. While you can't use a [[demon trident]] while worshipping a [[good god]], [[The Shining One]] will transform one into the even better [[trishula]].\n\n===Armour===\nYou'll want to stick to robes, leather, or troll leather armour at first, since [[Ozocubu's Armour]] requires armour with an [[encumbrance rating]] of 4 or lower. If you absolutely need a particular [[resistance]] (such as [[poison resistance]] for [[Swamp]]), it might be worth wearing ring mail to get it, if you have no other option (such as a ring).\n\nEventually you might move on to a heavier armour. [[Dragon armour]] is popular in the late game, especially [[fire dragon armour]] for [[Zot]]. Anything heavier than that is not recommended, as it will heavily impede your [[evasion]].\n\nShields are popular for their extra defense, at the cost of a lower damage output. Playing with and without a shield is acceptable, so often it's best to decide based on what spawns in your game. If you run across a \"[[shield]] of [[Resistance (ego)|resistance]]\" early on, definitely use shields. If you run across a [[vampiric]] [[bardiche]], use that instead!\n\n==Gods==\n*'''[[Okawaru]]:''' The invocations Heroism and Finesse are both simple yet powerful additions to your toolbox, and he will give you weapons and armour of variable usefulness as you progress through the dungeon. While you can easily complete the game with Oka, if you want to collect all 15 [[Rune of Zot|Runes of Zot]], swapping to another god is recommended ([[The Shining One]] is a popular choice).\n\n*'''[[Makhleb]]:''' Health on kills, piety-powered destructive blasts and the ability to summon demons. His summons are much more powerful than ice-beasts, and HP is always useful, so Makhleb is a good choice. The one catch is you absolutely have to level Invocations, or risk summoning hostile demons.\n\n*'''[[Yredelemnul]]:''' Perhaps the absolute best god if all you want to do is win. He allows you to raise the dead to fight by your side, and gifts undead allies, all of which become more powerful once you can [[haste]]n them. In addition to that, Pain Mirror is a great panic button, Drain Life can heal you when you need it most, and Enslave Soul allows to make any unique in the game your permanent servant.\n\n*'''[[The Shining One]]:''' A poor choice for the early game due to his restrictions, but one of the absolute strongest gods for the extended game. He has so many useful abilities, I'm not even going to try and list them all here. If you want to swap to TSO later, make sure to save [[Crypt]] until you've swapped.\n\n==General Tips==\n*''Remember your buffs''. Casting Ozocubu's Armour and Condensation Shield before a tough fight can be the difference between life and death.\n*''Use your ranged attacks''. Trolls, giants, and any other highly-competent melee combatant should get some ice to the face before they get too close. Never engage them in straight melee.\n*''Know thy enemy''. Examine every foe you encounter. If they look dangerous, they probably are, and you shouldn't wade into an entire horde of them.\n*''Merfolks love water''. It makes you faster, better at dodging, and deep water can keep away plenty of enemies.\n*''Better them than you''. If you have allies, such as [[ice beast]]s, generally you want them to take hits for you, or at the very least, distract the weaker enemies while you mop up the rest. The game will continue if they're dead. It'll stop if you're dead. Besides, you have a reaching weapon perfectly suited for combat from the back row.\n*''Items, Items, Items''. If you have less than 5 varieties of scroll, wand, ring, amulet and potion on your person, chances are you're woefully under-prepared for the challenges ahead. When you believe a situation has a decent chance of getting you killed, don't make the mistake of being too conservative - use those consumables!\n\n[[Category:Character guides]]"}

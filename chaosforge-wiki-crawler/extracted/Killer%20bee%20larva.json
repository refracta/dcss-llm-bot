However, if they happened to cross a tile containing a [[honeycomb]] or [[royal jelly (item)|royal jelly]], they immediately matured into a mature killer bee. They could be found most often in killer bee [[vault]]s, and were occasionally seen elsewhere as a possible [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]] form.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nNone required.\n\n==History==\nKiller bee larvae were removed from ''Crawl'' in [[0.11]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

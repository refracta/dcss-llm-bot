{"title":"Worm","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Worm","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{list of|worms}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Worms''' are early-game monsters. They are slow, but moderately strong for their level, and their fast regeneration can make [[kiting]] take longer. They can be found as early as [[Dungeon]]:2.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Worms are slow - all player species, including [[Naga]]s, can outrun a worm. Barring external circumstances (other monsters show up, you're backed into a corner...), you can just walk away. If you take lots of damage, you can easily retreat and pelt it with ranged attacks.\n*You can [[kite]] the worm with virtually any sort of ranged attack, such as [[spear]]s, [[poisoned]] [[dart]]s, and magic. But due to their fast regen, it might take a while.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], worms were replaced by [[ribbon worm]]s.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], worms had slightly more max HP, but didn't have fast regeneration."}

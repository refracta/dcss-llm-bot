However, they fire slowly, with a [[mindelay]] of 1.0. In addition:\n*Hand cannons are particularly [[loud]] - they create a [[noise]] of 11 for every shot, enough to attract nearby monsters.\n*Hand cannons create harmless, transparent [[cloud]]s whenever fired.\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Hand cannon.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Hand cannon2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Hand cannon3.png]]\n|-\n! || '''[[Unrandarts|Unrandart]]'''\n|-\n| '''[[Mule]]''' || [[File:Mule.png]]\n|}\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], this item was known as a '''hand crossbow'''. Hand crossbows only had 15 base damage, but were half as loud and didn't create [[cloud]]s when shot. Also, it was less likely for one to generate with a good [[brand]].\n*Prior to [[0.30]], hand crossbows had 17 base damage.\n*In [[0.29]], hand crossbows were made heavier (previous stats: 12 damage, +5 accuracy, 15 base delay), and became designated for later portions of the game.  They were affected by the [[Ranged Weapons#History|ranged weapons rework]] that applied to all launchers, including the removal of the dedicated [[Crossbows (skill)|Crossbows skill]] and [[bolt]]s. Prior to this version, [[Hunter]]s and [[Arcane Marksmen]] could start with this weapon.\n*In [[0.15]], hand crossbows (as well as [[arbalest]]s and [[triple crossbow]]s) were introduced, replacing the standard [[crossbow (item)|crossbow]].\n*In very old versions of ''Crawl'', the hand crossbow was a one-handed ranged weapon which fired [[dart]]s.\n\n{{weapons}}"}

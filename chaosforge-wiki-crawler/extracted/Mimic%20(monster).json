They are more than a match for careless, fragile characters, packing poisonous bites and multiple moderately powerful attacks. '''Item mimics''' can be found on [[Dungeon]]:7 or lower, as well as in any branch except for the [[Ecumenical Temple]], and are slightly slower than the average character. The faster '''feature mimics''' can start appearing on D:10, and are absent from the Temple, [[the Slime Pits]], and [[the Vestibule of Hell]].\n\nIn order to keep mimics from devastating low level characters and to give them a bit more bite in the late game, [[0.11]] added two new varieties. [[Inept mimic]]s are much weaker and can be found on floors 1-6, while [[ravenous mimic]]s are significantly more powerful and haunt the deepest areas.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Be wary of extremely high quality gear found early on. While [[gold dragon armour]] or [[crystal plate mail]] can occasionally appear on any floor, it might be wise to test it for fangs first.\n**Unlike items, nothing can stand on a tile with a mimic in it, so monsters will step around them. Monsters neutralized by [[Elyvilon]]'s abilities, however, may still ascend or descend a mimic.\n**If your minions stand adjacent to an item mimic, it will attack them.\n**If you've already injured a mimic on this floor and it managed to escape, you may find an \"item\" later on with a health bar.\n*How to kill a mimic:\n**Powerful melee fighters can usually plow right through them, especially if they have poison resistance.\n**They have an [[EV]] score of 1. [[Bolt of Inaccuracy]] can annihilate them in a single hit.\n**Almost any [[Summonings]] spell can take them out without risk. They're fragile enough that a pack of imps can make short work of them.\n*Mimics almost always identify themselves when you stand next to you. A [[Blink]] spell can put some quick distance between you and it.\n*When dealing with feature mimics, escape won't be nearly as easy, but they're otherwise not any harder.\n*Note the differences between a weapon mimic and a hostile [[dancing weapon]]:  dancing weapons are much faster, may have any branded attack, and leave behind an actual weapon as a \"corpse.\"  A dancing weapon's attack strength and speed vary on the type of weapon being animated and can be quite powerful.\n\n==History==\nMimics ceased being monsters in [[0.16]]. However, items may still turn out to be [[mimic]]s, which simply vanish when you get within on tile of them.\n\nIn [[0.15]], mimics no longer mimic doors, statues, fountains or hatches.\n\nInept and ravenous mimics were added in [[0.11]].\n\nPrior to 0.10, item mimics were immobile, and in general they were cowardly creatures that [[teleport]]ed away when struck with a ranged attack.\n\nFeature mimics were introduced to the game in [[0.8]]. Due to numerous bugs, they were retired in [[0.9]], to be reintroduced in [[0.10]] after much bugfixing."}

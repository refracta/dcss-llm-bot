{"title":"Reaper","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Reaper","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Reapers''' are [[tier-2 demon]]s armed with randomly [[brand]]ed [[scythe]]s. They lack magic, but have decent lasting power and their [[reaching]] melee attacks can deal heavy damage and drag you backwards. They can normally be found in [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], and the [[Hell]]s (most often in [[the Iron City of Dis]] and [[Tartarus]]), but they also appear on some [[Depths]] floors. Some monsters can also summon them through the [[Summon Greater Demon]] spell.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Their reaching attacks hit even harder than [[stone giant]]s, and they have similar lasting power. Respect them, particularly if you encounter them early (e.g. through a Necromancy miscast).\n*While melee fighters shouldn't have much trouble with them on their own, they can be devastating when allowed to attack from the back row while you deal with more immediate opponents. Be especially careful if their weapon brand suddenly turns out to be [[chaos]] or [[distortion]].\n*Tiles players (and those who read monster descriptions) should beware: no matter how undead this monster looks/sounds, it is not. [[Dispel Undead]] will have no effect.\n*Be careful when fighting these demons near [[stairs]] or when [[stair dancing]], because reapers can drag you away.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], reapers couldn't drag their targets back with melee attacks.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], hostile reapers could be summoned by [[miscasting]] Necromancy spells and via [[death curse]]s.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

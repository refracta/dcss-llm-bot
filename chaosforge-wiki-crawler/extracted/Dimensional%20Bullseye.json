{"title":"Dimensional Bullseye","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Dimensional_Bullseye","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n'''Dimensional Bullseye''' is a level 4 [[Hexes]]/[[Translocation]] spell which allows you to mark any monster in your line of sight. Each time you fire at a non-marked enemy, the marked enemy is hit by an identical shot.\n\n[[Hexslinger]]s start with this spell in their libraries.\n\n==Useful Info==\nDimensional Bullseye is a [[smite-targeted]] spell which ''marks'' a given monster. Whenever you attack (hit or miss) with a [[ranged weapon]] or [[Throwing]] implement at ''another'' enemy, the marked target is also attacked. Projectiles land on the marked target's tile.\n\nThis effect occurs at the end of the projectiles' normal trajectory:\n*When using a non-penetrating weapon, it occurs after you hit any non-marked target, or after you miss every target in your path. For example, you can miss target #1, hit target #2 behind it, then attack the marked target. If you miss target #1 and target #2, you still get to attack the marked target.\n*When using a [[penetration|penetrating]] weapon, the attack will hit all original targets and the marked target together. \n\nIn addition, Ranged Weapon / Throwing attacks against the marked target gain a [[to-hit]] bonus of <code>power/12</code> (even if the above effect does not trigger).\n\n==Strategy==\nDimensional Bullseye is useful if you rely on [[Ranged Weapons]]. It boosts your accuracy, lets you hit an additional target in combat, and allows you to snipe monsters in the backlines.\n\nThis spell is somewhat redundant for [[Throwing]] users. [[Javelin]]s have innate penetration, so they can already hit monsters in the back (and everything in the way, too). It can still useful, though, as it lets you hit monsters outside the javelin's path.\n\nBecause this spell relies entirely on your ranged attack, Hexslingers should not rush for this spell. Instead, get your [[Ranged Weapons]] skill to competency, then train this spell as a support option.\n\n==History==\n*Dimensional Bullseye was introduced in [[0.31]], replacing [[Portal Projectile]]."}

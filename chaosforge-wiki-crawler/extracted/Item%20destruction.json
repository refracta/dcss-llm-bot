{"title":"Item destruction","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Item_destruction","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\nAlthough the majority of the dangers you'll encounter while exploring [[the Dungeon]] simply try to reduce your [[HP]] or afflict you with [[status effects]], some monsters and damage types also inflict '''item destruction'''. Although this won't kill you directly, losing critical consumable items can greatly reduce your odds of survival. Bear in mind that these attacks attempt to destroy every item in your [[inventory]] individually; carrying lots of useless scrolls, potions, or food will not reduce the chance of your useful items being affected!\n\n==Scrolls==\nAny time you suffer [[fire]] damage, there is a chance that your [[scroll]]s will be destroyed. The likelihood of this occurring decreases when your [[AC]] reduces the damage dealt. You can reduce this chance through the following means:\n*The [[preservation]] or [[conservation]] intrinsics (90% reduction)\n*The [[demonspawn mutation#Hurl Hellfire|Hurl Hellfire]] and [[demonspawn mutation#Ignite Blood|Ignite Blood]] [[demonspawn mutation]]s (90% reduction)\n*Wielding the [[Firestarter]] protects your scrolls\n*Worshiping [[Jiyva]] ([[piety]]-based reduction)\n\n==Potions==\nAny time you suffer [[cold]] damage, there is a chance that your [[potion]]s will be destroyed. The likelihood of this occurring decreases when your AC reduces the damage dealt. You can reduce this chance through the following means:\n*The [[preservation]] or [[conservation]] intrinsics (90% reduction)\n*The [[demonspawn mutation#Passive Freeze|Passive Freeze]] and [[demonspawn mutation#Icemail|Icemail]] [[demonspawn mutation]]s (90% reduction)\n*Worshiping [[Jiyva]] ([[piety]]-based reduction)\n\n==Food==\nAny time you are hit by a [[giant spore]] explosion, there is a chance that your [[food]] will be destroyed. You can reduce this chance through the following means:\n*The [[preservation]] or [[conservation]] intrinsics (90% reduction)\n*Worshiping [[Jiyva]] ([[piety]]-based reduction)\n\n==Corrosion==\n[[Acid]] attacks don't destroy items, but they do cause [[corrosion]], reducing item [[enchant]]ment.  Corrosion comes from two sources: striking a monster that has acidic flesh (which only affects your wielded item or gloves), and acid splashes (which affect all worn pieces of armour, but not your weapon). \n\nIf an item is corroded, it still has a chance to resist the corrosion based on its enchantment value. The greater the absolute value of an item's enchantment level, the better its odds of resisting.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0; padding:0;\"\n! Enchantment (+ or -) || Resist %\n|-\n| 0 || 6%\n|-\n| 1 || 18%\n|-\n| 2 || 34%\n|-\n| 3 || 58%\n|-\n| 4 || 98%\n|-\n| 5 or more || 100%\n|}\n\nOtherwise, the following methods reduce corrosion:\n*The resist corrosion intrinsic (found on the [[amulet of resist corrosion]] and the [[cloak of preservation]]) gives you an additional 90% chance to resist corrosion. \n*Dwarven items and [[crystal plate mail]] receive their own 80% resist chance.\n*[[Artefact]]s are completely immune to corrosion.\n\n==History==\n*Item destruction for items on your inventory was entirely removed in [[0.15]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], [[jellies]] would destroy seen items by moving over them, even without worshipping [[Jiyva]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], [[harpies]] had a unique food-destroying melee attack that only Jiyva-worship could defend against. Additionally, items on the floor could be destroyed by slimes moving over them.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], damage reduction through AC had no impact on item destruction chance."}

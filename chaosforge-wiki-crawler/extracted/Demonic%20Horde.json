The duration and friendliness of the demons are all dependent upon your [[spell power]], though the number and type are not.\n\n==Strategy==\nThis is more of a utility spell than a flat-out offensive spell, as the monsters it summons don't dish out that much damage, even in a good-sized group. However, their sheer numbers and not-terrible defenses mean that most monsters will take a considerable amount of time to grind through them all, often buying the caster valuable time to escape or use [[smite-targeted]] attacks with less fear of repercussion. Think of it as an upgrade of [[Summon Butterflies]], except the butterflies have more durability and can occasionally even kill things.\n\n==History==\nDemonic Horde was removed in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

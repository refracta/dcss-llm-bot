{"title":"Acid blob","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Acid_blob","type":"raw","data":"{{version027}}\n{{list of | jellies}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Acid blobs''' are fast, [[acid]]ic monsters with highly accurate ranged and melee attacks that can [[corrode]] your armour and weapons. They deal enough damage that fragile characters should be more concerned about their [[HP]]. They can be found in [[the Slime Pits]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*[[Resist corrosion]] reduces their damage output considerably and helps defend against the [[corrode]]d status.\n*The Slime Pits aren't exactly easy to bottleneck enemies in, but if you can use [[wall]]s or other enemies to keep acid blobs from shooting you while you move into combat range, it'll help.\n*Even with some form of acid resistance, these are still fast monsters that hit hard in melee: turn-for-turn, they have similar damage output to [[stone giant]]s. Prepare accordingly.\n*They have terrible defenses. Low-accuracy spells such as [[Iron Shot]] are quite effective against them."}

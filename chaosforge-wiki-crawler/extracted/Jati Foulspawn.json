This page probably contains spoilers.*\n\n**Disclaimer:** Some of the events in what follows are not exactly what happened in the Crawl game. One of the following will usually apply:\n\na) The first game I played, I got dropped in the abyss right away by a ynoximul, so it didn't count.\n\nb) This is being wrote very late/very early, depends on how you look at it. My recollection can get fuzzy. Or, most commonly,\n\nc) The way I \"put it\" in the diary makes for a better story. Deal with it.\n\nThe summary at the bottom of each section ('cept the prologue) tells you what happened, in plain english.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Prologue](#Prologue)\n- [2 Abyss](#Abyss)\n- [3 D:I](#D:I)\n- [4 D:II](#D:II)\n- [5 A Reflection](#A_Reflection)\n- [6 D:III](#D:III)\n- [7 D:IV](#D:IV)\n- [8 A Reflection, Part II](#A_Reflection.2C_Part_II)\n- [9 D:V](#D:V)\n- [10 D:VI](#D:VI)\n- [11 D:VII](#D:VII)\n- [12 D:VIII](#D:VIII)\n- [13 Orc Mines](#Orc_Mines)\n- [14 A Reflection, Part III](#A_Reflection.2C_Part_III)\n- [15 My Thoughts](#My_Thoughts)\n\n## Prologue\n\nI stand betrayed. Scorned by my own tribe for crimes I did not commit, men I once called 'brother' chased me from what was once my family's home. As I fled those base brutes, I prayed to the foreign goddess of the creatures that created me. The sky turned sickly, the colors of a deathly infection, and what I can only describe as a horrific rip in reality opened up in front of me. Even as the spawn of the Abyss poured out, I did not hesitate to jump in. And so it is that I find myself newly loyal to a goddess of evil, dedicated to destroying all that I once worked so hard to preserve. I stand betrayed, and my tribe, nay, the world will feel my wrath and tremble at my coming. I am filled with bitterness that I find myself vowing to desecrate all purity, to tear down all that is built up. But I will not tolerate such an injustice that I have received.\n\n## Abyss\n\nAs I finish the rites binding my soul to my patroness, who has informed me that I shall refer to her as the Unformed, the odd light of the Abyss changed somehow in tone. The monsters here are no longer ignoring me, either. It seems the Unformed is already testing my prowess. She will not be disappointed. I ventured around this palace of horrors, searching for something useful before I return to reality. My diligent searching was rewarded by a small sum of gold and an odd scroll that buzzes with energy. However, I now have sighted a pair of...things. Piles of flesh conglomerated together, animated somehow and moving swiftly towards me. I forged a gate to reality with my new powers, and found reality disconcerting after so many hours in chaos.\n\n**Summary:** I scored 20 gold and a scroll, then got chased out of the abyss by a pair of small abominations.\n\n## D:I\n\nThe Unformed has spoken to me, telling me what I shall do to exact my revenge. I have found myself in a dungeon. The Unformed reveals to me that at the bottom, an Orb of immense, unshaped power awaits me. I set off immediately, though I found myself stumbling and unable to focus my eyes properly at first. An insect set upon me, but afforded me neither challenge nor satiation in slaying. Feeling invincible, I read the contents of the scroll, and my axe glowed with a bloody light. I offered the pathetic creature I slew to the Unformed, and it disappeared. I can feel the Unformed's approval. In return for the killing of a few beasts, the Unformed placed a golden helmet before me. Trying it on, it fit perfectly, and the leering demon of the mask matches the burning of my soul perfectly. Guarded by a pair of large newts and a goblin which prodded them about via a crude goad, I found protective boots and gloves. After putting them on, two more scrawny goblins and a kobald emerged from the darkness and nearly slew me. But with perseverance, faith, and fury I made a bloody tribute to the Unformed out of them. The kobald had a robe of the finest make upon him, and I took it for myself. Upon examination, it was much more resilient than any fabric is naturally. Little else on the first floor is worth mentioning.\n\n**Summary:** I SCORED for D:1. The scroll was enchant weapon II, making my axe +3 +2, I got a +2 robe, a helmet, gloves, and boots. The Gobs and Kobald was a close call, but in my defense it was three on one and I was only level one at the time.\n\n## D:II\n\nI descended to the second level, and killed a pair of jackals left guarding the staircase. Another foolish soul, a snake, rushed for my throat, but after a few blows I sent it slithering away. Giving chase, It led me to a trio of Gnolls, no doubt the masters of the beasts. I was forced to retreat to the first level again. Praying it would take me to a different section of the dungeon, I took a second staircase and saw I was alone. Thanking the Unformed for my place of refuge, I explored. After some time trouncing the reptiles that infest this place, I saw the same snake as before. I ran it down in a corridor, and feasted on its blood. The gnolls again found me at this point, forcing me to again retreat upstairs, this time followed by a jackal easily dispatched. Returning to the second level through a third and final staircase, I came to the room the gnolls had occupied. I saw what they wanted to keep safe. A veritable library of scrolls, all pulsing with faint magic force. I saw only one that I recognized, the scroll which illuminated my axe and sharpened its edge. I was pleased to see it worked a second time. As for the other scrolls, one melded my gloves with my fingers, and another removed the curse. A third made an awful, deafening noise. The remainder seemed to have no effect. After relocating the gnolls, I lured them one by one and dispatched them. The Unformed took their souls with pleasure.\n\n**Summary:** D:2 was small, and had four gnolls (I know I said three, I found the fourth later) in it. For a level two character, this is an ugly combination. I was forced to fight a hit and run war with them, and the only real treasure was a room full of decent scrolls.\n\n## A Reflection\n\nAs I sit, nursing my wounds, I reflect on what led me to this place. My mother was a sinner, of that there is no doubt. She willfully participated in intercourse with a demonspawn of the Unformed, my mistress, and created me. When she finally told me the truth, (She had told me previously my father had been a \"beautiful traveling tradesman\") I was horrified but somehow not surprised. I had always been different from other children, staring at things that piqued my interest for no reason, and feeling uncomfortable in the presence of priests. Despite this, I took my mother's advice and devoted myself to Zin. Odd how she tried to make me something better than I was. I have left Zin now, for one of his mortal enemies, and nothing adverse has happened to me. Rather, I am much stronger than I have ever been. I think this is because Zin scorned my worship from the start. Of course he would know the awful truth.\n\n## D:III\n\nI am greeted to the third floor by a party of assorted weaklings, the least feeble of which was some orc brigand. Five of them or not, I dispatched them with ease. However, I ducked into cover at the sight of an orcish priest. I knew of Beogh, the Orc god. He is unusually interested in our world and gladly kills the enemies of his priests for them. I reviewed what I had with me for anything that could give me an edge upon him. I had nothing. He hadn't noticed me, and so I would avoid him for now. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, our paths crossed once more, and he noticed me. Somehow, I managed to avoid the wrath of the pig-man's god, and killed the heathen priest. I plucked his soul from the realm of Beogh and fed it to the Unformed, grinning with the irony. A second priest, possibly feeling the desecration of the former, charged out of the shadows of the cave. I slew this one as well, feeling a pleasurable surge of power with the kill. The Unformed was rewarding my deeds handsomely.\n\n**Summary:** A second level of the dungeon that was short but very dangerous. I nearly died twice there, taking on orc priests with their oh-so-evil smite power at only level four without the aid of wands or potions of any sort.\n\n## D:IV\n\nA welcome surprise. The opening room of the fourth level of the dungeon is free of fools bent on self-destruction, and contained a pair of yellowish drinks. Sampling one, my myriad scrapes and bruises instantly healed over. In the middle of a pen of filthy beasts, snakes and worms mostly, I found a robe which hummed, albeit faintly. I applied one of my scrolls of identification. The robe was cursed, and rather than protecting me, would amplify the damage my foes inflicted upon me. In return, it allowed me to see beyone what my eyes could percieve and protected me from electricity. I kept it, but did not put it on. Continuing, I found the entrance to a temple, but did not enter for my god cared little for altars. I, however, drank from the fountains surrounding it. My flesh immediately began to rot away and I drank the potion of healing I had to counter the effect. Nearby, I found a bone ring, which would protect me from cold. With a praise and a prayer to the Unformed, I put it on. Filled with a renewed zeal, the creatures of this place found themselves quickly hacked to pieces and their souls sent to the Unformed. My mistress rewarded me with a staff, which continually smoked. I had no more scrolls of identification, so I took it, but wielded it not. I've always been wary of sorcerers and that extends to their tools.\n\n**Summary:** I found a sucky randart, a staff, and a ring of protection from cold. Couldn't explore the level fully due to the presence of a teleportation trap in a corridor. Zero challenge from monsters.\n\n## A Reflection, Part II\n\nWhat I have not spoken of so far is what separates me from one such as yourself. I realize now that the men of my tribe were right to chase me away. But I have started on my path, and no one in my tribe will forgive me, given the creatures released from the gate no doubt killed them all. To anyone who saw me now I am a demon regardless. Most of my body is covered in the thickest sable scales, and what parts of me aren't are incredibly tough, and have taken on the hue of smoke, smoke made from burning rotted corpses.\n\n## D:V\n\nAfter consuming the souls of an imp of my Patroness's rival, Makhleb, and a hobgoblin slavishly loyal to it, I found a cloak which nearly completed my outfit. All that remains for me is a shield or buckler. I thank the Unformed for the protection she has granted upon my material form. As I finished the ritual butchery enslaving the eternal souls of the swine who dared to offer me so little satisfaction in slaying, a kobald burst through the door, peppering me with poisoned needles. I made his death slow. Examining his body, I found a ring of twisted silver. It proved uncursed, so I slipped it on. There was no immediate effect, and I had no scrolls of identification,so I set off still wearing it, to see if it would show its true colors. Four orcs and an imp later, I still did not know the effect. Later, I came upon a sleeping ogre, lying next to a pair of potions and a silver wand. For the first time, I felt apprehensive about my chances for success. But believing that the Unformed would fuel me with the strength to defeat the beast, I charged with a mighty battle cry and vanquished it. I sent it to the void in thanks to my Mistress.\n\nAnother ring! This time, a tube, and made of iron. It was uncursed, and switching it with the silver ring, I felt suddenly more able to dodge blows. I dispatched the remaining creatures with ease.\n\n**Summary:** A +4 ring of evasion, another ring, my first wand, and a couple of healing potions all awaited on D:V. The only fight that was any good was that of the ogre, but at level 6 I killed it pretty easily.\n\n## D:VI\n\nThe sixth room of the dungeon branched off into three separate areas. The first I tried contained only an ogre and an ant, which I killed without any injury to myself. The second I found myself between a snake and a scorpion, and slew them without too much trouble. I maimed a quartet of orcs gathered around a silver ring, and took it for myself, eating one of their bodies and sacrificing the others. In the third I came upon a room in which was clustered an ogre, a gelatinous ooze of some sort, a giant ant, a hobgoblin, and a goblin. Seeing a good opportunity to try my wand, I fired it at the ogre, resulting in a large explosion killing the jelly and maiming it. I backed off to a corridor and took the remainder on one by one. Beyond them I found an altar to the battle-master, Okawaru. I spat upon it.\n\n**Summary:** Yet another short level. The only loot was a mysterious ring. Okawaru would actually work pretty well as a god for Jati, but sadly I don't think I could handle Lugonu's punishments at level seven. Besides, I've got a story to write that doesn't include a change in god.\n\n## D:VII\n\nAs I descended, I found myself facing a kobald, a centaur, and the howling ghost of a berserk minotaur. Knowing they together would be enough to overcome me, I waited for the kobald to close with me, allowed it to follow me up the stairs, and slew it when we were alone. A different room of entry would be required. The second room was very near the first, and a giant ant, mauled by me, fled into it. I was terribly tempted to throw my spear after it, but I would want to retrieve it afterwards, and I could not do so. I had to try the third staircase. But coming upon the way back up, I saw the third staircase. All three were in a tight cluster. As I observed this, the centaur came around the corner and I killed it, retreating up the stairs to heal. The ghost of the minotaur will soon be shown what true rage is: The cold, dark fury of a soul nearly destroyed. In my battle with the apparition, I began to realize for the first time I was losing. I controlled my fury and read a scroll of teleportation...which moved me to a room filled with enemies, the highlights being a hippogriff, a giant beetle, and four gnolls. Killing off the minor creatures and the gnolls, and banishing the beetle to the abyss, I retreated up the stairs. Descending once more, I nearly killed a Jelly and lured the hippogriff upstairs, butchering it. I stole the bow off the corpse of a centaur wandering around the sixth level, knowing range would be an advantage against a berserker. My axe nearly ruined from fights against Jellies, (GODDAMIT!!!) I was forced to retreat to the eighth level and bypass this hellhole.\n\n**Summary:** One of the worst clusterf@$\\&s of a dungeon I've yet seen. A really, really strong minotaur berserker ghost, five Jellies, a hippogriff, and nine gnolls (more came), all in the area of the staircases. There was no way I could live through that.\n\n## D:VIII\n\nEarly in my exploration of this level, I picked up a book of minor summoning magic, and was then teleported by some trap. I came to a room filled with orcs. It seems this level may contain the legendary mines. I don't feel ready to go down to such a place yet, however. My confidence was somewhat increased by the slaying of a pair of orc warriors and wizards, but the warriors had also taken several blasts from my wand. From one of the legions of common orc brigands I slew, I took a weapon far too good for his hands: A trident which bursts into flame. Trying it, it seems far more effective than my axe, corroded as it is. I took also a very fine leather armor dyed red with blood. Orc blood. It occurred to me that with a spellbook in my possession, and the power of the Unformed, I should learn magic. After practicing spells on my scrolls, I felt ready. I managed to summon quite an armada of small animals before I heard a slurping noise. I cursed whatever foul entity populated this dungeon with so many of these infernal jellies, and set off to kill it before it multiplied. I found a trio, which corroded my new trident twice before my army of rats took them down. Tiring of the dungeon filled with Jellies, I left for the orcish mines.\n\n**Summary:** I hate jellies. More than I hate hydras. And I hate hydras a lot.\n\n## Orc Mines\n\nThe pig-men came at me, but could not match my ferocity or resolve, and found themselves given in tribute to the Unformed. The stories of their riches may be true, but such riches seem to have made the orcs decadent, and worthless as warriors. The only battle which stirred my blood was that of an enormous wolf, a warg they are called. But it too fell.\n\nDescending, I ran simultaneously into a warrior and wizard, and could not separate them. In the ensuing fight, I finally identified the trident I was using: to my surprise, it was negatively enchanted to begin with, and the Jellies had only worsened the problem. I switched to a war axe off the corpse of the warrior. A battle with a troll soon after forced me to teleport away, and I found myself inside a group of orcs. Nearly dead, I found this axe too was somewhat negatively enchanted. I prayed to the Unformed such inferior equipment could carry me through this trial. I had to flee many more times, as before my wounds could heal I found myself beset by more wizards and slave orc, an orc knight and warrior, and the troll, joined by another priest. I fled upstairs, through an escape hatch. Still near death, I came upon a trio of priests and their slaves. Somehow, by the Unformed's providence, I killed them, and the others in the area. But I realized I had no choice but to return to the fourth level. I was out of scrolls of teleportation, and suddenly I saw a sorcerer of the orcs. Even from a distance, I could tell he was greater than those before him. Our battle lasted hours, but he summoned demons and paralyzed me, and laughed as they ripped me to shreds.\n\n## A Reflection, Part III\n\nI have no regrets. My path of evil and butchery was decided by the gods before I was born. Would I change my actions, were I able? No. My little remaining lifeblood boils as it spills out, evaporating my softened feelings for my tribesmen like so much mist. If I had succeeded, they would have been butchered, and the world would have entered a new dark age at my wrath. I would have been a god. But I failed. My mistress must have known this. She was playing with me, as such is her nature. I deserve it for devoting myself to her. Now I find myself succumbing to the rage of the berserkers, not the channelled, precise fury I had before. I have failed myself as well.\n\n## My Thoughts\n\n```\nI feel that I played pretty well, though I was foolish at the end, not running away from the sorcerer. I didn't get very good loot, and what I did get was ruined by the ridiculous numbers of jellies in the dungeon. God, I hate those things. The orc mines were nastier than usual too, the last level containing countless wizards and priests, plus a troll, a knight, and a sorcerer. The experience amounts of the dungeon weren't that good, either. Most of the levels were zero challenge, or constant near death experiences. I would say I died of stupidity, but I was pretty much doomed anyway.\n```\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<meta

Scorned by my own tribe for crimes I did not commit, men I once called 'brother' chased me from what was once my family's home. As I fled those base brutes, I prayed to the foreign goddess of the creatures that created me. The sky turned sickly, the colors of a deathly infection, and what I can only describe as a horrific rip in reality opened up in front of me. Even as the spawn of the Abyss poured out, I did not hesitate to jump in. And so it is that I find myself newly loyal to a goddess of evil, dedicated to destroying all that I once worked so hard to preserve. I stand betrayed, and my tribe, nay, the world will feel my wrath and tremble at my coming. I am filled with bitterness that I find myself vowing to desecrate all purity, to tear down all that is built up. But I will not tolerate such an injustice that I have received.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Abyss\">Abyss</span></h2>\n<p>As I finish the rites binding my soul to my patroness, who has informed me that I shall refer to her as the Unformed, the odd light of the Abyss changed somehow in tone. The monsters here are no longer ignoring me, either. It seems the Unformed is already testing my prowess. She will not be disappointed. I ventured around this palace of horrors, searching for something useful before I return to reality. My diligent searching was rewarded by a small sum of gold and an odd scroll that buzzes with energy. However, I now have sighted a pair of...things. Piles of flesh conglomerated together, animated somehow and moving swiftly towards me. I forged a gate to reality with my new powers, and found reality disconcerting after so many hours in chaos.\n</p><p><b>Summary:</b> I scored 20 gold and a scroll, then got chased out of the abyss by a pair of small abominations.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"D:I\">D:I</span></h2>\n<p>The Unformed has spoken to me, telling me what I shall do to exact my revenge. I have found myself in a dungeon. The Unformed reveals to me that at the bottom, an Orb of immense, unshaped power awaits me. I set off immediately, though I found myself stumbling and unable to focus my eyes properly at first. An insect set upon me, but afforded me neither challenge nor satiation in slaying. Feeling invincible, I read the contents of the scroll, and my axe glowed with a bloody light. I offered the pathetic creature I slew to the Unformed, and it disappeared. I can feel the Unformed's approval. In return for the killing of a few beasts, the Unformed placed a golden helmet before me. Trying it on, it fit perfectly, and the leering demon of the mask matches the burning of my soul perfectly. Guarded by a pair of large newts and a goblin which prodded them about via a crude goad, I found protective boots and gloves. After putting them on, two more scrawny goblins and a kobald emerged from the darkness and nearly slew me. But with perseverance, faith, and fury I made a bloody tribute to the Unformed out of them. The kobald had a robe of the finest make upon him, and I took it for myself. Upon examination, it was much more resilient than any fabric is naturally. Little else on the first floor is worth mentioning.\n</p><p><b>Summary:</b> I SCORED for D:1. The scroll was enchant weapon II, making my axe +3 +2, I got a +2 robe, a helmet, gloves, and boots. The Gobs and Kobald was a close call, but in my defense it was three on one and I was only level one at the time.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"D:II\">D:II</span></h2>\n<p>I descended to the second level, and killed a pair of jackals left guarding the staircase. Another foolish soul, a snake, rushed for my throat, but after a few blows I sent it slithering away. Giving chase, It led me to a trio of Gnolls, no doubt the masters of the beasts. I was forced to retreat to the first level again. Praying it would take me to a different section of the dungeon, I took a second staircase and saw I was alone. Thanking the Unformed for my place of refuge, I explored. After some time trouncing the reptiles that infest this place, I saw the same snake as before. I ran it down in a corridor, and feasted on its blood. The gnolls again found me at this point, forcing me to again retreat upstairs, this time followed by a jackal easily dispatched. Returning to the second level through a third and final staircase, I came to the room the gnolls had occupied. I saw what they wanted to keep safe. A veritable library of scrolls, all pulsing with faint magic force. I saw only one that I recognized, the scroll which illuminated my axe and sharpened its edge. I was pleased to see it worked a second time. As for the other scrolls, one melded my gloves with my fingers, and another removed the curse. A third made an awful, deafening noise. The remainder seemed to have no effect. After relocating the gnolls, I lured them one by one and dispatched them. The Unformed took their souls with pleasure.\n</p><p><b>Summary:</b> D:2 was small, and had four gnolls (I know I said three, I found the fourth later) in it. For a level two character, this is an ugly combination. I was forced to fight a hit and run war with them, and the only real treasure was a room full of decent scrolls.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_Reflection\">A Reflection</span></h2>\n<p>As I sit, nursing my wounds, I reflect on what led me to this place. My mother was a sinner, of that there is no doubt. She willfully participated in intercourse with a demonspawn of the Unformed, my mistress, and created me. When she finally told me the truth, (She had told me previously my father had been a \"beautiful traveling tradesman\") I was horrified but somehow not surprised. I had always been different from other children, staring at things that piqued my interest for no reason, and feeling uncomfortable in the presence of priests. Despite this, I took my mother's advice and devoted myself to Zin. Odd how she tried to make me something better than I was. I have left Zin now, for one of his mortal enemies, and nothing adverse has happened to me. Rather, I am much stronger than I have ever been. I think this is because Zin scorned my worship from the start. Of course he would know the awful truth. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"D:III\">D:III</span></h2>\n<p>I am greeted to the third floor by a party of assorted weaklings, the least feeble of which was some orc brigand. Five of them or not, I dispatched them with ease. However, I ducked into cover at the sight of an orcish priest. I knew of Beogh, the Orc god. He is unusually interested in our world and gladly kills the enemies of his priests for them. I reviewed what I had with me for anything that could give me an edge upon him. I had nothing. He hadn't noticed me, and so I would avoid him for now. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, our paths crossed once more, and he noticed me. Somehow, I managed to avoid the wrath of the pig-man's god, and killed the heathen priest. I plucked his soul from the realm of Beogh and fed it to the Unformed, grinning with the irony. A second priest, possibly feeling the desecration of the former, charged out of the shadows of the cave. I slew this one as well, feeling a pleasurable surge of power with the kill. The Unformed was rewarding my deeds handsomely.\n</p><p><b>Summary:</b> A second level of the dungeon that was short but very dangerous. I nearly died twice there, taking on orc priests with their oh-so-evil smite power at only level four without the aid of wands or potions of any sort. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"D:IV\">D:IV</span></h2>\n<p>A welcome surprise. The opening room of the fourth level of the dungeon is free of fools bent on self-destruction, and contained a pair of yellowish drinks. Sampling one, my myriad scrapes and bruises instantly healed over. In the middle of a pen of filthy beasts, snakes and worms mostly, I found a robe which hummed, albeit faintly. I applied one of my scrolls of identification. The robe was cursed, and rather than protecting me, would amplify the damage my foes inflicted upon me. In return, it allowed me to see beyone what my eyes could percieve and protected me from electricity. I kept it, but did not put it on. Continuing, I found the entrance to a temple, but did not enter for my god cared little for altars. I, however, drank from the fountains surrounding it. My flesh immediately began to rot away and I drank the potion of healing I had to counter the effect. Nearby, I found a bone ring, which would protect me from cold. With a praise and a prayer to the Unformed, I put it on. Filled with a renewed zeal, the creatures of this place found themselves quickly hacked to pieces and their souls sent to the Unformed. My mistress rewarded me with a staff, which continually smoked. I had no more scrolls of identification, so I took it, but wielded it not. I've always been wary of sorcerers and that extends to their tools. \n</p><p><b>Summary:</b> I found a sucky randart, a staff, and a ring of protection from cold. Couldn't explore the level fully due to the presence of a teleportation trap in a corridor. Zero challenge from monsters.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_Reflection.2C_Part_II\">A Reflection, Part II</span></h2>\n<p>What I have not spoken of so far is what separates me from one such as yourself. I realize now that the men of my tribe were right to chase me away. But I have started on my path, and no one in my tribe will forgive me, given the creatures released from the gate no doubt killed them all. To anyone who saw me now I am a demon regardless. Most of my body is covered in the thickest sable scales, and what parts of me aren't are incredibly tough, and have taken on the hue of smoke, smoke made from burning rotted corpses.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"D:V\">D:V</span></h2>\n<p>After consuming the souls of an imp of my Patroness's rival, Makhleb, and a hobgoblin slavishly loyal to it, I found a cloak which nearly completed my outfit. All that remains for me is a shield or buckler. I thank the Unformed for the protection she has granted upon my material form. As I finished the ritual butchery enslaving the eternal souls of the swine who dared to offer me so little satisfaction in slaying, a kobald burst through the door, peppering me with poisoned needles. I made his death slow. Examining his body, I found a ring of twisted silver. It proved uncursed, so I slipped it on. There was no immediate effect, and I had no scrolls of identification,so I set off still wearing it, to see if it would show its true colors. Four orcs and an imp later, I still did not know the effect. Later, I came upon a sleeping ogre, lying next to a pair of potions and a silver wand. For the first time, I felt apprehensive about my chances for success. But believing that the Unformed would fuel me with the strength to defeat the beast, I charged with a mighty battle cry and vanquished it. I sent it to the void in thanks to my Mistress. \n</p><p>Another ring! This time, a tube, and made of iron. It was uncursed, and switching it with the silver ring, I felt suddenly more able to dodge blows. I dispatched the remaining creatures with ease.\n</p><p><b>Summary:</b> A +4 ring of evasion, another ring, my first wand, and a couple of healing potions all awaited on D:V. The only fight that was any good was that of the ogre, but at level 6 I killed it pretty easily.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"D:VI\">D:VI</span></h2>\n<p>The sixth room of the dungeon branched off into three separate areas. The first I tried contained only an ogre and an ant, which I killed without any injury to myself. The second I found myself between a snake and a scorpion, and slew them without too much trouble. I maimed a quartet of orcs gathered around a silver ring, and took it for myself, eating one of their bodies and sacrificing the others. In the third I came upon a room in which was clustered an ogre, a gelatinous ooze of some sort, a giant ant, a hobgoblin, and a goblin. Seeing a good opportunity to try my wand, I fired it at the ogre, resulting in a large explosion killing the jelly and maiming it. I backed off to a corridor and took the remainder on one by one. Beyond them I found an altar to the battle-master, Okawaru. I spat upon it.\n</p><p><b>Summary:</b> Yet another short level. The only loot was a mysterious ring. Okawaru would actually work pretty well as a god for Jati, but sadly I don't think I could handle Lugonu's punishments at level seven. Besides, I've got a story to write that doesn't include a change in god.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"D:VII\">D:VII</span></h2>\n<p>As I descended, I found myself facing a kobald, a centaur, and the howling ghost of a berserk minotaur. Knowing they together would be enough to overcome me, I waited for the kobald to close with me, allowed it to follow me up the stairs, and slew it when we were alone. A different room of entry would be required. The second room was very near the first, and a giant ant, mauled by me, fled into it. I was terribly tempted to throw my spear after it, but I would want to retrieve it afterwards, and I could not do so. I had to try the third staircase. But coming upon the way back up, I saw the third staircase. All three were in a tight cluster. As I observed this, the centaur came around the corner and I killed it, retreating up the stairs to heal. The ghost of the minotaur will soon be shown what true rage is: The cold, dark fury of a soul nearly destroyed. In my battle with the apparition, I began to realize for the first time I was losing. I controlled my fury and read a scroll of teleportation...which moved me to a room filled with enemies, the highlights being a hippogriff, a giant beetle, and four gnolls. Killing off the minor creatures and the gnolls, and banishing the beetle to the abyss, I retreated up the stairs. Descending once more, I nearly killed a Jelly and lured the hippogriff upstairs, butchering it. I stole the bow off the corpse of a centaur wandering around the sixth level, knowing range would be an advantage against a berserker. My axe nearly ruined from fights against Jellies, (GODDAMIT!!!) I was forced to retreat to the eighth level and bypass this hellhole.\n</p><p><b>Summary:</b> One of the worst clusterf@$&amp;s of a dungeon I've yet seen. A really, really strong minotaur berserker ghost, five Jellies, a hippogriff, and nine gnolls (more came), all in the area of the staircases. There was no way I could live through that.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"D:VIII\">D:VIII</span></h2>\n<p>Early in my exploration of this level, I picked up a book of minor summoning magic, and was then teleported by some trap. I came to a room filled with orcs. It seems this level may contain the legendary mines. I don't feel ready to go down to such a place yet, however. My confidence was somewhat increased by the slaying of a pair of orc warriors and wizards, but the warriors had also taken several blasts from my wand. From one of the legions of common orc brigands I slew, I took a weapon far too good for his hands: A trident which bursts into flame. Trying it, it seems far more effective than my axe, corroded as it is. I took also a very fine leather armor dyed red with blood. Orc blood. It occurred to me that with a spellbook in my possession, and the power of the Unformed, I should learn magic. After practicing spells on my scrolls, I felt ready. I managed to summon quite an armada of small animals before I heard a slurping noise. I cursed whatever foul entity populated this dungeon with so many of these infernal jellies, and set off to kill it before it multiplied. I found a trio, which corroded my new trident twice before my army of rats took them down. Tiring of the dungeon filled with Jellies, I left for the orcish mines.\n</p><p><b>Summary:</b> I hate jellies. More than I hate hydras. And I hate hydras a lot.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Orc_Mines\">Orc Mines</span></h2>\n<p>The pig-men came at me, but could not match my ferocity or resolve, and found themselves given in tribute to the Unformed. The stories of their riches may be true, but such riches seem to have made the orcs decadent, and worthless as warriors. The only battle which stirred my blood was that of an enormous wolf, a warg they are called. But it too fell.\n</p><p>Descending, I ran simultaneously into a warrior and wizard, and could not separate them. In the ensuing fight, I finally identified the trident I was using: to my surprise, it was negatively enchanted to begin with, and the Jellies had only worsened the problem. I switched to a war axe off the corpse of the warrior. A battle with a troll soon after forced me to teleport away, and I found myself inside a group of orcs. Nearly dead, I found this axe too was somewhat negatively enchanted. I prayed to the Unformed such inferior equipment could carry me through this trial. I had to flee many more times, as before my wounds could heal I found myself beset by more wizards and slave orc, an orc knight and warrior, and the troll, joined by another priest. I fled upstairs, through an escape hatch. Still near death, I came upon a trio of priests and their slaves. Somehow, by the Unformed's providence, I killed them, and the others in the area. But I realized I had no choice but to return to the fourth level. I was out of scrolls of teleportation, and suddenly I saw a sorcerer of the orcs. Even from a distance, I could tell he was greater than those before him. Our battle lasted hours, but he summoned demons and paralyzed me, and laughed as they ripped me to shreds. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_Reflection.2C_Part_III\">A Reflection, Part III</span></h2>\n<p>I have no regrets. My path of evil and butchery was decided by the gods before I was born. Would I change my actions, were I able? No. My little remaining lifeblood boils as it spills out, evaporating my softened feelings for my tribesmen like so much mist. If I had succeeded, they would have been butchered, and the world would have entered a new dark age at my wrath. I would have been a god. But I failed. My mistress must have known this. She was playing with me, as such is her nature. I deserve it for devoting myself to her. Now I find myself succumbing to the rage of the berserkers, not the channelled, precise fury I had before. I have failed myself as well.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"My_Thoughts\">My Thoughts</span></h2>\n<pre>I feel that I played pretty well, though I was foolish at the end, not running away from the sorcerer. I didn't get very good loot, and what I did get was ruined by the ridiculous numbers of jellies in the dungeon. God, I hate those things. The orc mines were nastier than usual too, the last level containing countless wizards and priests, plus a troll, a knight, and a sorcerer. The experience amounts of the dungeon weren't that good, either. Most of the levels were zero challenge, or constant near death experiences. I would say I died of stupidity, but I was pretty much doomed anyway.\n</pre>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20240916223645\nCache expiry: 86400\nDynamic content: false\n[SMW] In‐text

Some of the events in what follows are not exactly what happened in the Crawl game. One of the following will usually apply: \n\na) The first game I played, I got dropped in the abyss right away by a ynoximul, so it didn't count.\n\nb) This is being wrote very late/very early, depends on how you look at it. My recollection can get fuzzy. Or, most commonly,\n\nc) The way I \"put it\" in the diary makes for a better story. Deal with it.\n\nThe summary at the bottom of each section ('cept the prologue) tells you what happened, in plain english.\n== Prologue ==\nI stand betrayed. Scorned by my own tribe for crimes I did not commit, men I once called 'brother' chased me from what was once my family's home. As I fled those base brutes, I prayed to the foreign goddess of the creatures that created me. The sky turned sickly, the colors of a deathly infection, and what I can only describe as a horrific rip in reality opened up in front of me. Even as the spawn of the Abyss poured out, I did not hesitate to jump in. And so it is that I find myself newly loyal to a goddess of evil, dedicated to destroying all that I once worked so hard to preserve. I stand betrayed, and my tribe, nay, the world will feel my wrath and tremble at my coming. I am filled with bitterness that I find myself vowing to desecrate all purity, to tear down all that is built up. But I will not tolerate such an injustice that I have received.\n\n== Abyss ==\nAs I finish the rites binding my soul to my patroness, who has informed me that I shall refer to her as the Unformed, the odd light of the Abyss changed somehow in tone. The monsters here are no longer ignoring me, either. It seems the Unformed is already testing my prowess. She will not be disappointed. I ventured around this palace of horrors, searching for something useful before I return to reality. My diligent searching was rewarded by a small sum of gold and an odd scroll that buzzes with energy. However, I now have sighted a pair of...things. Piles of flesh conglomerated together, animated somehow and moving swiftly towards me. I forged a gate to reality with my new powers, and found reality disconcerting after so many hours in chaos.\n\n'''Summary:''' I scored 20 gold and a scroll, then got chased out of the abyss by a pair of small abominations.\n== D:I ==\nThe Unformed has spoken to me, telling me what I shall do to exact my revenge. I have found myself in a dungeon. The Unformed reveals to me that at the bottom, an Orb of immense, unshaped power awaits me. I set off immediately, though I found myself stumbling and unable to focus my eyes properly at first. An insect set upon me, but afforded me neither challenge nor satiation in slaying. Feeling invincible, I read the contents of the scroll, and my axe glowed with a bloody light. I offered the pathetic creature I slew to the Unformed, and it disappeared. I can feel the Unformed's approval. In return for the killing of a few beasts, the Unformed placed a golden helmet before me. Trying it on, it fit perfectly, and the leering demon of the mask matches the burning of my soul perfectly. Guarded by a pair of large newts and a goblin which prodded them about via a crude goad, I found protective boots and gloves. After putting them on, two more scrawny goblins and a kobald emerged from the darkness and nearly slew me. But with perseverance, faith, and fury I made a bloody tribute to the Unformed out of them. The kobald had a robe of the finest make upon him, and I took it for myself. Upon examination, it was much more resilient than any fabric is naturally. Little else on the first floor is worth mentioning.\n\n'''Summary:''' I SCORED for D:1. The scroll was enchant weapon II, making my axe +3 +2, I got a +2 robe, a helmet, gloves, and boots. The Gobs and Kobald was a close call, but in my defense it was three on one and I was only level one at the time.\n\n== D:II ==\nI descended to the second level, and killed a pair of jackals left guarding the staircase. Another foolish soul, a snake, rushed for my throat, but after a few blows I sent it slithering away. Giving chase, It led me to a trio of Gnolls, no doubt the masters of the beasts. I was forced to retreat to the first level again. Praying it would take me to a different section of the dungeon, I took a second staircase and saw I was alone. Thanking the Unformed for my place of refuge, I explored. After some time trouncing the reptiles that infest this place, I saw the same snake as before. I ran it down in a corridor, and feasted on its blood. The gnolls again found me at this point, forcing me to again retreat upstairs, this time followed by a jackal easily dispatched. Returning to the second level through a third and final staircase, I came to the room the gnolls had occupied. I saw what they wanted to keep safe. A veritable library of scrolls, all pulsing with faint magic force. I saw only one that I recognized, the scroll which illuminated my axe and sharpened its edge. I was pleased to see it worked a second time. As for the other scrolls, one melded my gloves with my fingers, and another removed the curse. A third made an awful, deafening noise. The remainder seemed to have no effect. After relocating the gnolls, I lured them one by one and dispatched them. The Unformed took their souls with pleasure.\n\n'''Summary:''' D:2 was small, and had four gnolls (I know I said three, I found the fourth later) in it. For a level two character, this is an ugly combination. I was forced to fight a hit and run war with them, and the only real treasure was a room full of decent scrolls.\n\n== A Reflection == \nAs I sit, nursing my wounds, I reflect on what led me to this place. My mother was a sinner, of that there is no doubt. She willfully participated in intercourse with a demonspawn of the Unformed, my mistress, and created me. When she finally told me the truth, (She had told me previously my father had been a \"beautiful traveling tradesman\") I was horrified but somehow not surprised. I had always been different from other children, staring at things that piqued my interest for no reason, and feeling uncomfortable in the presence of priests. Despite this, I took my mother's advice and devoted myself to Zin. Odd how she tried to make me something better than I was. I have left Zin now, for one of his mortal enemies, and nothing adverse has happened to me. Rather, I am much stronger than I have ever been. I think this is because Zin scorned my worship from the start. Of course he would know the awful truth. \n\n== D:III ==\nI am greeted to the third floor by a party of assorted weaklings, the least feeble of which was some orc brigand. Five of them or not, I dispatched them with ease. However, I ducked into cover at the sight of an orcish priest. I knew of Beogh, the Orc god. He is unusually interested in our world and gladly kills the enemies of his priests for them. I reviewed what I had with me for anything that could give me an edge upon him. I had nothing. He hadn't noticed me, and so I would avoid him for now. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, our paths crossed once more, and he noticed me. Somehow, I managed to avoid the wrath of the pig-man's god, and killed the heathen priest. I plucked his soul from the realm of Beogh and fed it to the Unformed, grinning with the irony. A second priest, possibly feeling the desecration of the former, charged out of the shadows of the cave. I slew this one as well, feeling a pleasurable surge of power with the kill. The Unformed was rewarding my deeds handsomely.\n\n'''Summary:''' A second level of the dungeon that was short but very dangerous. I nearly died twice there, taking on orc priests with their oh-so-evil smite power at only level four without the aid of wands or potions of any sort. \n\n== D:IV ==\nA welcome surprise. The opening room of the fourth level of the dungeon is free of fools bent on self-destruction, and contained a pair of yellowish drinks. Sampling one, my myriad scrapes and bruises instantly healed over. In the middle of a pen of filthy beasts, snakes and worms mostly, I found a robe which hummed, albeit faintly. I applied one of my scrolls of identification. The robe was cursed, and rather than protecting me, would amplify the damage my foes inflicted upon me. In return, it allowed me to see beyone what my eyes could percieve and protected me from electricity. I kept it, but did not put it on. Continuing, I found the entrance to a temple, but did not enter for my god cared little for altars. I, however, drank from the fountains surrounding it. My flesh immediately began to rot away and I drank the potion of healing I had to counter the effect. Nearby, I found a bone ring, which would protect me from cold. With a praise and a prayer to the Unformed, I put it on. Filled with a renewed zeal, the creatures of this place found themselves quickly hacked to pieces and their souls sent to the Unformed. My mistress rewarded me with a staff, which continually smoked. I had no more scrolls of identification, so I took it, but wielded it not. I've always been wary of sorcerers and that extends to their tools. \n\n'''Summary:''' I found a sucky randart, a staff, and a ring of protection from cold. Couldn't explore the level fully due to the presence of a teleportation trap in a corridor. Zero challenge from monsters.\n\n== A Reflection, Part II ==\nWhat I have not spoken of so far is what separates me from one such as yourself. I realize now that the men of my tribe were right to chase me away. But I have started on my path, and no one in my tribe will forgive me, given the creatures released from the gate no doubt killed them all. To anyone who saw me now I am a demon regardless. Most of my body is covered in the thickest sable scales, and what parts of me aren't are incredibly tough, and have taken on the hue of smoke, smoke made from burning rotted corpses.\n\n== D:V ==\nAfter consuming the souls of an imp of my Patroness's rival, Makhleb, and a hobgoblin slavishly loyal to it, I found a cloak which nearly completed my outfit. All that remains for me is a shield or buckler. I thank the Unformed for the protection she has granted upon my material form. As I finished the ritual butchery enslaving the eternal souls of the swine who dared to offer me so little satisfaction in slaying, a kobald burst through the door, peppering me with poisoned needles. I made his death slow. Examining his body, I found a ring of twisted silver. It proved uncursed, so I slipped it on. There was no immediate effect, and I had no scrolls of identification,so I set off still wearing it, to see if it would show its true colors. Four orcs and an imp later, I still did not know the effect. Later, I came upon a sleeping ogre, lying next to a pair of potions and a silver wand. For the first time, I felt apprehensive about my chances for success. But believing that the Unformed would fuel me with the strength to defeat the beast, I charged with a mighty battle cry and vanquished it. I sent it to the void in thanks to my Mistress. \n\nAnother ring! This time, a tube, and made of iron. It was uncursed, and switching it with the silver ring, I felt suddenly more able to dodge blows. I dispatched the remaining creatures with ease.\n\n'''Summary:''' A +4 ring of evasion, another ring, my first wand, and a couple of healing potions all awaited on D:V. The only fight that was any good was that of the ogre, but at level 6 I killed it pretty easily.\n\n== D:VI ==\nThe sixth room of the dungeon branched off into three separate areas. The first I tried contained only an ogre and an ant, which I killed without any injury to myself. The second I found myself between a snake and a scorpion, and slew them without too much trouble. I maimed a quartet of orcs gathered around a silver ring, and took it for myself, eating one of their bodies and sacrificing the others. In the third I came upon a room in which was clustered an ogre, a gelatinous ooze of some sort, a giant ant, a hobgoblin, and a goblin. Seeing a good opportunity to try my wand, I fired it at the ogre, resulting in a large explosion killing the jelly and maiming it. I backed off to a corridor and took the remainder on one by one. Beyond them I found an altar to the battle-master, Okawaru. I spat upon it.\n\n'''Summary:''' Yet another short level. The only loot was a mysterious ring. Okawaru would actually work pretty well as a god for Jati, but sadly I don't think I could handle Lugonu's punishments at level seven. Besides, I've got a story to write that doesn't include a change in god.\n\n== D:VII ==\nAs I descended, I found myself facing a kobald, a centaur, and the howling ghost of a berserk minotaur. Knowing they together would be enough to overcome me, I waited for the kobald to close with me, allowed it to follow me up the stairs, and slew it when we were alone. A different room of entry would be required. The second room was very near the first, and a giant ant, mauled by me, fled into it. I was terribly tempted to throw my spear after it, but I would want to retrieve it afterwards, and I could not do so. I had to try the third staircase. But coming upon the way back up, I saw the third staircase. All three were in a tight cluster. As I observed this, the centaur came around the corner and I killed it, retreating up the stairs to heal. The ghost of the minotaur will soon be shown what true rage is: The cold, dark fury of a soul nearly destroyed. In my battle with the apparition, I began to realize for the first time I was losing. I controlled my fury and read a scroll of teleportation...which moved me to a room filled with enemies, the highlights being a hippogriff, a giant beetle, and four gnolls. Killing off the minor creatures and the gnolls, and banishing the beetle to the abyss, I retreated up the stairs. Descending once more, I nearly killed a Jelly and lured the hippogriff upstairs, butchering it. I stole the bow off the corpse of a centaur wandering around the sixth level, knowing range would be an advantage against a berserker. My axe nearly ruined from fights against Jellies, (GODDAMIT!!!) I was forced to retreat to the eighth level and bypass this hellhole.\n\n'''Summary:''' One of the worst clusterf@$&s of a dungeon I've yet seen. A really, really strong minotaur berserker ghost, five Jellies, a hippogriff, and nine gnolls (more came), all in the area of the staircases. There was no way I could live through that.\n\n== D:VIII ==\nEarly in my exploration of this level, I picked up a book of minor summoning magic, and was then teleported by some trap. I came to a room filled with orcs. It seems this level may contain the legendary mines. I don't feel ready to go down to such a place yet, however. My confidence was somewhat increased by the slaying of a pair of orc warriors and wizards, but the warriors had also taken several blasts from my wand. From one of the legions of common orc brigands I slew, I took a weapon far too good for his hands: A trident which bursts into flame. Trying it, it seems far more effective than my axe, corroded as it is. I took also a very fine leather armor dyed red with blood. Orc blood. It occurred to me that with a spellbook in my possession, and the power of the Unformed, I should learn magic. After practicing spells on my scrolls, I felt ready. I managed to summon quite an armada of small animals before I heard a slurping noise. I cursed whatever foul entity populated this dungeon with so many of these infernal jellies, and set off to kill it before it multiplied. I found a trio, which corroded my new trident twice before my army of rats took them down. Tiring of the dungeon filled with Jellies, I left for the orcish mines.\n\n'''Summary:''' I hate jellies. More than I hate hydras. And I hate hydras a lot.\n\n== Orc Mines ==\nThe pig-men came at me, but could not match my ferocity or resolve, and found themselves given in tribute to the Unformed. The stories of their riches may be true, but such riches seem to have made the orcs decadent, and worthless as warriors. The only battle which stirred my blood was that of an enormous wolf, a warg they are called. But it too fell.\n\nDescending, I ran simultaneously into a warrior and wizard, and could not separate them. In the ensuing fight, I finally identified the trident I was using: to my surprise, it was negatively enchanted to begin with, and the Jellies had only worsened the problem. I switched to a war axe off the corpse of the warrior. A battle with a troll soon after forced me to teleport away, and I found myself inside a group of orcs. Nearly dead, I found this axe too was somewhat negatively enchanted. I prayed to the Unformed such inferior equipment could carry me through this trial. I had to flee many more times, as before my wounds could heal I found myself beset by more wizards and slave orc, an orc knight and warrior, and the troll, joined by another priest. I fled upstairs, through an escape hatch. Still near death, I came upon a trio of priests and their slaves. Somehow, by the Unformed's providence, I killed them, and the others in the area. But I realized I had no choice but to return to the fourth level. I was out of scrolls of teleportation, and suddenly I saw a sorcerer of the orcs. Even from a distance, I could tell he was greater than those before him. Our battle lasted hours, but he summoned demons and paralyzed me, and laughed as they ripped me to shreds. \n\n== A Reflection, Part III ==\nI have no regrets. My path of evil and butchery was decided by the gods before I was born. Would I change my actions, were I able? No. My little remaining lifeblood boils as it spills out, evaporating my softened feelings for my tribesmen like so much mist. If I had succeeded, they would have been butchered, and the world would have entered a new dark age at my wrath. I would have been a god. But I failed. My mistress must have known this. She was playing with me, as such is her nature. I deserve it for devoting myself to her. Now I find myself succumbing to the rage of the berserkers, not the channelled, precise fury I had before. I have failed myself as well.\n\n\n== My Thoughts ==\n I feel that I played pretty well, though I was foolish at the end, not running away from the sorcerer. I didn't get very good loot, and what I did get was ruined by the ridiculous numbers of jellies in the dungeon. God, I hate those things. The orc mines were nastier than usual too, the last level containing countless wizards and priests, plus a troll, a knight, and a sorcerer. The experience amounts of the dungeon weren't that good, either. Most of the levels were zero challenge, or constant near death experiences. I would say I died of stupidity, but I was pretty much doomed anyway."}

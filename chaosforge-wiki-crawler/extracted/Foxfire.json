{"title":"Foxfire","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Foxfire","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''This page refers to the spell. If you were looking for the [[card]] formerly known as Foxfire, see [[Swarm card]].''\n{{spell info}}{{AttackSpell\n|name=Foxfire\n|formula = 2 x 1d(4 + power/5)\n|maxdmg = 2 x 1d9 [[fire]]\n|maxsp = 25\n|range = LOS\n|target = Special\n|tohit = Never misses\n|special = Needs open space to spawn and move}}\n'''Foxfire''' is a Level 1 [[Conjurations]]/[[Fire Magic]] spell that conjures two [[foxfire (monster)|foxfires]].\n\n[[Fire Elementalist]]s start with Foxfire memorized.\n\n==Useful Info==\nFoxfire attempts to create 2 [[foxfire (monster)|foxfire entities]] on empty tiles (no monsters, [[wall]]s, etc.) adjacent to the caster. If there are no valid tiles, they fail to spawn. Foxfires travel at [[Movement#Monster Speed|speed]] 30 towards nearby monsters. They move like any other monster, so they need an unobstructed path to a target. On impact, it deals [[evasion|unavoidable]] [[fire]] damage. Foxfires [[fly]] and can [[see invisible]].\n\nFoxfires dissipate harmlessly after 8 actions without doing anything, if they leave your [[LOS]], or if the caster moves onto its tile. As conjured entities, you can create Foxfires under [[Okawaru]] or [[Ru]]'s Sacrifice Love.\n\n==Strategy==\nFoxfire requires a somewhat open space (or at least, a path to monsters) for full effect. You should be very wary around corridors, since (at most) 1 foxfire can hit an enemy:\n\n .#.#.    .#m#.    .#.#.  \n .#m#.    .#f#.    .#.#.  \n .#@#.    .#@#.    .#m#.  \n .#f#.    .#f#.    .#@f.\n .#.#.    .#.#.    .####<br><br>m = monster<br>f = foxfire \n\nIn the leftmost scenario, using Foxfire does nothing. In the middle and right scenarios, only 1 foxfire can hit the monster. If you're stuck adjacent to a monster in a corridor (and can't use [[Scorch]]), the best thing you can do is stand in a corner or intersection, where foxfires can move diagonally towards the target. Also, getting surrounded by monsters can lead you to the same situation - avoid this whenever possible.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Despite their low damage, Foxfire can remain useful for some time - it can't miss and can target invisible creatures. Many threats up to [[the Lair]] can be dealt with by standing in the open and conjuring a stream of foxfires. They falter against creatures with high [[AC]], as two foxfires check AC twice.\n*Like many fire spells, Foxfire creates [[steam]] when striking creatures that are in [[water]], making it useful for fighting early swimming enemies like [[adder]]s or [[electric eel]]s. Conversely, they dissipate [[freezing cloud]]s on impact.\n*Be wary about casting Foxfire around fire-resistant or -immune monsters, as foxfires make no effort to avoid foes they cannot harm.\n*Because foxfires technically count as creatures, this spell can help block line of effect to monsters with dangerous spells like [[Banishment]], [[Petrify]], [[Malmutate]], or [[Orb of Destruction]]. However, this is not as effective as simply [[summon]]ing a meat shield, as foxfires move quickly and erratically and disappear once they strike something.\n\n==Monster Version==\nMonsters have access to the [[Marshlight]] spell, which is functionally identical, but does more damage.\n\n{{monsters with spell|Marshlight}}\n\n[[Player ghost]]s won't cast Foxfire or Marshlight, however.\n\n==History==\n*Foxfire was added in [[0.25]].\n*In early development, you couldn't pass through conjured foxfires."}

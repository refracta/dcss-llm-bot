{"title":"Great orb of eyes","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Great_orb_of_eyes","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{list of | eyeballs}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Great orbs of eyes''' are annoying spellcasting monsters with high [[willpower]]. They can be found in the middle- to late-[[Dungeon]], [[the Slime Pits]], and [[the Vaults]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Most of the threat comes from its spells. Having high [[willpower]] prevents most spells from affecting you, making them little more than marginally dangerous melee enemies. But if you don't have high will, they are ''very'' scary threats - [[polymorph]] is often a dangerous effect.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.31]], they had [[Paralyse]] and [[Drain Magic]] instead of [[Vitrify]] and [[Polymorph]]. Also, their HD was 1 lower. \n*Prior to [[0.17]], they could [[Teleport Other]]."}

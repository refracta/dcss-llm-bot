{"title":"Tzitzimitl","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Tzitzimitl","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Tzitzimimeh''' are one of the most versatile among fiends, posing a threat to characters whether they're living or [[undead]]. While [[negative energy resistance]] helps reduce the effects of most of their attacks, [[torment]] and [[Dispel Undead]] always sting. They can be found in [[Pandemonium]] and the [[Hell]]s (primarily [[Tartarus]] and summoned by [[Ereshkigal]]), and some monsters may summon them with the [[Summon Greater Demon]] spell.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nThis is the only fiend against which being undead does is not a guaranteed upside - in fact, it is possibly more dangerous to be so, given that Dispel Undead deals as much damage as [[Iron Shot]] but bypasses AC, EV and any resistances. If you are undead, keep them at the edge of LOS or behind other monsters and pelt them from afar with ranged attacks. Fortunately, their multiplicity of spells makes them torment slightly less often than other fiends, and having rN+++ greatly reduces the threat they pose. Use a [[holy wrath]] weapon or high-powered non-elemental conjurations to dispatch them, for they have no specific vulnerabilities.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], Tzitzimimeh had [[Bolt of Cold]] in their spell lists.\n*Prior to its removal in [[0.26]], Tzitzimimeh had [[rot]]ting melee attacks.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], Tzitzimimeh casted [[Dispel Undead]] instead of [[Dispel Undead Range]], which was functionally equivalent.\n*Prior to [[0.19]], Tzitzimitl melee created [[miasma]], instead of slowing and rotting victims. \n*Prior to [[0.18]], they were called Shadow Fiends, who lacked miasma attacks and had less HD.\n\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

This statue's hands and staff have very little dust compared to the base, suggesting it is capable of making magical gestures. The trap is too obvious, but dealing with it might not be.}}\n\n==Useful info==\n'''Wizard statues''' are a form of animated [[statue]] which attacks you with a variety of powerful magic. They are only ever found in rare [[Dungeon]] [[vault]]s.\n\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Freezing Cloud]] (2d17)\n|slot2=[[Mephitic Cloud]]\n|slot3=[[Throw Icicle]] (3d16)\n|slot4=[[Confuse]]\n|slot5=''none''\n|slot6=''none''\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you intend to charge in and smash them in melee, use rC+ and [[conservation]] (or at least drop your [[potion]]s first) in preparation for the inevitable ice attacks. Having some [[poison]] resistance will negate Mephitic Cloud, and [[clarity]] or high [[magic resistance]] will make it much less likely for you to wind up confused.\n*Statues are stationary and don't regenerate, so you can hit them with ranged weapons from the edge of your [[line of sight]], stepping away to recover if injured.\n\n==History==\nWizard statues were removed in [[0.14]].\n\n[[Category:Vault-only monsters]]\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

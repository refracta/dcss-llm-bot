{"title":"List of bears","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/List_of_bears","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n'''Bears''' are beefy animals that can occasionally be found throughout the [[Dungeon]] and [[Lair]]. While they're less common than some other types of creatures, they make up for it by having multiple attacks and the ability to go [[berserk]] when badly injured.\n\n==Bear Types==\n{{monsterlink|Black bear}} - The common variety of bears. They can manage to rip apart fragile spellcasters, but most other characters will have an easy time with them.\n\n{{monsterlink|Polar bear}} - [[Amphibious]] bears hailing from arctic climes, their thick white fur gives them [[cold resistance]]. Often found in [[Ice Cave]]s.\n\n==Retired bears==\n{{monsterlink|Grizzly bear}} - Bigger, stronger bears, but otherwise not very noteworthy.\n\n{{monsterlink|Ancient bear}} - Huge, powerful bears whose long lives in magical places gave them [[fire resistance]]. Considered for [[0.14]]\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.27]], [[fear|fleeing]] bears could go berserk.\n*In [[0.15]], grizzly bears were removed.\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]"}

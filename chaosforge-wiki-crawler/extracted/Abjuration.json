{"title":"Abjuration","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Abjuration","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{flavour|Reduces the remaining duration of any nearby hostile summoned creatures.}}\n'''Abjuration''' is a monster-only spell which attempts to dispel all [[summon]]ed creatures hostile to the caster in their [[line of sight]]. The affected monsters have their remaining duration drastically reduced; if this reduces their duration to zero or less, the monsters are unsummoned entirely.\n\nNo monsters actually know this spell. However, all monsters which know Summoning spells with '''spflag::mons_abjure''' flag have a 33% chance of Abjuring instead of casting these spells, if you currently have any summoned allies. These spells include:\n\n*[[Fire Summon]]\n*[[Haunt]]\n*[[Shadow Creatures]]\n*[[Summon Air Elementals]]\n*[[Summon Demon]]\n*[[Summon Dragon]]\n*[[Summon Drakes]]\n*[[Summon Earth Elementals]]\n*[[Summon Emperor Scorpions]]\n*[[Summon Executioners]]\n*[[Summon Eyeballs]]\n*[[Summon Fire Elementals]]\n*[[Summon Greater Demon]]\n*[[Summon Holies]]\n*[[Summon Horrible Things]]\n*[[Summon Hydra]]\n*[[Summon Mana Viper]]\n*[[Summon Mushrooms]]\n*[[Summon Scarabs]]\n*[[Summon Scorpions]]\n*[[Summon Spiders]]\n*[[Summon Ugly Thing]]\n*[[Summon Undead]]\n*[[Summon Vermin]]\n*[[Summon Water Elementals]]\n\nIn theory, this means that a [[dread lich]] may spend a turn abjuring your summoned [[quokka]] rather than summoning fiends. In practice, deliberately summoning such chaff is unwise: the monster usually loses at most one turn, which is the same time you spent casting the spell, and it may lose no turns if one of its summons takes care of your distraction.\n\n==Player Version==\nPlayers may get a form of abjuration via [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]]. This spell always and completely unsummons a single creature, and then creates an explosion which damages nearby enemies. [[Durable summon]]s are immune to both abjuration and this spell.\n\n==History==\n{{Spell\n|name=Abjuration\n|level=3\n|school1={{Summonings}}\n|school2=\n|school3=\n|sources=<div>\n*[[Book of Summonings]] \n</div>\n|castingnoise=3\n|spellnoise=0\n}}\n{{Flavour|This spell attempts to send hostile summoned creatures to the place from whence they came, or at least shorten their stay in the caster's locality.}}\n\n*Prior to [[0.26]], players could also abjure by using [[Aura of Abjuration]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Abjuration was a level 3 spell available to players.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], summoning monsters had a 50% chance of casting mass abjuration instead of summoning.\n*Prior to [[0.10]], Abjuration targeted multiple creatures instead of a single target; this effect was given to [[Mass Abjuration]].\n\n[[Category:Monster spells]]"}

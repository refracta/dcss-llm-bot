Although it does not provide its wearer with as much protection as the scales of some heavier dragons, it is somewhat lighter and less encumbering. The armour repels both attacks on the wearer's willpower and magical modification of itself - it cannot be enchanted.}}\n\n'''Quicksilver dragon scales''' are a curious form of body armour. They are light, have high base AC, and grant a rank of [[willpower]]. However, they cannot be [[enchant]]ed beyond +0. Even [[artefact]] quicksilver scales will always be +0.\n\nThis item has a 33% chance to generate when you slay a [[quicksilver dragon]].\n\n==Desirability==\nQuicksilver dragon scales can be effective. Not being able to enchant this armour may seem like an intimidating handicap... but if you don't have spare [[scrolls of enchant armour]], it doesn't matter much. In any case, you can still use scrolls to enchant a [[shield]] or your other aux slots.\n\nAs a light armour, it works best for casters and [[EV]]-based characters, especially those with decent armour skill. Melee brutes will likely prefer something like a [[plate armour]] of willpower instead.\n\n[[Willpower]] is useful to any character who hasn't reached the maximum; it prevents statuses like [[paralysis]] and [[confusion]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.19]], quicksilver dragon scales were known as quicksilver dragon armour, and were obtained by turning a [[quicksilver dragon hide]] into armour with a [[scroll of enchant armour]].\n*Quicksilver dragon armour had its armour class reduced from 10 to 9 in [[0.17]].\n*Quicksilver dragon armour was added in [[0.16]].\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

For every \"lethal\" threat enemy, it gains +9 enchantment.

The labrys will frequently raise its enchantment, making it even stronger. Any reasonably threatening monster will count as \"tough\", so reaching a +13 or +16 enchantment is quite easy.\n\nDuring the 3-rune portion of the game, the labrys can still be a great weapon. While its brand will rarely be effective, it will frequently get to a high enchantment.\n\n==History==\n*The Consecrated labrys was added in [[0.30]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Axes]]"}

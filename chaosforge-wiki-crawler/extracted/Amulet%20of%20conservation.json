{"title":"Amulet of conservation","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Amulet_of_conservation","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n{{Flavour|This amulet protects some of the possessions of its wearer from outright destruction, but not infallibly so.}}\n{{item\n |itemtype=Jewellery\n |name=Amulet of conservation\n |weight=1.0\n}}\n\nWearing an '''amulet of conservation''' provides you with the [[conservation]] intrinsic, giving you a 90% chance to negate [[potion]], [[scroll]], and [[food]] [[item destruction]]. Bear in mind that this provides no defense against food-destruction through [[harpy]] attacks (they steal and eat the food rather than destroying it outright) or against equipment [[corrosion]] from [[acid]] attacks (you'd need the [[resist corrosion]] intrinsic for that).\n\nStacking this amulet with other sources of conservation or with items that provide the [[preservation]] intrinsic provides no further benefit; only the most effective source of item protection applies.\n\nWhile this amulet provides no short-term combat advantages, losing items to item destruction is irritating at best and devastating at worst. When entering areas where [[fire]] or [[cold]] damage are common, conservation is almost necessary if you intend to keep any of the scrolls or potions you bring in or find along the way. That being said, feel free to swap it out when another amulet is called for, and as a general rule, avoid carrying more potions or scrolls than is necessary.\n\n==History==\nAmulets of conservation were retired in [[0.15]], along with item destruction.\n\n[[Category:Amulets]]"}

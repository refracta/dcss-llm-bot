By itself, it is an almost useless weapon, but magical staves have extra bonuses to both melee and spellcasting.\n\n==History==\n*Basic staves stopped appearing in-game in version [[0.12]].\n*The staff item was introduced in [[0.10]], where it could be found in mundane form. Prior to that, all magical staves had [[quarterstaves]] as their base type (although the latter was much weaker, only doing 7 base damage).\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

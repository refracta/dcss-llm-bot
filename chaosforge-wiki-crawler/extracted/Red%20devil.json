{"title":"Red devil","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Red_devil","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Red devils''' are [[fire]]-themed [[tier-4 demon]]s, usually found wielding [[trident]]s or [[demon trident]]s. They inflict [[barbs]] on you, which inflicts damage on movement. Although aggravating, they lack magic, and aren't very strong unless weapon is well-[[brand]]ed or if they happen to generate in an early [[vault]]. They can be found in the [[Volcano]], [[the Abyss]], [[Pandemonium]], and the [[Hell]]s (primarily [[Gehenna]]). Some monsters may also summon them through the [[Summon Demon]] spell.\n\n==Useful Info==\n*Check their gear after killing them, as a good [[demon trident]] can be a very useful [[polearm]] (though summoned devils will never drop anything).\n*Be careful not to kill them over lava, as you will lose their weapon.\n*Their tendency to attack at range and vulnerability to cold makes them perfect targets for [[Hailstorm]].\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], red devils had the kiting [[attack flavour]] (on attack with reaching, may move back 1 square) instead of barbs.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], red devils did not have the kiting attack flavour.\n[[Category:Demon]]"}

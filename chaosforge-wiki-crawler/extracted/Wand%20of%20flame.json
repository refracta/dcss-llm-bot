When used by a player, it deals <code>2d(5.5 + 0.35 * [[Evocations]])</code> fire damage (capped at 2d9).\n\n[[Artificer]]s will start with a wand of flame with 15 charges.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*This wand effectively duplicates the old [[Throw Flame]] spell, which was level 2. Use it early: later on, it deals little damage, even with high Evocations.\n*Like other sources of fire, if it crosses a pool of water, it will create a [[cloud]] of steam. Use this to take out [[electric eel]]s or other waterborne creatures, like [[list of merfolk|merfolk]]. Even at low skill, steam clouds can block vision and deal significant damage.\n*Although it does produce [[fire]], wands of flame are not powerful enough to burn [[tree]]s.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.16]], this wand could hold up to 24 charges.\n\n{{wands}}"}

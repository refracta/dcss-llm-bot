{"title":"Passage of Golubria","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Passage_of_Golubria","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Passage of Golubria''' is a level 4 [[Translocations]] spell which creates a wormhole, allowing instantaneous passage between two points. \n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen cast, you select a target tile within range. Two portals are immediately created: one within 2 tiles of your location, one within 2 tiles of the targeted tile. Portals can only form on ground tiles; [[shallow water|shallow]] or [[deep water]], [[lava]], [[stairs]], [[altar]]s, [[door]]s (closed or open), [[trap]]s, or any other dungeon feature are ineligible.<ref>The portals are technically considered traps, so they can only generate where traps can.</ref> There must be at least one valid spot for both portals to spawn. \n\nEntering a portal's tile (if on top of one, use '''<''' or '''>''') will immediately teleport you to another portal, noisily destroying the entry portal in the process. The destination portal remains - it can be used if there are other portals. Since each casting creates two ''additional'' portals, casting PoG multiple times will leave you with 3+ portals. In this case, the destination tile is randomly chosen. Monsters can enter portals, if the portal is in their path; they won't explicitly try to enter portals.\n\nPortals last for 10-19 turns; this does not depend on [[spell power]].<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|traps.cc|93}}</ref> Portals also expire if you leave the floor.\n \nThis spell is completely unusable in the [[Gauntlet]]. However, Passage of Golubria is not considered a teleport, so [[Formicid]]s can use portals normally.\n\n==Strategy==\nA good escape spell, if you have decent power, and if you use it proactively. You get to control the direction of the portals. Even if the exact location isn't precise, getting 4-5 tiles of distance can make it ''much'' easier to escape. But it isn't perfect. Monsters may step in a portal, and sometimes either the entry or destination portal won't be in a great location (monsters in the way of the entry portal, for instance). \n\nAs mentioned, it's best to use the portal proactively; cast this spell before entering a dangerous fight. That way, you don't waste time casting mid-battle, and know the destination before things get dangerous.\n\nThe destination portal lasts after you use a passage, so watch out if you're casting it more than once. An immediate second cast has a 50% chance of delivering you to the entry portal. Thankfully, you can use '''>''' to enter the portal you're on, so this just means you lose a turn. You can also use this property to your advantage:\n*You can \"juke\" enemies; cast Passage once, run away for a bit, then cast it again to go back to the first portal. Since enemies will be traveling towards the second location, going back to the original location can let you get away.\n*You can mess with [[teleport]]s. Cast a passage, then teleport. If you want to go back, cast it again, and you'll likely end up at the pre-teleport destination. Note the very short duration.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\nOther than escape, Passage of Golubria can be used for these purposes:\n*[[Kiting]]. Each cast of PoG gives you a couple tiles of distance. With a large enough MP pool, you can shoot at melee enemies without ever getting in melee range. Using the destination portals, as mentioned above, is very helpful.\n*[[Stab]]bing. You make a soft noise on cast, and the portals are noisy when destroyed. However, the creation of the portals is silent. Passages can be used to approach an enemy using fewer turns. Don't cast when in [[line of sight]] of the victim, since the destroyed portal can wake them up.\n*Lowering your [[turn]]count. During exploration, you can cast a passage in a direction, regenerate MP (while walking), then have the MP to cast it again. Mostly relevant to turncount [[speedrun]]s that use magic (e.g. [[high score]] runs).\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n!

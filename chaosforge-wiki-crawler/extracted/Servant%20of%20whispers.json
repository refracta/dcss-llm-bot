{"title":"Servant of whispers","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Servant_of_whispers","type":"raw","data":"{{version021}}\n{{stub}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Servants of whispers''' are fragile but formidable support casters often found roaming the [[Desolation of Salt]] with a band of [[saltling]]s and in Desolation-exclusive ruins with [[imperial myrmidon]]s, [[ragged hierophant]]s, [[ironbound convoker]]s and [[halazid warlock]]s. Their [[Still Winds]] invocation clears the ever present salt clouds, stripping away the player's concealment, and removes hazardous [[clouds]] covering allies, shutting down spells such as [[Freezing Cloud]] and [[Ring of Flames]] and lessening the effects of spells like [[Glaciate]] and [[Fire Storm]]. Occasionally, they will cast a special invocation version of [[Lightning Bolt]], dealing significant [[electricity]] damage to [[Electricity#Electricity Resistance|uninsulated]] players.\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n\n==History==\nAdded in [[0.19]]\n\n[[Category:Human]]"}

Just as St. Lee sought to atone for the destruction his spells wrought by protecting others, so his staff protects its wielder.}}\n__NOTOC__\n\n[[File:Staff of the Meek.png]] '''''the +7 staff of the Meek'''''\n\n+7 [[quarterstaff]]\n<br>[[Protection]] [[brand]]\n<br>Provides even more [[AC]] at low health.\n\n==Mechanics==\nRegardless of health, the staff provides the effects of the protection brand (+7 AC for a short time after attacking a monster). At 55 HP, and for every 4 health below 55, that AC bonus increases by 1. This caps out at 27 HP, where the Meekstaff will provide 14 AC total.<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|player.cc|5992}}</ref>\n\n==Desirability==\nQuarterstaves are decent weapons in the early stages of the game thanks to their high accuracy, damage, and low attack delay. The '''staff of the Meek'''<ref>{{source ref|0.29.0|art-data.txt|1645}}</ref>, a +7 quarterstaff, gives characters just staring out a distinct advantage over early foes. For a relatively small skill investment (you can even rely on [[crosstraining]]), this staff provides a great return. While the staff does take up your [[shield]] slot, the protection brand helps compensate, especially when your max HP is low. Plus, you might not have a shield in the first place.\n\nConsider switching to a stronger offensive weapon once you start finding other decent [[brand]]ed weapons and better defensive gear.\n\nThe staff of the Meek tends to appear early in the Dungeon, where it is most useful.\n\n==History==\n*The staff was added in [[0.28]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Staves]]"}

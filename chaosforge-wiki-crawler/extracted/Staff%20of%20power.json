Because mana regeneration is based on your max MP, this will also cause you to regenerate MP slightly faster.\n\nThe staff can also be used in combat, functioning as a +0 [[staff]]. Unlike some other magical staves, it provides no magical combat effects, but [[Fighting]] and [[Staves]] increase damage like for any other weapon.\n\n==Strategy==\nOne of the more universally useful magical staves, a staff of power can benefit any caster. That being said, it may be wiser to wield a [[staff of wizardry]] if your [[spell failure]] isn't terribly low; being able to cast a spell once reliably is better than being able to fail to cast a spell multiple times.\n\n==History==\n*Staves of power were removed in [[0.25]].\n*As of [[0.17]], this staff once again adds a flat +15 bonus to max MP instead of having a separate reservoir.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], the additional MP was treated as a bonus to max MP, not a reservoir contained in the staff.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], this staff granted a flat +13 MP, although subject to the same stepdown for max MP over 50.\n*Prior to [[0.8]], the chance of a staff of power auto-identifying when wielded depended on the [[Spellcasting]] skill of the wielder."}

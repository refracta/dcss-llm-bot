{"title":"Rimeblight","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Rimeblight","type":"raw","data":"{{version032}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Rimeblight''' is a level 7 [[Ice Magic]]/[[Necromancy]] irresistible enchantment that inflicts the Rimeblight status upon a living/holy/demonic creature. The creature will take AC-ignoring cold damage over several turns as ice devours them from the inside out, and also periodically explode in a flurry of ice shards that damages nearby hostiles (but not the player, their allies, or [[peaceful]] monsters!) and can spread the disease to susceptible creatures it hits. The infection chance from rimeblight explosions is 2/3 for nearby monsters. Note that explosions and disease spread don't happen out of your [[line of sight]].\n\nMonsters with rimeblight on them that drop below 20% hp, to the \"almost dead\" health, will instantly die and be replaced with a short-lived [[pillar of rime]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nIf you cast the spell on a low hp monster and it dies from the initial damage, this won't infect nearby monsters with rimeblight.\n\n==Strategy==\n\n==History==\n*Added in [[0.32]]."}

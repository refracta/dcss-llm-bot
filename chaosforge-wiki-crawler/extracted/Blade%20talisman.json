{"title":"Blade talisman","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Blade_talisman","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n''For the spell present in [[0.30]], see [[Blade Hands (spell)]].''\n{{flavour|Causes long, needle-thin blades to grow from the user's hands and smaller fragments of metal to grow inside their body, deforming them and reducing the effectiveness of body armour. Shapeshifting skill mitigates and eventually eliminates the latter effect, as well as increasing damage dealt.\n\nWhile transformed, equipped weapons, shields, and gloves are melded.}}\n\n[[File:blade talisman.png]] A '''blade talisman''' is a [[talisman]] that gives you '''Blade Hands''', increasing your damage in [[Unarmed Combat]].\n\n==Useful Info==\nWhen e'''V'''oked, a blade talisman grants Blade Hands, which lasts until you end the form. Entering or exiting a form takes 5 turns.\n\nBlade Hands has the following effects:\n\n'''Combat Bonuses'''\n*'''[[Unarmed Combat]]:''' Linearly scales from the following points:\n**Below minimum: 6 damage (0 skill) - 15 damage (10 skill)\n**Above minimum: 15 damage (10 skill) - 23 damage (19 skill) ; +0.88 damage per level\n*Your [[auxiliary attack|off-hand punch]] gains +6 damage.\n*Reduces base [[AC]] of [[body armour]]; multiplies body armour base AC by <code>(Shapeshifting - 10) / 9</code> (min. 0), where your total AC is rounded down.<ref>{{source ref|0.31-b1|transform.cc|668}}</ref> (+11.1% per level)\n**Does not impact [[enchantment]], and AC gained from [[Armour skill]] is still calculated with the armour's full base AC. Stacks multiplicatively with [[Deformed]] / [[Pseudopods]].\n\n'''Restrictions'''\n*'''[[Transformation#Useful Info|Melded Gear]]:''' [[Weapon]], [[shield]], and [[gloves]]. [[Claws]] are also melded.\n*You cannot [[throw]] items.\nBlade Hands does not block [[mutation]]s (other than claws), does not change your [[size]], and gives no innate bonus to HP / [[AC]].\n\nIt has a minimum [[Shapeshifting]] skill of 10, below which you get an [[Talisman#Skill|HP penalty]], and Unarmed damage scales down. It has a maximum skill of 19, where skill has no further impact.\n\n==Strategy==\nBlade Hands is essentially [[hand|two-handed]] Unarmed Combat. Even at 0 Unarmed Combat skill, you'll hit as hard as an [[eveningstar]], while keeping the off-hand punch. It's certainly strong, but melds the shield slot and reduces AC (until max skill).\n\nUnlike certain other forms, Blade Hands doesn't meld body armour. It's great for Shapeshifters wanting to focus on Armour skill.\n\n==History==\n*Introduced in [[0.31]] in the transformation overhaul. Previously implemented as a spell, [[Blade Hands (spell)|Blade Hands]].\n:The previous spell had 22 base damage, cut [[hydra]] heads, had a spellcasting penalty, and didn't have an AC penalty. (However, since it was a spell, heavy armour made it harder to cast).\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Forms}}"}

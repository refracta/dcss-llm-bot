{"title":"Strength weight","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Strength_weight","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\nGenerally in Crawl, heavier weapons benefit more from [[strength]] than from [[dexterity]]. '''Strength weighting''' (abbreviated \"str weight\") is a game mechanic that determines relatively how much a character's strength and dexterity affect a given weapon's damage output.\n\nA given str weight value can be viewed as a quotient expressed as a percentage; the \"amount of effect\" that strength has on a weapon, divided by the total amount of effect that strength and dexterity together have on it. So a str weight of 100% (such as with a [[giant club]]) implies that strength affects the weapon far more than dexterity does. Conversely, 0% (eg. [[quick blade]]) implies that strength has a very small effect on how well a weapon performs.\n\nAlmost all weapons fall somewhere in-between the two extremes. The weighted average of strength and dexterity affects both damage potential and [[to-hit]], the former being affected more by strength and the latter being affected more by dexterity. Thus, note that that even 0% and 100% strength weightings don't imply that either stat has no effect: more dexterity always implies better to-hit and more strength always implies higher per-hit damage. A 50% str weight still implies that dexterity has a bigger effect than strength on to-hit, and conversely with strength and damage.\n\n== Formulas and source ==\n[https://gitorious.org/crawl/crawl/source/3fb7fd9f23f7f93a1e85b39c3ba46f27e91505f3:crawl-ref/source/itemprop.cc#L163 In the source]\nstrength weight fractions are represented by integers from 0 to 10, representing 0% to 100% respectively.

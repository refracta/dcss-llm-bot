It offers 1 more AC than a robe, at a slight encumbrance penalty. [[Dodge]]rs and casters may prefer leather over a plain robe.\n\n==Desirability==\nLeather armour is a bland piece of armour. [[Robe]]s are more likely to have useful egos, while lighter dragon scales (like [[acid dragon scales|acid]] or [[swamp dragon scales|swamp]]) offer far more AC for relatively little encumbrance. However, it is useful in a few situations:\n*For an early EV-reliant character, before you find a superior alternative, this is often better than a plain robe. In exchange for 1 point of EV, you will get at least 1 more AC.\n*Leather armour is very common, meaning that well-enchanted and artefact leather armours are reasonable to come across. A +3 leather armour of fire resistance is comparable to the aforementioned dragon armours, while a good artefact (such as the [[salamander hide armour]]) might be worth wearing.\nNote that a plain +0 leather armour is completely outclassed by both [[troll leather armour]] and [[steam dragon scales]].\n\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"border:none; margin:auto; padding:0; text-align: center\"\n! || Image\n|-\n| '''Mundane''' || [[File:Leather armour1.png]]\n|-\n| '''Magical''' || [[File:Leather armour2.png]]\n|-\n| '''Artifact''' || [[File:Leather armour3.png]]\n|-\n! || [[Unrandart]]<br>Leather armour\n|-\n| '''[[Salamander hide armour]]''' || [[File:Salamander hide armour.png]]\n|-\n| '''[[Cigotuvi's embrace]]''' || [[File:Cigotuvi's embrace urand.png]]\n|}\n\n{{armours}}\n[[Category:Body armour]]"}

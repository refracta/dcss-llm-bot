Breaking the flask's seal will release it to wreak havoc - possibly on you.}}\n\nA '''bottled efreet''' is a one-time use evocable item which releases an [[efreet]] armed with a [[scimitar]] of [[flaming]]. Whether this efreet decides to serve you or attack you depends on your [[Evocations]] skill and your choice of [[god]]. Worshipers of any good god ([[Zin]], [[Elyvilon]], or [[the Shining One]]) always summon hostile efreets. Anyone else has a 50+(5Ã—(Evocations/3))% chance of summoning a friendly efreet:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"text-align: center; border:none; margin:auto; padding:0;\"\n!

This will be trouble for any other allied monsters you have following you, particularly [[undead]] monsters without regeneration, or fire-vulnerable [[ice beast]]s. Since it's an actual monster and not a summon, it may be better simply to kill it for free flaming weapon it carries (they make excellent anti-[[hydra]] weapons).\n\nUsually, hydras will kill your allied efreets quickly in melee, as the demons have low HP and don't blink. You can collect the weapon later if you manage to lure the hydra away or kill it yourself.\n\n==History==\nBottled efreets were removed in [[0.14]]."}

Higher [[spell power]] may increase the number of creatures created, create stronger snakes and increase their duration. One arrow from inventory is consumed for each snake created.\n\nPossible monsters are:\n:{{monsterlink|Ball python}}\n:{{monsterlink|Adder}}\n:{{monsterlink|Water moccasin}}\n\nThese snakes are not real summons, and can not be [[abjuration|abjured]]. They will wither away after a while though.\n\nNumber of snakes created per cast is <code>1 + (1d<power> - 1) / 15</code>, capped at 7.<ref>{{source ref|0.25.0|spl-summoning.cc|180}}</ref> Assuming you have enough arrows, of course.\n\n[[Duration class]] ranges from 3 (around 27 turns) to 5 (around 81 turns). The formula is <code>3 + (1d<power> - 1) / 20</code>, capped at 5.<ref>{{source ref|0.25.0|spl-summoning.cc|179}}</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\nSticks to Snakes allows you to create [[summon]]s (for all intents) with no cap. They can block line of fire or distract enemies. If you have enough arrows, you can swarm enemies with snakes, which will let you win most early game fights. Very powerful for [[Transmuter]] starts, and useful for other characters (even past the early game).\n\nSnakes can be combined with a [[scroll of immolation]] or [[Inner Flame]] to \"snakebomb\" enemies - even ball pythons create a high damage explosion. As all summons can be affected by Inner Flame as of [[0.25]], this isn't exclusive to Sticks to Snakes anymore, but this spell has no summon cap (so you can have more explosions at once). With enough immolated snakes, you can even kill [[TRJ]].\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|Sticks to Snakes will return as a monster-only spell available to [[Beogh]]'s apostles.}}\n*Sticks to Snakes was removed in [[0.26]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], Sticks to Snakes required arrows to be wielded.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], Transmutations skill was used instead of spell power for some formulas.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], this spell worked on melee weapons, like [[club]]s and [[polearm]]s. It could also create [[black mamba]]s or even [[anaconda]]s.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

{"title":"Potion of gain strength","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Potion_of_gain_strength","type":"raw","data":"{{obsolete}}\n\n{{item\n |itemtype=Potion\n |name=Potion of gain strength\n |cost=350\n |weight=4.0\n}}\n\n{{Flavour|A potion of beneficial mutation}}\n\nThe '''potion of gain strength''' bestows one level of the [[good mutations#Improved Attributes|Improved Attributes]] mutation, which gives your character +1 [[Strength]] (cumulative up to +14 points). Hard to find, and useful for melee-oriented characters, or those who are dangerously low on strength.\n\nThe mutation can be removed by the normal means (eg, a [[potion of cure mutation]], Zin's [[Zin#Given Abilities|Cure All Mutations]] ability). Unlike other sources of mutations, the potion isn't hindered by an [[amulet of resist mutation]] (but ''is'' by the [[Good mutations#Mutation Resistance|Mutation Resistance]] mutation). Use of this potion does not offend [[Zin]].\n\n{{crawlquote|''You feel stronger.''}}\n\n==History==\nIn [[0.13]] this potion was replaced with the [[potion of beneficial mutation]]."}

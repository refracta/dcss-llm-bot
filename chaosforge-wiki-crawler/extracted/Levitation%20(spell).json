However, it did have drawbacks: you became more vulnerable to the [[Airstrike]] spell, could not pick up items, and could not descend [[stairs]] until the effect has worn off. To avoid the last two of these, you could use the [[controlled flight]] intrinsic. You'd receive the [[fly]] condition instead, which had none of the down sides and a few extra perks.\n\nAlthough this spell cannot be learned anymore, [[quaff]]ing a [[potion of levitation]] has the same effect.\n\n==History==\nThe spell levitation was removed in [[0.10]]\n\n[[Category:Movement]][[Category:Obsolete spells]]"}

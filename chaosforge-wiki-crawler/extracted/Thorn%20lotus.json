Although they often decide to pass their turns or spend them moving randomly, these thorns can do significant damage when they hit, and the lotuses are occasionally accompanied by other random monsters. Thorn lotuses can be encountered in any pool of water in the [[Swamp]].\n\n<!--spl-bot-begin-->\n==Spells==\n{{Spellcaster\n|number=\n|slot1=[[Volley of Thorns]] (3d15)\n|slot2=[[Volley of Thorns]] (3d15)\n|slot3=''none''\n|slot4=[[Volley of Thorns]] (3d15)\n|slot5=[[Volley of Thorns]] (3d15)\n|slot6=''none''\n}}\n{{clear}}\n<!--spl-bot-end-->\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*If you encounter a thorn lotus along with land-based opponents, lure its allies away from the water; the lotus won't be going anywhere.\n*[[Repel Missiles]] and [[Deflect Missiles]] are every bit as effective here as they are everywhere else. [[Invisibility]] also helps quite a bit (so long as you're standing on land).\n\n==History==\nThorn lotuses were added in [[0.14]] and removed in [[0.15]].\n\n[[Category:Obsolete monsters]]"}

Like the [[unrand]] [[Eos]], characters wielding an orb of light emit a 3-tile [[halo]]. The halo makes everything inside (except you) easier to hit,<ref>When attacking a creature inside a halo, the attack's [[to-hit]] is increased by <code>1 + 1d8</code>.</ref> reveals [[invisible]] creatures, and decreases stealth.\n\n==Strategy==\n*The orb can be used as a bootleg [[see invisible]]. This is most useful if you don't have another [[shield]] yet.\n*The halo's to-hit boost not only helps you, but your [[allies]] ([[summon]]s, [[derived undead]], etc.) too. As monsters don't have the greatest accuracy, using light can really help your allies' damage output.\n*Remember that the halo will also impact ''your'' invisibility! Don't rely on it while wielding this orb.\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==History==\n*The light ego, along with orbs themselves, was introduced in [[0.28]].\n\n{{orb}}"}

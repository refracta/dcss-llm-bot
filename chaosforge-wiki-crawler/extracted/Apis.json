{"title":"Apis","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Apis","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{monster info}}\n{{list of | holy monsters}}\n\n==Useful Info==\nAn '''apis''' is a rare [[yak]]-type monster. They are mostly restricted to [[holy]] [[Pandemonium]] levels and [[Ziggurat]] floors, though they can also be found in a holy-themed [[Shoals]]:4 [[vault]]. They behave like all yaks, moving into melee range and hitting surprisingly hard with their holy horns (especially dangerous to [[undead]] or [[demonspawn]] characters).\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Think of them as [[death yak]]s but stronger, particularly if you're vulnerable to [[holy]] damage.\n\n==Trivia==\nThe [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apis_(god) apis] was a sacred bull worshiped in ancient Egypt.\n\n==History==\n*In [[0.31]], apis can now appear in a holy-themed [[Shoals]]:4 vault.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], [[Elyvilon]] could punish the player for killing an apis by inflicting irresistible but temporary [[weakness]]. Also, hostile apis could turn neutral if the player worshipped a [[good god]] and was sufficiently [[Piety|pious]].\n*In [[0.14]], apis were supposed to appear in the [[Enchanted Forest]].\n*Prior to [[0.13]], killing an apis did not trigger Elyvilon's wrath."}

These potions are excellent for dealing with powerful elemental foes when you don't have time to change your gear or simply haven't found the right item yet, though they're uncommon enough that you'll want to have most of your resistances covered through other means. Be aware that gaining poison resistance will not have any effect on poison already in your system - for that, you'll need a [[potion of curing]]. And, of course, this potion conveys no resistance to [[negative energy]].\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile all the resistances these potions provide can be lifesavers, potions of resistance are particularly useful for characters who find no good source of electricity resistance. This resistance is critical when dealing with certain nasty electrical threats ([[Nikola]], [[electric golem]]s, [[storm dragon]]s if encountered early on), but these opponents are rare enough that you can usually make it through the game relying entirely on these potions.\n\nUnfortunately, these potions are quite rare. You may be lucky to find more than 10 by Zot.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.15]], a potion of resistance didn't grant corrosion resistance.\n*Prior to [[0.12]], quaffing a potion of resistance gave the player a point of [[Contamination]].\n*Prior to [[0.11]], the duration of each resistance granted by this potion was determined separately (i.e. your cold resistance might wear off in 11 turns while your fire resistance would wear off in 28 turns).\n\n{{potions}}"}

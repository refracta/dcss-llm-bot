{"title":"Mayhem","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Mayhem","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{flavour|It causes witnesses of the wearer's kills to go into a frenzy, attacking everything nearby with great strength and speed.}}\n\n'''Mayhem''' is an [[ego]] found only on [[orb]]s. Characters wielding an orb of mayhem have a 50% chance of inflicting [[frenzy]] on another monster whenever they kill a foe. Frenzied monsters are [[neutral]], attack the closest thing (friend or foe), and gain immense power and speed ([[might]] and [[haste]]).\n\n==Strategy==\n*Mayhem is most useful in areas you know will be filled with monsters; areas like [[Vaults]]:5 or a [[Ziggurat]].\n*Whilst very powerful when fighting a group, be aware that it can backfire. For example, it can frenzy your own [[summon]]s, or enrage the only enemy left alive.\n**There are a few ways to deal with dangerous frenzied monsters that target you. [[Spriggan]]s can easily outrun even hasted monsters, other characters can [[teleport]] away, and you can dispel frenzy with [[Yara's Violent Unravelling]] or a [[wand of quicksilver]].\n\n==History==\nThe mayhem ego, along with orbs themselves, was introduced in [[0.28]].\n\n{{orb}}"}

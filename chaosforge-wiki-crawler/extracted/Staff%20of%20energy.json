It allows the wielder to cast spells without gaining hunger, and to channel ambient magical energy to restore their reserves of magic.}}\n\nA '''staff of energy''' is a [[magical staff]] which eliminates [[spell hunger]] caused by casting spells, and provides some minor channeling ability. It does not affect [[Evocations]]- or [[Invocations]]- based abilities. Status effects like [[Regeneration]] still have their usual hunger cost.\n\n==Useful Info==\n\n===Channeling===\nSuccessfully [[Evocations|evoking]] the staff restores 1-3 [[MP]] at a cost of 50 [[nutrition]]. A failed attempt does not incur the hunger cost. This is much less hunger-efficient than waiting, but it's faster. [[Evocations]] skill decreases the failure. \n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" style=\"text-align: center; border:none; margin:auto; padding:0;\"\n! Evocations || Success Rate (%)\n|-\n| 0 || 28\n|-\n| 2 || 33\n|-\n| 5 || 40\n|-\n| 10 || 53\n|-\n| 15 || 65\n|-\n| 20 || 78\n|-\n| 25 || 90\n|-\n| 27 || 95\n|}\n\n===Combat===\nThis staff functions as a +0 [[staff]] in melee. Unlike some other magical staves, it has no extra melee effect.\n\n==Strategy==\nAlthough this staff won't make magic any stronger or easier to use, it does allow you to spam high-level spells without fear of starving. It lets you get away with less [[Spellcasting]] skill than you'd otherwise want or need.\n\nAny caster should keep one on hand, simply to speed up MP regeneration (at least, when traveling through edible [[corpse]]-rich branches).\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Staff of Wucad Mu]] - an [[unrand]] staff that also channels MP - it's faster, but riskier.\n\n==History==\n*Staves of energy were removed in [[0.26]], along with the hunger mechanic itself.\n*Prior to [[0.13]], the channeling feature was on a separate staff. \n*In [[0.11]], the staff was temporarily nerfed, reducing food costs by two-thirds. It was restored to zero spell hunger in [[0.13]]. \n*Prior to [[0.8]], the chance of a staff of energy auto-identifying when wielded depended on the [[Spellcasting]] skill of the wielder."}

{"title":"Polar Vortex","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Polar_Vortex","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{spell info}}\n\n'''Polar Vortex''' is a level 9 [[Ice Magic]] spell that creates a frenzy of raging wind up to 6 tiles around you, dealing catastrophic [[cold]] damage.\n\n==Useful Info==\nPolar Vortex creates [[cloud]]s of raging wind, dealing a base of <code>12d(pow/15)</code> damage per 1.0 turn.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-vortex.cc|377}}</ref> Only 50% of damage is affected by [[cold resistance]].\n\nThe damage is then adjusted by:<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-vortex.cc|294}}</ref>\n* Percentage of tiles open. In tight spaces, damage is reduced. Damage is multiplied by the ratio, <code>(tiles with wind) / (tiles that could have wind)</code>.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-vortex.cc|271}}</ref>\n* \"Duration-radius\" factor. Creatures on the outside of the vortex will receive the most damage.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-vortex.cc|291}}</ref>\n\nThe vortex's radius is equal to <code>sqrt([[aut]]_passed) * 7/5</code>, or roughly 1 tile per 1.0 turn, with a max. of 5 tiles. Creatures and [[cloud]]s caught inside will rotate in a counterclockwise fashion. The \"rotation\" is a square shape, and done at a rate of ~1 full rotation per 6 turns.\n\nWhile casting the spell, the caster and anything caught inside will [[fly]] for a short period of time. Once it ends, there's a grace period of 1 turn until flight ends.<ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-vortex.cc|351}}</ref><ref>{{source ref|0.30.0|spl-vortex.cc|365}}</ref> Monsters won't make any effort to avoid falling into [[deep water]] or [[lava]].\n\nPolar Vortex lasts for 6 turns. The vortex immediately ends if you [[blink]] or [[teleport]] via any means, or if you enter another floor. After it ends, it has a cooldown of 3.5 - 4.5 turns.\n\nCreatures who are currently casting Polar Vortex (including [[twister]]s) are immune to other creatures' Polar Vortex. No other monster is immune.\n\n==Strategy==\nWhile Polar Vortex has poor damage/turn compared to other level 9 spells, it has great MP efficiency. For a single, 9 MP cast, you'll get up to 6 turns of damage. Plus, you can cast other spells while the vortex is running. Great in an open area, especially against crowds. The ability to pierce cold resistance is also useful for Ice Magic specialists.\n\nThe downsides (other than damage/turn) mostly stem from the vortex mechanic: it is much weaker in a cramped area, has a short radius (for most of the duration), and a lengthy cooldown.\n\nAs a single school spell, Polar Vortex is easier to train than the likes of [[Fire Storm]] or [[Chain Lightning]], but it's still a significant XP investment. In a 3 rune game, training for a level 9 spell usually means sacrificing on your defenses. Yet, as a low-range, damage over time spell that excels in open areas, you'll want good defenses, thus making this spell harder to justify. Polar Vortex can still be worth using, but don't rush for it.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*When the radius is 5, the amount of noise is 15. This number is multiplied by the delay of your last action (in [[aut]]s) and divided by 10.\n*Be careful not to use [[Blink]] while the spell is up, unless you specifically want to end its effects.\n*Any [[tree]]s within Polar Vortex's range have a chance of being destroyed by the spell.\n\n==Gallery==\n[[File:Polar Vortex demo.png|left|thumb|350px|Polar Vortex at max radius.]]\n{{clear}}\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.30]], Polar Vortex was 60% irresistible.\n*Prior to [[0.28]], Polar Vortex's power was not stored on cast. Using [[Sif Muna]]'s Divine Exegesis would cause a 0 power vortex after the first turn. Also, switching gear would recheck the power.\n*Polar Vortex was added in [[0.27]], as a rethemed version of [[Tornado]]. Comparative to Tornado, Vortex deals 33% more damage, but is partially resistible. In addition, a few monsters lost rTornado.\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

Armour increases your [[armour class]] (AC), which defends against melee, ranged, and most magical attacks. It can also have [[ego]]s, which provide further benefit. \n\nHowever, [[body armour]] is [[encumbrance|encumbering]]. Wearing heavier body armour will lower your [[EV]] and [[stealth]], increase chance of [[spell failure]], and slow down [[Ranged Weapons]]. These penalties are reduced, but not eliminated, by [[strength]] and [[Armour skill]]. Only body armour and [[shield]]s have encumbrance penalties; all other armour can be worn at no cost.\n\n[[Shield]]s increase [[SH]] instead of AC, but are usually considered a piece of \"armour\" as well.\n\n==Armour Locations==\nThere are six armour locations in ''Crawl'', also known as '''armour slots'''. Some [[species]] have restrictions on the kinds of armour they can wear, while many [[Transmutations]] will render pieces unusable.\n\n*'''[[Body armour]]''' is worn on a character's torso, and is the primary source of AC. Its AC bonus is penalized by the [[Deformed]] mutation. Heavier body armour imposes greater penalties.\n*'''[[Gloves]]''' are worn on the hands, and are unusable with rank 3 of the [[Claws]] mutation.\n*'''[[Boots]]''' are worn on the feet, and are unusable with rank 3 of either the [[Talons]] or [[Hooves]] mutations.\n**In place of boots, [[Armataur]]s and [[Naga]]s can wear '''[[barding]]s''' on the rear portions of their bodies. They provide more AC and higher potential enchantment, but slightly reduce your [[EV]].\n*'''[[Helmet]]s''' and '''[[hat]]s''' are worn on the head. The [[Beak]], [[Antennae]], and [[Horns]] mutations all restrict the player's headgear options.\n*'''[[Cloak]]s''' and '''[[Scarf|scarves]]''' are worn around the shoulders, which are unusable with demonspawn's [[Weakening Stinger]].\n*'''[[Shields]]''' and '''[[orb]]s''' are held on character's arm. They prevent the use of [[Handedness|two-handed]] weapons. Shields provide [[SH]], but impede spellcasting and EV without sufficient skill.\n\nAll armour types, including shields, take 5 turns to remove and 5 turns to put on. If you swap from one piece of armour to another, it takes 10 turns total. If you are hurt when (un)equpping armour, the game will ask if you want to abort the action.\n\n==Encumbrance Rating==\nMost [[body armour]] has an [[encumbrance rating]] proportional to its AC. [[Robe]]s and [[leather armour]], being lightweight, have little or no EV penalty; at the other end of the spectrum you can find [[plate armour]] and [[crystal plate armour]], which are cumbersome but incredibly protective.\n\nA higher [[encumbrance rating]]:\n*Lowers your [[ev]]asion\n*Makes you less [[stealth]]y\n*Reduces your spellcasting success rate\n*Make [[Ranged Weapons]] attack slower (not including [[Throwing]] weapons)\n\nIncreasing your Armour skill decreases the effect of the encumbrance rating (-2.2% per level, or -60% at Armour 27) and boosts the total AC granted by those pieces. High [[strength]] will also help. Stealth is always penalized the same. See the [[encumbrance rating]] page for more details.\n\n[[Shield]]s have an encumbrance rating, but it works differently from body armour. See [[Shields]] for more details.\n\nOnly body armour and shields have an encumbrance rating. [[Barding]]s have an EV penalty, but this is unrelated to ER.\n\n==Calculating AC Value==\n===Base AC & Armour skill===\nYour total \"base AC\" is equal to the ''sum'' of the base AC values from every worn armour. This excludes any armour [[enchant]]ments you may have.\n\nThen, [[Armour skill]] provides a bonus to AC, using your base AC:<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|player.cc|5691}}</ref>\n\n   (base AC) * (1 + Armour_skill / 22)\n\nThis is roughly equivalent to +4.5% base AC per level of Armour skill. AC is calculated to 2 decimal places, and most displays show this value rounded down. Item descriptions will, however, show your AC rounded to 1 decimal place, together with the change in AC from equipping or removing that item. \n\n===Body Armour Penalties===\nThere are two penalties that lower your body armour's base AC. These are calculated after the bonus from Armour skill. These do not impact enchantment or other armour types.\n*If you have the [[Deformed]] or the [[Pseudopods]] mutation, you lose <code><body armour base AC> * 0.5</code> AC. These mutations do not stack with each other.\n*If you are in [[Blade Form]] and under 19 [[Shapeshifting]] skill, you lose <code><body armour base AC> * (19 - Shapeshifting) / 9</code> AC. This cannot be greater than your body armour base AC.\n\nIf both penalties apply, they stack multiplicatively, for a total loss of <code>(1 - <body armour base AC>) * 0.5 * <Blade Hands Modifier></code> AC. \n\n===Bonuses===\nAll other sources of AC are flat, additive bonuses to your AC score, which are not impacted by armour or Armour skill:<ref>{{source ref|0.28.0|player.cc|5914}}</ref>\n*Value from armour [[enchant]]ment, [[rings of protection]], and [[artefact]] bonuses\n*[[Ozocubu's Armour]]\n*[[Protection]] brand\n*[[Mutation]]s\n*Innate AC from [[transformation]]s, like [[Dragon Form]] and [[Statue Form]]\n\n==Tables of Armours==\n===Body Armour===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%\" border=1\n!scope = \"col\" | Armour\n!scope = \"col\" | Base AC\n!scope = \"col\" | Encumbrance rating\n!scope = \"col\" | Wearable\n|-\n|[[Robe]]\n|align=\"right\" | 2\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Leather armour]]\n|align=\"right\" | 3\n|align=\"right\" | 4\n|align=\"right\" | Small–Medium\n|-\n|[[Ring mail]]\n|align=\"right\" | 5\n|align=\"right\" | 7\n|align=\"right\" | Small–Medium\n|-\n|[[Scale mail]]\n|align=\"right\" | 6\n|align=\"right\" | 10\n|align=\"right\" | Small–Medium\n|-\n|[[Chain mail]]\n|align=\"right\" | 8\n|align=\"right\" | 14\n|align=\"right\" | Small–Medium\n|-\n|[[Plate armour]]\n|align=\"right\" | 10\n|align=\"right\" | 18\n|align=\"right\" | Small–Medium\n|-\n|[[Crystal plate armour]]\n|align=\"right\" | 14\n|align=\"right\" | 23\n|align=\"right\" | Small–Medium\n|-\n|[[Animal skin]]\n|align=\"right\" | 2\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Troll leather armour]]\n|align=\"right\" | 3\n|align=\"right\" | 4\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Steam dragon scales]]\n|align=\"right\" | 5\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Acid dragon scales]]\n|align=\"right\" | 6\n|align=\"right\" | 5\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Swamp dragon scales]]\n|align=\"right\" | 7\n|align=\"right\" | 7\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Quicksilver dragon scales]]\n|align=\"right\" | 9\n|align=\"right\" | 7\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Fire dragon scales]]\n|align=\"right\" | 8\n|align=\"right\" | 11\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Ice dragon scales]]\n|align=\"right\" | 9\n|align=\"right\" | 11\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Pearl dragon scales]]\n|align=\"right\" | 10\n|align=\"right\" | 11\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Storm dragon scales]]\n|align=\"right\" | 10\n|align=\"right\" | 15\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Shadow dragon scales]]\n|align=\"right\" | 11\n|align=\"right\" | 15\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Gold dragon scales]]\n|align=\"right\" | 12\n|align=\"right\" | 23\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|}\n\n===Shields===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%\" border=1\n!scope = \"col\" | Shield\n!scope = \"col\" | SH\n!scope = \"col\" | Encumbrance\n!scope = \"col\" | Wearable\n|-\n|[[Buckler]]\n|align=\"right\" | 3\n|align=\"right\" | 5\n|align=\"right\" | Little–Medium\n|-\n|[[Kite shield]]\n|align=\"right\" | 8\n|align=\"right\" | 10\n|align=\"right\" | Small–Big\n|-\n|[[Orb]]\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Tower shield]]\n|align=\"right\" | 13\n|align=\"right\" | 15\n|align=\"right\" | Medium–Giant\n|}\n\n===Headgear===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%\" border=1\n!scope = \"col\" | Headgear\n!scope = \"col\" | AC\n!scope = \"col\" | Encumbrance rating\n!scope = \"col\" | Wearable\n|-\n|[[Helmet]]\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | Small–Medium\n|-\n|[[Hat]]\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|}\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%\" border=1\n!scope = \"col\" | Armour\n!scope = \"col\" | AC\n!scope = \"col\" | Encumbrance rating\n!scope = \"col\" | Wearable\n|-\n|[[Boots]]\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | Small–Medium\n|-\n|[[Cloak]]\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Scarf]]\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | All\n|-\n|[[Gloves]]\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | Small–Medium\n|-\n|[[Barding]]\n|align=\"right\" | 4\n|align=\"right\" | -6\n|align=\"right\" | Naga/Armataur\n|}\n\n==Egos==\nEnchanted armour may have an [[ego]], which gives it additional properties.\n\n==Restrictions and Mutations==\n*Beaks, horns, and antennae are incompatible with helmets. Hats are allowed.\n**Horns 3 and Antennae 3 disallow all headgear, however.\n*Hooves 3 and talons 3 are incompatible with boots.\n*Claws 3 and [[Blade Hands]] are incompatible with gloves.\n**Blade Hands is in addition incompatible with all types of shields and weapons.\n*Weakening stinger is incompatible with cloaks.\n*[[Wisp Form]] is incompatible with all armour and jewellery.\n*[[Bat Form]] and [[Pig Form]] are incompatible with all armour and rings (you can only wear amulets).\n*[[Fungus Form]], [[Spider Form]], [[Ice Form]], [[Storm Form]], and [[Dragon Form]] are incompatible with all armour (you can only wear jewellery).\n*[[Tree Form]] is incompatible with all armour except shields.\n*[[Statue Form]] is incompatible with all armour except headgear, shields, and cloaks.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.32]], AC was always rounded down to an integer, meaning AC would increase at specific breakpoints in Armour skill, rather than increasing smoothly.\n*Prior to [[0.29]], body armour encumbrance did ''not'' slow down [[Ranged Weapons]].\n*Prior to [[0.28]], armour and shields would penalize your [[to-hit]].\n*Prior to [[0.27]], [[GDR]] was determined based on your body armour, not from total [[AC]].\n*Prior to [[0.17]], heavy armour slowed [[throwing]] and [[unarmed combat]] attacks.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], light armour had no small spellcasting success penalty.\n*Prior to [[0.15]], armour took <code>AC + 1</code> turns to unequip or equip (instead of a flat 5 turns).\n*Prior to [[0.14]], [[Racial equipment|racial armour types]] existed. Elven armour impeded spellcasting less, dwarven armour had more AC but impeded casting more, and orcish armour was better for [[Hill Orc]]s only.\n*In [[0.13]], the evasion penalty system was changed. \"Base Evasion Penalty\" (BEVP) was changed into [[encumbrance rating]], and rescaled for all armours (see [https://crawl.develz.org/wiki/doku.php?id=dcss:brainstorm:mutation:stats&#effect_of_strength_on_armour_evp dev wiki]). \n*Prior to [[0.11]], you could only train Armour while wearing equipment with an EV penalty of at least -1.\n*Prior to [[0.6]], body armour was divided into \"Light Armour\" and \"Heavy Armour\". The former would allow you to train Dodging, while the latter trained Armour.\n\n===Changes to armour types===\n*In [[0.30]], [[chain mail]] had encumbrance reduced (from 15 -> 14).\n*In [[0.29]], [[shadow dragon scales]] had its AC increased (10 -> 11).\n*Orbs were introduced in [[0.28]].\n*Prior to [[0.26]], bardings were split into [[naga barding]]s and [[centaur barding]]s.\n*Scarves were added in [[0.20]].\n*Prior to [[0.19]], dragon scales were named dragon armours. Also, trolls/dragons only dropped hides; you had to use a [[scroll of enchant armour]] on the hide to get the armour.\n*In [[0.16]], [[scale mail]] had encumbrance reduced (11 -> 10).\n*In [[0.14]], gold dragon armour, crystal plate armour, and plate armour have had their encumbrance ratings reduced (27 -> 25, 24 -> 23, and 19 -> 18 respectively). Mottled dragon armour increased ER from 4 to 5.\n*In [[0.13]], [[splint mail]] was removed.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Armours]]\n{{Skills}}"}

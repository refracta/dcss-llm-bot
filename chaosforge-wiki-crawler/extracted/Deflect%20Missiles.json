It is highly effective against both single-target and penetrating attacks. Each time a missile is deflected the spell has a chance of expiring, with a lower chance of expiry at high power.}}\n\n'''Deflect Missiles''' is a level 6 [[Air Magic|Air]]/[[Charms]] spell which strongly protects the caster from ranged attacks.\n\n==Effect==\nOnce cast, deflecting missiles (DMsl) status is gained. This status will not time out, instead on each successful deflection there is a 8/(2 + power) chance of losing the status. The status can also be dispelled by magic-dispelling effects (like [[potion of cancellation]] or [[Quicksilver Bolt]]) or forgetting the spell.\n\nWhile active, Deflect Missiles reduces the [[to-hit]] of ranged attacks against the caster to a random value between:\n*vs single-target beams: 0% - 50% of its normal value\n*vs penetrating bolts: 0% - 66% of its normal value<ref>{{source ref|0.24.0|beam.cc|2823}}</ref>\nThis spell only helps you to [[ev]]ade ranged attacks; it has no effect on your ability to [[SH|block]] them.\n\nDeflect Missiles is a more advanced version of the Repel Missiles effect of [[repulsion]] and its effect overrides that of RMsl.\n\n==Strategy==\nThis spell gives a very good amount of protection, but there are still a few ranged attacks than can ignore it, among them such nasty things as [[Hellfire]], [[Torment]], and [[Fireball]], as well as all [[Hexes]]. Even so, it can be very useful in places like the last level of [[the Shoals]] ([[merfolk javelineer]]s), the last level of the [[Elven Halls]] ([[deep elf master archer]]s), or [[Zot]] ([[electric golem]]s, [[ancient lich]]es).\n\nDespite its power, this spell's usefulness is very character-dependent. In general, it doesn't do much that good [[EV]] ''or'' [[AC]] won't do. Usually, the characters who will find this the most useful are the purest of casters: it is possible for a low-HP [[deep elf]] to conquer [[the Realm of Zot]] with 8 AC and 16 EV if they make very judicious use of this and other utility spells.\n\nGiven that it is not usually necessary to cast this spell in combat, it is perfectly fine to have this spell at a high failure chance, take your armour and shield off and put on various items of wizardry in order to cast it. It is unlikely that any of even the most severe [[miscast effect]]s can have a marked effect if you cast this spell in a completely safe location (eg. a cleared floor). Doing this may significantly reduce the amount of skill required to cast it.\n\n==Monster Version==\nThe monster version of the spell functions much like the player version, but monsters generate with the spell already active.\n\nThe following enemies cast Deflect Missiles:\n\n*{{monsterlink|wind drake}}\n*{{monsterlink|spriggan air mage}}\n*{{monsterlink|the Enchantress}}\n*{{monsterlink|Sojobo}}\n\n==History==\n*Deflect Missiles was removed in [[0.25]]. Monsters that could cast this spell got [[Repel Missiles]] and +2 [[EV]] instead.\n*Prior to [[0.14]], deflecting missiles status expired based on a timer.\n\n==References==\n<references />"}

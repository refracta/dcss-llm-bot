Which god they made this vow to remains a point of bitter contention among the devout, but their pendant's power - and limitations - are irrefutable.}}\n\n[[File:Hermit's pendant.png]] '''''the Hermit's Pendant'''''<br>\n[[Amulet of faith]]<br>\nSets the wearer's [[Invocations]] skill to 14 and their [[Evocations]] skill to 0.<br>\n+5 MP\n\n==Desirability==\nThe '''Hermit's pendant'''<ref>{{source ref|0.31.0|art-data.txt|1723}}</ref> is usually found early, before you'll have another amulet. Even as a regular [[amulet of faith]], it can help you survive the early game. The Evocations downside is clear, though many [[wand]]s remain useful at 0 skill. Meanwhile, 14 Invocations will greatly boost the strength and/or success rates of your divine abilities. It also means that you don't have to train the Invocations skill, saving you some XP.\n\nThe benefit of faith and 14 Invocations will depend on your current [[god]]. Gods like [[Nemelex]] and [[Uskayaw]] benefit greatly from both faith and Invocations. Yet, even if your god doesn't use Invocations skill, the faith intrinsic alone can be worth it. Even if your god doesn't use faith, casters can use it for the +5 MP.\n\nThe only penalty of removing this artefact is the usual piety penalty from any amulet of faith. It may be wise to take the pendant off if you want to train Invocations past 14, or if you want Evocations skill at all. If your god doesn't benefit from faith, you can remove this item with no penalty.\n\nThis artefact is more likely to spawn in the early game, where it is more likely to be useful.\n\n==History==\n*The Hermit's pendant was added in [[0.30]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Unrands]]\n[[Category:Amulets]]"}

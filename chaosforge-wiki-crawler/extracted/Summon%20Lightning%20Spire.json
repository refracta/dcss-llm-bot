{"title":"Summon Lightning Spire","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Summon_Lightning_Spire","type":"raw","data":"{{version031}}\n{{spell info}}\n'''Summon Lightning Spire''' is a level 4 [[Summonings|Summoning]]/[[Air Magic|Air]] spell which summons a [[lightning spire]].\n\n[[Summoner]]s begin with this spell in their libraries.\n\n==Useful Info==\nAn immobile lightning spire that shoots [[Electrical Bolt|bolts of electricity]] will be summoned in a random location within two tiles of the caster. The location must be empty and not [[deep water]] or [[lava]]. \n\nSpires' Electrical Bolts can pierce through enemies and will bounce from most [[wall]]s (potentially [[doublezap|hitting targets twice]]). Unlike the similar [[Lightning Bolt]] spell, the lightning spire's bolts are quiet and reasonably accurate. \n\nHigher spell power increases the spire's [[hit dice]], which increases its HP, accuracy, and damage. Lightning spire HD equals <code><spell power> / 10</code> (minimum of 1).<ref>{{source ref|0.30.1|spl-summoning.cc|847}}</ref>.\n\nThe construct lasts for around 18 turns; it does not depend on spell power.\n\nThere is a summon limit of 1; casting the spell again will cause the old summon to very quickly time out.\n\n==Strategy==\nLightning spires offer a fair bit of damage for its MP cost, at least for the early game. Unlike other low-level summons, it can shoot from a distance. One use of the spire is with [[kiting]]: summon a spire, back away, and let the spire get free shots. Even if you can't kite, it's good for the damage/MP alone.\n\nElectric bolts can [[doublezap]] if they reflect off a [[wall]]. If the spire isn't placed in a way that allows that to happen and you have MP to spare, you can summon a new one to try to place it somewhere better.\n\n===Tips & Tricks===\n*Spires will avoid shooting allies, including you, unless they are resistant or invisible. Make sure to position yourself and your allies in a way that allows the spire to fire.\n*Spires cannot see [[invisible]]. If you're invisible, it will fire bolts right through you. Conversely, spires are useless against invisible enemies, unless there is a visible monster behind them.\n*Like other summons, spires can be used to block line of fire, or to seal off a corridor when you need to retreat.\n**However, the random placement might mean that the spire blocks off ''your'' retreat path. You can attack it with ctrl-direction or '''v''' to make it dissipate instantly.\n*Spires are immune to  [[electricity]], [[poison]], and [[negative energy]], so you can use spells of those elements without harming the spire.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to around [[0.29]], allies weren't smart enough to stop their attacks before they'd hit you. So in this kind of position:\n .....\n .@y8.\n .....\n:The spire would not shoot, because it would hit you.\n*Prior to [[0.25]], the spire was summoned to a targeted location instead of a random one. Before this change, Lightning Spire was often considered one of the best spells in the game.\n*This spell was added in [[0.14]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>"}

For the player race, see [[deep dwarf]].''\n\n'''Deep dwarves''' are a strange people who live deep in the cold earth, worshiping gods of death and practicing [[Necromancy]]. They do not heal naturally but are generally well-armed, and their deep dwarf [[Deep dwarf#Damage Reduction|damage shaving]] provides surprising resilience to all forms of harm.\n\nHostile deep dwarves have largely been phased out of ''Crawl'', as their lack of regeneration made fighting them very low-risk. While they were still present, they could occasionally be found roving in [[the Abyss]], though you might also have encountered them in various death- and necromancy-themed branches and vaults. Nowadays, if you see a deep dwarf, it's usually a [[shapeshifter (monster)|shapeshifter]].\n==Deep Dwarf Types==\n{{Brown|q}} [[File:Deep dwarf (monster).png]] '''[[Deep dwarf (monster)|Deep dwarf]]''' - Vaguely sturdy melee fighters with damage shaving but no ability to heal.\n\n==Retired Deep Dwarves==\n{{monsterlink|Deep dwarf artificer}} - Ranged opponents that carried [[wand]]s or [[rod]]s.\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep dwarf scion}} - Deep dwarf foot soldiers, better trained and equipped than their generic brethren.\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep dwarf berserker}} - Savage [[Trog]] worshipers in search of carnage.\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep dwarf necromancer}} - Moderately powerful necromancers who wielded [[negative energy]] attacks.\n\n{{monsterlink|Deep dwarf death knight}} - Stark worshipers of [[Yredelemnul]] armed with powerful necromantic abilities.\n\n{{monsterlink|Unborn deep dwarf}} - Deep dwarven [[lich]]es with an extremely potent array of evil spells and the ability to cast Mirror Damage.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.17]], [[Jorgrun]] was a deep dwarf.\n*In [[0.15]], [[Deep dwarf death knight]]s were replaced by human [[death knight]]s. \n*Deep dwarf berserkers were removed in [[0.14]].\n*Deep dwarf scions, artificers, and necromancers were removed in [[0.13]], which also reworked unborn deep dwarves into the similar but non-dwarven [[Unborn]].\n\n[[Category:Lists of monsters]]\n[[Category:Dwarf]]"}

{"title":"Wandering mushroom","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Wandering_mushroom","type":"raw","data":"{{version030}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Wandering mushrooms''' are shy, fungal monsters with [[confusing]] melee attacks. Hostile mushrooms cannot move while in your [[line of sight]]. Every time a wandering mushroom attacks, it loses 1 [[HD]], becoming weaker (and dying at 0 HD).\n\nMonsters can summon them using the [[Summon Mushrooms]] spell, while players can use [[Fedhas]]' Overgrow ability to create them.\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*By the time you find [[curse toe]]s, wandering mushrooms aren't anything special. However, the mushrooms can block your retreat path, and they can finish off players who've been hit by the toe's [[torment]] a few times. You may want to clear them out.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.17]], wandering mushrooms spawned naturally. They can still be summoned by [[curse toe]]s, or created by Fedhas."}

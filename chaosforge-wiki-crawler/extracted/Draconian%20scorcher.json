Although less capable of dealing massive damage than [[draconian annihilator]]s, they are still a major threat, as their [[hellfire]] attacks can pierce any character's defenses. They are commonly found in [[the Realm of Zot]], and occasionally appear in [[the Abyss]] as well. Scorchers typically generate as [[red draconian]]s, who have a [[Searing Breath]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\nBeing adjacent to a scorcher will usually prevent them from casting fireball or hellfire, due to a reluctancy to blow themselves up.\n\n==History==\n*Prior to [[0.28]], classed draconians generated with random colours.\n*In [[0.24]], they can use [[Call Down Damnation]] when not at low HP.\n*Prior to [[0.16]], they could cast [[Sticky Flame Range]] instead of [[Bolt of Magma]].\n*Draconian scorchers, as with the other [[List of draconians|monster draconians]], were added in [[0.1]]."}

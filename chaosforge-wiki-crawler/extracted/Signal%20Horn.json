{"title":"Signal Horn","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Signal_Horn","type":"raw","data":"{{version016}}\n\n'''Signal Horn''' is a special ability unique to [[vault sentinel]]s. When they sound their horn, they generate [[noise]] as though they'd just read a [[scroll of noise]], waking up nearby monsters. When coupled with their spell [[Sentinel's Mark]], this results in lots of monsters converging on your location very soon.\n\nMuch like [[Geryon]]'s ability to sound the [[horn of Geryon]], you can disable this with [[Silence]]."}

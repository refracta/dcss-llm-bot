{"title":"Glowing orange brain","url":"http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Glowing_orange_brain","type":"raw","data":"{{version028}}\n{{monster info}}\n\n==Useful Info==\n'''Glowing orange brains''' are dangerous [[evil]] casters which can summon brutal monsters, feed on your intellect, or confuse you. While not too intimidating initially, they can create powerful reinforcements quickly and complicate almost any fight. They can be found in [[the Depths]], [[the Vaults]], and rarely in [[the Slime Pits]].\n\n{{monster spells}}\n\n==Tips & Tricks==\n*Use a source of [[clarity]] and try to kill them as quickly as possible to avoid a summoning spree. They aren't too durable, so a few high-powered [[Conjurations]] should take them out, but melee fighters may wish to lure them around a corner to avoid a dangerous charge into melee range.\n*[[Airstrike]] works well, taking advantage of their low AC and flight. [[Bolt spells]] or other attacks that let you hit them even when they're hiding behind allies are also handy.\n*No matter how frightening their summoned allies are, remember that killing the summoner will eliminate all its summons. This may be a safer, faster escape route than fleeing on foot or trying to [[teleport]] away.\n*Because the glowing orange brain can summon creatures, it has access to the [[abjuration]] spell.\n\n==History==\n{{CBA|0.32|glowing orange brains will get an [[aura]] of brilliance and will become [[cautious]].}}\n*Prior to [[0.19]], this monster was known as '''giant orange brain'''.\n*Prior to [[0.17]], giant orange brains could cast [[Teleport Self]].\n*Prior to [[0.14]], giant orange brains knew [[Confuse]] in place of [[Mass Confusion]]."}

The ring's power cannot be invoked while levitating.}}\n\nA [[ring of levitation]] can be evoked to gain [[levitation]] (or [[flying]] with an [[amulet of controlled flight]]).\n\nAlthough useful, the ring has one crucial limitation: unlike the [[Flight (spell)|Flight]] spell, you cannot re-evoke the ring while already levitating. Bring an emergency [[scroll of blinking]] or [[potion of levitation]] if you intend to cross long stretches of [[deep water]] or [[lava]].  Alternatively, make a habit of immediately evoking the ring to descend after you have crossed the  obstacle at hand; this way, you're much less likely to try to cross a subsequent obstacle without the full duration of levitation time given by the ring. \n\n==History==\nRings of levitation were replaced with [[ring of flight|rings of flight]] in [[0.12]].\n\n[[Category:Ring]]"}

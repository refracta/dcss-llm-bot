Yeomen are based primarily around the Yeoman Warders of the Tower of London, and are melee-focused combatants similar to [Knights](/wiki/Knight \"Knight\"), with more skill in riding and polearm use. Yeomen must be generated male and lawful, and may be [humans](/wiki/Human_\\(starting_race\\) \"Human (starting race)\"), [elves](/wiki/Elf_\\(starting_race\\) \"Elf (starting race)\") or [hobbits](/wiki/Hobbit_\\(starting_race\\) \"Hobbit (starting race)\"). According to the guidebook:\n\n```\nYeomen are sturdy fighters. They are famed for their ability to stand doing nothing for hours. It is said that this is because they  are  none  too bright. Yeomen can both take a lot of damage and inflict it on others.\n```\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Starting Inventory](#Starting_Inventory)\n- [2 Abilities](#Abilities)\n- [3 Skills](#Skills)\n- [4 Rank titles](#Rank_titles)\n- [5 Yeomen vs. Knights](#Yeomen_vs._Knights)\n- [6 Polearms (and Reaper)](#Polearms_.28and_Reaper.29)\n- [7 Swords](#Swords)\n- [8 The early game](#The_early_game)\n- [9 The midgame](#The_midgame)\n  - [9.1 Yeoman quest](#Yeoman_quest)\n- [10 The late game](#The_late_game)\n\n## Starting Inventory\n\n- a +2 [short sword](/wiki/Short_sword \"Short sword\")\n- a +1 [partisan](/wiki/Partisan \"Partisan\")\n- +1 [leather armor](/wiki/Leather_armor \"Leather armor\")\n- +0 [high boots](/wiki/High_boots \"High boots\")\n- +0 [leather gloves](/wiki/Leather_gloves \"Leather gloves\")\n- 10-20 [apples](/wiki/Apple \"Apple\")\n- 10-20 [carrots](/wiki/Carrot \"Carrot\")\n- 3 uncursed [potions of water](/wiki/Potions_of_water \"Potions of water\")\n- a [fishing pole](/wiki/Fishing_pole \"Fishing pole\")\n\nA Yeoman's starting pet is always a [saddled](/wiki/Saddle \"Saddle\") [pony](/wiki/Pony \"Pony\").\n\n## Abilities\n\nYeomen can identify all non-magical weapons and armor from the beginning. Yeomen begin the game with the [calm steed](/wiki/Calm_steed \"Calm steed\") technique, which does nothing likely due to a bug.\n\nYeomen also start the game with intrinsically slow [speed](/wiki/Speed \"Speed\"), making 4 moves for every 5 units of time.\n\n- At experience level 7 Yeomen gain intrinsic [speed](/wiki/Speed \"Speed\").\n- At experience level 15 Yeomen gain the intrinsic ability to [swim](/wiki/Swim \"Swim\").\n\n## Skills\n\n| Yeoman skills |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Max           | Skills                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Basic         | -

Both can become expert riders, and start with a saddled pony. Both start with apples and carrots to keep their ponies fed and to train apport. Yeomen cannot intrinsically jump, but can easily gain that ability with boots, without being restricted to a knights move. Yeomen get the [calm steed](/wiki/Calm_steed \"Calm steed\") [technique](/wiki/Technique \"Technique\"), but miss out on the healing hands and turn undead. Yeomen can become expert at polearms, but only skilled at lance, where it is the opposite for Knights. Another similarity is their quest artifact, the [Crown of Saint Edward](/wiki/Crown_of_Saint_Edward \"Crown of Saint Edward\") is a Lawful Helm of telepathy, it confers magic resistance and half spell damage when carried. The Knight's [Magic Mirror of Merlin](/wiki/Magic_Mirror_of_Merlin \"Magic Mirror of Merlin\") also confers magic resistance and telepathy, and doubles some spell damage.\n\n## Polearms (and [Reaper](/wiki/Reaper \"Reaper\"))\n\nYeomen are the only class that can gain expert at polearms. Like lances, you can use a polearm in melee normally without bashing while mounted. Unlike lances, you cannot joust an enemy with a polearm. However, polearms have a few distinct advantages over lances. They will not break like lances can on an unlucky joust. They are much more common. They are lighter, ranging from ranseurs and spetums weighing 50 to halberds and lucern hammers at 150. Lances weigh 180. The better polearms do more damage, and though your starting partisan is the weakest in the category, its average damage is equal to the knight's starting lance.\n\n- Lances do 1d6 vs small and 1d8 vs large or 3.5 to 4.5 on average.\n- Halberds do 1d10 vs small and 2d6 vs large or 5.5 to 7 on average.\n\nThere are no artifact lances, but the Yeoman's second sacrifice gift is the fantastic lawful halberd [Reaper](/wiki/Reaper \"Reaper\") which has +5 to hit and +20 to damage when pounding and in melee while riding. Pounding a large monster with Reaper while mounted gives an average base damage of 27, with a follow-up melee for another 27. That is an *average* damage of 54 points before most monsters can hit once, and before enchantment and skill bonuses. The same scenario with a lance would pound at 4.5, and joust (20-80% of the time) for 16 for a total of 20.5 points. If you have jump boots, and a light source you can do massive damage just pounding with Reaper, without the risk of breakage, or the chance of not jousting, and the +5 to hit means you will rarely miss.\n\n## Swords\n\nAlthough you start with a pretty well enchanted +2 short sword, and can gain expert in the skill, if you can find a longsword, you should consider switching. Yeomen can become skilled at longsword have relatively easy access to [Excalibur](/wiki/Excalibur \"Excalibur\"). The first sacrifice gift for Yeomen is the very good [Sword of Justice](/wiki/Sword_of_Justice \"Sword of Justice\"), a longsword with +5 to hit and +12 to damage against neutral and chaotic monsters. Since Yeomen can become skilled at two weapon, and in Slash'em you can [#twoweapon](#twoweapon) with two artifacts, Excalibur and Sword of Justice are a very effective combination.\n\nIf you are skilled at #twoweapon and skilled at longsword, and are wielding both the +7 Excalibur and +7 Sword of Justice, you will do more damage per hit than with an Expert +7 Reaper. You will also get drain resistance and searching, but there are disadvantages to carrying Excalibur, particularly in Gehennom, and Sword of Justice is less effective in the Astral Plane. There are fewer keystrokes involved in just slashing away at monsters than applying a polearm, jumping and applying again, so lazy Yeomen will prefer this strategy.\n\nNote that hobbit Yeomen cannot #twoweapon at all, so advancing longsword is less attractive.\n\n## The early game\n\nThe early game can be difficult with your intrinsic slowness, but can become quite a strong fighter very quickly if played well. Your initial focus should be on helping your pony to grow into a [warhorse](/wiki/Warhorse \"Warhorse\") and improving your skill with [polearms](/wiki/Polearm \"Polearm\"). A good strategy is to repeatedly engrave Elbereth in the dust and chop away at foes by applying your partisan at range. Other strategies to improve polearm skill include moving so as to keep your horse between you and your foe, picking up an item in a shop and attacking over the [shopkeeper](/wiki/Shopkeeper \"Shopkeeper\")'s head, and attacking with it in melee while mounted. The last strategy should be delayed until you have enough HP to survive a failed mounting attempt (at least 20). You will get speed at level 7, and by the time your pony grows up it will let you move faster than even a pair of [speed boots](/wiki/Speed_boots \"Speed boots\").\n\nYour starting +2 [short sword](/wiki/Short_sword \"Short sword\") will help you hit foes and gain your first few levels, but it's not worth trying to advance short sword skill in light of the other powerful weapons you will soon have access to; focus on polearm instead. You may want to collect a stack of daggers in the mines to use for ranged fighting, but these are heavy and burdening an already slow player is particularly dangerous. If your horse grows up into a [warhorse](/wiki/Warhorse \"Warhorse\") pounding with your polearm while mounted is probably a better strategy. If you find an early [long sword](/wiki/Long_sword \"Long sword\"), begin training with it as soon as possible. Once you get to level 5, you can begin to dip for [Excalibur](/wiki/Excalibur \"Excalibur\"). The [Rat King](/wiki/Rat_King \"Rat King\") has a longsword, but is not always generated. Watching your horse fight a [watch captain](/wiki/Watch_captain \"Watch captain\") will reveal what weapon he carries, and if it's a long sword, you may try to [disarm](/wiki/Disarm \"Disarm\") him (and then be ready to run!) In the worst case, you will eventually get one from a [barrow wight](/wiki/Barrow_wight \"Barrow wight\") or from the quest. When you find an altar, you will also be able to sacrifice for the [Sword of Justice](/wiki/Sword_of_Justice \"Sword of Justice\") (your guaranteed first [sacrifice gift](/wiki/Sacrifice_gift \"Sacrifice gift\")), one of the best lawful artifacts in the game. Two-weaponing with the [Sword of Justice](/wiki/Sword_of_Justice \"Sword of Justice\") and [Excalibur](/wiki/Excalibur \"Excalibur\") makes for a potent offense.\n\nYou should trade up for a better polearm if you come across one. Spetums are a favorite because they are light and do a good deal of damage. Bardiches and halberds are upgrades in damage, but are heavier. Any other unenchanted polearm would be a downgrade from your +1 partisan, or at best a wash. Once you find an altar, do keep sacrificing until you get [Reaper](/wiki/Reaper \"Reaper\") (your guaranteed second [sacrifice gift](/wiki/Sacrifice_gift \"Sacrifice gift\")), at which point the game will suddenly become much easier.\n\nYou should also try to find an [unlocking tool](/wiki/Unlocking_tool \"Unlocking tool\") (check the [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\") shops, the mall, or kill a [plastic golem](/wiki/Plastic_golem \"Plastic golem\")), so you don't have to dismount to open locked doors. An axe or pickaxe will do in a pinch as well.\n\n## The midgame\n\nThe Yeoman's midgame is straightforward and not overly difficult. Try to get a source of [reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\") and [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\"); the latter is especially critical as losing your warhorse to a polymorph trap will make you much slower. As with most SLASH'EM roles, you should make for the [Black Market](/wiki/Black_Market \"Black Market\") as soon as you finish [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") (or possibly after getting the [luckstone](/wiki/Luckstone \"Luckstone\") from [Mine's End](/wiki/Mine%27s_End \"Mine's End\")) and before doing any of the dangerous SLASH'EM dungeon branches. If you plan to kill Sam for his ascension gear, hold off on buying protection until after you have done so.\n\n### Yeoman quest\n\n- *Main article: [Yeoman quest](/wiki/Yeoman_quest \"Yeoman quest\")*\n\nOnce you are sufficiently strong in melee and well-armored, you should complete the Yeoman quest. [Colonel Blood](/wiki/Colonel_Blood \"Colonel Blood\") hits hard, but is not an overly tough foe, and the [Crown of Saint Edward](/wiki/Crown_of_Saint_Edward \"Crown of Saint Edward\") will give you both [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\") and [half spell damage](/wiki/Half_spell_damage \"Half spell damage\"), as well as extrinsic [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\"). You will also find plenty of bullets and firearms from the soldiers on the quest, as well as a guaranteed long sword and co-aligned altar. Pick up bullets whenever you see them, as exploding grenades will destroy them if they are lying about or in a soldier's inventory.\n\n## The late game\n\nIn the late game, a good scenario to aspire to is:\n\n- Expert at riding, riding a ki-rin with a blessed saddle (worth a wish to get a blessed figurine of a ki-rin)\n- Expert at polearms, wielding the blessed rustproof +7 Reaper (or two-weaponing with [Excalibur](/wiki/Excalibur \"Excalibur\") and another powerful artifact such as [Grayswandir](/wiki/Grayswandir \"Grayswandir\"), [Frost Brand](/wiki/Frost_Brand \"Frost Brand\"), [Fire Brand](/wiki/Fire_Brand \"Fire Brand\"), or [Sword of Justice](/wiki/Sword_of_Justice \"Sword of Justice\"))\n- Wearing blessed +5 fixed gauntlets of dexterity (This is a nice boost to AC for every SLASH'EM character)\n- Wearing blessed +5 fixed jumping boots (speed boots don't enhance speed while riding, but jumping does work)\n- A lit blessed magic lamp or magic candle. Although the candle is preferable (lighter and no chance of giving a wish), having a permanent source of light is more important than an 80% chance of one wish while using Reaper, and required for jumping and pounding in dark places. There will always be a magic lamp you can swim for in the [Sunless Sea](/wiki/Special_level_\\(SLASH%27EM\\)#Sunless_Sea \"Special level (SLASH'EM)\").\n- the rest of a standard [Ascension kit](/wiki/Ascension_kit \"Ascension kit\")\n\nIt is also worth sacrificing for [minions](/wiki/Minion \"Minion\") at higher levels, as a Yeoman has access to powerful [devas](/wiki/Deva \"Deva\"), and eventually mega-powerful [Archons](/wiki/Archon \"Archon\"), [Planetars](/wiki/Planetar \"Planetar\"), and [Solars](/wiki/Solar \"Solar\"). With your full ascension kit, your fast flying steed, and your powerful retinue, you can head into the end-game as a nearly unstoppable tank and have a very satisfying experience.\n\n[![This article may require revision for the next version of SLASH'EM.

Both can become expert riders, and start with a saddled pony. Both start with apples and carrots to keep their ponies fed and to train apport. Yeomen cannot intrinsically jump, but can easily gain that ability with boots, without being restricted to a knights move. Yeomen get the <a href=\"/wiki/Calm_steed\" title=\"Calm steed\">calm steed</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Technique\" title=\"Technique\">technique</a>, but miss out on the healing hands and turn undead. Yeomen can become expert at polearms, but only skilled at lance, where it is the opposite for Knights. Another similarity is their quest artifact, the <a href=\"/wiki/Crown_of_Saint_Edward\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crown of Saint Edward\">Crown of Saint Edward</a> is a Lawful Helm of telepathy, it confers magic resistance and half spell damage when carried. The Knight's <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_Mirror_of_Merlin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Magic Mirror of Merlin\">Magic Mirror of Merlin</a> also confers magic resistance and telepathy, and doubles some spell damage.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Polearms_(and_Reaper)\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Polearms_.28and_Reaper.29\">Polearms (and <a href=\"/wiki/Reaper\" title=\"Reaper\">Reaper</a>)</span></h2>\n<p>Yeomen are the only class that can gain expert at polearms. Like lances, you can use a polearm in melee normally without bashing while mounted. Unlike lances, you cannot joust an enemy with a polearm. However, polearms have a few distinct advantages over lances. They will not break like lances can on an unlucky joust. They are much more common. They are lighter, ranging from ranseurs and spetums weighing 50 to halberds and lucern hammers at 150. Lances weigh 180. The better polearms do more damage, and though your starting partisan is the weakest in the category, its average damage is equal to the knight's starting lance.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Lances do 1d6 vs small and 1d8 vs large or 3.5 to 4.5 on average.</li>\n<li>Halberds do 1d10 vs small and 2d6 vs large or 5.5 to 7 on average.</li></ul>\n<p>There are no artifact lances, but the Yeoman's second sacrifice gift is the fantastic lawful halberd <a href=\"/wiki/Reaper\" title=\"Reaper\">Reaper</a> which has +5 to hit and +20 to damage when pounding and in melee while riding. Pounding a large monster with Reaper while mounted gives an average base damage of 27, with a follow-up melee for another 27. That is an <i>average</i> damage of 54 points before most monsters can hit once, and before enchantment and skill bonuses. The same scenario with a lance would pound at 4.5, and joust (20-80% of the time) for 16 for a total of 20.5 points. If you have jump boots, and a light source you can do massive damage just pounding with Reaper, without the risk of breakage, or the chance of not jousting, and the +5 to hit means you will rarely miss.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Swords\">Swords</span></h2>\n<p>Although you start with a pretty well enchanted +2 short sword, and can gain expert in the skill, if you can find a longsword, you should consider switching. Yeomen can become skilled at longsword have relatively easy access to <a href=\"/wiki/Excalibur\" title=\"Excalibur\">Excalibur</a>. The first sacrifice gift for Yeomen is the very good <a href=\"/wiki/Sword_of_Justice\" title=\"Sword of Justice\">Sword of Justice</a>, a longsword with +5 to hit and +12 to damage against neutral and chaotic monsters. Since Yeomen can become skilled at two weapon, and in Slash'em you can <a href=\"#twoweapon\">#twoweapon</a> with two artifacts, Excalibur and Sword of Justice are a very effective combination.\n</p><p>If you are skilled at #twoweapon and skilled at longsword, and are wielding both the +7 Excalibur and +7 Sword of Justice, you will do more damage per hit than with an Expert +7 Reaper. You will also get drain resistance and searching, but there are disadvantages to carrying Excalibur, particularly in Gehennom, and Sword of Justice is less effective in the Astral Plane. There are fewer keystrokes involved in just slashing away at monsters than applying a polearm, jumping and applying again, so lazy Yeomen will prefer this strategy.\n</p><p>Note that hobbit Yeomen cannot #twoweapon at all, so advancing longsword is less attractive.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_early_game\">The early game</span></h2>\n<p>The early game can be difficult with your intrinsic slowness, but can become quite a strong fighter very quickly if played well. Your initial focus should be on helping your pony to grow into a <a href=\"/wiki/Warhorse\" title=\"Warhorse\">warhorse</a> and improving your skill with <a href=\"/wiki/Polearm\" title=\"Polearm\">polearms</a>. A good strategy is to repeatedly engrave Elbereth in the dust and chop away at foes by applying your partisan at range. Other strategies to improve polearm skill include moving so as to keep your horse between you and your foe, picking up an item in a shop and attacking over the <a href=\"/wiki/Shopkeeper\" title=\"Shopkeeper\">shopkeeper</a>'s head, and attacking with it in melee while mounted. The last strategy should be delayed until you have enough HP to survive a failed mounting attempt (at least 20). You will get speed at level 7, and by the time your pony grows up it will let you move faster than even a pair of <a href=\"/wiki/Speed_boots\" title=\"Speed boots\">speed boots</a>.\n</p><p>Your starting +2 <a href=\"/wiki/Short_sword\" title=\"Short sword\">short sword</a> will help you hit foes and gain your first few levels, but it's not worth trying to advance short sword skill in light of the other powerful weapons you will soon have access to; focus on polearm instead. You may want to collect a stack of daggers in the mines to use for ranged fighting, but these are heavy and burdening an already slow player is particularly dangerous. If your horse grows up into a <a href=\"/wiki/Warhorse\" title=\"Warhorse\">warhorse</a> pounding with your polearm while mounted is probably a better strategy. If you find an early <a href=\"/wiki/Long_sword\" title=\"Long sword\">long sword</a>, begin training with it as soon as possible. Once you get to level 5, you can begin to dip for <a href=\"/wiki/Excalibur\" title=\"Excalibur\">Excalibur</a>. The <a href=\"/wiki/Rat_King\" title=\"Rat King\">Rat King</a> has a longsword, but is not always generated. Watching your horse fight a <a href=\"/wiki/Watch_captain\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Watch captain\">watch captain</a> will reveal what weapon he carries, and if it's a long sword, you may try to <a href=\"/wiki/Disarm\" title=\"Disarm\">disarm</a> him (and then be ready to run!) In the worst case, you will eventually get one from a <a href=\"/wiki/Barrow_wight\" title=\"Barrow wight\">barrow wight</a> or from the quest. When you find an altar, you will also be able to sacrifice for the <a href=\"/wiki/Sword_of_Justice\" title=\"Sword of Justice\">Sword of Justice</a> (your guaranteed first <a href=\"/wiki/Sacrifice_gift\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sacrifice gift\">sacrifice gift</a>), one of the best lawful artifacts in the game. Two-weaponing with the <a href=\"/wiki/Sword_of_Justice\" title=\"Sword of Justice\">Sword of Justice</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Excalibur\" title=\"Excalibur\">Excalibur</a> makes for a potent offense.\n</p><p>You should trade up for a better polearm if you come across one. Spetums are a favorite because they are light and do a good deal of damage. Bardiches and halberds are upgrades in damage, but are heavier. Any other unenchanted polearm would be a downgrade from your +1 partisan, or at best a wash. Once you find an altar, do keep sacrificing until you get <a href=\"/wiki/Reaper\" title=\"Reaper\">Reaper</a> (your guaranteed second <a href=\"/wiki/Sacrifice_gift\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sacrifice gift\">sacrifice gift</a>), at which point the game will suddenly become much easier.\n</p><p>You should also try to find an <a href=\"/wiki/Unlocking_tool\" title=\"Unlocking tool\">unlocking tool</a> (check the <a href=\"/wiki/Minetown\" title=\"Minetown\">Minetown</a> shops, the mall, or kill a <a href=\"/wiki/Plastic_golem\" title=\"Plastic golem\">plastic golem</a>), so you don't have to dismount to open locked doors. An axe or pickaxe will do in a pinch as well.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_midgame\">The midgame</span></h2>\n<p>The Yeoman's midgame is straightforward and not overly difficult. Try to get a source of <a href=\"/wiki/Reflection\" title=\"Reflection\">reflection</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a>; the latter is especially critical as losing your warhorse to a polymorph trap will make you much slower. As with most SLASH'EM roles, you should make for the <a href=\"/wiki/Black_Market\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Black Market\">Black Market</a> as soon as you finish <a href=\"/wiki/Sokoban\" title=\"Sokoban\">Sokoban</a> (or possibly after getting the <a href=\"/wiki/Luckstone\" title=\"Luckstone\">luckstone</a> from <a href=\"/wiki/Mine%27s_End\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mine&#39;s End\">Mine's End</a>) and before doing any of the dangerous SLASH'EM dungeon branches. If you plan to kill Sam for his ascension gear, hold off on buying protection until after you have done so.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Yeoman_quest\">Yeoman quest</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><div class=\"noprint relarticle mainarticle\"><i>Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Yeoman_quest\" title=\"Yeoman quest\">Yeoman quest</a></i></div></dd></dl>\n<p>Once you are sufficiently strong in melee and well-armored, you should complete the Yeoman quest. <a href=\"/wiki/Colonel_Blood\" title=\"Colonel Blood\">Colonel Blood</a> hits hard, but is not an overly tough foe, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Crown_of_Saint_Edward\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crown of Saint Edward\">Crown of Saint Edward</a> will give you both <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Half_spell_damage\" title=\"Half spell damage\">half spell damage</a>, as well as extrinsic <a href=\"/wiki/Telepathy\" title=\"Telepathy\">telepathy</a>. You will also find plenty of bullets and firearms from the soldiers on the quest, as well as a guaranteed long sword and co-aligned altar. Pick up bullets whenever you see them, as exploding grenades will destroy them if they are lying about or in a soldier's inventory.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_late_game\">The late game</span></h2>\n<p>In the late game, a good scenario to aspire to is:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Expert at riding, riding a ki-rin with a blessed saddle (worth a wish to get a blessed figurine of a ki-rin)</li>\n<li>Expert at polearms, wielding the blessed rustproof +7 Reaper (or two-weaponing with <a href=\"/wiki/Excalibur\" title=\"Excalibur\">Excalibur</a> and another powerful artifact such as <a href=\"/wiki/Grayswandir\" title=\"Grayswandir\">Grayswandir</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Frost_Brand\" title=\"Frost Brand\">Frost Brand</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Fire_Brand\" title=\"Fire Brand\">Fire Brand</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Sword_of_Justice\" title=\"Sword of Justice\">Sword of Justice</a>)</li>\n<li>Wearing blessed +5 fixed gauntlets of dexterity (This is a nice boost to AC for every SLASH'EM character)</li>\n<li>Wearing blessed +5 fixed jumping boots (speed boots don't enhance speed while riding, but jumping does work)</li>\n<li>A lit blessed magic lamp or magic candle. Although the candle is preferable (lighter and no chance of giving a wish), having a permanent source of light is more important than an 80% chance of one wish while using Reaper, and required for jumping and pounding in dark places. There will always be a magic lamp you can swim for in the <a href=\"/wiki/Special_level_(SLASH%27EM)#Sunless_Sea\" title=\"Special level (SLASH&#39;EM)\">Sunless Sea</a>.</li>\n<li>the rest of a standard <a href=\"/wiki/Ascension_kit\" title=\"Ascension kit\">Ascension kit</a></li></ul>\n<p>It is also worth sacrificing for <a href=\"/wiki/Minion\" title=\"Minion\">minions</a> at higher levels, as a Yeoman has access to powerful <a href=\"/wiki/Deva\" title=\"Deva\">devas</a>, and eventually mega-powerful <a href=\"/wiki/Archon\" title=\"Archon\">Archons</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Planetar\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Planetar\">Planetars</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Solar\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Solar\">Solars</a>. With your full ascension kit, your fast flying steed, and your powerful retinue, you can head into the end-game as a nearly unstoppable tank and have a very satisfying experience.\n</p>\n<div style=\"display:none; right:44px; padding-bottom: 17px\" class=\"metadata topicon nopopups\"><div style=\"margin-top: -10px\"><a href=\"/wiki/NetHackWiki:Next_version\" title=\"This article may require revision for the next version of SLASH&#39;EM.

Warders}}\n\nThe '''Yeoman''' is a [[role]] that appears in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[SlashTHEM]]. Yeomen are based primarily around the Yeoman Warders of the Tower of London, and are melee-focused combatants similar to [[Knight]]s, with more skill in riding and polearm use. Yeomen must be generated male and lawful, and may be [[Human (starting race)|humans]], [[Elf (starting race)|elves]] or [[Hobbit (starting race)|hobbits]]. According to the guidebook:\n\n Yeomen are sturdy fighters. They are famed for their ability to stand doing nothing for hours. It is said that this is because they  are  none  too bright. Yeomen can both take a lot of damage and inflict it on others.\n\n== Starting Inventory ==\n\n* a +2 [[short sword]]\n* a +1 [[partisan]]\n* +1 [[leather armor]]\n* +0 [[high boots]]\n* +0 [[leather gloves]]\n* 10-20 [[apple]]s\n* 10-20 [[carrot]]s\n* 3 uncursed [[potions of water]]\n* a [[fishing pole]]\n\nA Yeoman's starting pet is always a [[saddle]]d [[pony]].\n\n== Abilities ==\n\nYeomen can identify all non-magical weapons and armor from the beginning. Yeomen begin the game with the [[calm steed]] technique, which does nothing likely due to a bug.<!--Does it work in SlashTHEM?-->\n\nYeomen also start the game with intrinsically slow [[speed]], making 4 moves for every 5 units of time.\n\n*At experience level 7 Yeomen gain intrinsic [[speed]].\n*At experience level 15 Yeomen gain the intrinsic ability to [[swim]].\n\n== Skills ==\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:larger\" | Yeoman skills\n|-\n! Max !! Skills\n|-\n| Basic\n|\n* ''Weapons:'' [[knife]], [[broadsword]], [[hammer]], [[spear]], [[sling]], [[dart]], [[whip]], [[unicorn horn]]\n* ''Spells:'' [[body spells|body]]\n|-\n| Skilled\n|\n* ''Weapons:'' [[dagger]], [[axe]], [[long sword]], [[saber]], [[paddle]], [[quarterstaff]], [[javelin]], [[trident]], [[lance]], [[firearms]], [[crossbow]]\n* ''Spells:'' [[enchantment spells|enchantment]], [[protection spells|protection]]\n* ''Combat:'' [[bare hands]], [[two weapon combat]]\n|-\n| Expert\n|\n* ''Weapons:'' [[short sword]], [[polearms]], [[bow]]\n* ''Combat:'' [[riding]]\n|}\n\n==Rank titles==\n\nThe [[status line]] shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\n\n*XL 1-2:Usher\n*XL 3-5:Steward\n*XL 6-9:Keeper\n*XL 10-13:Marshal\n*XL 14-17:Master Steward\n*XL 18-21:Chamberlain\n*XL 22-25:Constable\n*XL 26-29:Chancellor\n*XL 30:Regent\n\n== Yeomen vs. Knights ==\n\nThere are quite a few similarities between Yeomen and Knights. Both can become expert riders, and start with a saddled pony. Both start with apples and carrots to keep their ponies fed and to train apport. Yeomen cannot intrinsically jump, but can easily gain that ability with boots, without being restricted to a knights move. Yeomen get the [[calm steed]] [[technique]], but miss out on the healing hands and turn undead. Yeomen can become expert at polearms, but only skilled at lance, where it is the opposite for Knights. Another similarity is their quest artifact, the [[Crown of Saint Edward]] is a Lawful Helm of telepathy, it confers magic resistance and half spell damage when carried. The Knight's [[Magic Mirror of Merlin]] also confers magic resistance and telepathy, and doubles some spell damage.\n\n== Polearms (and [[Reaper]]) ==\n\nYeomen are the only class that can gain expert at polearms. Like lances, you can use a polearm in melee normally without bashing while mounted. Unlike lances, you cannot joust an enemy with a polearm. However, polearms have a few distinct advantages over lances. They will not break like lances can on an unlucky joust. They are much more common. They are lighter, ranging from ranseurs and spetums weighing 50 to halberds and lucern hammers at 150. Lances weigh 180. The better polearms do more damage, and though your starting partisan is the weakest in the category, its average damage is equal to the knight's starting lance.\n*Lances do 1d6 vs small and 1d8 vs large or 3.5 to 4.5 on average.\n*Halberds do 1d10 vs small and 2d6 vs large or 5.5 to 7 on average.\n\nThere are no artifact lances, but the Yeoman's second sacrifice gift is the fantastic lawful halberd [[Reaper]] which has +5 to hit and +20 to damage when pounding and in melee while riding. Pounding a large monster with Reaper while mounted gives an average base damage of 27, with a follow-up melee for another 27. That is an ''average'' damage of 54 points before most monsters can hit once, and before enchantment and skill bonuses. The same scenario with a lance would pound at 4.5, and joust (20-80% of the time) for 16 for a total of 20.5 points. If you have jump boots, and a light source you can do massive damage just pounding with Reaper, without the risk of breakage, or the chance of not jousting, and the +5 to hit means you will rarely miss.\n\n== Swords ==\n\nAlthough you start with a pretty well enchanted +2 short sword, and can gain expert in the skill, if you can find a longsword, you should consider switching. Yeomen can become skilled at longsword have relatively easy access to [[Excalibur]]. The first sacrifice gift for Yeomen is the very good [[Sword of Justice]], a longsword with +5 to hit and +12 to damage against neutral and chaotic monsters. Since Yeomen can become skilled at two weapon, and in Slash'em you can [[#twoweapon]] with two artifacts, Excalibur and Sword of Justice are a very effective combination.\n\nIf you are skilled at #twoweapon and skilled at longsword, and are wielding both the +7 Excalibur and +7 Sword of Justice, you will do more damage per hit than with an Expert +7 Reaper. You will also get drain resistance and searching, but there are disadvantages to carrying Excalibur, particularly in Gehennom, and Sword of Justice is less effective in the Astral Plane. There are fewer keystrokes involved in just slashing away at monsters than applying a polearm, jumping and applying again, so lazy Yeomen will prefer this strategy.\n\nNote that hobbit Yeomen cannot #twoweapon at all, so advancing longsword is less attractive.\n\n== The early game ==\n\nThe early game can be difficult with your intrinsic slowness, but can become quite a strong fighter very quickly if played well. Your initial focus should be on helping your pony to grow into a [[warhorse]] and improving your skill with [[polearm]]s. A good strategy is to repeatedly engrave Elbereth in the dust and chop away at foes by applying your partisan at range. Other strategies to improve polearm skill include moving so as to keep your horse between you and your foe, picking up an item in a shop and attacking over the [[shopkeeper]]'s head, and attacking with it in melee while mounted. The last strategy should be delayed until you have enough HP to survive a failed mounting attempt (at least 20). You will get speed at level 7, and by the time your pony grows up it will let you move faster than even a pair of [[speed boots]].\n\nYour starting +2 [[short sword]] will help you hit foes and gain your first few levels, but it's not worth trying to advance short sword skill in light of the other powerful weapons you will soon have access to; focus on polearm instead. You may want to collect a stack of daggers in the mines to use for ranged fighting, but these are heavy and burdening an already slow player is particularly dangerous. If your horse grows up into a [[warhorse]] pounding with your polearm while mounted is probably a better strategy. If you find an early [[long sword]], begin training with it as soon as possible. Once you get to level 5, you can begin to dip for [[Excalibur]]. The [[Rat King]] has a longsword, but is not always generated. Watching your horse fight a [[watch captain]] will reveal what weapon he carries, and if it's a long sword, you may try to [[disarm]] him (and then be ready to run!) In the worst case, you will eventually get one from a [[barrow wight]] or from the quest. When you find an altar, you will also be able to sacrifice for the [[Sword of Justice]] (your guaranteed first [[sacrifice gift]]), one of the best lawful artifacts in the game. Two-weaponing with the [[Sword of Justice]] and [[Excalibur]] makes for a potent offense.\n\nYou should trade up for a better polearm if you come across one. Spetums are a favorite because they are light and do a good deal of damage. Bardiches and halberds are upgrades in damage, but are heavier. Any other unenchanted polearm would be a downgrade from your +1 partisan, or at best a wash. Once you find an altar, do keep sacrificing until you get [[Reaper]] (your guaranteed second [[sacrifice gift]]), at which point the game will suddenly become much easier.\n\nYou should also try to find an [[unlocking tool]] (check the [[Minetown]] shops, the mall, or kill a [[plastic golem]]), so you don't have to dismount to open locked doors. An axe or pickaxe will do in a pinch as well.\n\n== The midgame ==\nThe Yeoman's midgame is straightforward and not overly difficult. Try to get a source of [[reflection]] and [[magic resistance]]; the latter is especially critical as losing your warhorse to a polymorph trap will make you much slower. As with most SLASH'EM roles, you should make for the [[Black Market]] as soon as you finish [[Sokoban]] (or possibly after getting the [[luckstone]] from [[Mine's End]]) and before doing any of the dangerous SLASH'EM dungeon branches. If you plan to kill Sam for his ascension gear, hold off on buying protection until after you have done so.\n\n=== Yeoman quest ===\n{{main|Yeoman quest}}\nOnce you are sufficiently strong in melee and well-armored, you should complete the Yeoman quest. [[Colonel Blood]] hits hard, but is not an overly tough foe, and the [[Crown of Saint Edward]] will give you both [[magic resistance]] and [[half spell damage]], as well as extrinsic [[telepathy]]. You will also find plenty of bullets and firearms from the soldiers on the quest, as well as a guaranteed long sword and co-aligned altar. Pick up bullets whenever you see them, as exploding grenades will destroy them if they are lying about or in a soldier's inventory.\n\n== The late game ==\n\nIn the late game, a good scenario to aspire to is:\n*Expert at riding, riding a ki-rin with a blessed saddle (worth a wish to get a blessed figurine of a ki-rin)\n*Expert at polearms, wielding the blessed rustproof +7 Reaper (or two-weaponing with [[Excalibur]] and another powerful artifact such as [[Grayswandir]], [[Frost Brand]], [[Fire Brand]], or [[Sword of Justice]])\n*Wearing blessed +5 fixed gauntlets of dexterity (This is a nice boost to AC for every SLASH'EM character)\n*Wearing blessed +5 fixed jumping boots (speed boots don't enhance speed while riding, but jumping does work)\n*A lit blessed magic lamp or magic candle. Although the candle is preferable (lighter and no chance of giving a wish), having a permanent source of light is more important than an 80% chance of one wish while using Reaper, and required for jumping and pounding in dark places. There will always be a magic lamp you can swim for in the [[Special level (SLASH'EM)#Sunless Sea|Sunless Sea]].\n*the rest of a standard [[Ascension kit]]\n\nIt is also worth sacrificing for [[minion]]s at higher levels, as a Yeoman has access to powerful [[deva]]s, and eventually mega-powerful [[Archon]]s, [[Planetar]]s, and [[Solar]]s. With your full ascension kit, your fast flying steed, and your powerful retinue, you can head into the end-game as a nearly unstoppable tank and have a very satisfying experience.\n{{slashem-7E7|offset=1}}\n{{variant-343}}\n[[Category:SLASH'EM roles]]\n[[Category:SlashTHEM roles]]"}

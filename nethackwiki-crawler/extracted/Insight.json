{"title":"Insight","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Insight","type":"markdown","data":"**Insight** is a feature specific to [dNetHack](/wiki/DNetHack \"DNetHack\"). It represents the player's ability to see \"beyond the veil\": Players with a high insight will encounter creatures they would otherwise never see.\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 The Veil](#The_Veil)\n\n- [2 Methods of changing insight](#Methods_of_changing_insight)\n\n- [3 Insight creatures](#Insight_creatures)\n\n- [4 Insight templates](#Insight_templates)\n\n- [5 Insight merchants](#Insight_merchants)\n\n- [6 Living doll merchants](#Living_doll_merchants)\n\n- [7 Kuker](#Kuker)\n\n- [8 Insight weapons](#Insight_weapons)\n\n  - [8.1 Insight weapon list](#Insight_weapon_list)\n  - [8.2 Insight weapon extra effects](#Insight_weapon_extra_effects)\n\n- [9 References](#References)\n\n## The Veil\n\nThe 'veil' refers to a perception of reality that is permanently altered by the following actions:\n\n- Reading the [Necronomicon](/wiki/DNetHack_artifacts#The_Necronomicon \"DNetHack artifacts\") or the [Book of Lost Names](/wiki/DNetHack_artifacts#The_Book_of_Lost_Names \"DNetHack artifacts\").\n- Successfully binding any [spirit](/wiki/Spirit \"Spirit\").\n- Entering the [Lost Cities](/index.php?title=Lost_Cities\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Lost Cities (page does not exist)\").\n- Playing as an [Anachrononaut](/wiki/Anachrononaut \"Anachrononaut\"), [Binder](/wiki/Binder \"Binder\") or [Madman](/wiki/Madman \"Madman\").\n- Discovering the presence of [The Black Mother](/wiki/The_Black_Mother \"The Black Mother\") and sacrificing to her.\n- Drinking a potion of goat's milk.\n- Turning traitor in the shared Hedrow Quest.\n- Receiving a telepathic message from an [elder brain](/wiki/Elder_brain \"Elder brain\") (possible in the [Drow Noble Quest](/wiki/Drow_Noble_Quest \"Drow Noble Quest\")).\n- Being told terrible truths by an [Apocalypse angel](/wiki/Apocalypse_angel \"Apocalypse angel\").\n\nWhile the 'veil' is intact, the PC has a +10 bonus to [sanity](/wiki/Sanity \"Sanity\") regeneration. Once the 'veil' has been pierced, insight can be accrued and reduced.\n\n## Methods of changing insight\n\n| Change      | Method                                                                                        |\n| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| +1          | Successfully reading the Necronomicon                                                         |\n|             | Successfully reading the Book of Lost Names                                                   |\n|             | Gaining telepathy from a corpse while hallucinating                                           |\n|             | Drinking a cursed potion of enlightenment                                                     |\n|             | Drinking a cursed potion of see invisible (1 in insight chance)                               |\n|             | Seeing an insight-granting monster up close for the first time                                |\n| +X          | Killing an insight-granting monster for the first time.

While a creature is unseen, the character will be unable to harm it in any way. However, many of these monsters will still be able to affect the character while unseen.\n\n| Creature           | Insight to see creature | Effects while unseen                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Bright walker      | 10                      |                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Lurking One        | 20 - 40                 |                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Blasphemous Lurker | 40                      |                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Blessed            | 40                      | Hostile Blessed will periodically spawn monsters while unseen.                                                                                                       |\n| Mouth of the Goat  | 60                      | Mouth will consume any corpses in its space.

If you [chat](/wiki/Chat \"Chat\") to them while wielding an artifact in your main hand, they will offer to take it from you, giving you a \"thought\" in return.[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1) Giving away a gifted artifact will anger the god that gave it to you.\n\nThoughts may also be obtained directly via glyphs. Glyphs may be wished for, found in bones files left by characters with thoughts, or, in the case of beast's embrace glyphs, left as treasure by monsters. Characters must still meet the minimum insight requirement in order to read the glyph.\n\n[Madmen](/wiki/Madmen \"Madmen\") can receive a free thought from their [secret whisperer](/wiki/Secret_whisperer \"Secret whisperer\") once it has become a veil-render due to them gaining 20 insight, but only once. You can receive the guidance thought for free if you read the lit [Holy Moonlight Sword](/wiki/DNetHack_artifacts#The_Holy_Moonlight_Sword \"DNetHack artifacts\") with at least 40 insight (even while blind).\n\nYou may have up to three thoughts in your head at once. Madmen who have completed [their quest](/wiki/Madman_quest \"Madman quest\") and either have at least 20 insight, or have already received a thought from their veil-render, can have four thoughts in their head instead.\n\nThoughts cannot be involuntarily removed, but are only active when you have sufficiently high insight (equal to the lowest possible value that could be required to see the corresponding merchant). Thoughts can be voluntarily removed with a trephination kit, the aid of a nurse, or the aid of a veil-render. Removing a thought results in a glyph, which can be read to return the thought to your head, as long as the character meets the minimum insight requirement.\n\n| Merchant                                                                                                                                                                          | Symbol  | Insight to See Merchant | Related Glyph                      | Thought's Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Bestial dervish                                                                                                                                                                   | X       | 20 -

Before reaching their insight threshold, they appear as \"lifeless dolls\", an object that functions as a living doll corpse. Each doll has an independent threshold of rnd(20) insight. Their corpses can be transported to a more convenient location. After reaching their insight threshold, they will wake up and appear as peaceful ' that sell a variety of dolls when you #[chat](/wiki/Chat \"Chat\") to them. [\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2)\n\nIf a doll or an android given a doll tear is killed, it will drop its items on the ground and leave a lifeless doll corpse. This corpse will revive again, following the same rules as the first awakening.\n\nLiving dolls will always sell doll tears and 9 to 11 random other dolls from the below table. For the dolls that grant an effect for a certain number of turns, they will always add to a pre-existing timer. Each doll costs 800 zorkmids regardless of charisma; a doll tear costs 8000 zm.\n\n| Doll                   | Unidentified appearance | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Effigy                 | Effigy                  | When applied, acts as a blessed [scroll of remove curse](/wiki/Scroll_of_remove_curse \"Scroll of remove curse\") regardless of its own beatitude.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Doll of jumping        | Pole-vaulter doll       | When applied, lets you jump immediately and gives you the ability to jump intrinsically for 100 turns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Doll of friendship     | Bard doll               | When applied, attempts to tame an adjacent monster in the given direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Doll of chastity       | Priest doll             | When applied, makes you intrinsically immune to seduction attacks for 100 turns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Doll of cleaving       | Berserker doll          | When applied, grants intrinsic cleaving for 100 turns.

Many insight weapons also gain additional effects once the PC passes certain insight thresholds; any PC can benefit from these effects. There are at least two thresholds for extra effects, with the exact amount and thresholds depending on the weapon, and the weapon's appearance will often have adjectives added to indicate which thresholds have been passed.\n\nThe Madman and Ose-binder bonus to-hit die's size is determined by the lower of the PC's Insight score and their level. Therefore, the maximum to-hit bonus is +1d30, for a PC of 30th level with at least 30 points of insight.\n\nThe Madman and Ose-binder bonus damage die's size is determined by halving the lower of the PC's Insight score and their level. When using a two-handed weapon, the PC's effective level is doubled. Therefore, for a one-handed weapon the maximum damage bonus is +1d15, for a PC of 30th level with at least 30 points of insight. For a two-handed weapon the maximum damage bonus is +1d30, for a PC of 30th level with at least 60 points of insight.\n\n### Insight weapon list\n\n| Weapon                                              | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Bestial Claw                                        | Grants an offhand claw attack that scales with Insanity.

is a feature specific to [[dNetHack]]. It represents the player's ability to see \"beyond the veil\": Players with a high insight will encounter creatures they would otherwise never see.\n\n== The Veil ==\n\nThe 'veil' refers to a perception of reality that is permanently altered by the following actions:\n\n* Reading the [[DNetHack artifacts#The Necronomicon|Necronomicon]] or the [[DNetHack artifacts#The Book of Lost Names|Book of Lost Names]].\n* Successfully binding any [[spirit]].\n* Entering the [[Lost Cities]].\n* Playing as an [[Anachrononaut]], [[Binder]] or [[Madman]].\n* Discovering the presence of [[The Black Mother]] and sacrificing to her.\n* Drinking a potion of goat's milk.\n* Turning traitor in the shared Hedrow Quest.\n* Receiving a telepathic message from an [[elder brain]] (possible in the [[Drow Noble Quest]]).\n* Being told terrible truths by an [[Apocalypse angel]].\n\nWhile the 'veil' is intact, the PC has a +10 bonus to [[sanity]] regeneration. Once the 'veil' has been pierced, insight can be accrued and reduced.\n\n==Methods of changing insight ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"80%\"\n!Change\n!Method\n|-\n| rowspan=6 | +1\n| Successfully reading the Necronomicon\n|-\n| Successfully reading the Book of Lost Names\n|-\n| Gaining telepathy from a corpse while hallucinating\n|-\n| Drinking a cursed potion of enlightenment\n|-\n| Drinking a cursed potion of see invisible (1 in insight chance)\n|-\n| Seeing an insight-granting monster up close for the first time\n|-\n| +X\n| Killing an insight-granting monster for the first time. X is the monster's difficulty/10 - 1.\n|-\n| -1\n| Drinking a cursed potion of hallucination\n|-\n| -X% insight\n| Amnesia (X is typically 10)\n|}\n\n== Insight creatures ==\nThere are a number of creatures that the character will be unable to perceive until they have accrued sufficient Insight. While a creature is unseen, the character will be unable to harm it in any way.

If you [[chat]] to them while wielding an artifact in your main hand, they will offer to take it from you, giving you a \"thought\" in return.<ref>https://github.com/Chris-plus-alphanumericgibberish/dnethack/blob/master/dnethack-3.4.3/src/sounds.c|2716</ref> Giving away a gifted artifact will anger the god that gave it to you.\n\nThoughts may also be obtained directly via glyphs. Glyphs may be wished for, found in bones files left by characters with thoughts, or, in the case of beast's embrace glyphs, left as treasure by monsters. Characters must still meet the minimum insight requirement in order to read the glyph.\n\n[[Madmen]] can receive a free thought from their [[secret whisperer]] once it has become a veil-render due to them gaining 20 insight, but only once. You can receive the guidance thought for free if you read the lit [[dNetHack artifacts#The Holy Moonlight Sword|Holy Moonlight Sword]] with at least 40 insight (even while blind).\n\nYou may have up to three thoughts in your head at once. Madmen who have completed [[Madman quest|their quest]] and either have at least 20 insight, or have already received a thought from their veil-render, can have four thoughts in their head instead.\n\nThoughts cannot be involuntarily removed, but are only active when you have sufficiently high insight (equal to the lowest possible value that could be required to see the corresponding merchant). Thoughts can be voluntarily removed with a trephination kit, the aid of a nurse, or the aid of a veil-render. Removing a thought results in a glyph, which can be read to return the thought to your head, as long as the character meets the minimum insight requirement.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n!

Before reaching their insight threshold, they appear as \"lifeless dolls\", an object that functions as a living doll corpse. Each doll has an independent threshold of rnd(20) insight. Their corpses can be transported to a more convenient location. After reaching their insight threshold, they will wake up and appear as peaceful {{brightmagenta|'}} that sell a variety of dolls when you #[[chat]] to them. <ref>https://github.com/Chris-plus-alphanumericgibberish/dnethack/blob/master/dnethack-3.4.3/src/sounds.c|2211</ref>\n\nIf a doll or an android given a doll tear is killed, it will drop its items on the ground and leave a lifeless doll corpse. This corpse will revive again, following the same rules as the first awakening.\n\nLiving dolls will always sell doll tears and 9 to 11 random other dolls from the below table. For the dolls that grant an effect for a certain number of turns, they will always add to a pre-existing timer. Each doll costs 800 zorkmids regardless of charisma; a doll tear costs 8000 zm.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Doll\n! Unidentified appearance\n!

While mind-blasting is active, you emanate 3d15 psychic blasts that can hit all monsters on the level. Most monsters have a {{frac|10}} chance of being affected, and mindless monsters are immune; telepathic monsters have a {{frac|2|3}} chance of being affected, or always if they are currently blinded. The monster's study count is set to the damage taken if it is greater than its current study.\n|-\n| Doll tear\n| milky gemstone\n| Can be applied to turn an android into a doll.

Androids, gynoids, operators, and commanders can be given doll abilities like this, in addition to a lifeless doll to bring the living doll back. \n|}\n[[Category:DNethack]]\n\n== Kuker ==\n[[Kuker]] are peaceful angelic creatures that spawn in the Neutral Quest once your insight is high enough. They offer several services in exchange for exorbitant amounts of money. They also grudge on any undead creatures on the level they are found on, and are often not strong enough to fight too many of them. So come prepared to buy anything you want, and don't dally when going to reach them.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"\n! Service\n! Cost\n!

Many insight weapons also gain additional effects once the PC passes certain insight thresholds; any PC can benefit from these effects. There are at least two thresholds for extra effects, with the exact amount and thresholds depending on the weapon, and the weapon's appearance will often have adjectives added to indicate which thresholds have been passed.\n\nThe Madman and Ose-binder bonus to-hit die's size is determined by the lower of the PC's Insight score and their level. Therefore, the maximum to-hit bonus is +1d30, for a PC of 30th level with at least 30 points of insight.\n\nThe Madman and Ose-binder bonus damage die's size is determined by halving the lower of the PC's Insight score and their level. When using a two-handed weapon, the PC's effective level is doubled. Therefore, for a one-handed weapon the maximum damage bonus is +1d15, for a PC of 30th level with at least 30 points of insight. For a two-handed weapon the maximum damage bonus is +1d30, for a PC of 30th level with at least 60 points of insight.\n\n=== Insight weapon list ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Weapon\n!

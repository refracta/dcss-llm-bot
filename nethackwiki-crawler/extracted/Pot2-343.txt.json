Each time you or another monster quaff a smoky potion, there is a\nchance of creating a djinni, depending on the number of djinn that have\nalready been created in the game:\n  DJINN:  0     1     2     3     4     5        n       >=120\n  PROB:  1/13  1/15  1/17  1/19  1/21  1/23  1/(13+2*n)    0\n\nWhen the djinni appears, the potion is used up and one of five outcomes\ncan occur.  The relative chance of these outcomes depends on whether the\nsmoky potion was blessed, uncursed, or cursed:\n  BLESSED  UNCURSED  CURSED  OUTCOME\n  ~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~\n    80%       20%       5%   Grants one wish, then disappears.\n                             \"I am in your debt.  I will grant one wish!\"\n     5%       20%       5%   Remains as a pet.\n                             \"Thank you for freeing me!\"\n     5%       20%       5%   Remains as a peaceful monster.\n                             \"You freed me!\"\n     5%       20%       5%   Speaks, then vanishes.\n                             \"It is about time!\"\n     5%       20%      80%   Remains as a hostile monster.\n                             \"You disturbed me, fool!\"\nIf the potion had been quaffed by a monster, you will only get a peaceful\nor vanishing djinni.  NOTE: There is no way to get a wish from the djinni\nother than the first outcome above.\n\nIn a similar manner, potions with the appearance \"milky\" may summon a ghost.\nEach time you or another monster quaff a milky potion, there is a chance\nof creating a ghost, depending on the number of ghosts that have already\nbeen created in the game:\n  GHOSTS:  0     1     2     3     4     5        n       >=120\n  PROB:   1/13  1/15  1/17  1/19  1/21  1/23  1/(13+2*n)    0\nWhen the ghost appears, the potion is used up.  If the potion was quaffed\nby a monster, that monster is paralyzed for 3 turns.  Otherwise, if you\nare unblind, you are paralyzed for 3 turns.\n\nIn either case, the effect of the potion does not take place (since there\nwas no actual potion in the bottle to drink).\n\nThere is a limit of 120 djinn (or ghosts) per game.  Beyond this limit,\nthey are extinct and no more can be created.\n\n\nCancelling and diluting potions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThere are several ways to turn potions into water.  If potions of sickness,\nsee invisible, or fruit juice are hit by a wand or spell of cancellation,\nthey become uncursed potions of fruit juice, with the same amount of\ndilution as before the cancellation.  Potions of oil and booze become\nuncursed but otherwise remain the same.  Other potions will become uncursed\npotions of water.\n\nYou can also change potions of blindness, confusion, or hallucination\ninto uncursed water -- or potions of sickness into fruit juice -- by\n#dipping a unicorn horn into these potions.  Note that if you had\nquaffed these potions, you would have suffered bad effects that could\nhave been cured by the unicorn horn in any case.  You can also #dip an\namethyst stone into booze to convert it into fruit juice (\"a-methyst\"\nmeans not intoxicated.) In either of these cases, only one potion\nwill be converted, regardless of the number of potions in the inventory\nslot.\n\nFinally, you can turn any potion except acid into water by #dipping it\ninto an uncursed potion of water or fountain (the latter may cause bad\neffects as well).  If you are over a pool or moat but not levitating,\nyou can also #dip into that water.  Furthermore, if you swim under water\nor fall into water, your potions have a chance of getting wet. If you\n#dip a potion of acid or it gets wet it does 1 to 10 points of damage.\n\nGetting potions wet happens in two stages.  After one dipping, the\npotions will become diluted, but will have their same blessed state.\nDiluted potions have exactly their same effects as undiluted potions\n(with minor exceptions for booze and fruit juice).  Getting diluted\npotions wet again then converts them into uncursed water.  Note that\nwater cannot be diluted.\n\n\nHoly water\n~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from the spoiler \"water\" by Maurice Vliege.)\n\nOnce you have potions of water, you can convert them to holy water at an\naltar with your same alignment.  Drop any unholy water or uncursed water\nthat you wish to convert onto the altar, and #pray.  If your god was\npleased with you, they will all be converted to holy water.\n\nTo make unholy water, you must find an altar of a different alignment\nthan your own that is not in Gehennom.  Drop any holy water or uncursed\nwater that you wish to convert onto the altar, and #pray.  All of the\npotions will be converted to unholy water.  It does not matter if your\ngod was pleased before, but your god will be upset after the prayer.\n\nHoly and unholy water may also be found randomly, may appear in bones\npiles from other characters, and can be wished for.  Holy water may be\npart of your initial inventory (Priests start with four).  A more obscure\nway to acquire holy or unholy water is to wield some uncursed potions of\nwater, take off all other worn items, and read a non-cursed scroll of\nremove curse while confused.  You have a 25% chance of creating holy\nwater and 25% chance of creating unholy water this way, and it doesn't\nneed any altars! Blessed scrolls of remove curse will have the same\neffect on each item in your inventory individually (try splitting\nup the water into different slots by #naming); be careful of other\nitems in inventory becoming cursed.\n\nOnce you have holy water, you can uncurse any cursed item or bless any\nuncursed items by the dipping the item into a potion of holy water.\nSimilarly, dipping a blessed item into unholy water makes it uncursed, and\ndipping an uncursed item into unholy water makes it cursed. (Dipping a\nblessed item into holy water or a cursed item into unholy water doesn't\ndo anything in particular: \"Interesting...\".) In all cases where the\nstatus is changed, one of the potions of (un)holy water is used in the\nprocess.  By dipping several uncursed potions of water into a potion of\n(un)holy water, you can continue to make more (un)holy water indefinitely\n(as long as you have uncursed water).\n\nDipping an item in holy or unholy water does NOT rust, blank, dilute,\nor otherwise damage it.\n\n\nDipping and mixing potions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from a posting by Paul Brinkley.)\n\nThe effects of #dipping various objects into potions is summarized in the\ntable below.  You are first prompted for the item to be DIPPED, and then\nthe potion to dip it INTO.  One of the potions dipped into will be used up,\nunless there was no effect or the potions were cancelled by the dipping\n(unicorn horn or amethyst).  Except where shown, it doesn't matter if\npotions are diluted before dipping.\n\nYou can mix two non-water potions (or groups of potions) of different types\nby dipping one into the other; this procedure is commonly referred to as\n\"alchemy\".  There is a 10% chance of an explosion (always if the DIPPED is\ncursed or acid) which makes you breathe vapors of the DIPPED potion, abuses\nyour strength, and makes you lose one of each potion.  Otherwise, the\nDIPPED potion(s) may become a different type of potion, which will always\nbe uncursed and diluted, and you use up one of the INTO potions.  The\npossible mixtures are also described in the table below.\n\n  DIPPED             INTO               RESULT\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~\n  cursed object      holy water         uncursed object\n  uncursed object    holy water         blessed object\n  blessed object     unholy water       uncursed object\n  uncursed object    unholy water       cursed object\n  acid               uncursed water     potion boils\n  undiluted potion   uncursed water     diluted potion\n  diluted potion     uncursed water     uncursed water\n  scroll/spellbook   uncursed water     blank scroll/spellbook (unless mail)\n  iron object        uncursed water     may rust\n  any potion         itself             \"That is a potion bottle,\n                                         not a Klein bottle!\"\n  any potion         same type          No effect.  \"Interesting...\"\n  ..................................................................\n  booze              enlightenment      confusion\n  booze              gain energy/level  hallucination\n  confusion          gain energy/level  1/3 enlightenment, 2/3 booze\n  enlightenment      booze              confusion\n  enlightenment      fruit juice        booze\n  enlightenment      levitation         2/3 gain level, 1/3 same as\n                                        \"other combination\" below\n  extra healing      gain energy/level  full healing\n  full healing       gain energy/level  gain ability\n  fruit juice        enlightenment      booze\n  fruit juice        gain energy/level  see invisible\n  fruit juice        sickness           sickness\n  fruit juice        speed              booze\n  gain energy/level  booze              hallucination\n  gain energy/level  confusion          1/3 enlightenment, 2/3 booze\n  gain energy/level  extra healing      full healing\n  gain energy/level  full healing       gain ability\n  gain energy/level  fruit juice        see invisible\n  gain energy/level  healing            extra healing\n  healing            gain energy/level  extra healing\n  healing            speed              extra healing\n  levitation         enlightenment      2/3 gain level, 1/3 same as\n                                        \"other combination\" below\n  sickness           fruit juice        sickness\n  speed              fruit juice        booze\n  speed              healing            extra healing\n  undiluted potion   other combination  1/2 evaporates, 1/4 sickness,\n                                        1/8 random potion, 1/8 water\n  diluted potion     other combination  uncursed water\n  ....................................................\n  unicorn horn       blindness,         uncursed water\n                     confusion,         (regardless of cursedness of horn,\n                     hallucination      as opposed to below results)\n  unicorn horn       sickness           fruit juice (uncursed or cursed)\n  amethyst           booze              fruit juice (uncursed or cursed)\n  missile weapon     sickness           poisoned weapon\n  poisoned weapon    healing,           unpoisoned weapon\n                     extra healing,\n                     full healing \n  anything (other    polymorph          polymorphed object of same class\n  than X of poly)                       (may resist: \"Nothing happens.\"\n                                        \"Nothing seems to happen.\" if\n                                        polymorphs to same item)\n  anything           lit oil            Explosion and/or damage\n  weapon             cursed oil         Greasy fingers\n  damaged weapon     other oil          May lose one damage depending on type\n  oil/magic lamp     other oil          Lamp is filled and made non-magic\n  All other combinations                No effect.  \"Interesting...\"\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks to Bruce Cox for proofreading the original version of this file.\nFurther corrections and clarifications provided by Big Al, Ken Cuvelier,\nDavid Goldfarb, Alex Pounds, and Irina Rempt.\n```\n\n*This page is based on a spoiler by [Dylan O'Donnell](https://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.spod-central.org/%257Epsmith/).

In all cases where the\nstatus is changed, one of the potions of (un)holy water is used in the\nprocess.  By dipping several uncursed potions of water into a potion of\n(un)holy water, you can continue to make more (un)holy water indefinitely\n(as long as you have uncursed water).\n\nDipping an item in holy or unholy water does NOT rust, blank, dilute,\nor otherwise damage it.\n\n\nDipping and mixing potions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from a posting by Paul Brinkley.)\n\nThe effects of #dipping various objects into potions is summarized in the\ntable below.  You are first prompted for the item to be DIPPED, and then\nthe potion to dip it INTO.  One of the potions dipped into will be used up,\nunless there was no effect or the potions were cancelled by the dipping\n(unicorn horn or amethyst).  Except where shown, it doesn't matter if\npotions are diluted before dipping.\n\nYou can mix two non-water potions (or groups of potions) of different types\nby dipping one into the other; this procedure is commonly referred to as\n\"alchemy\".  There is a 10% chance of an explosion (always if the DIPPED is\ncursed or acid) which makes you breathe vapors of the DIPPED potion, abuses\nyour strength, and makes you lose one of each potion.  Otherwise, the\nDIPPED potion(s) may become a different type of potion, which will always\nbe uncursed and diluted, and you use up one of the INTO potions.  The\npossible mixtures are also described in the table below.\n\n  DIPPED             INTO               RESULT\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~\n  cursed object      holy water         uncursed object\n  uncursed object    holy water         blessed object\n  blessed object     unholy water       uncursed object\n  uncursed object    unholy water       cursed object\n  acid               uncursed water     potion boils\n  undiluted potion   uncursed water     diluted potion\n  diluted potion     uncursed water     uncursed water\n  scroll/spellbook   uncursed water     blank scroll/spellbook (unless mail)\n  iron object        uncursed water     may rust\n  any potion         itself             \"That is a potion bottle,\n                                         not a Klein bottle!\"\n  any potion         same type          No effect.  \"Interesting...\"\n  ..................................................................\n  booze              enlightenment      confusion\n  booze              gain energy/level  hallucination\n  confusion          gain energy/level  1/3 enlightenment, 2/3 booze\n  enlightenment      booze              confusion\n  enlightenment      fruit juice        booze\n  enlightenment      levitation         2/3 gain level, 1/3 same as\n                                        \"other combination\" below\n  extra healing      gain energy/level  full healing\n  full healing       gain energy/level  gain ability\n  fruit juice        enlightenment      booze\n  fruit juice        gain energy/level  see invisible\n  fruit juice        sickness           sickness\n  fruit juice        speed              booze\n  gain energy/level  booze              hallucination\n  gain energy/level  confusion          1/3 enlightenment, 2/3 booze\n  gain energy/level  extra healing      full healing\n  gain energy/level  full healing       gain ability\n  gain energy/level  fruit juice        see invisible\n  gain energy/level  healing            extra healing\n  healing            gain energy/level  extra healing\n  healing            speed              extra healing\n  levitation         enlightenment      2/3 gain level, 1/3 same as\n                                        \"other combination\" below\n  sickness           fruit juice        sickness\n  speed              fruit juice        booze\n  speed              healing            extra healing\n  undiluted potion   other combination  1/2 evaporates, 1/4 sickness,\n                                        1/8 random potion, 1/8 water\n  diluted potion     other combination  uncursed water\n  ....................................................\n  unicorn horn       blindness,         uncursed water\n                     confusion,         (regardless of cursedness of horn,\n                     hallucination      as opposed to below results)\n  unicorn horn       sickness           fruit juice (uncursed or cursed)\n  amethyst           booze              fruit juice (uncursed or cursed)\n  missile weapon     sickness           poisoned weapon\n  poisoned weapon    healing,           unpoisoned weapon\n                     extra healing,\n                     full healing \n  anything (other    polymorph          polymorphed object of same class\n  than X of poly)                       (may resist: \"Nothing happens.\"\n                                        \"Nothing seems to happen.\" if\n                                        polymorphs to same item)\n  anything           lit oil            Explosion and/or damage\n  weapon             cursed oil         Greasy fingers\n  damaged weapon     other oil          May lose one damage depending on type\n  oil/magic lamp     other oil          Lamp is filled and made non-magic\n  All other combinations                No effect.  \"Interesting...\"\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks to Bruce Cox for proofreading the original version of this file.\nFurther corrections and clarifications provided by Big Al, Ken Cuvelier,\nDavid Goldfarb, Alex Pounds, and Irina Rempt.\n</pre>\n<div class=\"license_dod\">\n<p><i>This page is based on a spoiler by <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.spod-central.org/%257Epsmith/\">Dylan O'Donnell</a>.

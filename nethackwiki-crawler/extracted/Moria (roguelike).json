Because Rogue did not include its source code and originally ran only on one platform, several Rogue clones came into existence. Moria was the first of these many *Rogue* clones, or *roguelikes*, created for computers running [VMS](/wiki/VMS \"VMS\"). Meanwhile, a free Rogue clone known as *[Hack](/wiki/Hack \"Hack\")* was made for Unix, from which *NetHack* would come to be; Hack added features such as [persistent levels](/wiki/Persistent_level \"Persistent level\"), [pets](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\"), and [shops](/wiki/Shop \"Shop\"), while *NetHack* changed the game even more with additions like [dungeon branches](/wiki/Dungeon_branch \"Dungeon branch\").\n\nA port from VMS and Pascal to Unix was eventually created, known as *Umoria* - *Angband* is one of several *Umoria* variants - while another variant, called [Imoria](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Imoria \"roguebasin:Imoria\"), was created based on the original Pascal version.\n\nDevelopment of the original *Moria* essentially ended in the late 1980s, while development of other non-*Angband* variants of *Moria* would continue until 1993; there was brief attempt to revive *Imoria* after this year, and development of *Umoria* would end in 1995. On the other hand, development of *Angband* and its derivatives continue to this day. The *Moria* community considers Umoria, VMS Moria, and in later eras Angband, to be \"[vanilla](/wiki/Vanilla \"Vanilla\")\" versions of the game in contrast to variants like *[Zangband](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Zangband \"roguebasin:Zangband\")*, *IMoria*, or *[PMoria](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=PMoria \"roguebasin:PMoria\")* - these would be analogous to *[NetHack Plus](/wiki/NetHack_Plus \"NetHack Plus\")* or *[SLASH](/wiki/SLASH \"SLASH\")*.\n\n## Summary\n\n*Moria* and most of its variants are set in [Middle-earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth \"wikipedia:Middle-earth\"), with the game taking its name from [the underground city of Moria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria,_Middle-earth \"wikipedia:Moria, Middle-earth\").\n\nMoria deviates from the structure of *Rogue* in many significant ways, with the most notable being the addition of a town above the [dungeon](/wiki/Dungeon \"Dungeon\"). Unlike *NetHack*, where the [dungeon](/wiki/Dungeon \"Dungeon\") is a long trek away from civilization, *Moria* has a town set right near the dungeon entrance. Due to the non-persistent floors, *Moria* generates a new level with new monsters and items every time you leave a floor and return to it at a later point, making staircases one-way; Angband would change this during its own development so that staircases could be re-used. Therefore, *Moria* players seeking to make stashes generally leave them in the town, where they may still be disturbed by the town's other inhabitants.\n\nAnother significant change from the structure of *Rogue* was the shift of the main objective. Rather than retrieving the Amulet, the objective of the original *Moria* and variants that retain its name is to reach the bottom of the dungeon and defeat [the Balrog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog \"wikipedia:Balrog\"), which completes the game.\n\nBoth these changes and others, combined with the vastness of the dungeon and the impermanence of its floors, genereally means that the average *Moria* playthrough is of a similar length to *NetHack* if not longer. It may take weeks and months to play a Moria character from the beginning to either triumph over the Balrog or an inglorious death.\n\n### The Town\n\nIn *Moria*, the town contains the bulk of the game's services and shops; central to Moria is the Scroll of Word of Recall, an item that warps you between town and the deepest visited dungeon level, reducing the time and danger of making a trip back to your stash. Some *Moria* variants expand on this feature: *Angband* and other \\*bands let you leave town to find other dungeons and towns, while *Moria* variant *BOSS* instead has you defeating one of the Boss's lieutenants, after which it automatically transports you to another town with a more difficult dungeon.\n\nShopping in *Moria* mostly consists of interacting with a menu at each shop entrance, meaning that you cannot attack or rob shopkeepers, and other citizens cannot enter shops or take items. Items in shops are bought and sold fully identified, shopkeepers pay a base price for unidentified items, and their wares do not include cursed items; this is a useful way to ID the wider number of different potions, scrolls, and other items that *Moria* has compared to *NetHack*.\n\nThe six shops are a general store, an armory, a weaponsmith, a temple, an alchemy shop, and a magic-users' store; while beginners can supply themselves well if they have money, the dungeon will often still be the more viable source of better and higher-enchanted items. Food supply is limitless and thus largely a non-factor, unless one is playing an \"ironman game\" that forgoes access to the town.\n\n### The Dungeon\n\nIn Moria, there are two ways to label dungeon levels: by number (1, 2, 3, 4) as in *NetHack*, or by depth where the measure is fifty times the level number (50 feet, 100 feet, 150', 200').\n\n*Moria* dungeon levels are much larger than those found in *NetHack*, which are designed to fit on 80x24 terminals, and thus are split into panels. The map jumps to another panel as you approach the edge, and offscreen monsters might surprise you with attacks as you approach the edge. There is an option to center the screen on your hero (@), as in *[Linley's Dungeon Crawl](/wiki/Linley%27s_Dungeon_Crawl \"Linley's Dungeon Crawl\")*; the game typically disables this by default, so you may want to enable it prior to your first forays in. Larger levels mean larger rooms and longer corridors that take longer to explore, and it is not uncommon for some Moria players to take the first [staircase](/wiki/Staircase \"Staircase\") they find instead of fully exploring a level.\n\nDungeons are also drawn differently. For example, a [NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\") [room](/wiki/Room \"Room\") and [corridor](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\") might appear like this:\n\n```\n----------         #\n|........|     ########+     +   door\n|..{.....|     #   #         -   open door\n|..@.....|   ###   #         @   hero\n|........-####     #         - | wall\n|......d.|         #         d   dog\n|.%......|         #         %   food ration\n----------         #\n```\n\nNow here is how it might appear in the dungeon of Moria:\n\n```\n##########    #####+####\n#........#    #...'.'..+     + door\n#........#  ###.###'####     ' open door\n#..@.....####...# #.#        @ hero\n#........'....### #.#        # wall\n#......j.######   #.#        j jackal\n#.,......#        #.#        , food ration\n##########        #.#\n```\n\n### Monsters\n\nIn *Moria*, ranged attacks from monsters can target you on any a square within their range, compared to *NetHack* and its eight-directional combat; *Umoria* variant *Morgul* allows the player to do so as well, as does *Angband* and its variants. Monsters cannot target the player around corners or pillars, allowing characters with sufficiently high speed to attack monsters and quickly dash out of their sight before they retaliate; this is known as \"pillardancing\".\n\nAs you fight monsters in Moria, the game will gradually \"memorize\" their capabilities and store it in a *\"monster memory\"*. This feature contains information such as how many times you killed each type of monster, how fast they move, what attacks it has, and what level it normally appears on depending on how many of that monster you've fought. This monster memory is the only thing besides options that persists even after character death.\n\nThe lookup feature in vanilla *NetHack* only returns a literary quote associated with the monster in question; players must remember those monsters themselves, or else consult a bestiary of spoilers like the one hosted on this wiki. Some variants, such as [SlashTHEM](/wiki/SlashTHEM \"SlashTHEM\") and [xNetHack](/wiki/XNetHack \"XNetHack\"), add a monster lookup or a \"[Pokedex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon \"wikipedia:Pokémon\")\" that can be used to research the stats of a given monster.\n\n### Objects\n\n*Moria* objects and their generation have a few base similarities to *NetHack* items. *NetHack* and *Moria* players can [wield](/wiki/Wield \"Wield\") [weapons](/wiki/Weapon \"Weapon\"), [wear](/wiki/Wear \"Wear\") [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\"), and [put on](/wiki/Put_on \"Put on\") [rings](/wiki/Ring \"Ring\") and [amulets](/wiki/Amulet \"Amulet\"); both games also have an active and a spare weapon slot, with [a command to quickly swap the two](/wiki/Swap_weapons \"Swap weapons\"). Weapons and armor can have enchantments that increase their damage or defense.\n\nIn *Moria*, however, there are only 22 item slots from *a* to *v*, not counting currently worn equipment (as wearing something frees up that [inventory](/wiki/Inventory \"Inventory\") slot). *NetHack* inventories have 52 slots - *a* to *z* and *A* to *Z* (not counting the *#* used when picking up a [loadstone](/wiki/Loadstone \"Loadstone\") with a full inventory). NetHack additionally has a wide selection of gems and many miscellaneous tools, including [containers](/wiki/Container \"Container\") such as [bags](/wiki/Bag \"Bag\") and [chests](/wiki/Chest \"Chest\") to hold many \"screenfuls\" of items.\n\nSaving slots in *Moria* is done by eventually replacing carried items with better ones, such as finding spellbooks with multiple spells, and amassing enough gold that they no longer need to gather [junk](/wiki/Junk \"Junk\") to sell. *Moria* has no gems and fewer miscellaneous tools to worry about, and of those tools light sources have a dedicated slot; digging implements, which are second only in importance to lighting, can be put in the \"spare weapon\" slot.\n\n*NetHack* items can be [blessed, uncursed or cursed](/wiki/Beatitude \"Beatitude\"), with beatitude having an effect on item usage (i.e., blessed items often have much more beneficial or less harmful effects, while cursed ones tend to have weakened useful effects or much worse detrimental ones). *NetHack* items can also have additional properties applied, such as [erosion](/wiki/Erosion \"Erosion\")-proofing, [greasing](/wiki/Greasing \"Greasing\"), and [a set number of uses](/wiki/Charging \"Charging\"). While *Moria* items function similarly in that items can be cursed or noncursed, armor and weapons that are generated cursed have negative enchantments, and cursed weapons and armor cannot be removed, the curse itself does not actively degrade the item as in *NetHack*.\n\nIn lieu of [artifacts](/wiki/Artifact \"Artifact\"), Moria has \"Ego\" items. Unlike artifacts, more than one of a given type of ego item can appear in a given game, and can have any number of extra properties not unlike [object properties](/wiki/Object_properties \"Object properties\") in variants of *NetHack*: a [scimitar](/wiki/Scimitar \"Scimitar\") might have a \"Frost\" brand, making it a Scimitar of Frost that does extra [cold](/wiki/Cold \"Cold\") damage and provides cold resistance. A [scroll of identify](/wiki/Scroll_of_identify \"Scroll of identify\") will not reveal all these advanced properties, and only gives the two-letter code for the ego-type; the manual contains the key that details what each of the ego-types do.\n\nItem generation probabilities remain uniform in *NetHack* across dungeon levels, though they differ between branches (e.g., item generation in the [Gnomish Mines](/wiki/Gnomish_Mines \"Gnomish Mines\") is slanted towards [tools](/wiki/Tool \"Tool\")). In *Moria*, each item has an associated dungeon depth, and progressively more powerful items - higher-quality Ego items, weapons and armor with high enchantments, etc. - become more common as the hero descends deeper.\n\n## Moria and NetHack\n\n*NetHack* draws from J. R. R. Tolkien's setting and works, among many others, and naturally shares some other traits with *Moria* (e.g. the inclusion of [lembas](/wiki/Lembas \"Lembas\"), [mithril](/wiki/Mithril \"Mithril\"), etc.). For instance, the [balrog](/wiki/Balrog \"Balrog\") of *NetHack* is a powerful regular enemy that generates in [Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\") and can be gated in by other [major demons](/wiki/Major_demon \"Major demon\"), but cannot perform gating itself.\n\nThe ancient multi-hued dragon from *Moria* is one of the [hallucinatory monsters](/wiki/Hallucinatory_monster \"Hallucinatory monster\") in *NetHack*.\n\n### Moria in variants\n\n[UnNetHack](/wiki/UnNetHack \"UnNetHack\") has the [Ruins of Moria](/wiki/Ruins_of_Moria \"Ruins of Moria\") branch, which draws heavily from Middle-Earth and even features a unique balrog, [Durin's Bane](/wiki/Durin%27s_Bane \"Durin's Bane\"), as a boss monster. The third level also simulates a dungeon level found in a typical game of *Moria*.\n\n## Licensing\n\nNetHack is [free](/wiki/Free \"Free\") and open source software under its [NetHack General Public License](/wiki/NetHack_General_Public_License \"NetHack General Public License\"). Moria and its variants originally used a license which prohibited selling copies of the game. The practical effect of this is that operating systems like [Debian](/wiki/Debian \"Debian\") originally classified NetHack as \"free\" and Moria as \"non-free\", and refused to include Moria when selling discs of the system. The [Angband OpenSource Initiative](/wiki/Angband_OpenSource_Initiative \"Angband OpenSource Initiative\") was a successful attempt to change this: on January 9, 2009,[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1) Angband and Moria were completely dual licensed under the Moria license, and the GNU General Public License. (Moria had in fact been so dual licensed some time earlier, thanks to its lower number of contributors.)\n\nThe Moria license also did not contain explicit permission to modify the game, but modification is a strong tradition of the Moria community.\n\n## References\n\n1.

Meanwhile, a free Rogue clone known as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hack\" title=\"Hack\">Hack</a></i> was made for Unix, from which <i>NetHack</i> would come to be; Hack added features such as <a href=\"/wiki/Persistent_level\" title=\"Persistent level\">persistent levels</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Pet\" title=\"Pet\">pets</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Shop\" title=\"Shop\">shops</a>, while <i>NetHack</i> changed the game even more with additions like <a href=\"/wiki/Dungeon_branch\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dungeon branch\">dungeon branches</a>.\n</p><p>A port from VMS and Pascal to Unix was eventually created, known as <i>Umoria</i> - <i>Angband</i> is one of several <i>Umoria</i> variants - while another variant, called <a href=\"https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Imoria\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"roguebasin:Imoria\">Imoria</a>, was created based on the original Pascal version.\n</p><p>Development of the original <i>Moria</i> essentially ended in the late 1980s, while development of other non-<i>Angband</i> variants of <i>Moria</i> would continue until 1993; there was brief attempt to revive <i>Imoria</i> after this year, and development of <i>Umoria</i> would end in 1995. On the other hand, development of <i>Angband</i> and its derivatives continue to this day. The <i>Moria</i> community considers Umoria, VMS Moria, and in later eras Angband, to be \"<a href=\"/wiki/Vanilla\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vanilla\">vanilla</a>\" versions of the game in contrast to variants like <i><a href=\"https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Zangband\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"roguebasin:Zangband\">Zangband</a></i>, <i>IMoria</i>, or <i><a href=\"https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=PMoria\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"roguebasin:PMoria\">PMoria</a></i> - these would be analogous to <i><a href=\"/wiki/NetHack_Plus\" title=\"NetHack Plus\">NetHack Plus</a></i> or <i><a href=\"/wiki/SLASH\" title=\"SLASH\">SLASH</a></i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summary\">Summary</span></h2>\n<p><i>Moria</i> and most of its variants are set in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Middle-earth\">Middle-earth</a>, with the game taking its name from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria,_Middle-earth\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Moria, Middle-earth\">the underground city of Moria</a>.\n</p><p>Moria deviates from the structure of <i>Rogue</i> in many significant ways, with the most notable being the addition of a town above the <a href=\"/wiki/Dungeon\" title=\"Dungeon\">dungeon</a>. Unlike <i>NetHack</i>, where the <a href=\"/wiki/Dungeon\" title=\"Dungeon\">dungeon</a> is a long trek away from civilization, <i>Moria</i> has a town set right near the dungeon entrance. Due to the non-persistent floors, <i>Moria</i> generates a new level with new monsters and items every time you leave a floor and return to it at a later point, making staircases one-way; Angband would change this during its own development so that staircases could be re-used. Therefore, <i>Moria</i> players seeking to make stashes generally leave them in the town, where they may still be disturbed by the town's other inhabitants.\n</p><p>Another significant change from the structure of <i>Rogue</i> was the shift of the main objective. Rather than retrieving the Amulet, the objective of the original <i>Moria</i> and variants that retain its name is to reach the bottom of the dungeon and defeat <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Balrog\">the Balrog</a>, which completes the game.\n</p><p>Both these changes and others, combined with the vastness of the dungeon and the impermanence of its floors, genereally means that the average <i>Moria</i> playthrough is of a similar length to <i>NetHack</i> if not longer. It may take weeks and months to play a Moria character from the beginning to either triumph over the Balrog or an inglorious death.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Town\">The Town</span></h3>\n<p>In <i>Moria</i>, the town contains the bulk of the game's services and shops; central to Moria is the Scroll of Word of Recall, an item that warps you between town and the deepest visited dungeon level, reducing the time and danger of making a trip back to your stash. Some <i>Moria</i> variants expand on this feature: <i>Angband</i> and other *bands let you leave town to find other dungeons and towns, while <i>Moria</i> variant <i>BOSS</i> instead has you defeating one of the Boss's lieutenants, after which it automatically transports you to another town with a more difficult dungeon.\n</p><p>Shopping in <i>Moria</i> mostly consists of interacting with a menu at each shop entrance, meaning that you cannot attack or rob shopkeepers, and other citizens cannot enter shops or take items. Items in shops are bought and sold fully identified, shopkeepers pay a base price for unidentified items, and their wares do not include cursed items; this is a useful way to ID the wider number of different potions, scrolls, and other items that <i>Moria</i> has compared to <i>NetHack</i>.\n</p><p>The six shops are a general store, an armory, a weaponsmith, a temple, an alchemy shop, and a magic-users' store; while beginners can supply themselves well if they have money, the dungeon will often still be the more viable source of better and higher-enchanted items. Food supply is limitless and thus largely a non-factor, unless one is playing an \"ironman game\" that forgoes access to the town.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Dungeon\">The Dungeon</span></h3>\n<p>In Moria, there are two ways to label dungeon levels: by number (1, 2, 3, 4) as in <i>NetHack</i>, or by depth where the measure is fifty times the level number (50 feet, 100 feet, 150', 200').\n</p><p><i>Moria</i> dungeon levels are much larger than those found in <i>NetHack</i>, which are designed to fit on 80x24 terminals, and thus are split into panels. The map jumps to another panel as you approach the edge, and offscreen monsters might surprise you with attacks as you approach the edge. There is an option to center the screen on your hero (<span class=\"nhsym clr-white\">@</span>), as in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Linley%27s_Dungeon_Crawl\" title=\"Linley&#39;s Dungeon Crawl\">Linley's Dungeon Crawl</a></i>; the game typically disables this by default, so you may want to enable it prior to your first forays in. Larger levels mean larger rooms and longer corridors that take longer to explore, and it is not uncommon for some Moria players to take the first <a href=\"/wiki/Staircase\" title=\"Staircase\">staircase</a> they find instead of fully exploring a level.\n</p><p>Dungeons are also drawn differently. For example, a <a href=\"/wiki/NetHack\" title=\"NetHack\">NetHack</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Room\" title=\"Room\">room</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Corridor\" title=\"Corridor\">corridor</a> might appear like this:\n</p>\n<pre>----------         #\n|........|     ########+     +   <a href=\"/wiki/Door\" title=\"Door\">door</a>\n|..{.....|     #   #         -   <a href=\"/wiki/Door\" title=\"Door\">open door</a>\n|..@.....|   ###   #         @   <a href=\"/wiki/Hero\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hero\">hero</a>\n|........-####     #         - | <a href=\"/wiki/Wall\" title=\"Wall\">wall</a>\n|......d.|         #         d   <a href=\"/wiki/Dog\" title=\"Dog\">dog</a>\n|.%......|         #         %   <a href=\"/wiki/Food_ration\" title=\"Food ration\">food ration</a>\n----------         #\n</pre>\n<p>Now here is how it might appear in the dungeon of Moria:\n</p>\n<pre>##########    #####+####\n#........#    #...'.'..+     + <a href=\"/wiki/Door\" title=\"Door\">door</a>\n#........#  ###.###'####     ' <a href=\"/wiki/Door\" title=\"Door\">open door</a>\n#..@.....####...# #.#        @ <a href=\"/wiki/Hero\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hero\">hero</a>\n#........'....### #.#        # <a href=\"/wiki/Wall\" title=\"Wall\">wall</a>\n#......j.######   #.#        j <a href=\"/wiki/Dog\" title=\"Dog\">jackal</a>\n#.,......#        #.#        , <a href=\"/wiki/Food_ration\" title=\"Food ration\">food ration</a>\n##########        #.#\n</pre>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Monsters\">Monsters</span></h3>\n<p>In <i>Moria</i>, ranged attacks from monsters can target you on any a square within their range, compared to <i>NetHack</i> and its eight-directional combat; <i>Umoria</i> variant <i>Morgul</i> allows the player to do so as well, as does <i>Angband</i> and its variants. Monsters cannot target the player around corners or pillars, allowing characters with sufficiently high speed to attack monsters and quickly dash out of their sight before they retaliate; this is known as \"pillardancing\".\n</p><p>As you fight monsters in Moria, the game will gradually \"memorize\" their capabilities and store it in a <i>\"monster memory\"</i>. This feature contains information such as how many times you killed each type of monster, how fast they move, what attacks it has, and what level it normally appears on depending on how many of that monster you've fought. This monster memory is the only thing besides options that persists even after character death.\n</p><p>The lookup feature in vanilla <i>NetHack</i> only returns a literary quote associated with the monster in question; players must remember those monsters themselves, or else consult a bestiary of spoilers like the one hosted on this wiki. Some variants, such as <a href=\"/wiki/SlashTHEM\" title=\"SlashTHEM\">SlashTHEM</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/XNetHack\" title=\"XNetHack\">xNetHack</a>, add a monster lookup or a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Pokémon\">Pokedex</a>\" that can be used to research the stats of a given monster.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objects\">Objects</span></h3>\n<p><i>Moria</i> objects and their generation have a few base similarities to <i>NetHack</i> items. <i>NetHack</i> and <i>Moria</i> players can <a href=\"/wiki/Wield\" title=\"Wield\">wield</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Weapon\" title=\"Weapon\">weapons</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Wear\" title=\"Wear\">wear</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Armor\" title=\"Armor\">armor</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Put_on\" title=\"Put on\">put on</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Ring\" title=\"Ring\">rings</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet\" title=\"Amulet\">amulets</a>; both games also have an active and a spare weapon slot, with <a href=\"/wiki/Swap_weapons\" title=\"Swap weapons\">a command to quickly swap the two</a>. Weapons and armor can have enchantments that increase their damage or defense.\n</p><p>In <i>Moria</i>, however, there are only 22 item slots from <i>a</i> to <i>v</i>, not counting currently worn equipment (as wearing something frees up that <a href=\"/wiki/Inventory\" title=\"Inventory\">inventory</a> slot). <i>NetHack</i> inventories have 52 slots - <i>a</i> to <i>z</i> and <i>A</i> to <i>Z</i> (not counting the <i>#</i> used when picking up a <a href=\"/wiki/Loadstone\" title=\"Loadstone\">loadstone</a> with a full inventory). NetHack additionally has a wide selection of gems and many miscellaneous tools, including <a href=\"/wiki/Container\" title=\"Container\">containers</a> such as <a href=\"/wiki/Bag\" title=\"Bag\">bags</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Chest\" title=\"Chest\">chests</a> to hold many \"screenfuls\" of items.\n</p><p>Saving slots in <i>Moria</i> is done by eventually replacing carried items with better ones, such as finding spellbooks with multiple spells, and amassing enough gold that they no longer need to gather <a href=\"/wiki/Junk\" title=\"Junk\">junk</a> to sell. <i>Moria</i> has no gems and fewer miscellaneous tools to worry about, and of those tools light sources have a dedicated slot; digging implements, which are second only in importance to lighting, can be put in the \"spare weapon\" slot.\n</p><p><i>NetHack</i> items can be <a href=\"/wiki/Beatitude\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Beatitude\">blessed, uncursed or cursed</a>, with beatitude having an effect on item usage (i.e., blessed items often have much more beneficial or less harmful effects, while cursed ones tend to have weakened useful effects or much worse detrimental ones). <i>NetHack</i> items can also have additional properties applied, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Erosion\" title=\"Erosion\">erosion</a>-proofing, <a href=\"/wiki/Greasing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Greasing\">greasing</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Charging\" title=\"Charging\">a set number of uses</a>. While <i>Moria</i> items function similarly in that items can be cursed or noncursed, armor and weapons that are generated cursed have negative enchantments, and cursed weapons and armor cannot be removed, the curse itself does not actively degrade the item as in <i>NetHack</i>. \n</p><p>In lieu of <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact\" title=\"Artifact\">artifacts</a>, Moria has \"Ego\" items. Unlike artifacts, more than one of a given type of ego item can appear in a given game, and can have any number of extra properties not unlike <a href=\"/wiki/Object_properties\" title=\"Object properties\">object properties</a> in variants of <i>NetHack</i>: a <a href=\"/wiki/Scimitar\" title=\"Scimitar\">scimitar</a> might have a \"Frost\" brand, making it a Scimitar of Frost that does extra <a href=\"/wiki/Cold\" title=\"Cold\">cold</a> damage and provides cold resistance. A <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_identify\" title=\"Scroll of identify\">scroll of identify</a> will not reveal all these advanced properties, and only gives the two-letter code for the ego-type; the manual contains the key that details what each of the ego-types do.\n</p><p>Item generation probabilities remain uniform in <i>NetHack</i> across dungeon levels, though they differ between branches (e.g., item generation in the <a href=\"/wiki/Gnomish_Mines\" title=\"Gnomish Mines\">Gnomish Mines</a> is slanted towards <a href=\"/wiki/Tool\" title=\"Tool\">tools</a>). In <i>Moria</i>, each item has an associated dungeon depth, and progressively more powerful items - higher-quality Ego items, weapons and armor with high enchantments, etc. - become more common as the hero descends deeper.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Moria_and_NetHack\">Moria and NetHack</span></h2>\n<p><i>NetHack</i> draws from J. R. R. Tolkien's setting and works, among many others, and naturally shares some other traits with <i>Moria</i> (e.g. the inclusion of <a href=\"/wiki/Lembas\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lembas\">lembas</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Mithril\" title=\"Mithril\">mithril</a>, etc.). For instance, the <a href=\"/wiki/Balrog\" title=\"Balrog\">balrog</a> of <i>NetHack</i> is a powerful regular enemy that generates in <a href=\"/wiki/Gehennom\" title=\"Gehennom\">Gehennom</a> and can be gated in by other <a href=\"/wiki/Major_demon\" title=\"Major demon\">major demons</a>, but cannot perform gating itself.\n</p><p>The ancient multi-hued dragon from <i>Moria</i> is one of the <a href=\"/wiki/Hallucinatory_monster\" title=\"Hallucinatory monster\">hallucinatory monsters</a> in <i>NetHack</i>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Moria_in_variants\">Moria in variants</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/UnNetHack\" title=\"UnNetHack\">UnNetHack</a> has the <a href=\"/wiki/Ruins_of_Moria\" title=\"Ruins of Moria\">Ruins of Moria</a> branch, which draws heavily from Middle-Earth and even features a unique balrog, <a href=\"/wiki/Durin%27s_Bane\" title=\"Durin&#39;s Bane\">Durin's Bane</a>, as a boss monster. The third level also simulates a dungeon level found in a typical game of <i>Moria</i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Licensing\">Licensing</span></h2>\n<p>NetHack is <a href=\"/wiki/Free\" title=\"Free\">free</a> and open source software under its <a href=\"/wiki/NetHack_General_Public_License\" title=\"NetHack General Public License\">NetHack General Public License</a>. Moria and its variants originally used a license which prohibited selling copies of the game. The practical effect of this is that operating systems like <a href=\"/wiki/Debian\" title=\"Debian\">Debian</a> originally classified NetHack as \"free\" and Moria as \"non-free\", and refused to include Moria when selling discs of the system. The <a href=\"/wiki/Angband_OpenSource_Initiative\" title=\"Angband OpenSource Initiative\">Angband OpenSource Initiative</a> was a successful attempt to change this: on January 9, 2009,<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Angband and Moria were completely dual licensed under the Moria license, and the GNU General Public License. (Moria had in fact been so dual licensed some time earlier, thanks to its lower number of contributors.)\n</p><p>The Moria license also did not contain explicit permission to modify the game, but modification is a strong tradition of the Moria community.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol

(1983 video game)}}\n{{RogueBasin|Moria}}\n'''''The Dungeons of Moria''''', often shortened to just '''''Moria''''', is one of the earliest [[roguelike]] computer games, created in 1983 by Robert Alan Koeneke.\n\n''Moria'' and its [[variant]]s rival ''NetHack'' in popularity - many classifications divide roguelike games between \"hacklikes\" and \"*bands\", with the latter being named after ''[[Angband]]'', the most famous ''Moria'' variant. ''Moria'' was also the first open source roguelike and was ported to many different computer platforms, which was a major achievement for the era.\n\n==History==\n''[[Rogue]]'' started as a binary for [[BSD]], which was then a variant of [[Unix]] running on VAX hardware. Because Rogue did not include its source code and originally ran only on one platform, several Rogue clones came into existence. Moria was the first of these many ''Rogue'' clones, or ''roguelikes'', created for computers running [[VMS]]. Meanwhile, a free Rogue clone known as ''[[Hack]]'' was made for Unix, from which ''NetHack'' would come to be; Hack added features such as [[persistent level]]s, [[pet]]s, and [[shop]]s, while ''NetHack'' changed the game even more with additions like [[dungeon branch]]es.\n\nA port from VMS and Pascal to Unix was eventually created, known as ''Umoria'' - ''Angband'' is one of several ''Umoria'' variants - while another variant, called [[roguebasin:Imoria|Imoria]], was created based on the original Pascal version.\n\nDevelopment of the original ''Moria'' essentially ended in the late 1980s, while development of other non-''Angband'' variants of ''Moria'' would continue until 1993; there was brief attempt to revive ''Imoria'' after this year, and development of ''Umoria'' would end in 1995. On the other hand, development of ''Angband'' and its derivatives continue to this day. The ''Moria'' community considers Umoria, VMS Moria, and in later eras Angband, to be \"[[vanilla]]\" versions of the game in contrast to variants like ''[[roguebasin:Zangband|Zangband]]'', ''IMoria'', or ''[[roguebasin:PMoria|PMoria]]'' - these would be analogous to ''[[NetHack Plus]]'' or ''[[SLASH]]''.\n\n==Summary==\n''Moria'' and most of its variants are set in [[wikipedia:Middle-earth|Middle-earth]], with the game taking its name from [[wikipedia:Moria, Middle-earth|the underground city of Moria]].\n\nMoria deviates from the structure of ''Rogue'' in many significant ways, with the most notable being the addition of a town above the [[dungeon]]. Unlike ''NetHack'', where the [[dungeon]] is a long trek away from civilization, ''Moria'' has a town set right near the dungeon entrance. Due to the non-persistent floors, ''Moria'' generates a new level with new monsters and items every time you leave a floor and return to it at a later point, making staircases one-way; Angband would change this during its own development so that staircases could be re-used. Therefore, ''Moria'' players seeking to make stashes generally leave them in the town, where they may still be disturbed by the town's other inhabitants.\n\nAnother significant change from the structure of ''Rogue'' was the shift of the main objective. Rather than retrieving the Amulet, the objective of the original ''Moria'' and variants that retain its name is to reach the bottom of the dungeon and defeat [[wikipedia:Balrog|the Balrog]], which completes the game.\n\nBoth these changes and others, combined with the vastness of the dungeon and the impermanence of its floors, genereally means that the average ''Moria'' playthrough is of a similar length to ''NetHack'' if not longer. It may take weeks and months to play a Moria character from the beginning to either triumph over the Balrog or an inglorious death.\n\n===The Town===\nIn ''Moria'', the town contains the bulk of the game's services and shops; central to Moria is the Scroll of Word of Recall, an item that warps you between town and the deepest visited dungeon level, reducing the time and danger of making a trip back to your stash. Some ''Moria'' variants expand on this feature: ''Angband'' and other *bands let you leave town to find other dungeons and towns, while ''Moria'' variant ''BOSS'' instead has you defeating one of the Boss's lieutenants, after which it automatically transports you to another town with a more difficult dungeon.\n\nShopping in ''Moria'' mostly consists of interacting with a menu at each shop entrance, meaning that you cannot attack or rob shopkeepers, and other citizens cannot enter shops or take items. Items in shops are bought and sold fully identified, shopkeepers pay a base price for unidentified items, and their wares do not include cursed items; this is a useful way to ID the wider number of different potions, scrolls, and other items that ''Moria'' has compared to ''NetHack''.\n\nThe six shops are a general store, an armory, a weaponsmith, a temple, an alchemy shop, and a magic-users' store; while beginners can supply themselves well if they have money, the dungeon will often still be the more viable source of better and higher-enchanted items. Food supply is limitless and thus largely a non-factor, unless one is playing an \"ironman game\" that forgoes access to the town.\n\n===The Dungeon===\nIn Moria, there are two ways to label dungeon levels: by number (1, 2, 3, 4) as in ''NetHack'', or by depth where the measure is fifty times the level number (50 feet, 100 feet, 150', 200').\n\n''Moria'' dungeon levels are much larger than those found in ''NetHack'', which are designed to fit on 80x24 terminals, and thus are split into panels. The map jumps to another panel as you approach the edge, and offscreen monsters might surprise you with attacks as you approach the edge. There is an option to center the screen on your hero ({{white|@}}), as in ''[[Linley's Dungeon Crawl]]''; the game typically disables this by default, so you may want to enable it prior to your first forays in. Larger levels mean larger rooms and longer corridors that take longer to explore, and it is not uncommon for some Moria players to take the first [[staircase]] they find instead of fully exploring a level.\n\nDungeons are also drawn differently. For example, a [[NetHack]] [[room]] and [[corridor]] might appear like this:\n\n ----------         #\n |........|     ########+     +   [[door]]\n |..{.....|     #   #         -   [[door|open door]]\n |..@.....|   ###   #         @   [[hero]]\n |........-####     #         - | [[wall]]\n |......d.|         #         d   [[dog]]\n |.%......|         #         %   [[food ration]]\n ----------         #\n\nNow here is how it might appear in the dungeon of Moria:\n\n ##########    #####+####\n #........#    #...'.'..+     + [[door]]\n #........#  ###.###'####     ' [[door|open door]]\n #..@.....####...# #.#        @ [[hero]]\n #........'....### #.#        # [[wall]]\n #......j.######   #.#        j [[dog|jackal]]\n #.,......#        #.#        , [[food ration]]\n ##########        #.#\n\n===Monsters===\nIn ''Moria'', ranged attacks from monsters can target you on any a square within their range, compared to ''NetHack'' and its eight-directional combat; ''Umoria'' variant ''Morgul'' allows the player to do so as well, as does ''Angband'' and its variants. Monsters cannot target the player around corners or pillars, allowing characters with sufficiently high speed to attack monsters and quickly dash out of their sight before they retaliate; this is known as \"pillardancing\".\n\nAs you fight monsters in Moria, the game will gradually \"memorize\" their capabilities and store it in a ''\"monster memory\"''. This feature contains information such as how many times you killed each type of monster, how fast they move, what attacks it has, and what level it normally appears on depending on how many of that monster you've fought. This monster memory is the only thing besides options that persists even after character death.\n\nThe lookup feature in vanilla ''NetHack'' only returns a literary quote associated with the monster in question; players must remember those monsters themselves, or else consult a bestiary of spoilers like the one hosted on this wiki. Some variants, such as [[SlashTHEM]] and [[xNetHack]], add a monster lookup or a \"[[wikipedia:Pokémon|Pokedex]]\" that can be used to research the stats of a given monster.\n\n===Objects===\n''Moria'' objects and their generation have a few base similarities to ''NetHack'' items. ''NetHack'' and ''Moria'' players can [[wield]] [[weapon]]s, [[wear]] [[armor]], and [[put on]] [[ring]]s and [[amulet]]s; both games also have an active and a spare weapon slot, with [[swap weapons|a command to quickly swap the two]]. Weapons and armor can have enchantments that increase their damage or defense.\n\nIn ''Moria'', however, there are only 22 item slots from ''a'' to ''v'', not counting currently worn equipment (as wearing something frees up that [[inventory]] slot). ''NetHack'' inventories have 52 slots - ''a'' to ''z'' and ''A'' to ''Z'' (not counting the ''#'' used when picking up a [[loadstone]] with a full inventory). NetHack additionally has a wide selection of gems and many miscellaneous tools, including [[container]]s such as [[bag]]s and [[chest]]s to hold many \"screenfuls\" of items.\n\nSaving slots in ''Moria'' is done by eventually replacing carried items with better ones, such as finding spellbooks with multiple spells, and amassing enough gold that they no longer need to gather [[junk]] to sell. ''Moria'' has no gems and fewer miscellaneous tools to worry about, and of those tools light sources have a dedicated slot; digging implements, which are second only in importance to lighting, can be put in the \"spare weapon\" slot.\n\n''NetHack'' items can be [[Beatitude|blessed, uncursed or cursed]], with beatitude having an effect on item usage (i.e., blessed items often have much more beneficial or less harmful effects, while cursed ones tend to have weakened useful effects or much worse detrimental ones). ''NetHack'' items can also have additional properties applied, such as [[erosion]]-proofing, [[greasing]], and [[Charging|a set number of uses]]. While ''Moria'' items function similarly in that items can be cursed or noncursed, armor and weapons that are generated cursed have negative enchantments, and cursed weapons and armor cannot be removed, the curse itself does not actively degrade the item as in ''NetHack''. \n\nIn lieu of [[artifact]]s, Moria has \"Ego\" items. Unlike artifacts, more than one of a given type of ego item can appear in a given game, and can have any number of extra properties not unlike [[object properties]] in variants of ''NetHack'': a [[scimitar]] might have a \"Frost\" brand, making it a Scimitar of Frost that does extra [[cold]] damage and provides cold resistance. A [[scroll of identify]] will not reveal all these advanced properties, and only gives the two-letter code for the ego-type; the manual contains the key that details what each of the ego-types do.\n\nItem generation probabilities remain uniform in ''NetHack'' across dungeon levels, though they differ between branches (e.g., item generation in the [[Gnomish Mines]] is slanted towards [[tool]]s). In ''Moria'', each item has an associated dungeon depth, and progressively more powerful items - higher-quality Ego items, weapons and armor with high enchantments, etc. - become more common as the hero descends deeper.\n\n==Moria and NetHack==\n''NetHack'' draws from J. R. R. Tolkien's setting and works, among many others, and naturally shares some other traits with ''Moria'' (e.g. the inclusion of [[lembas]], [[mithril]], etc.). For instance, the [[balrog]] of ''NetHack'' is a powerful regular enemy that generates in [[Gehennom]] and can be gated in by other [[major demon]]s, but cannot perform gating itself.\n\nThe ancient multi-hued dragon from ''Moria'' is one of the [[hallucinatory monster]]s in ''NetHack''.\n\n===Moria in variants===\n[[UnNetHack]] has the [[Ruins of Moria]] branch, which draws heavily from Middle-Earth and even features a unique balrog, [[Durin's Bane]], as a boss monster. The third level also simulates a dungeon level found in a typical game of ''Moria''.\n\n==Licensing==\nNetHack is [[free]] and open source software under its [[NetHack General Public License]]. Moria and its variants originally used a license which prohibited selling copies of the game. The practical effect of this is that operating systems like [[Debian]] originally classified NetHack as \"free\" and Moria as \"non-free\", and refused to include Moria when selling discs of the system. The [[Angband OpenSource Initiative]] was a successful attempt to change this: on January 9, 2009,<ref>https://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.angband/msg/2db2fc9961d41c50</ref> Angband and Moria were completely dual licensed under the Moria license, and the GNU General Public License. (Moria had in fact been so dual licensed some time earlier, thanks to its lower number of contributors.)\n\nThe Moria license also did not contain explicit permission to modify the game, but modification is a strong tradition of the Moria community.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://beej.us/moria/ Moria homepage]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20200221144759/http://www-math.bgsu.edu/~grabine/moria.html Final Moria maintainer's page]\n\n[[Category:Roguelikes]]"}

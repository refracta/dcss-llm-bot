PROB is\nthe relative probability of each subtype.  They appear 1/8 cursed,\n3/4 uncursed, and 1/8 blessed.\n\nSome types of potions have the same APPEARANCE when unidentified.

If a monster can quaff a potion,\nthe effects upon the monster are documented below; all other potions won't\nbe quaffed by monsters. \n\nWhen a potion hits a monster, the monster will be awoken and has an 80%\nchance of losing one hit point (but not killed), and then suffers the\neffects described below.  If you didn't see the monster get hit, you will\nbe told, \"Crash!\".  Monsters are not angered by potions of (extra|full)\nhealing, (gain|restore) ability, speed, invisibility, water thrown at\ngremlins, or unholy water thrown at werecreatures, demons or undead; other\npotions will cause peaceful monsters to become hostile if you were the\nthrower.\n\nIf a potion hits you, you lose 1 to 2 hit points and get the effects of\nbreathing vapors described below unless the potion has a specific effect\nfor hitting you.  You may also breathe vapors if you are near a potion\nwhen it breaks (e.g., it hit a monster, was hit by a wand of striking, or\nwas kicked). If you are polymorphed into an unbreathing monster, the\nvapours will get into your eyes for the same effect. If you are polymorphed\ninto a monster that neither breathes nor has eyes, vapours will have no\neffect.\n\nacid\n  Cures stoning.\n  If you are acid resistant, no effect.\n    \"This tastes sour.\" (not hallucinating)\n    \"This tastes tangy.\" (hallucinating)\n  blessed\n    You lose 1 to 4 hit points, and abuse your constitution.\n      \"This burns a little!\"\n  uncursed\n    You lose 1 to 8 hit points, and abuse your constitution.\n      \"This burns like acid!\"\n  cursed\n    You lose 2 to 16 hit points, and abuse your constitution.\n      \"This burns a lot!\"\n  hits monster\n    The monster loses the same number of hit points as you would on\n    quaffing the potion. Some monsters may resist.\n      \"<monster> shrieks in pain!\"\n      \"<monster> writhes in pain!\" (silent monster)\n  hits you\n    May be thrown by monsters.\n    If you are acid resistant, no effect. Otherwise, same effect as\n    quaffing potion.\n  vapors\n    Abuses your constitution.\n \nblindness\n  blessed\n    You are blinded for 125 to 324 (more) turns.\n      \"A cloud of darkness falls upon you.\" (was unblind, not hallucinating)\n      \"Oh, bummer!

WGT specifies the weight\n(100 zorkmids weighs 1).\n\nPotions comprise 16% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,\n18% in containers, 22% on the Rogue level, and 1% in hell.  PROB is\nthe relative probability of each subtype.  They appear 1/8 cursed,\n3/4 uncursed, and 1/8 blessed.\n\nSome types of potions have the same APPEARANCE when unidentified.  The\nappearance of the remaining potions are are randomized from the following\ndescriptions:\n    ruby        pink        orange        yellow          emerald\n    dark green  cyan        sky blue      brilliant blue  magenta\n    purple-red  puce        milky         swirly          bubbly\n    smoky       cloudy      effervescent  black           golden\n    brown       fizzy       dark          white           murky\n\n\nPotion messages and effects\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from the WCST spoiler \"spoil803\".)\n\nWhat happens when you (q)uaff a potion usually depends on whether the\npotion was blessed, uncursed, or cursed.  If a monster can quaff a potion,\nthe effects upon the monster are documented below; all other potions won't\nbe quaffed by monsters. \n\nWhen a potion hits a monster, the monster will be awoken and has an 80%\nchance of losing one hit point (but not killed), and then suffers the\neffects described below.  If you didn't see the monster get hit, you will\nbe told, \"Crash!\".  Monsters are not angered by potions of (extra|full)\nhealing, (gain|restore) ability, speed, invisibility, water thrown at\ngremlins, or unholy water thrown at werecreatures, demons or undead; other\npotions will cause peaceful monsters to become hostile if you were the\nthrower.\n\nIf a potion hits you, you lose 1 to 2 hit points and get the effects of\nbreathing vapors described below unless the potion has a specific effect\nfor hitting you.  You may also breathe vapors if you are near a potion\nwhen it breaks (e.g., it hit a monster, was hit by a wand of striking, or\nwas kicked). If you are polymorphed into an unbreathing monster, the\nvapours will get into your eyes for the same effect. If you are polymorphed\ninto a monster that neither breathes nor has eyes, vapours will have no\neffect.\n\nacid\n  Cures stoning.\n  If you are acid resistant, no effect.\n    \"This tastes sour.\" (not hallucinating)\n    \"This tastes tangy.\" (hallucinating)\n  blessed\n    You lose 1 to 4 hit points, and abuse your constitution.\n      \"This burns a little!\"\n  uncursed\n    You lose 1 to 8 hit points, and abuse your constitution.\n      \"This burns like acid!\"\n  cursed\n    You lose 2 to 16 hit points, and abuse your constitution.\n      \"This burns a lot!\"\n  hits monster\n    The monster loses the same number of hit points as you would on\n    quaffing the potion. Some monsters may resist.\n      \"&lt;monster&gt; shrieks in pain!\"\n      \"&lt;monster&gt; writhes in pain!\" (silent monster)\n  hits you\n    May be thrown by monsters.\n    If you are acid resistant, no effect.

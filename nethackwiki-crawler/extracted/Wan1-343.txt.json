NODIR\n\nWands are listed above by increasing price, then alphabetically.  The\nCOST field denotes the base price of each item.  WGT specifies the weight\n(100 zorkmids weighs 1).\n\nWands comprise 4% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,\n6% in containers, 5% on the Rogue level, and 8% in hell.  PROB is\nthe relative probability of each subtype.  They appear 1/34 cursed,\n16/17 uncursed, and 1/34 blessed.\n\nThe CHG field specifies the maximum number of charges that a wand\nnormally has.  An exclamation (!) denotes that a wand of wishing may only\nbe recharged once.  Wands of wishing start with 1 to 3 charges; otherwise,\nthe wand starts with a number of charges at most 4 less than its maximum.\n\nEach time you (z)ap or (E)ngrave with a wand, you use one charge.  A wand\nwith zero charges left has a 1 in 121 chance of wresting a last charge\nand then turning to dust each time it is zapped (this won't happen if the\nwand was cancelled but not recharged).  Cancelling a wand will make it\nuncursed and (except for wands of cancellation) it will get zero charges.\n\nWands may be recharged by scrolls of charging or by the Platinum Yendorian\nExpress Card.  Previously-recharged wands have a chance of exploding (up\nto a maximum of 100% for a 7:x wand or a wand of wishing); see scrl-343.txt.\nA cursed scroll will have no effect on a blessed wand or a wand with no\ncharges; otherwise, \"Your <wand> vibrates briefly\" and it gets zero charges.\nAn uncursed scroll will bring the number of charges to a random number from\n1 to a random number between 5 and the maximum charges shown above (or for\na wand of wishing a random number from 1 to 3); a blessed scroll will bring\nthe number of charges in the wand to a random number from 5 to the maximum\ncharges shown above, or for a wand of wishing to three charges.  If it\nalready has that number of charges, it gains one more charge.  A wand of\nwishing charged beyond three charges will explode.\n\"Your <wand> <glows/vibrates> briefly.\" if the new enchantment is below the\nmaximum; \"Your <wand> <glows blue/vibrates> for a moment.\" otherwise.\n\nThe TYPE of wand denotes the behavior when it is zapped.  NODIR wands do\nnot ask for a direction.  BEAM wands ask for a direction, but do not show\na visibly animated effect when zapped.  RAY wands produce a ray which is\nanimated on the screen; if you are unblind when you zap the wand, you\nwill also identify that type of wand.\n\nThe appearances of wands are randomized from the following descriptions:\n    glass       balsa       crystal     maple       pine\n    oak         ebony       marble      tin         brass\n    copper      silver      platinum    iridium     zinc\n    aluminum    uranium     iron        steel       hexagonal\n    short       runed       long        curved      forked\n    spiked      jeweled\n\n\nZapping wands\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nNondirectional wands will be identified if you saw their effect (e.g., you\nfound a secret door with a wand of secret door detection).  If the wand\nproduces a visible ray or beam, you will identify the wand if you were\nunblind.  The range of a RAY will be 7 to 13 squares; this range may be\nlessened by the ray causing effects or bouncing.  Zapping a RAY wand\nupwards or downwards is equivalent to restricting the ray to a range of 1.\nBEAM wands have a range of 6 to 13 (other than digging), which can\nsimilarly be lessened, and will not bounce; they will be identified if you\nobserve an effect caused by them.\n\nCursed wands have a 1% chance of exploding when zapped; this does 1 to\n6 points of damage for each charge in the wand, plus an additional 2\nto 12 points of damage, and abuses your strength.\n\nMonsters are not angered by wands of digging, locking, nothing, opening,\nprobing, or undead turning (if not undead and none of their inventory was\naffected); being zapped with (or missed by) other wands will cause peaceful\nmonsters to become hostile if you were the zapper.\n\ncancellation (BEAM)\n  zap monster\n    Some monsters may resist.\n    Clay golems are killed.\n      \"Some writing vanishes from <monster's> head!\"\n    Weremonsters return to human form.\n    The monster is cancelled.\n  zap downwards\n    Any engraving at the location is removed.\n  zap object\n    Object is cancelled.\n  zap self\n    All items in your inventory are cancelled.\n    If you are polymorphed into a clay golem, you revert to your normal\n    form unless you have unchanging.\n      \"Some writing vanishes from your head!\" (if not blind)\n      \"Your amulet grows hot for a moment, then cools.\" (unchanging)\n\ncold (RAY)\n  zap monster\n    The location of the monster is revealed, if unseen.\n    If monster is cold resistant, no effect.\n    Otherwise, does 6 to 36 damage.

It will use one charge\n(possibly wresting the last) from the wand.  Depending on the type of the\nwand, you can get one of the messages below if you are unblinded, not\nlevitating, and over a writable floor.  Some messages are the same for\ndifferent types of wands, some messages require an engraving already on\nthat square, and some wands will not provide any means of identification\nthis way.  Nondirectional wands will act as if they were zapped.  If you\ndidn't wrest the last charge from the wand, you can write a message in\nthe dust (or engrave if specified below).  These messages provide (perhaps\nin combination with judicious zapping) a safe method of identifying many\nwands.\n\nWAND                   ENGRAVING\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~\ncancellation           If there already is an engraving, it is erased:\n                       \"The engraving on the <floor> vanishes!\"\n\ncold                   If a burned-in engraving exists, it is erased:\n                       \"The engraving on the <floor> vanishes!\"\n                       After writing in the dust:\n                       \"A few ice cubes drop from the wand.\"\n\ncreate monster         Same effect as zapping wand.\n\ndeath                  \"The bugs on the <floor> stop moving!\"\n                       (Same as sleep.)\n\ndigging                \"This <wand> is a wand of digging!\"\n                       You can engrave a message.\n\nenlightenment          Same effect as zapping wand.\n\nfire                   \"This <wand> is a wand of fire!\"\n                       You can burn a message.\n\nlight                  Same effect as zapping wand.\n\nlightning              \"This <wand> is a wand of lightning!\"\n                       You can burn a message, and you are blinded for\n                       1 to 50 turns.\n\nlocking                No message.\n\nmagic missile          You can write a message in the dust, after which\n                       \"The <floor> is riddled by bullet holes!\"\n\nmake invisible         If there already is an engraving, it is erased:\n                       \"The engraving on the <floor> vanishes!\"\n\nnothing                Same effect as zapping wand -- no message!\n\nopening                No message.\n\npolymorph              If an engraving already exists, it becomes a\n                       randomly chosen engraving; otherwise, no message.\n\nprobing                No message.\n\nsecret door detection  Same effect as zapping wand.\n\nsleep                  \"The bugs on the <floor> stop moving!\"\n                       (Same as death.)\n\nslow monster           \"The bugs on the <floor> slow down!\"\n\nspeed monster          \"The bugs on the <floor> speed up!\"\n\nstriking               \"The wand unsuccessfully fights your attempt to\n                        write!\"\n\nteleportation          If there already is an engraving, it is teleported:\n                       \"The engraving on the <floor> vanishes!\"\n\nundead turning         No message.\n\nwishing                Same effect as zapping wand.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks to Bruce Cox for proofreading the original version of this file.\nFurther corrections and clarifications provided by Vladimir Florinski,\nDavid Grabiner, Bruce Labbate, Eva Myers, Kate Nepveu, David Wang, and\nGary D.

PROB is\nthe relative probability of each subtype.  They appear 1/34 cursed,\n16/17 uncursed, and 1/34 blessed.\n\nThe CHG field specifies the maximum number of charges that a wand\nnormally has.  An exclamation (!) denotes that a wand of wishing may only\nbe recharged once.  Wands of wishing start with 1 to 3 charges; otherwise,\nthe wand starts with a number of charges at most 4 less than its maximum.\n\nEach time you (z)ap or (E)ngrave with a wand, you use one charge.  A wand\nwith zero charges left has a 1 in 121 chance of wresting a last charge\nand then turning to dust each time it is zapped (this won't happen if the\nwand was cancelled but not recharged).  Cancelling a wand will make it\nuncursed and (except for wands of cancellation) it will get zero charges.\n\nWands may be recharged by scrolls of charging or by the Platinum Yendorian\nExpress Card.  Previously-recharged wands have a chance of exploding (up\nto a maximum of 100% for a 7:x wand or a wand of wishing); see scrl-343.txt.\nA cursed scroll will have no effect on a blessed wand or a wand with no\ncharges; otherwise, \"Your &lt;wand&gt; vibrates briefly\" and it gets zero charges.\nAn uncursed scroll will bring the number of charges to a random number from\n1 to a random number between 5 and the maximum charges shown above (or for\na wand of wishing a random number from 1 to 3); a blessed scroll will bring\nthe number of charges in the wand to a random number from 5 to the maximum\ncharges shown above, or for a wand of wishing to three charges.  If it\nalready has that number of charges, it gains one more charge.  A wand of\nwishing charged beyond three charges will explode.\n\"Your &lt;wand&gt; &lt;glows/vibrates&gt; briefly.\" if the new enchantment is below the\nmaximum; \"Your &lt;wand&gt; &lt;glows blue/vibrates&gt; for a moment.\" otherwise.\n\nThe TYPE of wand denotes the behavior when it is zapped.  NODIR wands do\nnot ask for a direction.  BEAM wands ask for a direction, but do not show\na visibly animated effect when zapped.  RAY wands produce a ray which is\nanimated on the screen; if you are unblind when you zap the wand, you\nwill also identify that type of wand.\n\nThe appearances of wands are randomized from the following descriptions:\n    glass       balsa       crystal     maple       pine\n    oak         ebony       marble      tin         brass\n    copper      silver      platinum    iridium     zinc\n    aluminum    uranium     iron        steel       hexagonal\n    short       runed       long        curved      forked\n    spiked      jeweled\n\n\nZapping wands\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nNondirectional wands will be identified if you saw their effect (e.g., you\nfound a secret door with a wand of secret door detection).  If the wand\nproduces a visible ray or beam, you will identify the wand if you were\nunblind.  The range of a RAY will be 7 to 13 squares; this range may be\nlessened by the ray causing effects or bouncing.  Zapping a RAY wand\nupwards or downwards is equivalent to restricting the ray to a range of 1.\nBEAM wands have a range of 6 to 13 (other than digging), which can\nsimilarly be lessened, and will not bounce; they will be identified if you\nobserve an effect caused by them.\n\nCursed wands have a 1% chance of exploding when zapped; this does 1 to\n6 points of damage for each charge in the wand, plus an additional 2\nto 12 points of damage, and abuses your strength.\n\nMonsters are not angered by wands of digging, locking, nothing, opening,\nprobing, or undead turning (if not undead and none of their inventory was\naffected); being zapped with (or missed by) other wands will cause peaceful\nmonsters to become hostile if you were the zapper.\n\ncancellation (BEAM)\n  zap monster\n    Some monsters may resist.\n    Clay golems are killed.\n      \"Some writing vanishes from &lt;monster's&gt; head!\"\n    Weremonsters return to human form.\n    The monster is cancelled.\n  zap downwards\n    Any engraving at the location is removed.\n  zap object\n    Object is cancelled.\n  zap self\n    All items in your inventory are cancelled.\n    If you are polymorphed into a clay golem, you revert to your normal\n    form unless you have unchanging.\n      \"Some writing vanishes from your head!\" (if not blind)\n      \"Your amulet grows hot for a moment, then cools.\" (unchanging)\n\ncold (RAY)\n  zap monster\n    The location of the monster is revealed, if unseen.\n    If monster is cold resistant, no effect.\n    Otherwise, does 6 to 36 damage.

It will use one charge\n(possibly wresting the last) from the wand.  Depending on the type of the\nwand, you can get one of the messages below if you are unblinded, not\nlevitating, and over a writable floor.  Some messages are the same for\ndifferent types of wands, some messages require an engraving already on\nthat square, and some wands will not provide any means of identification\nthis way.  Nondirectional wands will act as if they were zapped.  If you\ndidn't wrest the last charge from the wand, you can write a message in\nthe dust (or engrave if specified below).  These messages provide (perhaps\nin combination with judicious zapping) a safe method of identifying many\nwands.\n\nWAND                   ENGRAVING\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~\ncancellation           If there already is an engraving, it is erased:\n                       \"The engraving on the &lt;floor&gt; vanishes!\"\n\ncold                   If a burned-in engraving exists, it is erased:\n                       \"The engraving on the &lt;floor&gt; vanishes!\"\n                       After writing in the dust:\n                       \"A few ice cubes drop from the wand.\"\n\ncreate monster         Same effect as zapping wand.\n\ndeath                  \"The bugs on the &lt;floor&gt; stop moving!\"\n                       (Same as sleep.)\n\ndigging                \"This &lt;wand&gt; is a wand of digging!\"\n                       You can engrave a message.\n\nenlightenment          Same effect as zapping wand.\n\nfire                   \"This &lt;wand&gt; is a wand of fire!\"\n                       You can burn a message.\n\nlight                  Same effect as zapping wand.\n\nlightning              \"This &lt;wand&gt; is a wand of lightning!\"\n                       You can burn a message, and you are blinded for\n                       1 to 50 turns.\n\nlocking                No message.\n\nmagic missile          You can write a message in the dust, after which\n                       \"The &lt;floor&gt; is riddled by bullet holes!\"\n\nmake invisible         If there already is an engraving, it is erased:\n                       \"The engraving on the &lt;floor&gt; vanishes!\"\n\nnothing                Same effect as zapping wand -- no message!\n\nopening                No message.\n\npolymorph              If an engraving already exists, it becomes a\n                       randomly chosen engraving; otherwise, no message.\n\nprobing                No message.\n\nsecret door detection  Same effect as zapping wand.\n\nsleep                  \"The bugs on the &lt;floor&gt; stop moving!\"\n                       (Same as death.)\n\nslow monster           \"The bugs on the &lt;floor&gt; slow down!\"\n\nspeed monster          \"The bugs on the &lt;floor&gt; speed up!\"\n\nstriking               \"The wand unsuccessfully fights your attempt to\n                        write!\"\n\nteleportation          If there already is an engraving, it is teleported:\n                       \"The engraving on the &lt;floor&gt; vanishes!\"\n\nundead turning         No message.\n\nwishing                Same effect as zapping wand.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks to Bruce Cox for proofreading the original version of this file.\nFurther corrections and clarifications provided by Vladimir Florinski,\nDavid Grabiner, Bruce Labbate, Eva Myers, Kate Nepveu, David Wang, and\nGary D.

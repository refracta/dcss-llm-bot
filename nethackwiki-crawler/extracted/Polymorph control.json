{"title":"Polymorph control","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Polymorph_control","type":"markdown","data":"**[English]()**\n\n • [한국어](/wiki/Polymorph_control/ko \"Polymorph control/ko\")\n\n**Polymorph control** is a [property](/wiki/Property \"Property\") in *[NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\")* that allows the [hero](/wiki/Hero \"Hero\") to maintain control over the form they take whenever they [polymorph](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\").\n\nThe only source of the property is wearing or [eating](/wiki/Eating_jewelry \"Eating jewelry\") the [ring of polymorph control](/wiki/Ring_of_polymorph_control \"Ring of polymorph control\").\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([3.7.0](/wiki/3.7.0 \"3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nThe blessed [potion of polymorph](/wiki/Potion_of_polymorph \"Potion of polymorph\") gives a controlled polymorph when quaffed, as a form of temporary \"polymorph control\".\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Description](#Description)\n\n- [2 Strategy](#Strategy)\n\n  - [2.1 Advantage in combat](#Advantage_in_combat)\n  - [2.2 Special abilities](#Special_abilities)\n  - [2.3 Laying eggs](#Laying_eggs)\n  - [2.4 Gaining intrinsics](#Gaining_intrinsics)\n  - [2.5 Other uses](#Other_uses)\n  - [2.6 Good choices for self-polymorph](#Good_choices_for_self-polymorph)\n\n- [3 Messages](#Messages)\n\n- [4 Variants](#Variants)\n\n  - [4.1 SLASH'EM](#SLASH.27EM)\n  - [4.2 dNetHack](#dNetHack)\n  - [4.3 SlashTHEM](#SlashTHEM)\n\n- [5 References](#References)\n\n## Description\n\nIf you polymorph while you have polymorph control, and you are not [stunned](/wiki/Stun \"Stun\") or unconscious, a prompt will appear asking what type of [monster](/wiki/Monster \"Monster\") you want to become: you can type the name of that monster and confirm, then you will attempt to polymorph into that monster. This will always prevent [system shock](/wiki/System_shock \"System shock\") from occurring, and also overrides the special cases for polymorph where you would otherwise become a predetermined target – i.e. polymorphing while wearing [dragon scales](/wiki/Dragon_scales \"Dragon scales\") or a [dragon scale mail](/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail \"Dragon scale mail\"), or else polymorphing while you are a [vampire](/wiki/Vampire_\\(monster_class\\) \"Vampire (monster class)\") or [werecreature](/wiki/Werecreature \"Werecreature\"); you will still be allowed to choose your polymorph form in these cases.[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1)[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2) If you have lycanthropy or are in vampire form, and your transformation is triggered by means that are not polymorph magic (such as the random chance per turn or unholy water for lycanthropy, or #monster for vampire form), you are instead asked whether or not you want to shift from your current form, and declining will not transform you.[\\[3\\]](#cite_note-3)[\\[4\\]](#cite_note-4)\n\nChoosing to [polymorph into a monster of your own species](/wiki/Polymorph#Polymorphing_into_your_own_race \"Polymorph\") will cause random adjustments to your [attributes](/wiki/Attributes \"Attributes\") and [experience level](/wiki/Experience_level \"Experience level\") change to your scores; polymorphing into your own species while in the form of another monster will return you to your base form. Both transformations give the same message. There is also a 1⁄5 chance that a polymorph will cause you to turn into your own species and shuffle your stats, regardless of if you have polymorph control.[\\[5\\]](#cite_note-5)\n\n## Strategy\n\nThere are many reasons for a player to want control over their polymorphs, whether it is gaining advantages and special abilities in combat, obtaining otherwise-rare pets, obtain hard-to-get intrinsics, or even making travel less of a hassle.\n\n### Advantage in combat\n\n- *See also: [Monsters (by speed)](/wiki/Monsters_\\(by_speed\\) \"Monsters (by speed)\")*\n\nPolyself has vastly improved the record for game-time [speed ascensions](/wiki/Speed_ascension \"Speed ascension\"). Some species have higher speed that lets you move, attack and react faster to enemies—in short, deal more damage per turn. Some species also have multiple or additional attacks, dealing extra damage. Whenever you attempt to hit a monster, you use all of your form's attacks. If the monster has no weapon attacks but can wield a weapon, you typically get your weapon damage added to the first attack (which may be a claw move); if a monster has multiple weapon attacks, you hit with your weapon multiple times.[\\[6\\]](#cite_note-6) High-level monsters often have a lower base [AC](/wiki/AC \"AC\"), effectively giving you an AC bonus if you turn into one. If killed by HP loss while polymorphed, reverting to original form is a \"free\" [amulet of life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\").\n\nPossible choices include:\n\n- [Master mind flayers](/wiki/Master_mind_flayer \"Master mind flayer\") have 0 base AC and can fly. They have five brain-sucking attacks; each one causes d10 damage to monsters with brains. This is one of the best forms to rack up damage in melee, and they can wear a cloak or armor for [magic cancellation](/wiki/Magic_cancellation \"Magic cancellation\"). However, mind flayer attacks also have some dangers:\n\n  - **Accidentally attacking/bumping a [cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") is a common [stoning](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\") instadeath when in the form of a mind flayer:** the mind flayer's tentacles are bare skin, and no armor can cover them. Similarly, eating Medusa's brain will result in delayed stoning, while eating any Rider's brain will kill you instantly.\n  - The brain-sucking attack adds nutrition on each hit, making it possible to become oversatiated very quickly - this results in frequent [dexterity](/wiki/Dexterity \"Dexterity\") abuse and also puts you at the risk of [instadeath](/wiki/Instadeath \"Instadeath\") by [choking](/wiki/Choking \"Choking\") if you eat any comestible while oversatiated, including [wraith](/wiki/Wraith \"Wraith\") [corpses](/wiki/Corpse \"Corpse\"). Choking and dying will ***not*** revert you to original form - among other things, this means that curing delayed stoning in this state (e.g. eating a cockatrice [egg](/wiki/Egg \"Egg\")) will require non-comestible means, such as a [potion of acid](/wiki/Potion_of_acid \"Potion of acid\") or polymorphing into a form with [stoning resistance](/wiki/Stoning_resistance \"Stoning resistance\").\n  - If polymorphing into a (master) mind flayer as a human, eating the brains of [soldiers](/wiki/Soldier \"Soldier\") counts as [cannibalism](/wiki/Cannibalism \"Cannibalism\"), hurting your [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") and making any subsequent Luck-reliant actions riskier.\n\n- [Jabberwocks](/wiki/Jabberwock \"Jabberwock\") likely deal the most damage per turn of all polyforms (without an enchanted artifact weapon), can wield weapons, and are capable of flight. However, they can only wear non-body armor and cannot cast spells; in addition, jabberwocks wielding [footrice](/wiki/Footrice \"Footrice\") corpses in 3.4.3 will not petrify monsters with them.\n\n- [Minotaurs](/wiki/Minotaur \"Minotaur\") are a good compromise between speed and damage output.\n\n- [Titans](/wiki/Titan \"Titan\") can fly, have base AC −3, and are faster than the other recommendations. They can also manipulate [boulders](/wiki/Boulder \"Boulder\"), and cannot be [engulfed](/wiki/Engulfing \"Engulfing\").\n\n- [Elvenkings](/wiki/Elvenking \"Elvenking\") are speed 12, base AC 10 (same as you) and HD 9. They allow you to hit with your weapon damage twice per move, with a 2d4 bonus to each attack. Note, however, that elven characters cannot use this form.\n\n- [Vampire lords](/wiki/Vampire_lord \"Vampire lord\") are speed 14 with base AC 0 and HD 12. They regenerate and are unbreathing. This allows you to swim, and you cannot choke to death from wraith corpses (e.g. when oversatiated due to brain-eating in mmf form). Both V can see any @ on the same level as you, as if telepathic, without needing to be blind. Useful for finding shops and temples. Note however that V are silver-hating, and cannot wield silver sabers. (They can however throw silver daggers.) Before polymorphing to a V, check that rings of polymorph control don't happen to be silver rings.\n\nOut of the above monsters, only Elvenkings, master mind flayers and vampire lords are medium-sized, and thus can wear all forms of [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\"). Jabberwocks and minotaurs are large, and titans are huge, so they cannot wear torso armor. They cannot benefit from the extra AC of that armor, nor from the [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\"), [reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\") or [magic cancellation](/wiki/Magic_cancellation \"Magic cancellation\") they provide.\n\nPay attention to the base level of the species, as this determines your resulting HP. If it is not enough to survive combat, you may need to [increase it](/wiki/HP#Player \"HP\"). This is only worthwhile if you plan to be [unchanging](/wiki/Amulet_of_unchanging \"Amulet of unchanging\"), as the increase is lost when you transform back. You also regenerate HP at the same rate as your species, so having [regeneration](/wiki/Regeneration \"Regeneration\") or healing magic is useful.\n\nBe careful when using a form that has a contact attack. Attacking a [footrice](/wiki/Footrice \"Footrice\") will cause [stoning](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\") and biting a [green slime](/wiki/Green_slime \"Green slime\") causes [sliming](/wiki/Sliming \"Sliming\"). Forms with many such attacks, such as mind flayers, may also suffer multiple splashes of acid when attacking [jellies](/wiki/J \"J\"). If reaching the Astral Plane in changed form, attacking any [Rider](/wiki/Rider \"Rider\") as a mind flayer will prove to be fatal, as a tentacle hit counts as eating the corpse.\n\n### Special abilities\n\nWhen polymorphed into certain species, you can use their abilities with the [#monster](/wiki/Monster_\\(command\\) \"Monster (command)\") command:\n\n- A [dragon](/wiki/Dragon \"Dragon\")'s [breath](/wiki/Breath \"Breath\"). The black dragon's [disintegration](/wiki/Disintegration \"Disintegration\") beam is a particular favorite, since few monsters are disintegration-resistant. For example, a [monk](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\") can [defeat Master Kaen](/wiki/Monk_quest \"Monk quest\") by flying over lava and breathing a blast of disintegration at him.\n- A [gremlin](/wiki/Gremlin \"Gremlin\")'s ability to split near a source of water. This results in tame gremlins.\n- A [mind flayer](/wiki/Mind_flayer \"Mind flayer\")'s psychic blast, which wakes nearby monsters and can hurt them. Some players use this to wake inaccessible enemies such as the [Master Assassin](/wiki/Master_Assassin \"Master Assassin\") or the [Wizard of Yendor](/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor \"Wizard of Yendor\").\n\n### Laying eggs\n\nFemale characters who polymorph into [oviparous](/wiki/Oviparous \"Oviparous\") monsters can use the #[sit](/wiki/Sit \"Sit\") command to lay eggs, which hatch into [pets](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\") of the same species. This can be used to gain pets of powerful species, such as [dragons](/wiki/Dragon \"Dragon\") and [purple worms](/wiki/Purple_worm \"Purple worm\"), although they usually hatch into baby forms that take a while to [grow up](/wiki/Grow_up \"Grow up\").\n\nYou can then kill the dragons after they grow up and take [their scales](/wiki/Dragon_scales \"Dragon scales\"). However, dragons only leave their scales 1⁄3 of the time.\n\nAnother tactic is to lay cockatrice eggs and use them later to petrify enemies. Note that your [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") is penalized by −1 each time you break your own eggs, to a maximum of −5.\n\n### Gaining intrinsics\n\nMost of your attributes are reset when you return to original form, but you keep any intrinsics gained while in monster form. For example, if you eat poisonous corpses that damage your [strength](/wiki/Strength \"Strength\"), you may gain [poison resistance](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\") and still keep your original strength when you change back.\n\nAnother way to gain intrinsics is to polymorph into a [metallivore](/wiki/Metallivore \"Metallivore\") or [gelatinous cube](/wiki/Gelatinous_cube \"Gelatinous cube\") and [eat rings and amulets](/wiki/Eating_jewelry \"Eating jewelry\"). This way, you do not have to wear those items to enjoy their benefits. Note that some items cannot be eaten, some intrinsics cannot ever be gained, and some items have unwanted side effects. For example, the intrinsic from a [ring of regeneration](/wiki/Ring_of_regeneration \"Ring of regeneration\") will also cause you to burn nutrition faster, even when your HP is full. Interestingly, it is possible to get both intrinsic [polymorphitis](/wiki/Polymorphitis \"Polymorphitis\") and polymorph control from rings, allowing you to polymorph from time to time like a [shapeshifter](/wiki/Shapeshifter \"Shapeshifter\") monster.\n\nPolymorph control is also useful for temporary intrinsics and other properties, such as a [silver dragon](/wiki/Silver_dragon \"Silver dragon\") form to deal with a [Gnome With the Wand of Death](/wiki/Gnome_With_the_Wand_of_Death \"Gnome With the Wand of Death\"), or a [winged gargoyle](/wiki/Winged_gargoyle \"Winged gargoyle\") form to pick up a cockatrice [corpse](/wiki/Corpse \"Corpse\") without gloves - one common such use is the [xorn](/wiki/Xorn \"Xorn\") form's phasing ability to move more efficiently on [non-teleport levels](/wiki/Non-teleport_level \"Non-teleport level\"), e.g. to get the Castle's [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\") without having to fight the army inside. Other similar uses include turning into a [nymph](/wiki/Nymph \"Nymph\") to steal items from other monsters, becoming a [cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") to petrify monsters, or turning into a [major demon](/wiki/Major_demon \"Major demon\") to summon tame demons as you attack enemies bare-handed.\n\n### Other uses\n\nSome players turn into an [air elemental](/wiki/Air_elemental \"Air elemental\") to travel, especially on the hectic [Elemental Planes](/wiki/Elemental_Planes \"Elemental Planes\"). Their base speed is 36, the highest of all monsters, and is further increased if the player has extra [speed](/wiki/Speed \"Speed\"). They are permanently blind and cannot wear armor or use most items, so this strategy requires care. It is frequently used by players attempting [speed ascensions](/wiki/Speed_ascension \"Speed ascension\").\n\nTurning into a [pudding](/wiki/Pudding \"Pudding\") and then getting yourself split by an enemy's iron weapon will create a tame pudding. You can then strike it until it turns against you and then commence [pudding farming](/wiki/Pudding_farming \"Pudding farming\").\n\nA [mountain centaur](/wiki/Mountain_centaur \"Mountain centaur\") is the fastest form that can operate a [pick-axe](/wiki/Pick-axe \"Pick-axe\"), e.g. in the [dig for victory](/wiki/Dig_for_victory \"Dig for victory\") phase of a [speed run](/wiki/Speed_run \"Speed run\").\n\n### Good choices for self-polymorph\n\nHaving a [ring of polymorph](/wiki/Ring_of_polymorph \"Ring of polymorph\") and a [ring of polymorph control](/wiki/Ring_of_polymorph_control \"Ring of polymorph control\") allows a low level character to become more powerful. Good options for polymorphing include:[\\[7\\]](#cite_note-7)\n\n| Hit dice                                                                                                                       | Armor class                                                                                                        |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| - greater than 14 = Excellent\n- 12 to 14 = Very good\n- 9 to 11 = Good\n- 7 to 8 = Mediocre\n- 5 to 6 = Poor\n- 1 to 4 = Very poor | * less than −3 = Excellent\n* −3 to −2 Very good\n* −1 to 0 Good\n* 1 to 3 Mediocre\n* 4 to 6 Poor\n* 7 to 10 Very poor |\n\n| Creature                                                                                                                                                           | Pros and cons                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| A [Aleax](/wiki/Aleax \"Aleax\")                                                                                                                                     | - + Good attacks (W1d6+W1d6+1d4).\n- + Good hit dice (10).\n- + Good base armor class (0).\n- + [Cold](/wiki/Cold_resistance \"Cold resistance\"), [shock](/wiki/Shock_resistance \"Shock resistance\"), [sleep](/wiki/Sleep_resistance \"Sleep resistance\"), and [poison resistant](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\"); [see invisible](/wiki/See_invisible \"See invisible\").\n- − Slow (8).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| g [gargoyle](/wiki/Gargoyle \"Gargoyle\")                                                                                                                            | * + [Stoning](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\") resistant; if you are turning to stone, polymorphing into a gargoyle will stop the stiffening process.

Unless you are a female character initially, you'll have to polymorph repeatedly until you turn into a female form of the dragon, and then #sit to produce eggs.

what type of monster? \\[type the name]\n\n  You polymorphed while you had polymorph control, and can select a monster to attempt to transform into.\n\n- Would you like to become a \\<wolf/jackal/rat>?\n\n  As above while you have lycanthropy and a random shapeshift or other form of polymorph would have triggered.\n\n- You feel like a new \\<man/woman>!\n\n  You polymorphed into your own race, either willingly with polymorph control or with a 1⁄5 chance while trying to turn into another monster; the latter can occur regardless of polymorph control.\n\n## Variants\n\nSome variants implement major changes to polymorph mechanics that may affect polyself with polymorph control.\n\n### SLASH'EM\n\nIn [SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\"), [doppelgangers](/wiki/Doppelganger_\\(starting_race\\) \"Doppelganger (starting race)\") gain intrinsic polymorph control at experience level 9, making them an excellent race choice for newer players, as controlled polyself makes them extremely powerful relatively early in the game. Without polymorph control, they can only reliably turn into monsters whose [corpse](/wiki/Corpse \"Corpse\") or [tin](/wiki/Tin \"Tin\") they have eaten, or whose monster level is equal to or lower than their current level.\n\nFurthermore, the number of attractive polymorph targets in SLASH'EM is significantly higher. Some worthwhile forms (in addition to those listed above):\n\n- [Giant shoggoths](/wiki/Giant_shoggoth \"Giant shoggoth\") are about the most powerful form, making short work of just about any monster, including [One-eyed Sam](/wiki/Black_market_\\(SLASH%27EM\\)#One-eyed_Sam \"Black market (SLASH'EM)\"). They are stoning resistant, can eat metal, are quite fast, and have teleport control. Unfortunately, they are also blind and have no hands. Thus, they make poor traveling forms, but are excellent for problem-solving.\n- [Crystal golems](/wiki/Crystal_golem \"Crystal golem\") are too large to wear body armor, but intrinsically possess magic resistance, reflection, fire, cold, sleep and shock resistance. They will always have 300 HP as well. While their melee attack only does the damage of your wielded weapon/bare-handed combat abilities, they also possess a random breath weapon, possibly including disintegration.\n- [Master mind flayers](/wiki/Master_mind_flayer \"Master mind flayer\") are still a good choice, but in SLASH'EM they oddly have fewer brain-eating attacks than normal mind flayers.\n- [Fire vampires](/wiki/Fire_vampire \"Fire vampire\") and [star vampires](/wiki/Star_vampire \"Star vampire\") are [breathless](/wiki/Breathless \"Breathless\"), [regenerating](/wiki/Regenerate \"Regenerate\"), [flying](/wiki/Flying \"Flying\"), and make excellent fighting forms. Fire vampires can wear all types of armor, give out radius 2 [light](/wiki/Light \"Light\"), have 24 speed, a base level of 12 (same as a [vampire lord](/wiki/Vampire_lord \"Vampire lord\")), a base AC of 0, and additional attacks including a fire touch and level-draining bite. Star vampires can wear all types of armor excluding body armor (shirt, suit/robe, cloak), have 18 speed, base AC of −5, a base level of 18, and can easily mow down enemies, doing up to 12d6 damage with six tentacle attacks per turn. Note that if you are playing the [vampire race](/wiki/Vampire_\\(starting_race_in_SLASH%27EM\\) \"Vampire (starting race in SLASH'EM)\"), any attempt to transform into any vampiric form will always result in failure, with the \"You feel like a new (wo)man!\" message and its attendant effects.\n- [Gugs](/wiki/Gug \"Gug\") can wear all regular things, and have a paralyzing attack and 18 speed.\n\nNote that in SLASH'EM, forms that have a contact attack (bite, tentacle, claw, touch, etc.) will refrain from using that contact attack against a monster with a passive [stoning](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\") attack ([cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\"), [chickatrice](/wiki/Chickatrice \"Chickatrice\"), [basilisk](/wiki/Basilisk \"Basilisk\"), or [asphynx](/wiki/Asphynx \"Asphynx\")), but you still need to exercise caution. Contact attacks will be disabled *only* if: (1) you attack with a wielded weapon, and (2) the monster is in the same form for the first attack and subsequent attacks. Thus, clawing, biting, or butting a cockatrice without wielding a weapon will stone you, but hitting one with a sword as a master mind flayer or vampire will not; that is, unless the cockatrice was polymorphed into (for example) a troll, and an early attack caused the troll to drop below 1 hp and revert to cockatrice form, in which case the subsequent attacks will still hit the cockatrice and result in a stoning instadeath. This latter case may be a bug. Note further that this limits polyself options for doppleganger monks who are attempting the weaponless conduct; they will always attempt their contact attacks.\n\n### dNetHack\n\nIn [dNetHack](/wiki/DNetHack \"DNetHack\"), both [The Silver Key](/wiki/The_Silver_Key \"The Silver Key\") and [The Hand-Mirror of Cthylla](/index.php?title=The_Hand-Mirror_of_Cthylla\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"The Hand-Mirror of Cthylla (page does not exist)\") (equivalent artifact to the Silver Key for [Binders](/wiki/Binder \"Binder\")) grant polymorph control while carried. [The Alignment Thing](/wiki/Spirits_\\(dNetHack\\)#The_Alignment_Thing \"Spirits (dNetHack)\") is a spirit that confers polymorph control while bound.\n\n### SlashTHEM\n\nIn [SlashTHEM](/wiki/SlashTHEM \"SlashTHEM\"), doppelgangers instead gain intrinsic polymorph control at experience level 25, making the ring of polymorph control much more valuable for controlled polymorphs in the interim.\n\n## References\n\n1.

This will always prevent <a href=\"/wiki/System_shock\" title=\"System shock\">system shock</a> from occurring, and also overrides the special cases for polymorph where you would otherwise become a predetermined target &#8211; i.e. polymorphing while wearing <a href=\"/wiki/Dragon_scales\" title=\"Dragon scales\">dragon scales</a> or a <a href=\"/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail\" title=\"Dragon scale mail\">dragon scale mail</a>, or else polymorphing while you are a <a href=\"/wiki/Vampire_(monster_class)\" title=\"Vampire (monster class)\">vampire</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Werecreature\" title=\"Werecreature\">werecreature</a>; you will still be allowed to choose your polymorph form in these cases.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> If you have lycanthropy or are in vampire form, and your transformation is triggered by means that are not polymorph magic (such as the random chance per turn or unholy water for lycanthropy, or #monster for vampire form), you are instead asked whether or not you want to shift from your current form, and declining will not transform you.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Choosing to <a href=\"/wiki/Polymorph#Polymorphing_into_your_own_race\" title=\"Polymorph\">polymorph into a monster of your own species</a> will cause random adjustments to your <a href=\"/wiki/Attributes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Attributes\">attributes</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Experience_level\" title=\"Experience level\">experience level</a> change to your scores; polymorphing into your own species while in the form of another monster will return you to your base form.

Some species have higher speed that lets you move, attack and react faster to enemies&#8212;in short, deal more damage per turn. Some species also have multiple or additional attacks, dealing extra damage. Whenever you attempt to hit a monster, you use all of your form's attacks. If the monster has no weapon attacks but can wield a weapon, you typically get your weapon damage added to the first attack (which may be a claw move); if a monster has multiple weapon attacks, you hit with your weapon multiple times.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> High-level monsters often have a lower base <a href=\"/wiki/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a>, effectively giving you an AC bonus if you turn into one. If killed by HP loss while polymorphed, reverting to original form is a \"free\" <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving\" title=\"Amulet of life saving\">amulet of life saving</a>.\n</p><p>Possible choices include:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Master_mind_flayer\" title=\"Master mind flayer\">Master mind flayers</a> have 0 base AC and can fly. They have five brain-sucking attacks; each one causes d10 damage to monsters with brains. This is one of the best forms to rack up damage in melee, and they can wear a cloak or armor for <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_cancellation\" title=\"Magic cancellation\">magic cancellation</a>. However, mind flayer attacks also have some dangers:\n<ul><li><b>Accidentally attacking/bumping a <a href=\"/wiki/Cockatrice\" title=\"Cockatrice\">cockatrice</a> is a common <a href=\"/wiki/Stoning\" title=\"Stoning\">stoning</a> instadeath when in the form of a mind flayer:</b> the mind flayer's tentacles are bare skin, and no armor can cover them. Similarly, eating Medusa's brain will result in delayed stoning, while eating any Rider's brain will kill you instantly.</li>\n<li>The brain-sucking attack adds nutrition on each hit, making it possible to become oversatiated very quickly - this results in frequent <a href=\"/wiki/Dexterity\" title=\"Dexterity\">dexterity</a> abuse and also puts you at the risk of <a href=\"/wiki/Instadeath\" title=\"Instadeath\">instadeath</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Choking\" title=\"Choking\">choking</a> if you eat any comestible while oversatiated, including <a href=\"/wiki/Wraith\" title=\"Wraith\">wraith</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Corpse\" title=\"Corpse\">corpses</a>. Choking and dying will <i><b>not</b></i> revert you to original form - among other things, this means that curing delayed stoning in this state (e.g. eating a cockatrice <a href=\"/wiki/Egg\" title=\"Egg\">egg</a>) will require non-comestible means, such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_acid\" title=\"Potion of acid\">potion of acid</a> or polymorphing into a form with <a href=\"/wiki/Stoning_resistance\" title=\"Stoning resistance\">stoning resistance</a>.</li>\n<li>If polymorphing into a (master) mind flayer as a human, eating the brains of <a href=\"/wiki/Soldier\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soldier\">soldiers</a> counts as <a href=\"/wiki/Cannibalism\" title=\"Cannibalism\">cannibalism</a>, hurting your <a href=\"/wiki/Luck\" title=\"Luck\">Luck</a> and making any subsequent Luck-reliant actions riskier.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Jabberwock\" title=\"Jabberwock\">Jabberwocks</a> likely deal the most damage per turn of all polyforms (without an enchanted artifact weapon), can wield weapons, and are capable of flight. However, they can only wear non-body armor and cannot cast spells; in addition, jabberwocks wielding <a href=\"/wiki/Footrice\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Footrice\">footrice</a> corpses in 3.4.3 will not petrify monsters with them.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Minotaur\" title=\"Minotaur\">Minotaurs</a> are a good compromise between speed and damage output.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Titan\" title=\"Titan\">Titans</a> can fly, have base AC &#8722;3, and are faster than the other recommendations. They can also manipulate <a href=\"/wiki/Boulder\" title=\"Boulder\">boulders</a>, and cannot be <a href=\"/wiki/Engulfing\" title=\"Engulfing\">engulfed</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Elvenking\" title=\"Elvenking\">Elvenkings</a> are speed 12, base AC 10 (same as you) and HD 9. They allow you to hit with your weapon damage twice per move, with a 2d4 bonus to each attack. Note, however, that elven characters cannot use this form.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Vampire_lord\" title=\"Vampire lord\">Vampire lords</a> are speed 14 with base AC 0 and HD 12. They regenerate and are unbreathing. This allows you to swim, and you cannot choke to death from wraith corpses (e.g. when oversatiated due to brain-eating in mmf form). Both V can see any @ on the same level as you, as if telepathic, without needing to be blind. Useful for finding shops and temples. Note however that V are silver-hating, and cannot wield silver sabers. (They can however throw silver daggers.) Before polymorphing to a V, check that rings of polymorph control don't happen to be silver rings.</li></ul>\n<p>Out of the above monsters, only Elvenkings, master mind flayers and vampire lords are medium-sized, and thus can wear all forms of <a href=\"/wiki/Armor\" title=\"Armor\">armor</a>. Jabberwocks and minotaurs are large, and titans are huge, so they cannot wear torso armor. They cannot benefit from the extra AC of that armor, nor from the <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Reflection\" title=\"Reflection\">reflection</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_cancellation\" title=\"Magic cancellation\">magic cancellation</a> they provide.\n</p><p>Pay attention to the base level of the species, as this determines your resulting HP. If it is not enough to survive combat, you may need to <a href=\"/wiki/HP#Player\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HP\">increase it</a>. This is only worthwhile if you plan to be <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_unchanging\" title=\"Amulet of unchanging\">unchanging</a>, as the increase is lost when you transform back. You also regenerate HP at the same rate as your species, so having <a href=\"/wiki/Regeneration\" title=\"Regeneration\">regeneration</a> or healing magic is useful.\n</p><p>Be careful when using a form that has a contact attack. Attacking a <a href=\"/wiki/Footrice\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Footrice\">footrice</a> will cause <a href=\"/wiki/Stoning\" title=\"Stoning\">stoning</a> and biting a <a href=\"/wiki/Green_slime\" title=\"Green slime\">green slime</a> causes <a href=\"/wiki/Sliming\" title=\"Sliming\">sliming</a>. Forms with many such attacks, such as mind flayers, may also suffer multiple splashes of acid when attacking <a href=\"/wiki/J\" title=\"J\">jellies</a>. If reaching the Astral Plane in changed form, attacking any <a href=\"/wiki/Rider\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rider\">Rider</a> as a mind flayer will prove to be fatal, as a tentacle hit counts as eating the corpse.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Special_abilities\">Special abilities</span></h3>\n<p>When polymorphed into certain species, you can use their abilities with the <a href=\"/wiki/Monster_(command)\" title=\"Monster (command)\">#monster</a> command:\n</p>\n<ul><li>A <a href=\"/wiki/Dragon\" title=\"Dragon\">dragon</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Breath\" title=\"Breath\">breath</a>. The black dragon's <a href=\"/wiki/Disintegration\" title=\"Disintegration\">disintegration</a> beam is a particular favorite, since few monsters are disintegration-resistant. For example, a <a href=\"/wiki/Monk\" title=\"Monk\">monk</a> can <a href=\"/wiki/Monk_quest\" title=\"Monk quest\">defeat Master Kaen</a> by flying over lava and breathing a blast of disintegration at him.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"/wiki/Gremlin\" title=\"Gremlin\">gremlin</a>'s ability to split near a source of water. This results in tame gremlins.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"/wiki/Mind_flayer\" title=\"Mind flayer\">mind flayer</a>'s psychic blast, which wakes nearby monsters and can hurt them. Some players use this to wake inaccessible enemies such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Master_Assassin\" title=\"Master Assassin\">Master Assassin</a> or the <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor\" title=\"Wizard of Yendor\">Wizard of Yendor</a>.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Laying_eggs\">Laying eggs</span></h3>\n<p>Female characters who polymorph into <a href=\"/wiki/Oviparous\" title=\"Oviparous\">oviparous</a> monsters can use the #<a href=\"/wiki/Sit\" title=\"Sit\">sit</a> command to lay eggs, which hatch into <a href=\"/wiki/Pet\" title=\"Pet\">pets</a> of the same species. This can be used to gain pets of powerful species, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Dragon\" title=\"Dragon\">dragons</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Purple_worm\" title=\"Purple worm\">purple worms</a>, although they usually hatch into baby forms that take a while to <a href=\"/wiki/Grow_up\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Grow up\">grow up</a>.\n</p><p>You can then kill the dragons after they grow up and take <a href=\"/wiki/Dragon_scales\" title=\"Dragon scales\">their scales</a>. However, dragons only leave their scales <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub> of the time.\n</p><p>Another tactic is to lay cockatrice eggs and use them later to petrify enemies. Note that your <a href=\"/wiki/Luck\" title=\"Luck\">Luck</a> is penalized by &#8722;1 each time you break your own eggs, to a maximum of &#8722;5.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gaining_intrinsics\">Gaining intrinsics</span></h3>\n<p>Most of your attributes are reset when you return to original form, but you keep any intrinsics gained while in monster form. For example, if you eat poisonous corpses that damage your <a href=\"/wiki/Strength\" title=\"Strength\">strength</a>, you may gain <a href=\"/wiki/Poison_resistance\" title=\"Poison resistance\">poison resistance</a> and still keep your original strength when you change back.\n</p><p>Another way to gain intrinsics is to polymorph into a <a href=\"/wiki/Metallivore\" title=\"Metallivore\">metallivore</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Gelatinous_cube\" title=\"Gelatinous cube\">gelatinous cube</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Eating_jewelry\" title=\"Eating jewelry\">eat rings and amulets</a>. This way, you do not have to wear those items to enjoy their benefits. Note that some items cannot be eaten, some intrinsics cannot ever be gained, and some items have unwanted side effects. For example, the intrinsic from a <a href=\"/wiki/Ring_of_regeneration\" title=\"Ring of regeneration\">ring of regeneration</a> will also cause you to burn nutrition faster, even when your HP is full. Interestingly, it is possible to get both intrinsic <a href=\"/wiki/Polymorphitis\" title=\"Polymorphitis\">polymorphitis</a> and polymorph control from rings, allowing you to polymorph from time to time like a <a href=\"/wiki/Shapeshifter\" title=\"Shapeshifter\">shapeshifter</a> monster.\n</p><p>Polymorph control is also useful for temporary intrinsics and other properties, such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Silver_dragon\" title=\"Silver dragon\">silver dragon</a> form to deal with a <a href=\"/wiki/Gnome_With_the_Wand_of_Death\" title=\"Gnome With the Wand of Death\">Gnome With the Wand of Death</a>, or a <a href=\"/wiki/Winged_gargoyle\" title=\"Winged gargoyle\">winged gargoyle</a> form to pick up a cockatrice <a href=\"/wiki/Corpse\" title=\"Corpse\">corpse</a> without gloves - one common such use is the <a href=\"/wiki/Xorn\" title=\"Xorn\">xorn</a> form's phasing ability to move more efficiently on <a href=\"/wiki/Non-teleport_level\" title=\"Non-teleport level\">non-teleport levels</a>, e.g. to get the Castle's <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_wishing\" title=\"Wand of wishing\">wand of wishing</a> without having to fight the army inside. Other similar uses include turning into a <a href=\"/wiki/Nymph\" title=\"Nymph\">nymph</a> to steal items from other monsters, becoming a <a href=\"/wiki/Cockatrice\" title=\"Cockatrice\">cockatrice</a> to petrify monsters, or turning into a <a href=\"/wiki/Major_demon\" title=\"Major demon\">major demon</a> to summon tame demons as you attack enemies bare-handed.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_uses\">Other uses</span></h3>\n<p>Some players turn into an <a href=\"/wiki/Air_elemental\" title=\"Air elemental\">air elemental</a> to travel, especially on the hectic <a href=\"/wiki/Elemental_Planes\" title=\"Elemental Planes\">Elemental Planes</a>. Their base speed is 36, the highest of all monsters, and is further increased if the player has extra <a href=\"/wiki/Speed\" title=\"Speed\">speed</a>. They are permanently blind and cannot wear armor or use most items, so this strategy requires care.

Without polymorph control, they can only reliably turn into monsters whose <a href=\"/wiki/Corpse\" title=\"Corpse\">corpse</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Tin\" title=\"Tin\">tin</a> they have eaten, or whose monster level is equal to or lower than their current level.\n</p><p>Furthermore, the number of attractive polymorph targets in SLASH'EM is significantly higher. Some worthwhile forms (in addition to those listed above):\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Giant_shoggoth\" title=\"Giant shoggoth\">Giant shoggoths</a> are about the most powerful form, making short work of just about any monster, including <a href=\"/wiki/Black_market_(SLASH%27EM)#One-eyed_Sam\" title=\"Black market (SLASH&#39;EM)\">One-eyed Sam</a>. They are stoning resistant, can eat metal, are quite fast, and have teleport control. Unfortunately, they are also blind and have no hands. Thus, they make poor traveling forms, but are excellent for problem-solving.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Crystal_golem\" title=\"Crystal golem\">Crystal golems</a> are too large to wear body armor, but intrinsically possess magic resistance, reflection, fire, cold, sleep and shock resistance. They will always have 300 HP as well. While their melee attack only does the damage of your wielded weapon/bare-handed combat abilities, they also possess a random breath weapon, possibly including disintegration.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Master_mind_flayer\" title=\"Master mind flayer\">Master mind flayers</a> are still a good choice, but in SLASH'EM they oddly have fewer brain-eating attacks than normal mind flayers.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Fire_vampire\" title=\"Fire vampire\">Fire vampires</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Star_vampire\" title=\"Star vampire\">star vampires</a> are <a href=\"/wiki/Breathless\" title=\"Breathless\">breathless</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Regenerate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Regenerate\">regenerating</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Flying\" title=\"Flying\">flying</a>, and make excellent fighting forms. Fire vampires can wear all types of armor, give out radius 2 <a href=\"/wiki/Light\" title=\"Light\">light</a>, have 24 speed, a base level of 12 (same as a <a href=\"/wiki/Vampire_lord\" title=\"Vampire lord\">vampire lord</a>), a base AC of 0, and additional attacks including a fire touch and level-draining bite. Star vampires can wear all types of armor excluding body armor (shirt, suit/robe, cloak), have 18 speed, base AC of &#8722;5, a base level of 18, and can easily mow down enemies, doing up to 12d6 damage with six tentacle attacks per turn. Note that if you are playing the <a href=\"/wiki/Vampire_(starting_race_in_SLASH%27EM)\" title=\"Vampire (starting race in SLASH&#39;EM)\">vampire race</a>, any attempt to transform into any vampiric form will always result in failure, with the \"You feel like a new (wo)man!\" message and its attendant effects.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Gug\" title=\"Gug\">Gugs</a> can wear all regular things, and have a paralyzing attack and 18 speed.</li></ul>\n<p>Note that in SLASH'EM, forms that have a contact attack (bite, tentacle, claw, touch, etc.) will refrain from using that contact attack against a monster with a passive <a href=\"/wiki/Stoning\" title=\"Stoning\">stoning</a> attack (<a href=\"/wiki/Cockatrice\" title=\"Cockatrice\">cockatrice</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Chickatrice\" title=\"Chickatrice\">chickatrice</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Basilisk\" title=\"Basilisk\">basilisk</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Asphynx\" title=\"Asphynx\">asphynx</a>), but you still need to exercise caution. Contact attacks will be disabled <i>only</i> if: (1) you attack with a wielded weapon, and (2) the monster is in the same form for the first attack and subsequent attacks. Thus, clawing, biting, or butting a cockatrice without wielding a weapon will stone you, but hitting one with a sword as a master mind flayer or vampire will not; that is, unless the cockatrice was polymorphed into (for example) a troll, and an early attack caused the troll to drop below 1 hp and revert to cockatrice form, in which case the subsequent attacks will still hit the cockatrice and result in a stoning instadeath. This latter case may be a bug. Note further that this limits polyself options for doppleganger monks who are attempting the weaponless conduct; they will always attempt their contact attacks.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"dNetHack\">dNetHack</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/DNetHack\" title=\"DNetHack\">dNetHack</a>, both <a href=\"/wiki/The_Silver_Key\" title=\"The Silver Key\">The Silver Key</a> and <a href=\"/index.php?title=The_Hand-Mirror_of_Cthylla&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"The Hand-Mirror of Cthylla (page does not exist)\">The Hand-Mirror of Cthylla</a> (equivalent artifact to the Silver Key for <a href=\"/wiki/Binder\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Binder\">Binders</a>) grant polymorph control while carried. <a href=\"/wiki/Spirits_(dNetHack)#The_Alignment_Thing\" title=\"Spirits (dNetHack)\">The Alignment Thing</a> is a spirit that confers polymorph control while bound.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"SlashTHEM\">SlashTHEM</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/SlashTHEM\" title=\"SlashTHEM\">SlashTHEM</a>, doppelgangers instead gain intrinsic polymorph control at experience level 25, making the ring of polymorph control much more valuable for controlled polymorphs in the interim.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/NetHack-3.6.7_Released/src/polyself.c#L404\">src/polyself.c in NetHack 3.6.7, line 404</a><span>:</span> <i>Polymorph control prevents system shock</i>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/NetHack-3.6.7_Released/src/polyself.c#L419\">src/polyself.c in NetHack 3.6.7, line 419</a><span>:</span> <i>Getting hit by polymorph magic while wearing dragon armor, or being a werecreature or vampire, and having polymorph control, overrides the normal case in the following <code>else</code> statement.</i>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/NetHack-3.6.7_Released/src/were.c#L183\">src/were.c in NetHack 3.6.7, line 183</a><span>:</span> <i>Option to change as a werecreature when you have polymorph control</i>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/NetHack-3.6.7_Released/src/polyself.c#L540\">src/polyself.c in NetHack 3.6.7, line 540</a><span>:</span> <i>Option to change when using #monster as a vampire.</i>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-5\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-5\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/NetHack-3.6.7_Released/src/polyself.c#L268\">src/polyself.c in NetHack 3.6.7, line 268</a><span>:</span> <i><code>newman()</code></i>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/NetHack-3.6.6_Released/src/uhitm.c#L2394\">src/uhitm.c in NetHack 3.6.6, line 2394</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-7\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-7\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://ccphys.nsu.ru/~zvold/nethack/spoilers/32poly.txt\">http://ccphys.nsu.ru/~zvold/nethack/spoilers/32poly.txt</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<div style=\"display:none; right:10px; padding-bottom: 17px\" class=\"metadata topicon nopopups\"><div style=\"margin-top: -10px\"><a href=\"/wiki/NetHackWiki:Next_version\" title=\"This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.7.

control''' is a [[property]] in ''[[NetHack]]'' that allows the [[hero]] to maintain control over the form they take whenever they [[polymorph]].\n\nThe only source of the property is wearing or [[Eating jewelry|eating]] the [[ring of polymorph control]].\n\n{{upcoming|3.7.0|The blessed [[potion of polymorph]] gives a controlled polymorph when quaffed, as a form of temporary \"polymorph control\".}}\n\n==Description==\nIf you polymorph while you have polymorph control, and you are not [[stun]]ned or unconscious, a prompt will appear asking what type of [[monster]] you want to become: you can type the name of that monster and confirm, then you will attempt to polymorph into that monster. This will always prevent [[system shock]] from occurring, and also overrides the special cases for polymorph where you would otherwise become a predetermined target &ndash; i.e. polymorphing while wearing [[dragon scales]] or a [[dragon scale mail]], or else polymorphing while you are a [[vampire (monster class)|vampire]] or [[werecreature]]; you will still be allowed to choose your polymorph form in these cases.{{refsrc|src/polyself.c|404|version=NetHack 3.6.7|comment=Polymorph control prevents system shock}}{{refsrc|src/polyself.c|419|version=NetHack 3.6.7|comment=Getting hit by polymorph magic while wearing dragon armor, or being a werecreature or vampire, and having polymorph control, overrides the normal case in the following <code>else</code> statement.}} If you have lycanthropy or are in vampire form, and your transformation is triggered by means that are not polymorph magic (such as the random chance per turn or unholy water for lycanthropy, or #monster for vampire form), you are instead asked whether or not you want to shift from your current form, and declining will not transform you.{{refsrc|src/were.c|183|version=NetHack 3.6.7|comment=Option to change as a werecreature when you have polymorph control}}{{refsrc|src/polyself.c|540|version=NetHack 3.6.7|comment=Option to change when using #monster as a vampire.}}\n\nChoosing to [[Polymorph#Polymorphing into your own race|polymorph into a monster of your own species]] will cause random adjustments to your [[attributes]] and [[experience level]] change to your scores; polymorphing into your own species while in the form of another monster will return you to your base form. Both transformations give the same message. There is also a {{frac|5}} chance that a polymorph will cause you to turn into your own species and shuffle your stats, regardless of if you have polymorph control.{{refsrc|src/polyself.c|268|version=NetHack 3.6.7|comment=<code>newman()</code>}}\n\n==Strategy==\nThere are many reasons for a player to want control over their polymorphs, whether it is gaining advantages and special abilities in combat, obtaining otherwise-rare pets, obtain hard-to-get intrinsics, or even making travel less of a hassle.\n\n=== Advantage in combat ===\n:''See also: [[Monsters (by speed)]]''\nPolyself has vastly improved the record for game-time [[speed ascension]]s. Some species have higher speed that lets you move, attack and react faster to enemies&mdash;in short, deal more damage per turn. Some species also have multiple or additional attacks, dealing extra damage. Whenever you attempt to hit a monster, you use all of your form's attacks. If the monster has no weapon attacks but can wield a weapon, you typically get your weapon damage added to the first attack (which may be a claw move); if a monster has multiple weapon attacks, you hit with your weapon multiple times.{{refsrc|src/uhitm.c|2394|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} High-level monsters often have a lower base [[AC]], effectively giving you an AC bonus if you turn into one. If killed by HP loss while polymorphed, reverting to original form is a \"free\" [[amulet of life saving]].\n\nPossible choices include:\n* [[Master mind flayer]]s have 0 base AC and can fly. They have five brain-sucking attacks; each one causes d10 damage to monsters with brains. This is one of the best forms to rack up damage in melee, and they can wear a cloak or armor for [[magic cancellation]]. However, mind flayer attacks also have some dangers:\n** '''Accidentally attacking/bumping a [[cockatrice]] is a common [[stoning]] instadeath when in the form of a mind flayer:''' the mind flayer's tentacles are bare skin, and no armor can cover them. Similarly, eating Medusa's brain will result in delayed stoning, while eating any Rider's brain will kill you instantly.\n** The brain-sucking attack adds nutrition on each hit, making it possible to become oversatiated very quickly - this results in frequent [[dexterity]] abuse and also puts you at the risk of [[instadeath]] by [[choking]] if you eat any comestible while oversatiated, including [[wraith]] [[corpse]]s. Choking and dying will '''''not''''' revert you to original form - among other things, this means that curing delayed stoning in this state (e.g. eating a cockatrice [[egg]]) will require non-comestible means, such as a [[potion of acid]] or polymorphing into a form with [[stoning resistance]].\n** If polymorphing into a (master) mind flayer as a human, eating the brains of [[soldier]]s counts as [[cannibalism]], hurting your [[Luck]] and making any subsequent Luck-reliant actions riskier.\n* [[Jabberwock]]s likely deal the most damage per turn of all polyforms (without an enchanted artifact weapon), can wield weapons, and are capable of flight. However, they can only wear non-body armor and cannot cast spells; in addition, jabberwocks wielding [[footrice]] corpses in 3.4.3 will not petrify monsters with them.\n* [[Minotaur]]s are a good compromise between speed and damage output.\n* [[Titan]]s can fly, have base AC &minus;3, and are faster than the other recommendations. They can also manipulate [[boulder]]s, and cannot be [[engulfing|engulfed]].\n* [[Elvenking]]s are speed 12, base AC 10 (same as you) and HD 9. They allow you to hit with your weapon damage twice per move, with a 2d4 bonus to each attack. Note, however, that elven characters cannot use this form.\n* [[Vampire lord]]s are speed 14 with base AC 0 and HD 12. They regenerate and are unbreathing. This allows you to swim, and you cannot choke to death from wraith corpses (e.g. when oversatiated due to brain-eating in mmf form). Both V can see any @ on the same level as you, as if telepathic, without needing to be blind. Useful for finding shops and temples. Note however that V are silver-hating, and cannot wield silver sabers. (They can however throw silver daggers.) Before polymorphing to a V, check that rings of polymorph control don't happen to be silver rings.\n\nOut of the above monsters, only Elvenkings, master mind flayers and vampire lords are medium-sized, and thus can wear all forms of [[armor]]. Jabberwocks and minotaurs are large, and titans are huge, so they cannot wear torso armor. They cannot benefit from the extra AC of that armor, nor from the [[magic resistance]], [[reflection]] or [[magic cancellation]] they provide.\n\nPay attention to the base level of the species, as this determines your resulting HP. If it is not enough to survive combat, you may need to [[HP#Player|increase it]]. This is only worthwhile if you plan to be [[amulet of unchanging|unchanging]], as the increase is lost when you transform back. You also regenerate HP at the same rate as your species, so having [[regeneration]] or healing magic is useful.\n\nBe careful when using a form that has a contact attack. Attacking a [[footrice]] will cause [[stoning]] and biting a [[green slime]] causes [[sliming]]. Forms with many such attacks, such as mind flayers, may also suffer multiple splashes of acid when attacking [[j|jellies]]. If reaching the Astral Plane in changed form, attacking any [[Rider]] as a mind flayer will prove to be fatal, as a tentacle hit counts as eating the corpse.\n\n===Special abilities===\nWhen polymorphed into certain species, you can use their abilities with the [[monster (command)|#monster]] command:\n* A [[dragon]]'s [[breath]]. The black dragon's [[disintegration]] beam is a particular favorite, since few monsters are disintegration-resistant. For example, a [[monk]] can [[monk quest|defeat Master Kaen]] by flying over lava and breathing a blast of disintegration at him.\n* A [[gremlin]]'s ability to split near a source of water. This results in tame gremlins.\n* A [[mind flayer]]'s psychic blast, which wakes nearby monsters and can hurt them. Some players use this to wake inaccessible enemies such as the [[Master Assassin]] or the [[Wizard of Yendor]].\n\n===Laying eggs===\nFemale characters who polymorph into [[oviparous]] monsters can use the #[[sit]] command to lay eggs, which hatch into [[pet]]s of the same species. This can be used to gain pets of powerful species, such as [[dragon]]s and [[purple worm]]s, although they usually hatch into baby forms that take a while to [[grow up]].\n\nYou can then kill the dragons after they grow up and take [[dragon scales|their scales]]. However, dragons only leave their scales {{frac|3}} of the time.\n\nAnother tactic is to lay cockatrice eggs and use them later to petrify enemies. Note that your [[Luck]] is penalized by &minus;1 each time you break your own eggs, to a maximum of &minus;5.<!-- Clarify: does the penalty stop occurring when your Luck is −5, or when you've been penalized 5 times? -->\n\n===Gaining intrinsics===\nMost of your attributes are reset when you return to original form, but you keep any intrinsics gained while in monster form. For example, if you eat poisonous corpses that damage your [[strength]], you may gain [[poison resistance]] and still keep your original strength when you change back.\n\nAnother way to gain intrinsics is to polymorph into a [[metallivore]] or [[gelatinous cube]] and [[Eating jewelry|eat rings and amulets]]. This way, you do not have to wear those items to enjoy their benefits. Note that some items cannot be eaten, some intrinsics cannot ever be gained, and some items have unwanted side effects. For example, the intrinsic from a [[ring of regeneration]] will also cause you to burn nutrition faster, even when your HP is full. Interestingly, it is possible to get both intrinsic [[polymorphitis]] and polymorph control from rings, allowing you to polymorph from time to time like a [[shapeshifter]] monster.\n\nPolymorph control is also useful for temporary intrinsics and other properties, such as a [[silver dragon]] form to deal with a [[Gnome With the Wand of Death]], or a [[winged gargoyle]] form to pick up a cockatrice [[corpse]] without gloves - one common such use is the [[xorn]] form's phasing ability to move more efficiently on [[non-teleport level]]s, e.g. to get the Castle's [[wand of wishing]] without having to fight the army inside. Other similar uses include turning into a [[nymph]] to steal items from other monsters, becoming a [[cockatrice]] to petrify monsters, or turning into a [[major demon]] to summon tame demons as you attack enemies bare-handed.\n\n===Other uses===\nSome players turn into an [[air elemental]] to travel, especially on the hectic [[Elemental Planes]]. Their base speed is 36, the highest of all monsters, and is further increased if the player has extra [[speed]]. They are permanently blind and cannot wear armor or use most items, so this strategy requires care. It is frequently used by players attempting [[speed ascension]]s.\n\nTurning into a [[pudding]] and then getting yourself split by an enemy's iron weapon will create a tame pudding. You can then strike it until it turns against you and then commence [[pudding farming]].\n\nA [[mountain centaur]] is the fastest form that can operate a [[pick-axe]], e.g. in the [[dig for victory]] phase of a [[speed run]].\n\n===Good choices for self-polymorph===\nHaving a [[ring of polymorph]] and a [[ring of polymorph control]] allows a low level character to become more powerful. Good options for polymorphing include:<ref>http://ccphys.nsu.ru/~zvold/nethack/spoilers/32poly.txt</ref>\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n!Hit dice\n!Armor class\n|-\n|\n* greater than 14 = Excellent \n* 12 to 14 = Very good\n* 9 to 11 = Good\n* 7 to 8 = Mediocre\n* 5 to 6 = Poor\n* 1 to 4 = Very poor\n|\n* less than &minus;3 = Excellent \n* &minus;3 to &minus;2 Very good\n* &minus;1 to 0 Good\n* 1 to 3 Mediocre\n* 4 to 6 Poor\n* 7 to 10 Very poor\n|}\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" style=\"text-align:left\" |'''Creatures which can wear all armor'''\n!Creature\n!Pros and cons\n|-\n|{{monsymlink|Aleax}}\n|\n*+ Good attacks (W1d6+W1d6+1d4).\n*+ Good hit dice (10).\n*+ Good base armor class (0).\n*+ [[cold resistance|Cold]], [[shock resistance|shock]], [[sleep resistance|sleep]], and [[poison resistance|poison resistant]]; [[see invisible]].\n*&minus; Slow (8).\n|-\n|{{monsymlink|gargoyle}}\n|\n*+ [[Stoning]] resistant; if you are turning to stone, polymorphing into a gargoyle will stop the stiffening process.

It is possible albeit difficult to create [[silver dragon scale mail|silver]] or [[gray dragon scale mail]] by polymorphing into one of these forms. Unless you are a female character initially, you'll have to polymorph repeatedly until you turn into a female form of the dragon, and then #sit to produce eggs. Raise the pet baby dragons until they turn into adults, and then have them killed. They might leave [[dragon scales]], which can be turned into [[dragon scale mail]] using a [[scroll of enchant armor]].\n* If you lack [[poison resistance]], you can easily gain it by polymorphing into a [[green dragon]] and eating [[poison]]ous corpses. Although the green dragon is poison resistant, you can still permanently gain the intrinsic by eating poisonous corpses (\"''You feel especially healthy''\").\n* If already wearing dragon scales or mail, you become that dragon.\n\n\n*+ Good attacks (B+3d8+1d4+1d4).\n*+ Excellent hit dice (15).\n*+ Good armor class (&minus;1).\n*+ Has an intrinsic depending on the color.\n*+ Can fly.\n*+ Strength 18/**.\n*+ Can lay eggs (if female) to produce good pets.\n*+ [[Breath]] weapon.\n*&minus; Cannot wear any armor nor wield any weapon.\n*&minus; You will break your shirt, body armor (except dragon scales), and cloak.\n*&minus; Can't safely attack [[cockatrice]]s (except [[yellow dragon]]s which are resistant to stoning).\n|-\n|{{monsymlink|titan}}\n|\n*+ Good attacks (W2d8+M0d0)\n*+ Very fast.\n*+ Excellent hit dice (16).\n*+ Very good armor class (&minus;3).\n*+ Strength 18/**.\n*+ Being [[huge]], cannot be engulfed (important on the [[Astral Plane]])\n*&minus; You will break your shirt, body armor, and cloak.\n|-\n|{{monsymlink|jabberwock}}\n|\n*+ Excellent attacks (2d10+2d10+2d10+2d10).\n*+ Excellent hit dice (15).\n*+ Very good armor class (&minus;2).\n*+ Can fly.\n*+ Strength 18/**.\n*+ Can wear boots, shield, and helm.\n*&minus; You will break your shirt, body armor, and cloak.\n*&minus; Can't safely attack cockatrices.\n|\n|-\n|{{monsymlink|marilith}}\n|\n*+ Excellent attacks with weapons (W2d4+W2d4) plus claws (2d4+2d4+2d4+2d4).\n*+ Excellent armor class (&minus;6).\n*+ Low base level (7) allows low level characters to stay polymorphed for the normal duration.\n*+ Fire and poison resistant, see invisible.\n*+/&minus; mediocre hit dice (7)\n*&minus; You will break your shirt, body armor, and cloak.\n*&minus; Cannot wear boots.\n|\n|-\n|{{monsymlink|cockatrice}}\n||\n*+ Can lay eggs to produce good pets.\n*+ Can stone most other monsters.\n*+ Poison and stone resistant.\n*&minus; Poor hit dice (5) and poor armor class (6).\n*&minus; You will drop your weapon and all armor.\n|-\n|{{monsymlink|purple worm}}\n||\n*+ Can engulf and digest most other monsters.\n*+ Can lay eggs to produce good pets.\n*+ Excellent hit dice (15).\n*&minus; Poor armor class (6).\n*&minus; You will break your shirt, body armor, and cloak.\n*&minus; You will drop your weapon, gloves, shield, helmet, and boots.\n*&minus; You can be stoned by engulfing cockatrices or Medusa.\n*&minus; Not good for attacking groups of monsters.\n|-\n|{{monsymlink|gelatinous cube}}\n||\n*+ Can eat organic rings.\n*+ Can paralyze most other monsters.\n*+ Fire, cold, shock, sleep, poison, acid, and stone resistant.\n*&minus; Poor hit dice (6) and very poor armor class (8).\n*&minus; You will drop your weapon and all armor.\n*&minus; You will break your shirt, body armor, and cloak.\n|-\n|{{monsymlink|rock mole}}\n||\n*+ Can eat metallic rings and amulets.\n*+ Can dig through walls.\n*&minus; Very poor hit dice (3).\n*&minus; You will drop your weapon and all armor.\n|-\n|{{monsymlink|umber hulk}}\n||\n*+ Can dig through walls.\n*+ Can confuse most other monsters.\n*&minus; You will break your shirt, body armor, and cloak.\n*&minus; Can't safely attack cockatrices.\n|-\n|{{monsymlink|xorn}}\n||\n*+ Can eat metallic rings and amulets.\n*+ Can phase through most terrain.\n** Obtain gems and gold entrapped in walls.\n** Rob [[vault]]s.\n** Reach [[Master Assassin]] at the [[Rogue quest]].\n** Find the [[vibrating square]] fast.\n*+ Good attacks (1d3+1d3+1d3+4d6).\n*+ Very good armor class (&minus;2).\n*+ Strength 18/**.\n*+ Fire, cold, and stone resistant; doesn't breathe.\n*&minus; You will break your shirt, body armor, and cloak.\n|}\n\n==Messages==\n{{message|Become what type of monster?

Without polymorph control, they can only reliably turn into monsters whose [[corpse]] or [[tin]] they have eaten, or whose monster level is equal to or lower than their current level.\n\nFurthermore, the number of attractive polymorph targets in SLASH'EM is significantly higher. Some worthwhile forms (in addition to those listed above):\n\n* [[Giant shoggoth]]s are about the most powerful form, making short work of just about any monster, including [[Black market (SLASH'EM)#One-eyed Sam|One-eyed Sam]]. They are stoning resistant, can eat metal, are quite fast, and have teleport control. Unfortunately, they are also blind and have no hands. Thus, they make poor traveling forms, but are excellent for problem-solving.\n* [[Crystal golem]]s are too large to wear body armor, but intrinsically possess magic resistance, reflection, fire, cold, sleep and shock resistance. They will always have 300 HP as well. While their melee attack only does the damage of your wielded weapon/bare-handed combat abilities, they also possess a random breath weapon, possibly including disintegration.\n* [[Master mind flayer]]s are still a good choice, but in SLASH'EM they oddly have fewer brain-eating attacks than normal mind flayers.\n* [[Fire vampire]]s and [[star vampire]]s are [[breathless]], [[regenerate|regenerating]], [[flying]], and make excellent fighting forms. Fire vampires can wear all types of armor, give out radius 2 [[light]], have 24 speed, a base level of 12 (same as a [[vampire lord]]), a base AC of 0, and additional attacks including a fire touch and level-draining bite. Star vampires can wear all types of armor excluding body armor (shirt, suit/robe, cloak), have 18 speed, base AC of &minus;5, a base level of 18, and can easily mow down enemies, doing up to 12d6 damage with six tentacle attacks per turn. Note that if you are playing the [[Vampire_(starting_race_in_SLASH%27EM)|vampire race]], any attempt to transform into any vampiric form will always result in failure, with the \"You feel like a new (wo)man!\" message and its attendant effects.\n* [[Gug]]s can wear all regular things, and have a paralyzing attack and 18 speed.\n\nNote that in SLASH'EM, forms that have a contact attack (bite, tentacle, claw, touch, etc.) will refrain from using that contact attack against a monster with a passive [[stoning]] attack ([[cockatrice]], [[chickatrice]], [[basilisk]], or [[asphynx]]), but you still need to exercise caution. Contact attacks will be disabled ''only'' if: (1) you attack with a wielded weapon, and (2) the monster is in the same form for the first attack and subsequent attacks. Thus, clawing, biting, or butting a cockatrice without wielding a weapon will stone you, but hitting one with a sword as a master mind flayer or vampire will not; that is, unless the cockatrice was polymorphed into (for example) a troll, and an early attack caused the troll to drop below 1 hp and revert to cockatrice form, in which case the subsequent attacks will still hit the cockatrice and result in a stoning instadeath. This latter case may be a bug. Note further that this limits polyself options for doppleganger monks who are attempting the weaponless conduct; they will always attempt their contact attacks.\n\n===dNetHack===\nIn [[dNetHack]], both [[The Silver Key]] and [[The Hand-Mirror of Cthylla]] (equivalent artifact to the Silver Key for [[Binder]]s) grant polymorph control while carried. [[Spirits (dNetHack)#The Alignment Thing|The Alignment Thing]] is a spirit that confers polymorph control while bound.\n\n===SlashTHEM===\nIn [[SlashTHEM]], doppelgangers instead gain intrinsic polymorph control at experience level 25, making the ring of polymorph control much more valuable for controlled polymorphs in the interim.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{nethack-367}}\n[[Category:Properties]]"}

The ENCHANTment of\nMagicbane affects these probabilities; note that higher enchantments\nreduce the likelihood of the better attacks. (Negative enchantments\nhave the same probabilities as at +0.)  Even the NORMAL, non-magical\ndamage that occurs 60% of the time has an extra d4 damage above that\nof a normal athame unless the monster resists.  If any magical attacks\noccur, additional d4s of damage are added; at most one of the\nindividual attacks may cause a magical effect as detailed below.\n\nThe PROBE attack usually does nothing special beyond adding the d4 for\nthe magical attack; if no other effect has occurred, there is a 1 in\n(3 * (absolute value of enchantment)) chance that the probe is\ninsightful, giving the effect of a wand of probing. A probe is always\ninsightful if Magicbane is at +0.\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade probes <monster>!\"\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade prods <monster>!\" (hallucinating)\n\nThe STUN attack causes an additional d4 damage; if none of the later\neffects have occurred and been successful, it stuns the monster (or\nyou, for 3 (more) turns, if you are being attacked by Magicbane).\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade stuns <monster>!\"\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade amazes <monster>!\" (hallucinating)\n\nThe SCARE attack causes an additional d4 damage; if not combined with\na CANCEL attack, causes the monster to flee for 3 (more) turns; the\nmonster has a 50% chance of being given an opportunity to resist this\neffect. If you are being attacked by Magicbane and aren't\nmagic-resistant, this effect paralyses you for 3 (more) turns.\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade scares <monster>!\"\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade tickles <monster>!\" (hallucinating)\n\nFinally, the CANCEL attack causes another additional d4 damage and has\nthe same effect as a spell of cancellation (but with a fixed level of\n10 for resistance saving throw purposes). If the monster has the\nability to cast spells, the effect adds one to your current and\nmaximum spell energy. The monster may resist. If you are hit with\nMagicbane and you don't have magic-resistance, you are cancelled and\nlose one current and maximum spell energy.\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade cancels <monster>!\"\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade purges <monster>!\"\n\nIn addition, any magical attack has a 1 in 12 chance of confusing the\ndefender.\n\nThe AVE DMG column in the table above summarizes the expected average\ndamage for each enchantment level; it includes bonuses due to\nenchantment but not to weapon skills (athames are in the dagger\nclass). (Again, note that a monster with a high base magic resistance\nsaving throw may reduce the severity of the attacks that occur, as\nwell as averting the potential magical effects; the quoted figures are\nfor monsters with 0 MR.)  The Damage row lists the amount of damage\neach type of attack causes; the average of each attack type is given\nin the Ave dmg row.\n\nFor those source divers who are interested in how the above values were\nobtained, the following table may help:\n    Enchant      +0   +1   +2   +3   +4   +5   +6   +7   +8   +9   more\n    * Probes/11   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11\n    * Stuns/11   10    9    8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1    0\n    Scare roll    4    4    4    2    2    2    1    1    1    0    0\n    Cancel roll   2    2    2    1    1    1    0    0    0    0    0\n    Die roll 1   Can  Can  Can  Can  Can  Can  Sca  Sca  Sca   *    *\n    Die roll 2   Can  Can  Can  Sca  Sca  Sca   *    *    *    *    *\n    Die roll 3   Sca  Sca  Sca   *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n    Die roll 4   Sca  Sca  Sca   *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n    Roll 5-8      *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n    Roll 9-20    ----------- Normal, non-magical damage -------------\n\nWhat is the best enchantment for Magicbane?  If you simply want to cause\nthe most damage, then the table indicates that you should enchant it as\nhigh as possible (safely to +7).  Fortunately, your odds of magic-\nresistance, curse-resistance, and engraving do not depend upon the\nenchantment.  However, if you want to maximize the best magical attacks\nof this artifact, it should be enchanted to +2.  Note that the only\ndifference in the magical attacks between the +0 and the +2 Magicbane is\na 3.7% change between probing and stunning.\n\nMagicbane is generally not the best weapon for combat, although\nmedium-level characters with good dagger skill and poor skills in other\nweapon may find it their best choice.  Higher-level characters may want\nto wield it as their regular weapon to absorb curses while they are\ntravelling through the dungeon, switching to something else to fight\npowerful monsters.\n\n\nWhich artifact should I choose?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n[Adapted from a spoiler courtesy of David Grabiner.]\n\nIf you get an early wish and decide to use it for a weapon, or if you\nhave accumulated several artifact weapons, which weapon you should wield\ndepends highly on your class because of the class limits on weapon\nskills.\n\nARTIFACT weapons that are worth keeping are listed in the table below.\nSome artifacts are not listed, because they are only effective against\na small subset of monsters.  The SKILL category of each artifact is\nlisted, as well as the maximum skill level for each class (ABCH KMPRaRo\nSTVW): - means restricted to unskilled, b means basic skill, s means\nskilled, and E means expert.  Note that if you receive an artifact as a\ngift by crowning or sacrificing, any restriction on its weapon class will\nbe removed and you will be able to advance to basic skill.\n\nThe table also indicates the damage range of each artifact against\ntypical SMALL creatures, LARGE creatures, and major DEMONs.  The damage\ncalculations assume that the artifact is enchanted as shown, you have\nexpert skill, and that the artifact's special attacks apply to the\nmonster; the Longbow of Diana assumes that you are using normal +0\narrows fired at a rate of up to 4 a round (expert Ranger). Damage\nagainst major demons further assumes that the weapon is blessed and that\nthe demon hates silver, is fire-resistant, and is drain-resistant.\nFinally, the table summarizes the average damage against major demons\n(DAVE), which are often the nastiest creatures in the dungeon. \nMagicbane's actual damage is slightly greater due to its special\nattacks, but it doesn't make a difference here.\n\nARTIFACT              SKILL         ABCH KMPRaRo STVW  SMALL LARGE DEMON DAVE\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~  ~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~\n+2 Magicbane    (MB)  Dagger        bbbs b--E E  bEEE   6-12  6-11  7-15 11.0\n+7 Staff Aesculapius  Quarterstaff  sbEE -bEb -  bbbE  19-36 19-36 12-19 15.5\n+7 Stormbringer (SB)  Broadsword    -s-- s--- s  sbs-  13-27 13-26 12-20 16.0\n+7 Grimtooth          Dagger        bbbs b--E E  bEEE  11-18 11-18 12-22 17.0\n+7 Sunsword           Long sword    -s-- E--- s  EbE-  10-17 10-21 11-25 18.0\n+7 Fire Brand         Long sword    -s-- E--- s  EbE-  18-32 18-40 11-25 18.0\n+7 Vorpal Blade       Long sword    -s-- E--- s  EbE-  11-18 11-22 12-26 19.0\n+7 Longbow Diana      Bow           -bs- b-bE -  Eb--   1-32  1-32  2-48 19.9\n+7 Snickersnee        Long sword    -s-- E--- s  EbE-  11-27 11-29 12-33 22.5\n+7 Excalibur    (EX)  Long sword    -s-- E--- s  EbE-  11-27 11-31 12-35 23.5\n+7 Cleaver            Axe           -Es- s--s -  -bEs  12-27 13-29 14-33 23.5\n+7 Sceptre of Might   Mace          -sEb s-E- s  -b-b  20-30 18-28 20-32 26.0\n+7 Mjollnir     (MJ)  Hammer        -Es- b-Eb b  -bE-  12-38 11-37 12-41 26.5\n+7 Tsurugi Muramasa   Two-hand swd  -E-- s--- b  EbE-  11-32 13-37 14-41 27.5\n+7 Demonbane          Long sword    -s-- E--- s  EbE-  10-17 10-21 20-44 32.0\n+7 Frost Brand  (FB)  Long sword    -s-- E--- s  EbE-  18-32 18-40 20-44 32.0\n+7 Grayswandir  (GS)  Saber         Eb-b s--- s  bsb-  18-32 18-32 20-56 38.5\n\nSix artifacts are particularly good all-purpose weapons and will be\nconsidered further.  \n\n* Magicbane (MB) has several magical effects (see section above) that\n  make it a good weapon even though it doesn't cause much damage\n  (particularly if you are limiting its enchantment to +2 to maximise\n  its special attacks). Magicbane is also good if you don't have\n  magic resistance or are short of ways to remove curses.\n* Stormbringer (SB) permanently drains levels from monsters --\n  although some species are resistant, including major demons -- and\n  will attack tame or peaceful creatures without confirmation, so it's\n  bad if you're trying to keep a pet.\n* Excalibur (EX) is easy to get if you are lawful (dip a long sword in\n  a fountain), has automatic searching, and is a somewhat effective\n  weapon.\n* Mjollnir (MJ) causes lightning damage, and when thrown by a Valkyrie\n  with strength 25, will usually return to your hand. Being a hammer,\n  it is good for classes who are restricted from blades. However, it\n  may destroy useful wands and rings carried by monsters.\n* Frost Brand (FB) causes cold damage, which makes it an excellent\n  all-around weapon. However, it may freeze useful potions carried by\n  monsters. Although Fire Brand similarly causes fire damage, most\n  major demons are fire-resistant.\n* Grayswandir (GS) doubles most of its damage (working best when fully\n  enchanted) and causes silver damage. Even though Grayswandir causes\n  the most damage to major demons, Frost Brand is slightly better\n  against ordinary large monsters.\n\nThe table below compares these six artifacts for each character CLASS.\nThe EARLY GAME recommendation assumes that you will quickly reach maximum\nskill in the weapon and that the weapon is enchanted to +2, which\nmight be expected from wishing or limited enchantment.  The LATE GAME\nrecommendation assumes that you are maximally skilled and that the weapon\nis enchanted as in the above table.  If a weapon is listed with a slash,\nthis means that several are comparable and the choice may depend on other\nfactors.  An artifact is listed in parentheses if its skill starts as\nrestricted; you will usually want to obtain it or a weapon of its class\nas a divine gift in order to unrestrict the skill before using it.\n\nThe weapons listed include any weapon which could reasonably be the best\nfor that class, as well as weapons which may be obtained without a wish\nand which are close in quality:\n\n* Excalibur is a good weapon early in the game for lawful characters,\n  because it does almost as much damage as Frost Brand and can be\n  obtained without a wish; its lack of double damage makes it inferior\n  later, as Frost Brand's damage and strength bonuses will be doubled.\n* The Staff of Aesculapius and the Tsurugi of Muramasa, Quest\n  Artifacts for Healers and Samurai, are powerful weapons; they have\n  the disadvantage of requiring two hands, but both do more damage\n  early in the game than any other available weapon.  The Tsurugi\n  becomes inferior late in the game, because its damage bonus is not\n  doubled; the Staff is at a disadvantage in Gehennom because it will\n  lose its double damage against level-drain-resistant demons.\n* The Longbow of Diana, Quest Artifact for Rangers, is a highly useful\n  back-up weapon for fighting at a distance, but has the disadvantage\n  of extremely variable damage depending on the vagaries of multiple\n  shots, and the fact that the supply of arrows is unenchanted.\n\n    CLASS  EX  FB  GS  MB  MJ  SB  EARLY GAME      LATE GAME\n    ~~~~~  ~~  ~~  ~~  ~~  ~~  ~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~\n     Arc   -   -   E   b   -   -   GS              GS\n     Bar   s   s   b   b   E   s   MJ              FB\n     Cav   -   -   -   b   s   -   MJ/(FB)/(EX)    (FB)/(GS)/MJ\n     Hea   -   -   b   s   -   -   SoA/MB/(MJ)/GS  SoA/(FB)/GS\n     Kni   E   E   s   b   b   s   FB/MJ/EX        FB\n     Mon   -   -   -   -   -   -   None            None\n     Pri   -   -   -   -   E   -   MJ/(FB)/(EX)    (FB)/MJ/(GS)\n     Ran   -   -   -   E   b   -   MB/LoD          MJ\n     Rog   s   s   s   E   b   s   MJ/SB/MB        FB/GS\n     Sam   E   E   b   b   -   s   ToM/FB/EX       FB\n     Tou   b   b   s   E   b   b   MJ/MB           GS/FB\n     Val   E   E   b   E   E   s   MJ/EX           FB/MJ\n     Wiz   -   -   -   E   -   -   MB              (FB)/(GS)\n\nIt's interesting that Magicbane does so well early in the game; this is\na side effect of the weapon skills.  Even for those classes which don't\nhave it listed, it's a good artifact to wish for because it serves other\nuseful purposes (magic resistance, engraving, and curse resistance).\nIt's a useful weapon to keep as your main weapon after you have killed\nthe Wizard; you can switch to Frost Brand when a lot of nasties appear,\nbecause Magicbane takes a long time to kill them, and powerful creatures\nwill resist Magicbane's special attacks.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks again to David Grabiner.\nCorrections and clarifications provided by Joe Bednorz, Steven Bush,\nAndreas Dorn, Kate Nepveu, Mike Ruskai, Darshan Shaligram, and\nBoudewijn Waijers.\n```\n\n*This page is based on a spoiler by [Dylan O'Donnell](https://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.spod-central.org/%257Epsmith/).

As a weapon,\nit may (depending on the monster's magic resistance saving throw) add\nadditional damage and magical effects.\n\n  ENCHANT  NORMAL  PROBE  STUN   SCARE  SCARE   SCARE   SCARE  AVE DMG\n                                        +STUN  +CANCL  +ST+CN\n  ~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~  ~~~~   ~~~~~  ~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~\n  Damage    2d4     3d4    4d4    4d4    5d4     5d4     6d4      --\n  Ave dmg   5.0     7.5   10.0    10.0   12.5    12.5    15.0     --\n    +0      60%     1.8%  18.2%   0.9%   9.1%    0.9%    9.1%    7.66\n    +1      60%     3.6%  16.4%   1.8%   8.2%    1.8%    8.2%    8.57\n    +2      60%     5.5%  14.5%   2.7%   7.3%    2.7%    7.3%    9.48\n    +3      60%    10.9%  19.1%   1.8%   3.2%    1.8%    3.2%   10.01\n    +4      60%    13.6%  16.4%   2.3%   2.7%    2.3%    2.7%   10.92\n    +5      60%    16.4%  13.6%   2.7%   2.3%    2.7%    2.3%   11.83\n    +6      60%    22.3%  12.7%   3.2%   1.8%      0%      0%   12.49\n    +7      60%    25.5%   9.5%   3.6%   1.4%      0%      0%   13.40\n    +8      60%    28.6%   6.4%   4.1%   0.9%      0%      0%   14.31\n    +9      60%    36.4%   3.6%     0%     0%      0%      0%   15.09\n   more     60%      40%     0%     0%     0%      0%      0%    6.00+bonus\n\nThe above table describes the chance that each of the magical attacks\nwill occur, assuming that the monster fails the magic resistance\nsaving throw it gets to reduce their probability.  The ENCHANTment of\nMagicbane affects these probabilities; note that higher enchantments\nreduce the likelihood of the better attacks. (Negative enchantments\nhave the same probabilities as at +0.)  Even the NORMAL, non-magical\ndamage that occurs 60% of the time has an extra d4 damage above that\nof a normal athame unless the monster resists.  If any magical attacks\noccur, additional d4s of damage are added; at most one of the\nindividual attacks may cause a magical effect as detailed below.\n\nThe PROBE attack usually does nothing special beyond adding the d4 for\nthe magical attack; if no other effect has occurred, there is a 1 in\n(3 * (absolute value of enchantment)) chance that the probe is\ninsightful, giving the effect of a wand of probing. A probe is always\ninsightful if Magicbane is at +0.\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade probes &lt;monster&gt;!\"\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade prods &lt;monster&gt;!\" (hallucinating)\n\nThe STUN attack causes an additional d4 damage; if none of the later\neffects have occurred and been successful, it stuns the monster (or\nyou, for 3 (more) turns, if you are being attacked by Magicbane).\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade stuns &lt;monster&gt;!\"\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade amazes &lt;monster&gt;!\" (hallucinating)\n\nThe SCARE attack causes an additional d4 damage; if not combined with\na CANCEL attack, causes the monster to flee for 3 (more) turns; the\nmonster has a 50% chance of being given an opportunity to resist this\neffect. If you are being attacked by Magicbane and aren't\nmagic-resistant, this effect paralyses you for 3 (more) turns.\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade scares &lt;monster&gt;!\"\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade tickles &lt;monster&gt;!\" (hallucinating)\n\nFinally, the CANCEL attack causes another additional d4 damage and has\nthe same effect as a spell of cancellation (but with a fixed level of\n10 for resistance saving throw purposes). If the monster has the\nability to cast spells, the effect adds one to your current and\nmaximum spell energy. The monster may resist. If you are hit with\nMagicbane and you don't have magic-resistance, you are cancelled and\nlose one current and maximum spell energy.\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade cancels &lt;monster&gt;!\"\n  \"The magic-absorbing blade purges &lt;monster&gt;!\"\n\nIn addition, any magical attack has a 1 in 12 chance of confusing the\ndefender.\n\nThe AVE DMG column in the table above summarizes the expected average\ndamage for each enchantment level; it includes bonuses due to\nenchantment but not to weapon skills (athames are in the dagger\nclass). (Again, note that a monster with a high base magic resistance\nsaving throw may reduce the severity of the attacks that occur, as\nwell as averting the potential magical effects; the quoted figures are\nfor monsters with 0 MR.)  The Damage row lists the amount of damage\neach type of attack causes; the average of each attack type is given\nin the Ave dmg row.\n\nFor those source divers who are interested in how the above values were\nobtained, the following table may help:\n    Enchant      +0   +1   +2   +3   +4   +5   +6   +7   +8   +9   more\n    * Probes/11   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11\n    * Stuns/11   10    9    8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1    0\n    Scare roll    4    4    4    2    2    2    1    1    1    0    0\n    Cancel roll   2    2    2    1    1    1    0    0    0    0    0\n    Die roll 1   Can  Can  Can  Can  Can  Can  Sca  Sca  Sca   *    *\n    Die roll 2   Can  Can  Can  Sca  Sca  Sca   *    *    *    *    *\n    Die roll 3   Sca  Sca  Sca   *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n    Die roll 4   Sca  Sca  Sca   *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n    Roll 5-8      *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n    Roll 9-20    ----------- Normal, non-magical damage -------------\n\nWhat is the best enchantment for Magicbane?  If you simply want to cause\nthe most damage, then the table indicates that you should enchant it as\nhigh as possible (safely to +7).  Fortunately, your odds of magic-\nresistance, curse-resistance, and engraving do not depend upon the\nenchantment.  However, if you want to maximize the best magical attacks\nof this artifact, it should be enchanted to +2.  Note that the only\ndifference in the magical attacks between the +0 and the +2 Magicbane is\na 3.7% change between probing and stunning.\n\nMagicbane is generally not the best weapon for combat, although\nmedium-level characters with good dagger skill and poor skills in other\nweapon may find it their best choice.  Higher-level characters may want\nto wield it as their regular weapon to absorb curses while they are\ntravelling through the dungeon, switching to something else to fight\npowerful monsters.\n\n\nWhich artifact should I choose?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n[Adapted from a spoiler courtesy of David Grabiner.]\n\nIf you get an early wish and decide to use it for a weapon, or if you\nhave accumulated several artifact weapons, which weapon you should wield\ndepends highly on your class because of the class limits on weapon\nskills.\n\nARTIFACT weapons that are worth keeping are listed in the table below.\nSome artifacts are not listed, because they are only effective against\na small subset of monsters.  The SKILL category of each artifact is\nlisted, as well as the maximum skill level for each class (ABCH KMPRaRo\nSTVW): - means restricted to unskilled, b means basic skill, s means\nskilled, and E means expert.  Note that if you receive an artifact as a\ngift by crowning or sacrificing, any restriction on its weapon class will\nbe removed and you will be able to advance to basic skill.\n\nThe table also indicates the damage range of each artifact against\ntypical SMALL creatures, LARGE creatures, and major DEMONs.  The damage\ncalculations assume that the artifact is enchanted as shown, you have\nexpert skill, and that the artifact's special attacks apply to the\nmonster; the Longbow of Diana assumes that you are using normal +0\narrows fired at a rate of up to 4 a round (expert Ranger). Damage\nagainst major demons further assumes that the weapon is blessed and that\nthe demon hates silver, is fire-resistant, and is drain-resistant.\nFinally, the table summarizes the average damage against major demons\n(DAVE), which are often the nastiest creatures in the dungeon. \nMagicbane's actual damage is slightly greater due to its special\nattacks, but it doesn't make a difference here.\n\nARTIFACT              SKILL         ABCH KMPRaRo STVW  SMALL LARGE DEMON DAVE\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~  ~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~\n+2 Magicbane    (MB)  Dagger        bbbs b--E E  bEEE   6-12  6-11  7-15 11.0\n+7 Staff Aesculapius  Quarterstaff  sbEE -bEb -  bbbE  19-36 19-36 12-19 15.5\n+7 Stormbringer (SB)  Broadsword    -s-- s--- s  sbs-  13-27 13-26 12-20 16.0\n+7 Grimtooth          Dagger        bbbs b--E E  bEEE  11-18 11-18 12-22 17.0\n+7 Sunsword           Long sword    -s-- E--- s  EbE-  10-17 10-21 11-25 18.0\n+7 Fire Brand         Long sword    -s-- E--- s  EbE-  18-32 18-40 11-25 18.0\n+7 Vorpal Blade       Long sword    -s-- E--- s  EbE-  11-18 11-22 12-26 19.0\n+7 Longbow Diana      Bow           -bs- b-bE -  Eb--   1-32  1-32  2-48 19.9\n+7 Snickersnee        Long sword    -s-- E--- s  EbE-  11-27 11-29 12-33 22.5\n+7 Excalibur    (EX)  Long sword    -s-- E--- s  EbE-  11-27 11-31 12-35 23.5\n+7 Cleaver            Axe           -Es- s--s -  -bEs  12-27 13-29 14-33 23.5\n+7 Sceptre of Might   Mace          -sEb s-E- s  -b-b  20-30 18-28 20-32 26.0\n+7 Mjollnir     (MJ)  Hammer        -Es- b-Eb b  -bE-  12-38 11-37 12-41 26.5\n+7 Tsurugi Muramasa   Two-hand swd  -E-- s--- b  EbE-  11-32 13-37 14-41 27.5\n+7 Demonbane          Long sword    -s-- E--- s  EbE-  10-17 10-21 20-44 32.0\n+7 Frost Brand  (FB)  Long sword    -s-- E--- s  EbE-  18-32 18-40 20-44 32.0\n+7 Grayswandir  (GS)  Saber         Eb-b s--- s  bsb-  18-32 18-32 20-56 38.5\n\nSix artifacts are particularly good all-purpose weapons and will be\nconsidered further.  \n\n* Magicbane (MB) has several magical effects (see section above) that\n  make it a good weapon even though it doesn't cause much damage\n  (particularly if you are limiting its enchantment to +2 to maximise\n  its special attacks). Magicbane is also good if you don't have\n  magic resistance or are short of ways to remove curses.\n* Stormbringer (SB) permanently drains levels from monsters --\n  although some species are resistant, including major demons -- and\n  will attack tame or peaceful creatures without confirmation, so it's\n  bad if you're trying to keep a pet.\n* Excalibur (EX) is easy to get if you are lawful (dip a long sword in\n  a fountain), has automatic searching, and is a somewhat effective\n  weapon.\n* Mjollnir (MJ) causes lightning damage, and when thrown by a Valkyrie\n  with strength 25, will usually return to your hand. Being a hammer,\n  it is good for classes who are restricted from blades. However, it\n  may destroy useful wands and rings carried by monsters.\n* Frost Brand (FB) causes cold damage, which makes it an excellent\n  all-around weapon. However, it may freeze useful potions carried by\n  monsters. Although Fire Brand similarly causes fire damage, most\n  major demons are fire-resistant.\n* Grayswandir (GS) doubles most of its damage (working best when fully\n  enchanted) and causes silver damage. Even though Grayswandir causes\n  the most damage to major demons, Frost Brand is slightly better\n  against ordinary large monsters.\n\nThe table below compares these six artifacts for each character CLASS.\nThe EARLY GAME recommendation assumes that you will quickly reach maximum\nskill in the weapon and that the weapon is enchanted to +2, which\nmight be expected from wishing or limited enchantment.  The LATE GAME\nrecommendation assumes that you are maximally skilled and that the weapon\nis enchanted as in the above table.  If a weapon is listed with a slash,\nthis means that several are comparable and the choice may depend on other\nfactors.  An artifact is listed in parentheses if its skill starts as\nrestricted; you will usually want to obtain it or a weapon of its class\nas a divine gift in order to unrestrict the skill before using it.\n\nThe weapons listed include any weapon which could reasonably be the best\nfor that class, as well as weapons which may be obtained without a wish\nand which are close in quality:\n\n* Excalibur is a good weapon early in the game for lawful characters,\n  because it does almost as much damage as Frost Brand and can be\n  obtained without a wish; its lack of double damage makes it inferior\n  later, as Frost Brand's damage and strength bonuses will be doubled.\n* The Staff of Aesculapius and the Tsurugi of Muramasa, Quest\n  Artifacts for Healers and Samurai, are powerful weapons; they have\n  the disadvantage of requiring two hands, but both do more damage\n  early in the game than any other available weapon.  The Tsurugi\n  becomes inferior late in the game, because its damage bonus is not\n  doubled; the Staff is at a disadvantage in Gehennom because it will\n  lose its double damage against level-drain-resistant demons.\n* The Longbow of Diana, Quest Artifact for Rangers, is a highly useful\n  back-up weapon for fighting at a distance, but has the disadvantage\n  of extremely variable damage depending on the vagaries of multiple\n  shots, and the fact that the supply of arrows is unenchanted.\n\n    CLASS  EX  FB  GS  MB  MJ  SB  EARLY GAME      LATE GAME\n    ~~~~~  ~~  ~~  ~~  ~~  ~~  ~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~\n     Arc   -   -   E   b   -   -   GS              GS\n     Bar   s   s   b   b   E   s   MJ              FB\n     Cav   -   -   -   b   s   -   MJ/(FB)/(EX)    (FB)/(GS)/MJ\n     Hea   -   -   b   s   -   -   SoA/MB/(MJ)/GS  SoA/(FB)/GS\n     Kni   E   E   s   b   b   s   FB/MJ/EX        FB\n     Mon   -   -   -   -   -   -   None            None\n     Pri   -   -   -   -   E   -   MJ/(FB)/(EX)    (FB)/MJ/(GS)\n     Ran   -   -   -   E   b   -   MB/LoD          MJ\n     Rog   s   s   s   E   b   s   MJ/SB/MB        FB/GS\n     Sam   E   E   b   b   -   s   ToM/FB/EX       FB\n     Tou   b   b   s   E   b   b   MJ/MB           GS/FB\n     Val   E   E   b   E   E   s   MJ/EX           FB/MJ\n     Wiz   -   -   -   E   -   -   MB              (FB)/(GS)\n\nIt's interesting that Magicbane does so well early in the game; this is\na side effect of the weapon skills.  Even for those classes which don't\nhave it listed, it's a good artifact to wish for because it serves other\nuseful purposes (magic resistance, engraving, and curse resistance).\nIt's a useful weapon to keep as your main weapon after you have killed\nthe Wizard; you can switch to Frost Brand when a lot of nasties appear,\nbecause Magicbane takes a long time to kill them, and powerful creatures\nwill resist Magicbane's special attacks.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks again to David Grabiner.\nCorrections and clarifications provided by Joe Bednorz, Steven Bush,\nAndreas Dorn, Kate Nepveu, Mike Ruskai, Darshan Shaligram, and\nBoudewijn Waijers.\n</pre>\n<div class=\"license_dod\">\n<p><i>This page is based on a spoiler by <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.spod-central.org/%257Epsmith/\">Dylan O'Donnell</a>.

{"title":"Why do I keep dying?","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Why_do_I_keep_dying%3F","type":"markdown","data":"This page is an attempt to provide basic tips for survival and it specifically describes typical beginner misconceptions regarding *[NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\")*. It is aimed at new players who feel like they can't get the hang of it and [die](/wiki/Die \"Die\") early every game, so it will focus on the [early game](/wiki/Early_game \"Early game\") stage and deliberately ignore *NetHack*'s abundant corner cases. Follow the links if you want a complete [strategy](/wiki/Strategy \"Strategy\") overview.\n\nIt is assumed you have played (and died) a couple of dozen times and know how to open [doors](/wiki/Door \"Door\") and do simple stuff like that. If you are still wondering what the funny @ means, then first have a look at the excellent [Guidebook](/wiki/Guidebook \"Guidebook\") that comes with *NetHack*, play a few games to get the feel of it, *read the Guidebook again*—picking up the numerous hints you will have overlooked during the first reading—then come back here.\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 The one good game](#The_one_good_game)\n- [2 Moving fast, typing slowly](#Moving_fast.2C_typing_slowly)\n- [3 Traps](#Traps)\n- [4 Finding down](#Finding_down)\n- [5 Monsters too tough?](#Monsters_too_tough.3F)\n- [6 Drinking water](#Drinking_water)\n- [7 Eating](#Eating)\n- [8 Praying](#Praying)\n- [9 Watching your pet](#Watching_your_pet)\n- [10 Identifying](#Identifying)\n- [11 See also](#See_also)\n- [12 External links](#External_links)\n\n## The one good game\n\nYou sometimes hear that *NetHack* is near impossible to [win](/wiki/Win \"Win\"), because of the amount of exceptional good die rools that are required to win: it takes years to get just one good game, with an early [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\") and having everything else work out just right. That is a myth!\n\n**If your survival depends on luck then you are following the wrong strategy.** True, a few unavoidable deaths remain, like falling into a [poisoned spiked pit](/wiki/Spiked_pit \"Spiked pit\"), or the proverbial [Gnome With the Wand of Death](/wiki/Gnome_With_the_Wand_of_Death \"Gnome With the Wand of Death\"), but these are threatening only early, before [countermeasures](/wiki/Property \"Property\") have been acquired. Truly outstanding players (such as [Marvin](/wiki/Marvin \"Marvin\")) manage to [ascend](/wiki/Ascend \"Ascend\") 80% of their games, and they do not get more wands of wishing than the rest of us. A large part of learning to play NetHack is acquiring safe habits.\n\n## Moving fast, typing slowly\n\n**Never explore while [Burdened](/wiki/Burdened \"Burdened\") or worse.** [Speed](/wiki/Speed \"Speed\") is a major issue. When you are *Stressed*, your average opponent can hit twice for your every chance to move, and your [HP](/wiki/HP \"HP\") will just melt away. (If you do need to haul around heavy [stashes](/wiki/Stash \"Stash\") of equipment, stick to known territory and be ready to shed weight at the sight of danger.) In such occasions, a [wand of speed monster](/wiki/Wand_of_speed_monster \"Wand of speed monster\") or [speed boots](/wiki/Speed_boots \"Speed boots\") are a big advantage, allowing *you* to hit (or escape) faster.\n\nDo not use the arrow keys, because they provide only orthogonal [movement](/wiki/Direction \"Direction\"), requiring twice as many steps to reach a diagonal destination. If the vi-like ([yuhjklbn](/wiki/Yuhjklbn \"Yuhjklbn\")) keys do not suit you, make a habit of using the [number pad](/wiki/Options#number_pad \"Options\") instead. [Take advantage of diagonal movement keys.](/wiki/Movement_tactics#Diagonal_movement \"Movement tactics\")\n\nAt the same time, type slowly and deliberately. You cannot run away more quickly from [monsters](/wiki/Monster \"Monster\") by typing more quickly! Additionally, **never hold down a key for autorepeat.** When you hold down a key, you often stumble into something and try to attack or pass it faster than you can release the key. Instead, make use of the [G](/wiki/G \"G\"), [g](/wiki/G \"G\"), capital YUHJKLBN, and numpad [5](/wiki/5 \"5\") commands to go in one direction until you discover something interesting. Also useful is [\\_](/wiki/Underscore \"Underscore\").\n\nIf you are running low on health and there are no monsters in the vicinity, rest and wait for your health to come back. The [.](/wiki/Dot \"Dot\") command will let you rest for a number of turns that you can specify. You will stop resting as soon as anything dangerous (or interesting) comes along.\n\nYou may also find it useful to [take notes](/wiki/Notetaking \"Notetaking\") on what you are doing. Besides the information's usefulness, it encourages you to be thoughtful.\n\nBeginners should also play purposefully: \"just exploring\", in the long run, is the same as \"just running around until you get killed\". If you find yourself doing this, look at your equipment and status to see what your immediate [goals](/wiki/Standard_strategy#Goals \"Standard strategy\") should be: \"I need an effective projectile weapon\", \"I need to get my armor class down\", \"I need to identify this magic stuff I've collected\", \"I need fire/cold/magic resistance before I go much further\" ... whatever's appropriate at the moment. Thinking this way will improve your game rapidly.\n\n## Traps\n\nOn dungeon level 1, every deadly trap has an automatically generated corpse on it.[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1) This decreases by 25% with each Dlvl, meaning that Dlvl 5 and below will never have traps with an auto-corpse. However, while you're on the level a monster may stumble onto a trap and die, so if you see a mysterious corpse that you didn't kill, beware.\n\nIf you're caught in a [bear trap](/wiki/Bear_trap \"Bear trap\"), you can escape five times faster by trying to move diagonally.[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2)\n\nDarts, arrows, and rocks on the ground. Beware, these may be traps.\n\nIf \"you hear rumbling in the distance\", there is a rolling boulder trap ready to do d20 damage to anything in its path.\n\nDarts and spiked pits have a chance of being poisoned and can cause insta-death. Since it takes a while to gain intrinsic [poison resistance](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\") or identify the necessary jewelry, an [alchemy smock](/wiki/Alchemy_smock \"Alchemy smock\") is a great find in the early game. (If this is a frequent problem for you, it may be worth trying playing a [barbarian](/wiki/Barbarian \"Barbarian\") as your first role, since they get poison resistance at [level](/wiki/Experience_level \"Experience level\") 1.)\n\n## Finding down\n\n**Every room has a way out.** If none is apparent, [search](/wiki/Search \"Search\") for it by hitting [s](/wiki/S \"S\") on every step along the [wall](/wiki/Wall \"Wall\") or at the dead end of a [corridor](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")—it may take you ten times or so before finding a secret door or passage, though. If all [doors](/wiki/Door \"Door\") are [locked](/wiki/Locked \"Locked\") and you have no other means to open them, [kick](/wiki/Kick \"Kick\") them down—but this is noisy and will wake sleeping monsters. If you kick down the door of a shop, the owner will attack. You can avoid kicking down shop doors by simply making sure that the dust in front of the door does not say \"[closed for inventory](/wiki/Closed_for_inventory \"Closed for inventory\")\".\n\n**Every level has a way down.** (There are exceptions, but not in the early dungeon.) Look on the map for a large, empty area where an additional, undiscovered [room](/wiki/Room \"Room\") might fit and search (as above) along adjacent walls or suspiciously shaped corridors. Or the [stairs](/wiki/Stairs \"Stairs\") could be covered by an [item](/wiki/Item \"Item\")—yes, NetHack does have mighty big [fortune cookies](/wiki/Fortune_cookie \"Fortune cookie\")! If a monster is sitting on top of the stairs, you will see them as soon as the monster is out of sight. If you're pretty sure you've explored the whole level and still don't see any stairs, use the #[terrain](/wiki/Terrain \"Terrain\") command to view the map without monsters or objects. Pressing [\\_](/wiki/Underscore \"Underscore\")[>](/wiki/Angle_bracket \"Angle bracket\") will also show the stairs since [Nethack 3.6.0](/wiki/Nethack_3.6.0 \"Nethack 3.6.0\") even if there are objects on top of them.\n\n## Monsters too tough?\n\nAs you go deeper in the dungeon and level up, monsters that generate become more powerful. Monsters that can generate are determined by the average of your experience level and your dungeon level; see [Monsters (by difficulty)](/wiki/Monsters_\\(by_difficulty\\) \"Monsters (by difficulty)\") for details. Even if you keep your experience level relatively low, you can still encounter difficult monsters as you venture deeper into the dungeon. If you are in a particularly deep area or a dangerous level such as the [Oracle level](/wiki/Oracle_\\(level\\) \"Oracle (level)\"), it may be in your best interest not to linger. Come back when you're more experienced or better equipped.\n\n## Drinking water\n\n**Don't.** A beginner who starved a couple of times might get the idea that drinking was also necessary. Unfortunately the Guidebook's advice on this matter is misleading (\"Although creatures can survive long periods of time without food, there is a physiological need for water\"). However, your character can in fact survive the whole game without drinking *anything*.\n\nThere is no need to drink water. In fact, [quaffing](/wiki/Quaff \"Quaff\") [potions of water](/wiki/Potions_of_water \"Potions of water\") is a big waste of resources; you are much better off saving them to turn into [holy water](/wiki/Potion_of_holy_water \"Potion of holy water\"). Drinking from [fountains](/wiki/Fountain \"Fountain\") is downright dangerous, since many bad effects can occur. True, if you are exceptionally fortunate you might get an early wish, or some other benefit, but the chances are tiny. Much more likely, you will get nasty hostile monsters—[water nymphs](/wiki/Water_nymph \"Water nymph\"), [water demons](/wiki/Water_demon \"Water demon\"), or swarms of [water moccasins](/wiki/Water_moccasin \"Water moccasin\").\n\n## Eating\n\nEating [corpses](/wiki/Corpse \"Corpse\") feels like Russian roulette. A [kobold](/wiki/Kobold \"Kobold\") will poison you. A [jackal](/wiki/Jackal \"Jackal\") \"tastes terrible\" but seems OK. But if you save another one for later, it'll give you deadly food poisoning. If you decide that eating corpses off the [floor](/wiki/Floor \"Floor\") is uncivilized anyway and vow to stick to proper \"people food\", you'll probably starve before finding any.\n\nFirst, understand that there are two separate kinds of poisoning that you can get from food. The first is [food poisoning](/wiki/Food_poisoning \"Food poisoning\") (\"FoodPois\"), contracted from eating old (\"tainted\") corpses. This will always kill you, but avoiding it is simple: **Eat your corpses fresh.** 60 [turns](/wiki/Turn \"Turn\") is the limit! Only [lichens](/wiki/Lichen \"Lichen\"), [lizards](/wiki/Lizard \"Lizard\"), and corpses kept in an [ice box](/wiki/Ice_box \"Ice box\") do not age. By the same logic, remember that [zombies](/wiki/Zombie \"Zombie\") and other [undead](/wiki/Undead \"Undead\") died long before you met them: they are walking food poisoning. If your pet kills an enemy out of sight and leaves a dwarf corpse, it was probably a [dwarf zombie](/wiki/Dwarf_zombie \"Dwarf zombie\"); otherwise your pet would have eaten it.\n\nThe second kind is \"regular\" [poison](/wiki/Poison \"Poison\"), which is simply a property of some monster types (e.g. kobolds). **Corpses your pet [dog](/wiki/Dog \"Dog\") or [cat](/wiki/Cat \"Cat\") will eat are safe** (with very few exceptions). Eating a poisonous corpse will lower your [stats](/wiki/Attribute \"Attribute\") and HP, though it won't kill you directly. Unlike food poisoning, you *can* become [resistant](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\") to this type, and in fact you should as soon as possible. This will also protect against spiked pits, the poisoned arrows of [Uruk-hai](/wiki/Uruk-hai \"Uruk-hai\"), and other sudden deaths. [Barbarians](/wiki/Barbarian \"Barbarian\"), [Healers](/wiki/Healer \"Healer\"), and [orc](/wiki/Orc_\\(starting_race\\) \"Orc (starting race)\") characters start out resistant, while [Monks](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\") gain the resistance at level 3; all others are safe as soon as \"you feel healthy\". (Watch out for other \"[you feel](/wiki/You_feel \"You feel\")\" messages, too, and learn their sources and effects.)\n\nRemember: [*NetHack* is not real life](/wiki/NetHack_is_not_real_life \"NetHack is not real life\"). Though most of us would not eat a [sewer rat](/wiki/Sewer_rat \"Sewer rat\") or an uncooked jackal corpse, and would get ill if we did, it is not an issue for your character. Unless there is something intrinsically harmful about a particular corpse, such as the poisonous kobold or the instantly petrifying [cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\"), and unless it is more than 60 turns dead, it will probably be safe for consumption.\n\nThere is also \"proper\" [food](/wiki/Food \"Food\"), of course: [Eggs](/wiki/Egg \"Egg\") and [tripe rations](/wiki/Tripe_ration \"Tripe ration\") are best left for pets, and keep the rest for hard times. In the [roguelike](/wiki/Roguelike \"Roguelike\") community, such food is called \"permafood\", because it never rots.\n\nFinally, if you are already at weak levels of [nutrition](/wiki/Nutrition \"Nutrition\") (or worse, fainting), you can also #[pray](/wiki/Pray \"Pray\"). You must take care not to anger your [god](/wiki/God \"God\"), but if you really want to, [it is quite possible to survive on prayer alone](/wiki/Foodless \"Foodless\").\n\n## Praying\n\nMost real-life religions encourage you to pray regularly. But the Guidebook states clearly that you pray to the gods *for help*. The *NetHack* gods will be perfectly happy never to hear from you. If they regard you as constantly whining, they might become [angry](/wiki/Anger \"Anger\") and eventually decide to [put you out of your misery](/wiki/Wide-angle_disintegration_beam \"Wide-angle disintegration beam\") and send someone worthier to fetch the [Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor \"Amulet of Yendor\") for them.\n\n**Used sparingly, prayer can get you out of tight spots.** Before praying again, wait around 700–1400 turns, [the longer the better](/wiki/Prayer_timeout \"Prayer timeout\"). [Sacrifice](/wiki/Sacrifice \"Sacrifice\") can shorten the time, and it may also get you [gifts](/wiki/Gifts \"Gifts\").\n\n## Watching your pet\n\nWatching what corpses your cats and dogs eat will help you figure out which are safe—[horses](/wiki/Horse \"Horse\") will not eat meat, and they can help you figure out which *vegetarian* corpses are safe (see [diet](/wiki/Diet \"Diet\")). But there is more that your pet can do for you:\n\nFinding better equipment is vital (see \"Leveling up\" above), but you must not [W](/wiki/W \"W\")[ear](/wiki/Wear \"Wear\"), [w](/wiki/W \"W\")[ield](/wiki/Wield \"Wield\") or [P](/wiki/P \"P\")[ut on](/wiki/Put_on \"Put on\") anything that might be [cursed](/wiki/BUC \"BUC\"), and [altars](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\") for ascertaining that are scarce. Fortunately, your pet can indicate whether an item is cursed: just drop it on the floor where you can see it and wait. **Pets will step on cursed items only reluctantly, if at all.** If a pet walks over or picks up an item without a message appearing, it is safe to try on. Early on, [pet-test](/wiki/Curse-testing#Pet_testing \"Curse-testing\") most of the [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\") you find, to get your [AC](/wiki/AC \"AC\") as low as you can.\n\nFurthermore, your pet can kill a [nymph](/wiki/Nymph \"Nymph\") before she can rob you or kill a peaceful coaligned [unicorn](/wiki/Unicorn \"Unicorn\") that you must not desecrate yourself. Eventually, your pet's natural aggression may get it killed by the [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\") [watch captain](/wiki/Watch_captain \"Watch captain\") (a large dog or cat will attack watchmen) or a [shopkeeper](/wiki/Shopkeeper \"Shopkeeper\") (warhorses attack these), so keep it away from these powerful monsters or [polymorph it](/wiki/Polymorph#Pets \"Polymorph\").\n\n## Identifying\n\nBoldly [r](/wiki/R \"R\")[eading](/wiki/Reading \"Reading\"), [q](/wiki/Q \"Q\")[uaffing](/wiki/Quaffing \"Quaffing\") and [z](/wiki/Z \"Z\")[apping](/wiki/Zapping \"Zapping\") everything you find is the obvious method of [identification](/wiki/Identification \"Identification\")—and it is ridiculously, suicidally dangerous, so **do not do it!** Here is a quick summary of the item classes:\n\n[Armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\"), [weapons](/wiki/Weapon \"Weapon\") and [amulets](/wiki/Amulet \"Amulet\") are actually quite safe to try on after [curse-testing](/wiki/Curse-testing \"Curse-testing\") them with your pet. A few items will [autocurse](/wiki/Autocurse \"Autocurse\"), but they are rare and not life-threatening. Make sure you are capable of [p](/wiki/P \"P\")[aying](/wiki/Paying \"Paying\") for the item if you decide to try it on in a shop, though.\n\n[Rings](/wiki/Ring \"Ring\") are also safe if curse-tested, with three complications: [conflict](/wiki/Ring_of_conflict \"Ring of conflict\"), [polymorph](/wiki/Ring_of_polymorph \"Ring of polymorph\"), and [teleportation](/wiki/Ring_of_teleportation \"Ring of teleportation\"). Never try them near a [shop](/wiki/Shop \"Shop\") or if your pet is powerful enough to kill you in one hit. If you're really afraid of a polymorph, take off your torso armor. Remove the ring immediately on the next turn to keep the chance of anything going wrong to a minimum, unless you think you can handle being polymorphed or teleported around. Often, putting on a ring will tell you nothing and you will have to identify it by some other means anyway.\n\n[Wands](/wiki/Wand \"Wand\") are fun. Write *Elbereth* with your finger (to exercise [Wisdom](/wiki/Wisdom \"Wisdom\")), then add to the engraving with a wand. Most will identify or at least give you hints. Six wands [give no message at all](/wiki/Engrave-test \"Engrave-test\"), are not particularly powerful, and can be further identified with a few common items. **Never, ever put wands that make engravings vanish in your [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\")** until you are absolutely sure the wand is a [wand of teleportation](/wiki/Wand_of_teleportation \"Wand of teleportation\") or a [wand of make invisible](/wiki/Wand_of_make_invisible \"Wand of make invisible\"), and not a [wand of cancellation](/wiki/Wand_of_cancellation \"Wand of cancellation\")—otherwise you will blow up your bag of holding and all of its contents.\n\n[Potions](/wiki/Potion \"Potion\") are trickier. [Potions of water](/wiki/Potions_of_water \"Potions of water\") are clear. [Potions of oil](/wiki/Potions_of_oil \"Potions of oil\") light up when [applied](/wiki/Apply \"Apply\"). By dipping some junk [darts](/wiki/Dart \"Dart\") or [arrows](/wiki/Arrow \"Arrow\") you may discover the [potion of polymorph](/wiki/Potion_of_polymorph \"Potion of polymorph\") and the [potion of sickness](/wiki/Potion_of_sickness \"Potion of sickness\"). Dipping a [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\") will turn [three other harmful potions](/wiki/Unicorn_horn#Potion_identification \"Unicorn horn\") into water. Finally, you have to rule out the potions of [sleep](/wiki/Potion_of_sleep \"Potion of sleep\") and [paralysis](/wiki/Potion_of_paralysis \"Potion of paralysis\"). Monsters may throw them at you, and you can also quaff-test them by being [sleep resistant](/wiki/Sleep_resistance \"Sleep resistance\") and wearing a [ring of free action](/wiki/Ring_of_free_action \"Ring of free action\"). All other potions are safe to quaff, provided that they are not cursed.\n\n[Scrolls](/wiki/Scroll \"Scroll\") are candidates for [price identification](/wiki/Price_identification \"Price identification\"), a complex and wearisome process. Fortunately, some of the most useful early-game scrolls are cheap and easy to price-identify. Drop the scroll at a [shop](/wiki/Shop \"Shop\") (but don't actually sell it), and multiply the shopkeeper's offer by 2 (or 3 if you [look like a tourist](/wiki/Shirt \"Shirt\")) to get the *base price*. (Some shopkeepers will offer only 3⁄4 of the normal selling price for unidentified items, however.) The [scroll of identify](/wiki/Scroll_of_identify \"Scroll of identify\") is the most easily recognizable, the most common, and the cheapest, with a base price of 20. The mostly useless [scroll of light](/wiki/Scroll_of_light \"Scroll of light\") has a base price of 50, and the [scroll of enchant weapon](/wiki/Scroll_of_enchant_weapon \"Scroll of enchant weapon\") has a base price of 60. The [scroll of remove curse](/wiki/Scroll_of_remove_curse \"Scroll of remove curse\") and the [scroll of enchant armor](/wiki/Scroll_of_enchant_armor \"Scroll of enchant armor\") both have a base price of 80. Several other scrolls can be identified from other factors:\n\n- Monsters will only ever read scrolls of [teleportation](/wiki/Scroll_of_teleportation \"Scroll of teleportation\"), [create monster](/wiki/Scroll_of_create_monster \"Scroll of create monster\"), and (rarely) [earth](/wiki/Scroll_of_earth \"Scroll of earth\"), which have obvious effects.\n- The scroll of teleportation is the only one that will be generated in [closets](/wiki/Closet \"Closet\"), so it is the only one you may see lying on the ground outside a room.\n- The two scrolls on the first level of [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") are [scrolls of earth](/wiki/Scroll_of_earth \"Scroll of earth\").\n- A [scroll of scare monster](/wiki/Scroll_of_scare_monster \"Scroll of scare monster\") will be placed under the Sokoban prize, and it can also be observed from its effect on peaceful monsters. If a pet or a shopkeeper \"turns to flee\" for no apparent reason, you're standing on one.\n\nThe other scrolls are too complicated or risky to try out, so just read a blessed scroll of identify when you've collected enough.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Standard strategy](/wiki/Standard_strategy \"Standard strategy\")\n- [Standard strategy (SLASH'EM)](/wiki/Standard_strategy_\\(SLASH%27EM\\) \"Standard strategy (SLASH'EM)\")\n- [Role difficulty](/wiki/Role_difficulty \"Role difficulty\")\n- [Game stages](/wiki/Game_stages \"Game stages\")\n- [Notetaking](/wiki/Notetaking \"Notetaking\")\n\n## External links\n\n- [Guidebook for *NetHack* 3.6.1](https://www.nethack.org/v361/Guidebook.html)\n\n[![This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.1.

Truly outstanding players (such as <a href=\"/wiki/Marvin\" title=\"Marvin\">Marvin</a>) manage to <a href=\"/wiki/Ascend\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ascend\">ascend</a> 80% of their games, and they do not get more wands of wishing than the rest of us. A large part of learning to play NetHack is acquiring safe habits.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Moving_fast,_typing_slowly\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Moving_fast.2C_typing_slowly\">Moving fast, typing slowly</span></h2>\n<p><b>Never explore while <a href=\"/wiki/Burdened\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Burdened\">Burdened</a> or worse.</b> <a href=\"/wiki/Speed\" title=\"Speed\">Speed</a> is a major issue. When you are <i>Stressed</i>, your average opponent can hit twice for your every chance to move, and your <a href=\"/wiki/HP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HP\">HP</a> will just melt away. (If you do need to haul around heavy <a href=\"/wiki/Stash\" title=\"Stash\">stashes</a> of equipment, stick to known territory and be ready to shed weight at the sight of danger.) In such occasions, a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_speed_monster\" title=\"Wand of speed monster\">wand of speed monster</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Speed_boots\" title=\"Speed boots\">speed boots</a> are a big advantage, allowing <i>you</i> to hit (or escape) faster.\n</p><p>Do not use the arrow keys, because they provide only orthogonal <a href=\"/wiki/Direction\" title=\"Direction\">movement</a>, requiring twice as many steps to reach a diagonal destination. If the vi-like (<a href=\"/wiki/Yuhjklbn\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yuhjklbn\">yuhjklbn</a>) keys do not suit you, make a habit of using the <a href=\"/wiki/Options#number_pad\" title=\"Options\">number pad</a> instead. <a href=\"/wiki/Movement_tactics#Diagonal_movement\" title=\"Movement tactics\">Take advantage of diagonal movement keys.</a>\n</p><p>At the same time, type slowly and deliberately. You cannot run away more quickly from <a href=\"/wiki/Monster\" title=\"Monster\">monsters</a> by typing more quickly! Additionally, <b>never hold down a key for autorepeat.</b> When you hold down a key, you often stumble into something and try to attack or pass it faster than you can release the key. Instead, make use of the <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/G\" title=\"G\">G</a></span></span>, <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/G\" title=\"G\">g</a></span></span>, capital YUHJKLBN, and numpad <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/5\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"5\">5</a></span></span> commands to go in one direction until you discover something interesting. Also useful is <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/Underscore\" title=\"Underscore\">_</a></span></span>. \n</p><p>If you are running low on health and there are no monsters in the vicinity, rest and wait for your health to come back. The <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/Dot\" title=\"Dot\">.</a></span></span> command will let you rest for a number of turns that you can specify. You will stop resting as soon as anything dangerous (or interesting) comes along. \n</p><p>You may also find it useful to <a href=\"/wiki/Notetaking\" title=\"Notetaking\">take notes</a> on what you are doing.  Besides the information's usefulness, it encourages you to be thoughtful.\n</p><p>Beginners should also play purposefully: \"just exploring\", in the long run, is the same as \"just running around until you get killed\". If you find yourself doing this, look at your equipment and status to see what your immediate <a href=\"/wiki/Standard_strategy#Goals\" title=\"Standard strategy\">goals</a> should be: \"I need an effective projectile weapon\", \"I need to get my armor class down\", \"I need to identify this magic stuff I've collected\", \"I need fire/cold/magic resistance before I go much further\" ... whatever's appropriate at the moment. Thinking this way will improve your game rapidly.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Traps\">Traps</span></h2>\n<p>On dungeon level 1, every deadly trap has an automatically generated corpse on it.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> This decreases by 25% with each Dlvl, meaning that Dlvl 5 and below will never have traps with an auto-corpse. However, while you're on the level a monster may stumble onto a trap and die, so if you see a mysterious corpse that you didn't kill, beware.\n</p><p>If you're caught in a <a href=\"/wiki/Bear_trap\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bear trap\">bear trap</a>, you can escape five times faster by trying to move diagonally.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Darts, arrows, and rocks on the ground. Beware, these may be traps.\n</p><p>If \"you hear rumbling in the distance\", there is a rolling boulder trap ready to do d20 damage to anything in its path.\n</p><p>Darts and spiked pits have a chance of being poisoned and can cause insta-death. Since it takes a while to gain intrinsic <a href=\"/wiki/Poison_resistance\" title=\"Poison resistance\">poison resistance</a> or identify the necessary jewelry, an <a href=\"/wiki/Alchemy_smock\" title=\"Alchemy smock\">alchemy smock</a> is a great find in the early game. (If this is a frequent problem for you, it may be worth trying playing a <a href=\"/wiki/Barbarian\" title=\"Barbarian\">barbarian</a> as your first role, since they get poison resistance at <a href=\"/wiki/Experience_level\" title=\"Experience level\">level</a> 1.)\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Finding_down\">Finding down</span></h2>\n<p><b>Every room has a way out.</b> If none is apparent, <a href=\"/wiki/Search\" title=\"Search\">search</a> for it by hitting <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/S\" title=\"S\">s</a></span></span> on every step along the <a href=\"/wiki/Wall\" title=\"Wall\">wall</a> or at the dead end of a <a href=\"/wiki/Corridor\" title=\"Corridor\">corridor</a>—it may take you ten times or so before finding a secret door or passage, though. If all <a href=\"/wiki/Door\" title=\"Door\">doors</a> are <a href=\"/wiki/Locked\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Locked\">locked</a> and you have no other means to open them, <a href=\"/wiki/Kick\" title=\"Kick\">kick</a> them down—but this is noisy and will wake sleeping monsters. If you kick down the door of a shop, the owner will attack. You can avoid kicking down shop doors by simply making sure that the dust in front of the door does not say \"<a href=\"/wiki/Closed_for_inventory\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Closed for inventory\">closed for inventory</a>\".\n</p><p><b>Every level has a way down.</b> (There are exceptions, but not in the early dungeon.) Look on the map for a large, empty area where an additional, undiscovered <a href=\"/wiki/Room\" title=\"Room\">room</a> might fit and search (as above) along adjacent walls or suspiciously shaped corridors. Or the <a href=\"/wiki/Stairs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stairs\">stairs</a> could be covered by an <a href=\"/wiki/Item\" title=\"Item\">item</a>—yes, NetHack does have mighty big <a href=\"/wiki/Fortune_cookie\" title=\"Fortune cookie\">fortune cookies</a>! If a monster is sitting on top of the stairs, you will see them as soon as the monster is out of sight. If you're pretty sure you've explored the whole level and still don't see any stairs, use the #<a href=\"/wiki/Terrain\" title=\"Terrain\">terrain</a> command to view the map without monsters or objects. Pressing <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/Underscore\" title=\"Underscore\">_</a></span></span><span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/Angle_bracket\" title=\"Angle bracket\">&gt;</a></span></span> will also show the stairs since <a href=\"/wiki/Nethack_3.6.0\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nethack 3.6.0\">Nethack 3.6.0</a> even if there are objects on top of them.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Monsters_too_tough?\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Monsters_too_tough.3F\">Monsters too tough?</span></h2>\n<p>As you go deeper in the dungeon and level up, monsters that generate become more powerful. Monsters that can generate are determined by the average of your experience level and your dungeon level; see <a href=\"/wiki/Monsters_(by_difficulty)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Monsters (by difficulty)\">Monsters (by difficulty)</a> for details. Even if you keep your experience level relatively low, you can still encounter difficult monsters as you venture deeper into the dungeon. If you are in a particularly deep area or a dangerous level such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Oracle_(level)\" title=\"Oracle (level)\">Oracle level</a>, it may be in your best interest not to linger. Come back when you're more experienced or better equipped.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drinking_water\">Drinking water</span></h2>\n<p><b>Don't.</b> A beginner who starved a couple of times might get the idea that drinking was also necessary. Unfortunately the Guidebook's advice on this matter is misleading (\"Although creatures can survive long periods of time without food, there is a physiological need for water\"). However, your character can in fact survive the whole game without drinking <i>anything</i>.\n</p><p>There is no need to drink water. In fact, <a href=\"/wiki/Quaff\" title=\"Quaff\">quaffing</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Potions_of_water\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Potions of water\">potions of water</a> is a big waste of resources; you are much better off saving them to turn into <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_holy_water\" title=\"Potion of holy water\">holy water</a>. Drinking from <a href=\"/wiki/Fountain\" title=\"Fountain\">fountains</a> is downright dangerous, since many bad effects can occur. True, if you are exceptionally fortunate you might get an early wish, or some other benefit, but the chances are tiny. Much more likely, you will get nasty hostile monsters—<a href=\"/wiki/Water_nymph\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Water nymph\">water nymphs</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Water_demon\" title=\"Water demon\">water demons</a>, or swarms of <a href=\"/wiki/Water_moccasin\" title=\"Water moccasin\">water moccasins</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Eating\">Eating</span></h2>\n<p>Eating <a href=\"/wiki/Corpse\" title=\"Corpse\">corpses</a> feels like Russian roulette. A <a href=\"/wiki/Kobold\" title=\"Kobold\">kobold</a> will poison you. A <a href=\"/wiki/Jackal\" title=\"Jackal\">jackal</a> \"tastes terrible\" but seems OK. But if you save another one for later, it'll give you deadly food poisoning. If you decide that eating corpses off the <a href=\"/wiki/Floor\" title=\"Floor\">floor</a> is uncivilized anyway and vow to stick to proper \"people food\", you'll probably starve before finding any.\n</p><p>First, understand that there are two separate kinds of poisoning that you can get from food. The first is <a href=\"/wiki/Food_poisoning\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Food poisoning\">food poisoning</a> (\"FoodPois\"), contracted from eating old (\"tainted\") corpses. This will always kill you, but avoiding it is simple: <b>Eat your corpses fresh.</b> 60 <a href=\"/wiki/Turn\" title=\"Turn\">turns</a> is the limit! Only <a href=\"/wiki/Lichen\" title=\"Lichen\">lichens</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Lizard\" title=\"Lizard\">lizards</a>, and corpses kept in an <a href=\"/wiki/Ice_box\" title=\"Ice box\">ice box</a> do not age. By the same logic, remember that <a href=\"/wiki/Zombie\" title=\"Zombie\">zombies</a> and other <a href=\"/wiki/Undead\" title=\"Undead\">undead</a> died long before you met them: they are walking food poisoning. If your pet kills an enemy out of sight and leaves a dwarf corpse, it was probably a <a href=\"/wiki/Dwarf_zombie\" title=\"Dwarf zombie\">dwarf zombie</a>; otherwise your pet would have eaten it.\n</p><p>The second kind is \"regular\" <a href=\"/wiki/Poison\" title=\"Poison\">poison</a>, which is simply a property of some monster types (e.g. kobolds). <b>Corpses your pet <a href=\"/wiki/Dog\" title=\"Dog\">dog</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Cat\" title=\"Cat\">cat</a> will eat are safe</b> (with very few exceptions). Eating a poisonous corpse will lower your <a href=\"/wiki/Attribute\" title=\"Attribute\">stats</a> and HP, though it won't kill you directly. Unlike food poisoning, you <i>can</i> become <a href=\"/wiki/Poison_resistance\" title=\"Poison resistance\">resistant</a> to this type, and in fact you should as soon as possible. This will also protect against spiked pits, the  poisoned arrows of <a href=\"/wiki/Uruk-hai\" title=\"Uruk-hai\">Uruk-hai</a>, and other sudden deaths. <a href=\"/wiki/Barbarian\" title=\"Barbarian\">Barbarians</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Healer\" title=\"Healer\">Healers</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Orc_(starting_race)\" title=\"Orc (starting race)\">orc</a> characters start out resistant, while <a href=\"/wiki/Monk\" title=\"Monk\">Monks</a> gain the resistance at level 3; all others are safe as soon as \"you feel healthy\". (Watch out for other \"<a href=\"/wiki/You_feel\" title=\"You feel\">you feel</a>\" messages, too, and learn their sources and effects.)\n</p><p>Remember: <a href=\"/wiki/NetHack_is_not_real_life\" title=\"NetHack is not real life\"><i>NetHack</i> is not real life</a>. Though most of us would not eat a <a href=\"/wiki/Sewer_rat\" title=\"Sewer rat\">sewer rat</a> or an uncooked jackal corpse, and would get ill if we did, it is not an issue for your character. Unless there is something intrinsically harmful about a particular corpse, such as the poisonous kobold or the instantly petrifying <a href=\"/wiki/Cockatrice\" title=\"Cockatrice\">cockatrice</a>, and unless it is more than 60 turns dead, it will probably be safe for consumption.\n</p><p>There is also \"proper\" <a href=\"/wiki/Food\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Food\">food</a>, of course: <a href=\"/wiki/Egg\" title=\"Egg\">Eggs</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Tripe_ration\" title=\"Tripe ration\">tripe rations</a> are best left for pets, and keep the rest for hard times. In the <a href=\"/wiki/Roguelike\" title=\"Roguelike\">roguelike</a> community, such food is called \"permafood\", because it never rots.\n</p><p>Finally, if you are already at weak levels of <a href=\"/wiki/Nutrition\" title=\"Nutrition\">nutrition</a> (or worse, fainting), you can also #<a href=\"/wiki/Pray\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pray\">pray</a>. You must take care not to anger your <a href=\"/wiki/God\" title=\"God\">god</a>, but if you really want to, <a href=\"/wiki/Foodless\" title=\"Foodless\">it is quite possible to survive on prayer alone</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Praying\">Praying</span></h2>\n<p>Most real-life religions encourage you to pray regularly. But the Guidebook states clearly that you pray to the gods <i>for help</i>. The <i>NetHack</i> gods will be perfectly happy never to hear from you. If they regard you as constantly whining, they might become <a href=\"/wiki/Anger\" title=\"Anger\">angry</a> and eventually decide to <a href=\"/wiki/Wide-angle_disintegration_beam\" title=\"Wide-angle disintegration beam\">put you out of your misery</a> and send someone worthier to fetch the <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor\" title=\"Amulet of Yendor\">Amulet of Yendor</a> for them.\n</p><p><b>Used sparingly, prayer can get you out of tight spots.</b> Before praying again, wait around 700–1400 turns, <a href=\"/wiki/Prayer_timeout\" title=\"Prayer timeout\">the longer the better</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/Sacrifice\" title=\"Sacrifice\">Sacrifice</a> can shorten the time, and it may also get you <a href=\"/wiki/Gifts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gifts\">gifts</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Watching_your_pet\">Watching your pet</span></h2>\n<p>Watching what corpses your cats and dogs eat will help you figure out which are safe—<a href=\"/wiki/Horse\" title=\"Horse\">horses</a> will not eat meat, and they can help you figure out which <i>vegetarian</i> corpses are safe (see <a href=\"/wiki/Diet\" title=\"Diet\">diet</a>).

Fortunately, your pet can indicate whether an item is cursed: just drop it on the floor where you can see it and wait. <b>Pets will step on cursed items only reluctantly, if at all.</b> If a pet walks over or picks up an item without a message appearing, it is safe to try on. Early on, <a href=\"/wiki/Curse-testing#Pet_testing\" title=\"Curse-testing\">pet-test</a> most of the <a href=\"/wiki/Armor\" title=\"Armor\">armor</a> you find, to get your <a href=\"/wiki/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a> as low as you can.\n</p><p>Furthermore, your pet can kill a <a href=\"/wiki/Nymph\" title=\"Nymph\">nymph</a> before she can rob you or kill a peaceful coaligned <a href=\"/wiki/Unicorn\" title=\"Unicorn\">unicorn</a> that you must not desecrate yourself. Eventually, your pet's natural aggression may get it killed by the <a href=\"/wiki/Minetown\" title=\"Minetown\">Minetown</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Watch_captain\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Watch captain\">watch captain</a> (a large dog or cat will attack watchmen) or a <a href=\"/wiki/Shopkeeper\" title=\"Shopkeeper\">shopkeeper</a> (warhorses attack these), so keep it away from these powerful monsters or <a href=\"/wiki/Polymorph#Pets\" title=\"Polymorph\">polymorph it</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Identifying\">Identifying</span></h2>\n<p>Boldly <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/R\" title=\"R\">r</a></span></span><a href=\"/wiki/Reading\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Reading\">eading</a>, <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/Q\" title=\"Q\">q</a></span></span><a href=\"/wiki/Quaffing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quaffing\">uaffing</a> and <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/Z\" title=\"Z\">z</a></span></span><a href=\"/wiki/Zapping\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Zapping\">apping</a> everything you find is the obvious method of <a href=\"/wiki/Identification\" title=\"Identification\">identification</a>—and it is ridiculously, suicidally dangerous, so <b>do not do it!</b> Here is a quick summary of the item classes:\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Armor\" title=\"Armor\">Armor</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Weapon\" title=\"Weapon\">weapons</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet\" title=\"Amulet\">amulets</a> are actually quite safe to try on after <a href=\"/wiki/Curse-testing\" title=\"Curse-testing\">curse-testing</a> them with your pet. A few items will <a href=\"/wiki/Autocurse\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Autocurse\">autocurse</a>, but they are rare and not life-threatening. Make sure you are capable of <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/P\" title=\"P\">p</a></span></span><a href=\"/wiki/Paying\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Paying\">aying</a> for the item if you decide to try it on in a shop, though.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Ring\" title=\"Ring\">Rings</a> are also safe if curse-tested, with three complications: <a href=\"/wiki/Ring_of_conflict\" title=\"Ring of conflict\">conflict</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Ring_of_polymorph\" title=\"Ring of polymorph\">polymorph</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Ring_of_teleportation\" title=\"Ring of teleportation\">teleportation</a>. Never try them near a <a href=\"/wiki/Shop\" title=\"Shop\">shop</a> or if your pet is powerful enough to kill you in one hit. If you're really afraid of a polymorph, take off your torso armor. Remove the ring immediately on the next turn to keep the chance of anything going wrong to a minimum, unless you think you can handle being polymorphed or teleported around. Often, putting on a ring will tell you nothing and you will have to identify it by some other means anyway.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Wand\" title=\"Wand\">Wands</a> are fun. Write <i>Elbereth</i> with your finger (to exercise <a href=\"/wiki/Wisdom\" title=\"Wisdom\">Wisdom</a>), then add to the engraving with a wand. Most will identify or at least give you hints. Six wands <a href=\"/wiki/Engrave-test\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Engrave-test\">give no message at all</a>, are not particularly powerful, and can be further identified with a few common items. <b>Never, ever put wands that make engravings vanish in your <a href=\"/wiki/Bag_of_holding\" title=\"Bag of holding\">bag of holding</a></b> until you are absolutely sure the wand is a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_teleportation\" title=\"Wand of teleportation\">wand of teleportation</a> or a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_make_invisible\" title=\"Wand of make invisible\">wand of make invisible</a>, and not a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_cancellation\" title=\"Wand of cancellation\">wand of cancellation</a>—otherwise you will blow up your bag of holding and all of its contents.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Potion\" title=\"Potion\">Potions</a> are trickier. <a href=\"/wiki/Potions_of_water\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Potions of water\">Potions of water</a> are clear. <a href=\"/wiki/Potions_of_oil\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Potions of oil\">Potions of oil</a> light up when <a href=\"/wiki/Apply\" title=\"Apply\">applied</a>. By dipping some junk <a href=\"/wiki/Dart\" title=\"Dart\">darts</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Arrow\" title=\"Arrow\">arrows</a> you may discover the <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_polymorph\" title=\"Potion of polymorph\">potion of polymorph</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_sickness\" title=\"Potion of sickness\">potion of sickness</a>. Dipping a <a href=\"/wiki/Unicorn_horn\" title=\"Unicorn horn\">unicorn horn</a> will turn <a href=\"/wiki/Unicorn_horn#Potion_identification\" title=\"Unicorn horn\">three other harmful potions</a> into water. Finally, you have to rule out the potions of <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_sleep\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Potion of sleep\">sleep</a>&#32;and <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_paralysis\" title=\"Potion of paralysis\">paralysis</a>. Monsters may throw them at you, and you can also quaff-test them by being <a href=\"/wiki/Sleep_resistance\" title=\"Sleep resistance\">sleep resistant</a> and wearing a <a href=\"/wiki/Ring_of_free_action\" title=\"Ring of free action\">ring of free action</a>. All other potions are safe to quaff, provided that they are not cursed.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Scroll\" title=\"Scroll\">Scrolls</a> are candidates for <a href=\"/wiki/Price_identification\" title=\"Price identification\">price identification</a>, a complex and wearisome process. Fortunately, some of the most useful early-game scrolls are cheap and easy to price-identify. Drop the scroll at a <a href=\"/wiki/Shop\" title=\"Shop\">shop</a> (but don't actually sell it), and multiply the shopkeeper's offer by 2 (or 3 if you <a href=\"/wiki/Shirt\" title=\"Shirt\">look like a tourist</a>) to get the <i>base price</i>. (Some shopkeepers will offer only <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> of the normal selling price for unidentified items, however.) The <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_identify\" title=\"Scroll of identify\">scroll of identify</a> is the most easily recognizable, the most common, and the cheapest, with a base price of 20. The mostly useless <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_light\" title=\"Scroll of light\">scroll of light</a> has a base price of 50, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_enchant_weapon\" title=\"Scroll of enchant weapon\">scroll of enchant weapon</a> has a base price of 60. The <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_remove_curse\" title=\"Scroll of remove curse\">scroll of remove curse</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_enchant_armor\" title=\"Scroll of enchant armor\">scroll of enchant armor</a> both have a base price of 80. Several other scrolls can be identified from other factors:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Monsters will only ever read scrolls of <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_teleportation\" title=\"Scroll of teleportation\">teleportation</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_create_monster\" title=\"Scroll of create monster\">create monster</a>, and (rarely) <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_earth\" title=\"Scroll of earth\">earth</a>, which have obvious effects.</li>\n<li>The scroll of teleportation is the only one that will be generated in <a href=\"/wiki/Closet\" title=\"Closet\">closets</a>, so it is the only one you may see lying on the ground outside a room.</li>\n<li>The two scrolls on the first level of <a href=\"/wiki/Sokoban\" title=\"Sokoban\">Sokoban</a> are <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_earth\" title=\"Scroll of earth\">scrolls of earth</a>.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_scare_monster\" title=\"Scroll of scare monster\">scroll of scare monster</a> will be placed under the Sokoban prize, and it can also be observed from its effect on peaceful monsters. If a pet or a shopkeeper \"turns to flee\" for no apparent reason, you're standing on one.</li></ul>\n<p>The other scrolls are too complicated or risky to try out, so just read a blessed scroll of identify when you've collected enough.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Standard_strategy\" title=\"Standard strategy\">Standard strategy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Standard_strategy_(SLASH%27EM)\" title=\"Standard strategy (SLASH&#39;EM)\">Standard strategy (SLASH'EM)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Role_difficulty\" title=\"Role difficulty\">Role difficulty</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Game_stages\" title=\"Game stages\">Game stages</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Notetaking\" title=\"Notetaking\">Notetaking</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.nethack.org/v361/Guidebook.html\">Guidebook for <i>NetHack</i> 3.6.1</a></li></ul>\n<div style=\"display:none; right:10px; padding-bottom: 17px\" class=\"metadata topicon nopopups\"><div style=\"margin-top: -10px\"><a href=\"/wiki/NetHackWiki:Next_version\" title=\"This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.1.

page is an attempt to provide basic tips for survival and it specifically describes typical beginner misconceptions regarding ''[[NetHack]]''. It is aimed at new players who feel like they can't get the hang of it and [[die]] early every game, so it will focus on the [[early game]] stage and deliberately ignore ''NetHack''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s abundant corner cases. Follow the links if you want a complete [[strategy]] overview.\n\nIt is assumed you have played (and died) a couple of dozen times and know how to open [[door]]s and do simple stuff like that. If you are still wondering what the funny {{white|@}} means, then first have a look at the excellent [[Guidebook]] that comes with ''NetHack'', play a few games to get the feel of it, ''read the Guidebook again''—picking up the numerous hints you will have overlooked during the first reading—then come back here.\n\n== The one good game ==\n\nYou sometimes hear that ''NetHack'' is near impossible to [[win]], because of the amount of exceptional good die rools that are required to win: it takes years to get just one good game, with an early [[wand of wishing]] and having everything else work out just right. That is a myth!\n\n'''If your survival depends on luck then you are following the wrong strategy.''' True, a few unavoidable deaths remain, like falling into a [[spiked pit|poisoned spiked pit]], or the proverbial [[Gnome With the Wand of Death]], but these are threatening only early, before [[property|countermeasures]] have been acquired. Truly outstanding players (such as [[Marvin]]) manage to [[ascend]] 80% of their games, and they do not get more wands of wishing than the rest of us. A large part of learning to play NetHack is acquiring safe habits.\n\n== Moving fast, typing slowly ==\n\n'''Never explore while [[Burdened]] or worse.''' [[Speed]] is a major issue. When you are ''Stressed'', your average opponent can hit twice for your every chance to move, and your [[HP]] will just melt away. (If you do need to haul around heavy [[stash]]es of equipment, stick to known territory and be ready to shed weight at the sight of danger.) In such occasions, a [[wand of speed monster]] or [[speed boots]] are a big advantage, allowing ''you'' to hit (or escape) faster.\n\nDo not use the arrow keys, because they provide only orthogonal [[direction|movement]], requiring twice as many steps to reach a diagonal destination. If the vi-like ([[yuhjklbn]]) keys do not suit you, make a habit of using the [[options#number_pad|number pad]] instead. [[Movement tactics#Diagonal movement|Take advantage of diagonal movement keys.]]\n\nAt the same time, type slowly and deliberately. You cannot run away more quickly from [[monster]]s by typing more quickly! Additionally, '''never hold down a key for autorepeat.''' When you hold down a key, you often stumble into something and try to attack or pass it faster than you can release the key. Instead, make use of the {{kbd|G}}, {{kbd|g}}, capital YUHJKLBN, and numpad {{kbd|5}} commands to go in one direction until you discover something interesting. Also useful is {{kbd|_}}. \n\nIf you are running low on health and there are no monsters in the vicinity, rest and wait for your health to come back. The {{kbd|.}} command will let you rest for a number of turns that you can specify. You will stop resting as soon as anything dangerous (or interesting) comes along. \n\nYou may also find it useful to [[Notetaking|take notes]] on what you are doing.  Besides the information's usefulness, it encourages you to be thoughtful.\n\nBeginners should also play purposefully: \"just exploring\", in the long run, is the same as \"just running around until you get killed\". If you find yourself doing this, look at your equipment and status to see what your immediate [[Standard strategy#Goals|goals]] should be: \"I need an effective projectile weapon\", \"I need to get my armor class down\", \"I need to identify this magic stuff I've collected\", \"I need fire/cold/magic resistance before I go much further\" ... whatever's appropriate at the moment. Thinking this way will improve your game rapidly.\n\n== Traps ==\nOn dungeon level 1, every deadly trap has an automatically generated corpse on it.{{refsrc|src/mklev.c|1391|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} This decreases by 25% with each Dlvl, meaning that Dlvl 5 and below will never have traps with an auto-corpse. However, while you're on the level a monster may stumble onto a trap and die, so if you see a mysterious corpse that you didn't kill, beware.\n\nIf you're caught in a [[bear trap]], you can escape five times faster by trying to move diagonally.{{refsrc|src/hack.c|1200|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}\n\nDarts, arrows, and rocks on the ground. Beware, these may be traps.\n\nIf \"you hear rumbling in the distance\", there is a rolling boulder trap ready to do d20 damage to anything in its path.\n\nDarts and spiked pits have a chance of being poisoned and can cause insta-death. Since it takes a while to gain intrinsic [[poison resistance]] or identify the necessary jewelry, an [[alchemy smock]] is a great find in the early game. (If this is a frequent problem for you, it may be worth trying playing a [[barbarian]] as your first role, since they get poison resistance at [[experience level|level]] 1.)\n\n== Finding down ==\n\n'''Every room has a way out.''' If none is apparent, [[search]] for it by hitting {{kbd|s}} on every step along the [[wall]] or at the dead end of a [[corridor]]—it may take you ten times or so before finding a secret door or passage, though. If all [[door]]s are [[locked]] and you have no other means to open them, [[kick]] them down—but this is noisy and will wake sleeping monsters. If you kick down the door of a shop, the owner will attack. You can avoid kicking down shop doors by simply making sure that the dust in front of the door does not say \"[[closed for inventory]]\".\n\n'''Every level has a way down.''' (There are exceptions, but not in the early dungeon.) Look on the map for a large, empty area where an additional, undiscovered [[room]] might fit and search (as above) along adjacent walls or suspiciously shaped corridors. Or the [[stairs]] could be covered by an [[item]]—yes, NetHack does have mighty big [[fortune cookie]]s! If a monster is sitting on top of the stairs, you will see them as soon as the monster is out of sight. If you're pretty sure you've explored the whole level and still don't see any stairs, use the #[[terrain]] command to view the map without monsters or objects. Pressing {{kbd|_}}{{kbd|>}} will also show the stairs since [[Nethack 3.6.0]] even if there are objects on top of them.\n\n== Monsters too tough? ==\nAs you go deeper in the dungeon and level up, monsters that generate become more powerful. Monsters that can generate are determined by the average of your experience level and your dungeon level; see [[Monsters (by difficulty)]] for details. Even if you keep your experience level relatively low, you can still encounter difficult monsters as you venture deeper into the dungeon. If you are in a particularly deep area or a dangerous level such as the [[Oracle (level)|Oracle level]], it may be in your best interest not to linger. Come back when you're more experienced or better equipped.\n\n== Drinking water ==\n'''Don't.''' A beginner who starved a couple of times might get the idea that drinking was also necessary. Unfortunately the Guidebook's advice on this matter is misleading (\"Although creatures can survive long periods of time without food, there is a physiological need for water\"). However, your character can in fact survive the whole game without drinking ''anything''.\n\nThere is no need to drink water. In fact, [[quaff]]ing [[potions of water]] is a big waste of resources; you are much better off saving them to turn into {{! of|holy water}}. Drinking from [[fountain]]s is downright dangerous, since many bad effects can occur. True, if you are exceptionally fortunate you might get an early wish, or some other benefit, but the chances are tiny. Much more likely, you will get nasty hostile monsters—[[water nymph]]s, [[water demon]]s, or swarms of [[water moccasin]]s.\n\n==Eating==\nEating [[corpse]]s feels like Russian roulette. A [[kobold]] will poison you. A [[jackal]] \"tastes terrible\" but seems OK. But if you save another one for later, it'll give you deadly food poisoning. If you decide that eating corpses off the [[floor]] is uncivilized anyway and vow to stick to proper \"people food\", you'll probably starve before finding any.\n\nFirst, understand that there are two separate kinds of poisoning that you can get from food. The first is [[food poisoning]] (\"FoodPois\"), contracted from eating old (\"tainted\") corpses. This will always kill you, but avoiding it is simple: '''Eat your corpses fresh.''' 60 [[turn]]s is the limit! Only [[lichen]]s, [[lizard]]s, and corpses kept in an [[ice box]] do not age. By the same logic, remember that [[zombie]]s and other [[undead]] died long before you met them: they are walking food poisoning. If your pet kills an enemy out of sight and leaves a dwarf corpse, it was probably a [[dwarf zombie]]; otherwise your pet would have eaten it.\n\nThe second kind is \"regular\" [[poison]], which is simply a property of some monster types (e.g. kobolds). '''Corpses your pet [[dog]] or [[cat]] will eat are safe''' (with very few exceptions). Eating a poisonous corpse will lower your [[attribute|stats]] and HP, though it won't kill you directly. Unlike food poisoning, you ''can'' become [[poison resistance|resistant]] to this type, and in fact you should as soon as possible. This will also protect against spiked pits, the  poisoned arrows of [[Uruk-hai]], and other sudden deaths. [[Barbarian]]s, [[Healer]]s, and [[Orc (starting race)|orc]] characters start out resistant, while [[Monk]]s gain the resistance at level 3; all others are safe as soon as \"you feel healthy\". (Watch out for other \"[[you feel]]\" messages, too, and learn their sources and effects.)\n\nRemember: [[NetHack is not real life|''NetHack'' is not real life]]. Though most of us would not eat a [[sewer rat]] or an uncooked jackal corpse, and would get ill if we did, it is not an issue for your character. Unless there is something intrinsically harmful about a particular corpse, such as the poisonous kobold or the instantly petrifying [[cockatrice]], and unless it is more than 60 turns dead, it will probably be safe for consumption.\n\nThere is also \"proper\" [[food]], of course: [[Egg]]s and [[tripe ration]]s are best left for pets, and keep the rest for hard times. In the [[roguelike]] community, such food is called \"permafood\", because it never rots.\n\nFinally, if you are already at weak levels of [[nutrition]] (or worse, fainting), you can also #[[pray]]. You must take care not to anger your [[god]], but if you really want to, [[Foodless|it is quite possible to survive on prayer alone]].\n\n== Praying ==\n\nMost real-life religions encourage you to pray regularly. But the Guidebook states clearly that you pray to the gods ''for help''. The ''NetHack'' gods will be perfectly happy never to hear from you. If they regard you as constantly whining, they might become [[anger|angry]] and eventually decide to [[wide-angle disintegration beam|put you out of your misery]] and send someone worthier to fetch the [[Amulet of Yendor]] for them.\n\n'''Used sparingly, prayer can get you out of tight spots.''' Before praying again, wait around 700–1400 turns, [[prayer timeout|the longer the better]]. [[Sacrifice]] can shorten the time, and it may also get you [[gifts]].\n\n== Watching your pet ==\n\nWatching what corpses your cats and dogs eat will help you figure out which are safe—[[horse]]s will not eat meat, and they can help you figure out which ''vegetarian'' corpses are safe (see [[diet]]). But there is more that your pet can do for you:\n\nFinding better equipment is vital (see \"Leveling up\" above), but you must not {{kbd|W}}[[wear|ear]], {{kbd|w}}[[wield|ield]] or {{kbd|P}}[[put on|ut on]] anything that might be [[BUC|cursed]], and [[altar]]s for ascertaining that are scarce. Fortunately, your pet can indicate whether an item is cursed: just drop it on the floor where you can see it and wait. '''Pets will step on cursed items only reluctantly, if at all.''' If a pet walks over or picks up an item without a message appearing, it is safe to try on. Early on, [[Curse-testing#Pet testing|pet-test]] most of the [[armor]] you find, to get your [[AC]] as low as you can.\n\nFurthermore, your pet can kill a [[nymph]] before she can rob you or kill a peaceful coaligned [[unicorn]] that you must not desecrate yourself. Eventually, your pet's natural aggression may get it killed by the [[Minetown]] [[watch captain]] (a large dog or cat will attack watchmen) or a [[shopkeeper]] (warhorses attack these), so keep it away from these powerful monsters or [[Polymorph#Pets|polymorph it]].\n\n== Identifying ==\n\nBoldly {{kbd|r}}[[reading|eading]], {{kbd|q}}[[quaffing|uaffing]] and {{kbd|z}}[[zapping|apping]] everything you find is the obvious method of [[identification]]—and it is ridiculously, suicidally dangerous, so '''do not do it!''' Here is a quick summary of the item classes:\n\n[[Armor]], [[weapon]]s and [[amulet]]s are actually quite safe to try on after [[curse-testing]] them with your pet. A few items will [[autocurse]], but they are rare and not life-threatening. Make sure you are capable of {{kbd|p}}[[paying|aying]] for the item if you decide to try it on in a shop, though.\n\n[[Ring]]s are also safe if curse-tested, with three complications: {{ring of|conflict|polymorph|and=1|teleportation}}. Never try them near a [[shop]] or if your pet is powerful enough to kill you in one hit. If you're really afraid of a polymorph, take off your torso armor. Remove the ring immediately on the next turn to keep the chance of anything going wrong to a minimum, unless you think you can handle being polymorphed or teleported around. Often, putting on a ring will tell you nothing and you will have to identify it by some other means anyway.\n\n[[Wand]]s are fun. Write ''Elbereth'' with your finger (to exercise [[Wisdom]]), then add to the engraving with a wand. Most will identify or at least give you hints. Six wands [[Engrave-test|give no message at all]], are not particularly powerful, and can be further identified with a few common items. '''Never, ever put wands that make engravings vanish in your [[bag of holding]]''' until you are absolutely sure the wand is a [[wand of teleportation]] or a [[wand of make invisible]], and not a [[wand of cancellation]]—otherwise you will blow up your bag of holding and all of its contents.\n\n[[Potion]]s are trickier. [[Potions of water]] are clear. [[Potions of oil]] light up when [[apply|applied]]. By dipping some junk [[dart]]s or [[arrow]]s you may discover the [[potion of polymorph]] and the [[potion of sickness]]. Dipping a [[unicorn horn]] will turn [[unicorn horn#Potion identification|three other harmful potions]] into water. Finally, you have to rule out the potions of {{potion of|sleep|and=1|paralysis}}. Monsters may throw them at you, and you can also quaff-test them by being [[sleep resistance|sleep resistant]] and wearing a [[ring of free action]]. All other potions are safe to quaff, provided that they are not cursed.\n\n[[Scroll]]s are candidates for [[price identification]], a complex and wearisome process. Fortunately, some of the most useful early-game scrolls are cheap and easy to price-identify. Drop the scroll at a [[shop]] (but don't actually sell it), and multiply the shopkeeper's offer by 2 (or 3 if you [[Shirt|look like a tourist]]) to get the ''base price''. (Some shopkeepers will offer only {{frac|3|4}} of the normal selling price for unidentified items, however.) The [[scroll of identify]] is the most easily recognizable, the most common, and the cheapest, with a base price of 20. The mostly useless [[scroll of light]] has a base price of 50, and the [[scroll of enchant weapon]] has a base price of 60. The [[scroll of remove curse]] and the [[scroll of enchant armor]] both have a base price of 80. Several other scrolls can be identified from other factors:\n* Monsters will only ever read scrolls of {{scroll of|teleportation|create monster}}, and (rarely) {{scroll of|earth}}, which have obvious effects.\n* The scroll of teleportation is the only one that will be generated in [[closet]]s, so it is the only one you may see lying on the ground outside a room.\n* The two scrolls on the first level of [[Sokoban]] are [[scroll of earth|scrolls of earth]]. \n* A [[scroll of scare monster]] will be placed under the Sokoban prize, and it can also be observed from its effect on peaceful monsters. If a pet or a shopkeeper \"turns to flee\" for no apparent reason, you're standing on one.\nThe other scrolls are too complicated or risky to try out, so just read a blessed scroll of identify when you've collected enough.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Standard strategy]]\n* [[Standard strategy (SLASH'EM)]]\n* [[Role difficulty]]\n* [[Game stages]]\n* [[Notetaking]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.nethack.org/v361/Guidebook.html Guidebook for ''NetHack'' 3.6.1]\n[[Category:Articles for beginners]]\n[[Category:Strategy]]\n{{nethack-361}}"}

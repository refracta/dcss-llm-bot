[3.2 Obtaining black-market copies](#Obtaining_black-market_copies)\n\n## Generation\n\nImperial elven gear is only spawned in three ways - the Anachrononaut Quest, the Elf Madman Quest, and on specific non-randomly generated monsters. This gear also counts as future tech, so only Tourists may wish for it normally. All pieces are typically made of wood, though can be rarely be made of mithril, silver, copper, gold or bone with probabilities identical to normal non-cloth elven gear. All pieces are inherently magical.\n\nImperial elven gear comes in two subtypes: upgradeable and non-upgradeable.\n\n### Upgradeable gear\n\nUpgradeable armor pieces mostly occur in fixed locations in the game, and have story-line reasons why they were damaged and need repairs.\n\n- For Elf Madpeople specifically, there is a full set of thoroughly burnt rotted imperial elven gear in their quest. This armor is always made of wood and bright green. It is located directly under - but not in the inventory - of Lady Constance. This set begins with no upgrades.\n- There is a full set of thoroughly rotted imperial elven gear on each lower filler level for [Anachrononauts](/wiki/Anachrononaut \"Anachrononaut\") (including Androids), with a small chance to find extra pieces lying around those same levels. Those sets are also random colors, instead of always bright green. These armors have no upgrades already applied, but can be upgraded as normal by anyone with the capabilities. This can be any material possible with the usual odds, and thus will almost always be wood.\n- [Star-emperors](/index.php?title=Star-emperor\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Star-emperor (page does not exist)\") and [empresses](/index.php?title=Star-empress\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Star-empress (page does not exist)\") have a full set of gear, and unlike other sources of upgradeable gear these have some upgrades already applied. The boots have the [speed](/wiki/Speed \"Speed\") and kicking upgrades. The gloves have the dexterity, strength, increased damage, and grappling upgrades. The body armor has the [flying](/wiki/Flying \"Flying\"), fast healing, [sickness resistance](/wiki/Immunity_to_sickness \"Immunity to sickness\"), and medium armor upgrades. Finally, the helm has the [breathlessness](/wiki/Breathless \"Breathless\"), and accuracy upgrades. These monsters are found inside mind flayer [crystal skulls](/index.php?title=Crystal_skull\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Crystal skull (page does not exist)\").\n- [Puppet-emperor Xeleth](/index.php?title=Puppet-emperor_Xeleth\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Puppet-emperor Xeleth (page does not exist)\") and [Puppet-empress Xedalli](/index.php?title=Puppet-empress_Xedalli\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Puppet-empress Xedalli (page does not exist)\") each have a set of technically-upgradeable golden gear that already has all possible upgrades applied. However, this set is also self-cursing and infested with byakhee larvae. If the PC were to equip the full set of gear they would take around 52 points of damage per turn from the biting and stinging larvae, and would likely be unable to quickly remove it due to its self-cursing behavior. These enemies are also exclusively found on the Planes for Elf Madpeople, and therefore out of reach for normal runs anyway.\n\n### Non-upgradeable gear\n\nNon-upgradeable gear is found in the inventories of certain monsters, typically with upgrades already applied. Unlike upgradeable gear, this gear is missing features simply because it is less sophisticated, and cannot be upgraded any further no matter what you do.\n\n- [Star-elves](/index.php?title=Star-elves\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Star-elves (page does not exist)\") have a full set of imperial elven gear, with a random material following the usual odds. The gloves have the dexterity upgrade, the body armor has the [sickness resistance](/wiki/Immunity_to_sickness \"Immunity to sickness\") upgrade, the helm has the [breathlessness](/wiki/Breathless \"Breathless\"), blindness resistance, and accuracy upgrade, and the boots have no upgrades.\n- [Carcosan courtiers](/index.php?title=Carcosan_courtier\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Carcosan courtier (page does not exist)\") in the future - in either Anachrononaut quest, specifically - have a 5% chance to have a plain golden set of imperial elven armor with a smattering of upgrades. The boots have speed, the gloves strength, the helm the same as Star-elves, and flying, sickness resistance, and reflection on the body armor. These are useful intrinsics to have, but Anachrononauts are guaranteed *upgradeable* imperial elven gear as well; if the player desires better versions of this gear can be assembled.\n\n## Upgrades\n\nThe main draws of imperial elven gear are their upgradeable abilities. Each piece can be upgraded separately, using an [upgrade kit](/wiki/Upgrade_kit \"Upgrade kit\") in conjunction with a specific item to add a new property to that specific piece of gear. All upgrades are slot-specific, must be worn to apply their effects, and do not stack with the same upgrade or other sources of the same property (except where specified). Any upgrade kits or items spent are consumed upon applying the upgrade.\n\nIf imperial elven gear is found in a [bones](/wiki/Bones \"Bones\") level, it will have the same upgrades and upgradable status as in its source game.\n\nTo upgrade a piece of gear, you must have learned how via some source. Otherwise, upgrade kits will simply not display the prompt. There are only four ways to have the ability to upgrade imperial elven armor: You must have started as an Anachrononaut, opened your quest box as an Elf Madperson, bound [Dantalion](/wiki/Dantalion \"Dantalion\") at any point (this is a permanent knowledge unlock, Dantalion does not have to still be bound), or have seen a Star-elf, Star-emperor, or Star-empress as a Tourist. For other roles, or for non-Elf madpeople, the only option for learning how to upgrade imperial elven gear is Dantalion.\n\nThe upgrade prompt will offer to \"repair\" a piece of imperial armor, and the armor must not be worn while upgrading. Upon choosing a piece of gear, it will ask which item to use to 'repair' the armor piece - if no items in your inventory are valid upgrade materials, this will abort the repair process with nothing consumed.\n\nUpgrade materials must be type-identified to be offered as choices - so an unidentified ring of increase damage will not work with gauntlets, for example, but once it's been identified it will display as a possible option. Some upgrades can take two or more items as possible materials - for example invisibility on the armor can come from a cloak of invisibility, a ring of invisibility, or even a wand of make invisible. These upgrades can still only be applied once, even if you try with the other possible materials. No upgrades are mutually exclusive - with sufficient upgrade kits, it is possible to have all upgrades at once.\n\nAny upgrades that apply an enchantment-scaling bonus use the enchantment of the imperial elven armor piece, rather than the upgrade material consumed. All upgrade materials only check the base item type and identification status, so even wands with expended charges, negatively enchanted items, or anything else. No traits of the original item are kept and used for anything after the upgrade completes.\n\nThere is no way to know what upgrades result from which items in-game, to know which items can be used to upgrade gear, or even to know which properties (aside from the ones that have obvious on-wear or inspect effects) a given piece of armor has. However, the below table summarizes all possible upgrades for each piece of gear. Separate recipes for the same upgrade are included as separate entries for ease of sorting.\n\n| armor slot | property granted

Strategy\n\n### Practical usage\n\nIn most cases, the practical limitations on your upgrades come from the number of upgrade kits in the game rather than the materials to upgrade with. Quite a few can spawn in the [Caves of Law](/wiki/Law_quest_\\(dNetHack\\) \"Law quest (dNetHack)\") and as the random tools in the [Gnomish Mines](/wiki/Gnomish_Mines \"Gnomish Mines\"), but besides those you would have to find them pretty much randomly. As such, it's important to ration your upgrade kits, and use them wisely on useful upgrades.\n\nNotable upgrades include [half physical damage](/wiki/Half_physical_damage \"Half physical damage\") and [half spell damage](/wiki/Half_spell_damage \"Half spell damage\") on your armor for general purpose use, [flying](/wiki/Flying \"Flying\") on your armor and very fast [speed](/wiki/Speed \"Speed\") on your boots to free up an armor or ring slot (a must-have for most builds using a full set of imperial elven armor), and [sustain ability](/wiki/Sustain_ability \"Sustain ability\") on your armor to free up a ring slot. Equally powerful but more situational upgrades include 25 strength on your gauntlets for melee builds (nearly a must-have for them, mediocre otherwise), [sickness resistance](/wiki/Immunity_to_sickness \"Immunity to sickness\") and [fast healing](/wiki/Regeneration \"Regeneration\") on your body armor (helpful for nearly everybody, but less impactful some other upgrades), and [breathlessness](/wiki/Breathless \"Breathless\") on your helm (again, helpful but less impactful).\n\nEven partially upgraded imperial elven gear, assuming you manage to get the powerful upgrades at least, is likely better than the majority of other available armors out there - since this is balanced out by its extreme rarity. It is notably missing magic resistance, free action and possibly drain resistance, but otherwise can supplant nearly all of an ascension kit armor-wise. You still have a free cloak slot, most likely for a cloak of magic resistance if you don't have that slotlessly, plus a free shirt slot and two free ring slots for free action (chef's choice for the second ring). Imperial elven helms and boots are likely the most supplantable, since the helms don't provide any crucial intrinsics (and the boots only really necessitate a speed upgrade), so if you're running short on upgrade kits you can forgo those pieces in favor of another helm or pair of boots you already possess. Helms of drain resistance and boots of speed are practical alternatives, or helms of brilliance for would-be casters. No set bonus is granted for wearing all 4 items, after all.\n\n### Obtaining black-market copies\n\nPractically speaking, the only way for non-Elf-Madperson non-Anachrononaut roles to get imperial elven gear is by finding them in bones, or off a Star-elf or their grown-up forms (Star-emperors and Star-empresses). Unfortunately, there is no way to force a Star-elf spawn in a way that includes its inventory aside from wishing for figurines, which only works for Tourists (non-Tourists will always have their figurines \"warp strangely\" and fail). Figurines of Star-emperors and empresses always \"warp strangely\" even for Tourists. They cannot be candled or reverse genocided. There are only 2 possible ways for them to spawn for other roles:\n\n- Star-elves and their grown-up forms can be found very rarely (1⁄24 for Star-elves, 1⁄48 for Star-emperors, 1⁄48 for Star-empresses, 1⁄12 chance for any) in crystal skulls, and they will have their inventory.\n- If a non-Madperson Elf findes the [Stranger](/wiki/Stranger \"Stranger\") in bones, the \"yellow nasties\" it spawns can include a [dream-leech](/index.php?title=Dream-leech\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Dream-leech (page does not exist)\") Star-elf with its inventory.\n\nCrystal skulls do not spawn naturally as objects, and are only found on mind flayers (1⁄120 chance), master mind flayers (1⁄90 chance), or alhoons (guaranteed). The master mind flayers that spawn at level generation in R'lyeh are guaranteed to have crystal skulls as well, making the R'lyeh have a total of 5 guaranteed crystal skulls, as well as 2 earlier in the Lost Cities on the alhoons.\n\nFor sufficiently dedicated adventurers who check all 7 of those, they have a \\~45% chance to find a crystal skull containing a set of imperial elven armor, but only a \\~25% chance to get useful and upgradeable armor. The armor can then be removed from the skull via a [trephination kit](/index.php?title=Trephination_kit\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Trephination kit (page does not exist)\") with charges - removing the armor directly from the summoned monster will cause it to vanish when that monster does. Note that the material can be random, and therefore potentially metallic. However, this is still of middling use considering it cannot be further upgraded without Dantalion - or for Tourists, by making prolonged eye contact with your summon. For sufficiently determined adventurers, it is nonetheless still technically possible and potentially strong, despite only being doable in under a quarter of games.\n\nFor extremely affluent Tourists with plenty of wishes available, wishing for imperial elven gear (most likely the body armor) is still an option. This requires at least one wish for each piece of gear, but does not solve the problem of your inability to upgrade them. You can wish for a figurine of a Star-elf to grant you the ability to upgrade it as well (if you don't already have Dantalion), but the armor they have is unupgradeable and therefore not worth your time. If this is your chosen route, wishing for mithril imperial elven armor is likely your best bet. Mithril grants an outstanding 9/9 base AC/DR, up from the 6/6 of wood, for only 146 weight (36 more). Furthermore, the body armor offers most of the majorly impactful upgrades. If you have the materials and upgrade kits available, this might actually even be worth your time and wishes.\n\n[![This article describes a 3.4.3-based variant of NetHack.

These monsters are found inside mind flayer <a href=\"/index.php?title=Crystal_skull&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Crystal skull (page does not exist)\">crystal skulls</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/index.php?title=Puppet-emperor_Xeleth&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Puppet-emperor Xeleth (page does not exist)\">Puppet-emperor Xeleth</a> and <a href=\"/index.php?title=Puppet-empress_Xedalli&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Puppet-empress Xedalli (page does not exist)\">Puppet-empress Xedalli</a> each have a set of technically-upgradeable golden gear that already has all possible upgrades applied.

If the PC were to equip the full set of gear they would take around 52 points of damage per turn from the biting and stinging larvae, and would likely be unable to quickly remove it due to its self-cursing behavior. These enemies are also exclusively found on the Planes for Elf Madpeople, and therefore out of reach for normal runs anyway.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Non-upgradeable_gear\">Non-upgradeable gear</span></h3>\n<p>Non-upgradeable gear is found in the inventories of certain monsters, typically with upgrades already applied. Unlike upgradeable gear, this gear is missing features simply because it is less sophisticated, and cannot be upgraded any further no matter what you do.\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/index.php?title=Star-elves&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Star-elves (page does not exist)\">Star-elves</a> have a full set of imperial elven gear, with a random material following the usual odds. The gloves have the dexterity upgrade, the body armor has the <a href=\"/wiki/Immunity_to_sickness\" title=\"Immunity to sickness\">sickness resistance</a> upgrade, the helm has the <a href=\"/wiki/Breathless\" title=\"Breathless\">breathlessness</a>, blindness resistance, and accuracy upgrade, and the boots have no upgrades.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/index.php?title=Carcosan_courtier&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Carcosan courtier (page does not exist)\">Carcosan courtiers</a> in the future - in either Anachrononaut quest, specifically - have a 5% chance to have a plain golden set of imperial elven armor with a smattering of upgrades. The boots have speed, the gloves strength, the helm the same as Star-elves, and flying, sickness resistance, and reflection on the body armor. These are useful intrinsics to have, but Anachrononauts are guaranteed <i>upgradeable</i> imperial elven gear as well; if the player desires better versions of this gear can be assembled.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Upgrades\">Upgrades</span></h2>\n<p>The main draws of imperial elven gear are their upgradeable abilities. Each piece can be upgraded separately, using an <a href=\"/wiki/Upgrade_kit\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Upgrade kit\">upgrade kit</a> in conjunction with a specific item to add a new property to that specific piece of gear. All upgrades are slot-specific, must be worn to apply their effects, and do not stack with the same upgrade or other sources of the same property (except where specified). Any upgrade kits or items spent are consumed upon applying the upgrade.\n</p><p>If imperial elven gear is found in a <a href=\"/wiki/Bones\" title=\"Bones\">bones</a> level, it will have the same upgrades and upgradable status as in its source game.\n</p><p>To upgrade a piece of gear, you must have learned how via some source. Otherwise, upgrade kits will simply not display the prompt. There are only four ways to have the ability to upgrade imperial elven armor: You must have started as an Anachrononaut, opened your quest box as an Elf Madperson, bound <a href=\"/wiki/Dantalion\" title=\"Dantalion\">Dantalion</a> at any point (this is a permanent knowledge unlock, Dantalion does not have to still be bound), or have seen a Star-elf, Star-emperor, or Star-empress as a Tourist. For other roles, or for non-Elf madpeople, the only option for learning how to upgrade imperial elven gear is Dantalion.\n</p><p>The upgrade prompt will offer to \"repair\" a piece of imperial armor, and the armor must not be worn while upgrading. Upon choosing a piece of gear, it will ask which item to use to 'repair' the armor piece - if no items in your inventory are valid upgrade materials, this will abort the repair process with nothing consumed. \n</p><p>Upgrade materials must be type-identified to be offered as choices - so an unidentified ring of increase damage will not work with gauntlets, for example, but once it's been identified it will display as a possible option. Some upgrades can take two or more items as possible materials - for example invisibility on the armor can come from a cloak of invisibility, a ring of invisibility, or even a wand of make invisible. These upgrades can still only be applied once, even if you try with the other possible materials. No upgrades are mutually exclusive - with sufficient upgrade kits, it is possible to have all upgrades at once. \n</p><p>Any upgrades that apply an enchantment-scaling bonus use the enchantment of the imperial elven armor piece, rather than the upgrade material consumed. All upgrade materials only check the base item type and identification status, so even wands with expended charges, negatively enchanted items, or anything else. No traits of the original item are kept and used for anything after the upgrade completes.\n</p><p>There is no way to know what upgrades result from which items in-game, to know which items can be used to upgrade gear, or even to know which properties (aside from the ones that have obvious on-wear or inspect effects) a given piece of armor has. However, the below table summarizes all possible upgrades for each piece of gear. Separate recipes for the same upgrade are included as separate entries for ease of sorting.\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable sortable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>armor slot\n</th>\n<th>property

class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Practical_usage\">Practical usage</span></h3>\n<p>In most cases, the practical limitations on your upgrades come from the number of upgrade kits in the game rather than the materials to upgrade with. Quite a few can spawn in the <a href=\"/wiki/Law_quest_(dNetHack)\" title=\"Law quest (dNetHack)\">Caves of Law</a> and as the random tools in the <a href=\"/wiki/Gnomish_Mines\" title=\"Gnomish Mines\">Gnomish Mines</a>, but besides those you would have to find them pretty much randomly. As such, it's important to ration your upgrade kits, and use them wisely on useful upgrades. \n</p><p>Notable upgrades include <a href=\"/wiki/Half_physical_damage\" title=\"Half physical damage\">half physical damage</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Half_spell_damage\" title=\"Half spell damage\">half spell damage</a> on your armor for general purpose use, <a href=\"/wiki/Flying\" title=\"Flying\">flying</a> on your armor and very fast <a href=\"/wiki/Speed\" title=\"Speed\">speed</a> on your boots to free up an armor or ring slot (a must-have for most builds using a full set of imperial elven armor), and <a href=\"/wiki/Sustain_ability\" title=\"Sustain ability\">sustain ability</a> on your armor to free up a ring slot. Equally powerful but more situational upgrades include 25 strength on your gauntlets for melee builds (nearly a must-have for them, mediocre otherwise), <a href=\"/wiki/Immunity_to_sickness\" title=\"Immunity to sickness\">sickness resistance</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Regeneration\" title=\"Regeneration\">fast healing</a> on your body armor (helpful for nearly everybody, but less impactful some other upgrades), and <a href=\"/wiki/Breathless\" title=\"Breathless\">breathlessness</a> on your helm (again, helpful but less impactful). \n</p><p>Even partially upgraded imperial elven gear, assuming you manage to get the powerful upgrades at least, is likely better than the majority of other available armors out there - since this is balanced out by its extreme rarity. It is notably missing magic resistance, free action and possibly drain resistance, but otherwise can supplant nearly all of an ascension kit armor-wise. You still have a free cloak slot, most likely for a cloak of magic resistance if you don't have that slotlessly, plus a free shirt slot and two free ring slots for free action (chef's choice for the second ring). Imperial elven helms and boots are likely the most supplantable, since the helms don't provide any crucial intrinsics (and the boots only really necessitate a speed upgrade), so if you're running short on upgrade kits you can forgo those pieces in favor of another helm or pair of boots you already possess. Helms of drain resistance and boots of speed are practical alternatives, or helms of brilliance for would-be casters. No set bonus is granted for wearing all 4 items, after all.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Obtaining_black-market_copies\">Obtaining black-market copies</span></h3>\n<p>Practically speaking, the only way for non-Elf-Madperson non-Anachrononaut roles to get imperial elven gear is by finding them in bones, or off a Star-elf or their grown-up forms (Star-emperors and Star-empresses). Unfortunately, there is no way to force a Star-elf spawn in a way that includes its inventory aside from wishing for figurines, which only works for Tourists (non-Tourists will always have their figurines \"warp strangely\" and fail). Figurines of Star-emperors and empresses always \"warp strangely\" even for Tourists. They cannot be candled or reverse genocided. There are only 2 possible ways for them to spawn for other roles:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Star-elves and their grown-up forms can be found very rarely (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>24</sub> for Star-elves, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>48</sub> for Star-emperors, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>48</sub> for Star-empresses, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>12</sub> chance for any) in crystal skulls, and they will have their inventory.</li>\n<li>If a non-Madperson Elf findes the <a href=\"/wiki/Stranger\" title=\"Stranger\">Stranger</a> in bones, the \"yellow nasties\" it spawns can include a <a href=\"/index.php?title=Dream-leech&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Dream-leech (page does not exist)\">dream-leech</a> Star-elf with its inventory.</li></ul>\n<p>Crystal skulls do not spawn naturally as objects, and are only found on mind flayers (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>120</sub> chance), master mind flayers (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>90</sub> chance), or alhoons (guaranteed). The master mind flayers that spawn at level generation in R'lyeh are guaranteed to have crystal skulls as well, making the R'lyeh have a total of 5 guaranteed crystal skulls, as well as 2 earlier in the Lost Cities on the alhoons.\n</p><p>For sufficiently dedicated adventurers who check all 7 of those, they have a ~45% chance to find a crystal skull containing a set of imperial elven armor, but only a ~25% chance to get useful and upgradeable armor. The armor can then be removed from the skull via a <a href=\"/index.php?title=Trephination_kit&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Trephination kit (page does not exist)\">trephination kit</a> with charges - removing the armor directly from the summoned monster will cause it to vanish when that monster does. Note that the material can be random, and therefore potentially metallic. However, this is still of middling use considering it cannot be further upgraded without Dantalion - or for Tourists, by making prolonged eye contact with your summon. For sufficiently determined adventurers, it is nonetheless still technically possible and potentially strong, despite only being doable in under a quarter of games.\n</p><p>For extremely affluent Tourists with plenty of wishes available, wishing for imperial elven gear (most likely the body armor) is still an option. This requires at least one wish for each piece of gear, but does not solve the problem of your inability to upgrade them. You can wish for a figurine of a Star-elf to grant you the ability to upgrade it as well (if you don't already have Dantalion), but the armor they have is unupgradeable and therefore not worth your time. If this is your chosen route, wishing for mithril imperial elven armor is likely your best bet. Mithril grants an outstanding 9/9 base AC/DR, up from the 6/6 of wood, for only 146 weight (36 more). Furthermore, the body armor offers most of the majorly impactful upgrades. If you have the materials and upgrade kits available, this might actually even be worth your time and wishes.\n</p>\n<div style=\"display:none; right:10px; padding-bottom: 17px\" class=\"metadata topicon nopopups\"><div style=\"margin-top: -10px\"><a href=\"/wiki/NetHackWiki:Next_version\" title=\"This article describes a 3.4.3-based variant of NetHack.

[[dNetHack]] and [[notdNetHack]], and found nearly exclusively by [[Madmen]] and [[Anachrononaut]]s on their quests.\n\n==Generation==\nImperial elven gear is only spawned in three ways - the Anachrononaut Quest, the Elf Madman Quest, and on specific non-randomly generated monsters. This gear also counts as future tech, so only Tourists may wish for it normally. All pieces are typically made of wood, though can be rarely be made of mithril, silver, copper, gold or bone with probabilities identical to normal non-cloth elven gear. All pieces are inherently magical.\n\nImperial elven gear comes in two subtypes: upgradeable and non-upgradeable.\n\n===Upgradeable gear===\nUpgradeable armor pieces mostly occur in fixed locations in the game, and have story-line reasons why they were damaged and need repairs.\n\n*For Elf Madpeople specifically, there is a full set of thoroughly burnt rotted imperial elven gear in their quest. This armor is always made of wood and bright green. It is located directly under - but not in the inventory - of Lady Constance. This set begins with no upgrades. \n*There is a full set of thoroughly rotted imperial elven gear on each lower filler level for [[Anachrononaut]]s (including Androids), with a small chance to find extra pieces lying around those same levels. Those sets are also random colors, instead of always bright green. These armors have no upgrades already applied, but can be upgraded as normal by anyone with the capabilities. This can be any material possible with the usual odds, and thus will almost always be wood.\n*[[Star-emperor]]s and [[Star-empress|empresses]] have a full set of gear, and unlike other sources of upgradeable gear these have some upgrades already applied. The boots have the [[speed]] and kicking upgrades. The gloves have the dexterity, strength, increased damage, and grappling upgrades. The body armor has the [[flying]], fast healing, [[immunity to sickness|sickness resistance]], and medium armor upgrades. Finally, the helm has the [[breathless|breathlessness]], and accuracy upgrades. These monsters are found inside mind flayer [[crystal skull]]s.\n*[[Puppet-emperor Xeleth]] and [[Puppet-empress Xedalli]] each have a set of technically-upgradeable golden gear that already has all possible upgrades applied. However, this set is also self-cursing and infested with byakhee larvae. If the PC were to equip the full set of gear they would take around 52 points of damage per turn from the biting and stinging larvae, and would likely be unable to quickly remove it due to its self-cursing behavior. These enemies are also exclusively found on the Planes for Elf Madpeople, and therefore out of reach for normal runs anyway.\n\n===Non-upgradeable gear===\nNon-upgradeable gear is found in the inventories of certain monsters, typically with upgrades already applied. Unlike upgradeable gear, this gear is missing features simply because it is less sophisticated, and cannot be upgraded any further no matter what you do.\n\n* [[Star-elves]] have a full set of imperial elven gear, with a random material following the usual odds. The gloves have the dexterity upgrade, the body armor has the [[immunity to sickness|sickness resistance]] upgrade, the helm has the [[breathless|breathlessness]], blindness resistance, and accuracy upgrade, and the boots have no upgrades.\n* [[Carcosan courtier]]s in the future - in either Anachrononaut quest, specifically - have a 5% chance to have a plain golden set of imperial elven armor with a smattering of upgrades. The boots have speed, the gloves strength, the helm the same as Star-elves, and flying, sickness resistance, and reflection on the body armor. These are useful intrinsics to have, but Anachrononauts are guaranteed ''upgradeable'' imperial elven gear as well; if the player desires better versions of this gear can be assembled.\n\n==Upgrades==\nThe main draws of imperial elven gear are their upgradeable abilities. Each piece can be upgraded separately, using an [[upgrade kit]] in conjunction with a specific item to add a new property to that specific piece of gear. All upgrades are slot-specific, must be worn to apply their effects, and do not stack with the same upgrade or other sources of the same property (except where specified). Any upgrade kits or items spent are consumed upon applying the upgrade.\n\nIf imperial elven gear is found in a [[bones]] level, it will have the same upgrades and upgradable status as in its source game.\n\nTo upgrade a piece of gear, you must have learned how via some source. Otherwise, upgrade kits will simply not display the prompt. There are only four ways to have the ability to upgrade imperial elven armor: You must have started as an Anachrononaut, opened your quest box as an Elf Madperson, bound [[Dantalion]] at any point (this is a permanent knowledge unlock, Dantalion does not have to still be bound), or have seen a Star-elf, Star-emperor, or Star-empress as a Tourist. For other roles, or for non-Elf madpeople, the only option for learning how to upgrade imperial elven gear is Dantalion.\n\nThe upgrade prompt will offer to \"repair\" a piece of imperial armor, and the armor must not be worn while upgrading. Upon choosing a piece of gear, it will ask which item to use to 'repair' the armor piece - if no items in your inventory are valid upgrade materials, this will abort the repair process with nothing consumed. \n\nUpgrade materials must be type-identified to be offered as choices - so an unidentified ring of increase damage will not work with gauntlets, for example, but once it's been identified it will display as a possible option. Some upgrades can take two or more items as possible materials - for example invisibility on the armor can come from a cloak of invisibility, a ring of invisibility, or even a wand of make invisible. These upgrades can still only be applied once, even if you try with the other possible materials. No upgrades are mutually exclusive - with sufficient upgrade kits, it is possible to have all upgrades at once. \n\nAny upgrades that apply an enchantment-scaling bonus use the enchantment of the imperial elven armor piece, rather than the upgrade material consumed. All upgrade materials only check the base item type and identification status, so even wands with expended charges, negatively enchanted items, or anything else. No traits of the original item are kept and used for anything after the upgrade completes.\n\nThere is no way to know what upgrades result from which items in-game, to know which items can be used to upgrade gear, or even to know which properties (aside from the ones that have obvious on-wear or inspect effects) a given piece of armor has. However, the below table summarizes all possible upgrades for each piece of gear. Separate recipes for the same upgrade are included as separate entries for ease of sorting.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! armor slot\n! property granted\n! upgrade material\n! in-game upgrade name\n|-\n| helm\n| [[breathless|breathlessnesss]]\n| [[amulet of magical breathing]]\n| life support subsystem\n|-\n| helm\n| [[see invisible]]\n| [[ring of see invisible]]\n| crystal eye\n|-\n| helm\n| [[telepathy]]\n| [[helm of telepathy]]\n| extrasensory perception subsystem\n|-\n| helm\n| [[telepathy]]\n| [[amulet of ESP]]\n| extrasensory perception subsystem\n|-\n| helm\n| [[teleport control]]\n| [[ring of teleport control]]\n| teleportation control subsystem\n|-\n| helm\n| [[protection from shape changers]]\n| [[ring of protection from shape changers]]\n| self-bored lens\n|-\n| helm\n| life sense (shows living monsters in line of sight, even if blind)\n| [[wand of draining]]\n| life-sign sensor\n|-\n| helm\n| blindness resistance (ala the [[Eyes of the Overworld]]), protects vs. attacks to the eyes, enables protection vs. mind flayer attacks, and +1 AC and DR.\n| [[crystal helm]]\n| visor\n|-\n| helm\n| increased accuracy (+enchantment to accuracy)\n| [[ring of increase accuracy]]\n| targeting subsystem\n|-\n| body armor\n| [[flying]]\n| [[flying boots]]\n| moth wings\n|-\n| body armor\n| [[sustain ability]]\n| [[ring of sustain ability]]\n| stasis subsystem\n|-\n| body armor\n| fast healing (heals 1 HP/turn, stacks with [[regeneration]], no hunger cost)\n| [[ring of regeneration]]\n| medical subsystem\n|-\n| body armor\n| fast healing (heals 1 HP/turn, stacks with [[regeneration]], no hunger cost)\n| [[amulet of wound closure]]\n| medical subsystem\n|-\n| body armor\n| [[reflection]]\n| [[amulet of reflection]]\n| reflective chestplate\n|-\n| body armor\n| [[reflection]]\n| [[shield of reflection]]\n| reflective chestplate\n|-\n| body armor\n| [[reflection]]\n| [[jumpsuit]]\n| reflective chestplate\n|-\n| body armor\n| [[immunity to sickness|sickness resistance]]\n| [[healer uniform]]\n| sealed bodyglove\n|-\n| body armor\n| [[immunity to sickness|sickness resistance]]\n| [[amulet vs. sickness]]\n| sealed bodyglove\n|-\n| body armor\n| [[half physical damage]]\n| [[cloak of protection]]\n| ballistic base layer\n|-\n| body armor\n| [[half spell damage]]\n| [[cloak of magic resistance]]\n| dispersive underlayer\n|-\n| body armor\n| [[half spell damage]]\n| [[orihalcyon gauntlets]]\n| dispersive underlayer\n|-\n| body armor\n| [[displacement]]\n| [[cloak of displacement]]\n| holographic projector\n|-\n| body armor\n| [[invisibility]]\n| [[cloak of invisibility]]\n| active camouflage system\n|-\n| body armor\n| [[invisibility]]\n| [[ring of invisibility]]\n| active camouflage system\n|-\n| body armor\n| [[invisibility]]\n| [[wand of make invisible]]\n| active camouflage system\n|-\n| body armor\n| bonus AC (+enchantment to AC specifically, stacks with normal AC/DR from enchantment)\n| [[ring of protection]]\n| deflectors\n|-\n| body armor\n| counts as medium armor, gaining 1/2 dex bonus (normally heavy armor, no dex bonus), also gives +1 AC and DR.\n| [[elven mithril coat]]\n| mithril articulation\n|-\n| gloves\n| [[swimming]]\n| [[water walking boots]]\n| swimming webs\n|-\n| gloves\n| 25 strength when worn\n| [[gauntlets of power]]\n| power servos\n|-\n| gloves\n| bonus dexterity (+enchantment to dexterity)\n| [[gauntlets of dexterity]]\n| dexterity servos\n|-\n| gloves\n| bonus damage (+enchantment to damage)\n| [[ring of increase damage]]\n| microtargeting servos\n|-\n| gloves\n| ability to fire aura bolts from your hands\n| [[wand of magic missile]]\n| missile projectors\n|-\n| gloves\n| grapples struck targets (only when struck by the gauntlets, not a melee weapon)\n| [[amulet of strangulation]]\n| grappling servos\n|-\n| boots\n| [[jumping]]\n| [[jumping boots]]\n| jump jets\n|-\n| boots\n| very fast [[speed]]\n| [[speed boots]]\n| speed boosters\n|-\n| boots\n| very fast [[speed]]\n| [[wand of speed monster]]\n| speed boosters\n|-\n| boots\n| very fast [[speed]]\n| [[ring of alacrity]]\n| speed boosters\n|-\n| boots\n| [[teleportitis]]\n| [[wand of teleportation]]\n| blink subsystem\n|-\n| boots\n| [[teleportitis]]\n| [[ring of teleportation]]\n| blink subsystem\n|-\n| boots\n| counts as kicking boots when kicking\n| [[kicking boots]]\n| concussive impactors\n|}\n\n== Strategy == \n\n=== Practical usage ===\n\nIn most cases, the practical limitations on your upgrades come from the number of upgrade kits in the game rather than the materials to upgrade with. Quite a few can spawn in the [[Law quest (dNetHack)|Caves of Law]] and as the random tools in the [[Gnomish Mines]], but besides those you would have to find them pretty much randomly. As such, it's important to ration your upgrade kits, and use them wisely on useful upgrades. \n\nNotable upgrades include [[half physical damage]] and [[half spell damage]] on your armor for general purpose use, [[flying]] on your armor and very fast [[speed]] on your boots to free up an armor or ring slot (a must-have for most builds using a full set of imperial elven armor), and [[sustain ability]] on your armor to free up a ring slot. Equally powerful but more situational upgrades include 25 strength on your gauntlets for melee builds (nearly a must-have for them, mediocre otherwise), [[immunity to sickness|sickness resistance]] and [[regeneration|fast healing]] on your body armor (helpful for nearly everybody, but less impactful some other upgrades), and [[breathless|breathlessness]] on your helm (again, helpful but less impactful). \n\nEven partially upgraded imperial elven gear, assuming you manage to get the powerful upgrades at least, is likely better than the majority of other available armors out there - since this is balanced out by its extreme rarity. It is notably missing magic resistance, free action and possibly drain resistance, but otherwise can supplant nearly all of an ascension kit armor-wise. You still have a free cloak slot, most likely for a cloak of magic resistance if you don't have that slotlessly, plus a free shirt slot and two free ring slots for free action (chef's choice for the second ring). Imperial elven helms and boots are likely the most supplantable, since the helms don't provide any crucial intrinsics (and the boots only really necessitate a speed upgrade), so if you're running short on upgrade kits you can forgo those pieces in favor of another helm or pair of boots you already possess. Helms of drain resistance and boots of speed are practical alternatives, or helms of brilliance for would-be casters. No set bonus is granted for wearing all 4 items, after all.\n\n=== Obtaining black-market copies ===\n\nPractically speaking, the only way for non-Elf-Madperson non-Anachrononaut roles to get imperial elven gear is by finding them in bones, or off a Star-elf or their grown-up forms (Star-emperors and Star-empresses). Unfortunately, there is no way to force a Star-elf spawn in a way that includes its inventory aside from wishing for figurines, which only works for Tourists (non-Tourists will always have their figurines \"warp strangely\" and fail). Figurines of Star-emperors and empresses always \"warp strangely\" even for Tourists. They cannot be candled or reverse genocided. There are only 2 possible ways for them to spawn for other roles:\n*Star-elves and their grown-up forms can be found very rarely ({{frac|24}} for Star-elves, {{frac|48}} for Star-emperors, {{frac|48}} for Star-empresses, {{frac|12}} chance for any) in crystal skulls, and they will have their inventory.\n*If a non-Madperson Elf findes the [[Stranger]] in bones, the \"yellow nasties\" it spawns can include a [[dream-leech]] Star-elf with its inventory.\n\nCrystal skulls do not spawn naturally as objects, and are only found on mind flayers ({{frac|120}} chance), master mind flayers ({{frac|90}} chance), or alhoons (guaranteed). The master mind flayers that spawn at level generation in R'lyeh are guaranteed to have crystal skulls as well, making the R'lyeh have a total of 5 guaranteed crystal skulls, as well as 2 earlier in the Lost Cities on the alhoons.\n\nFor sufficiently dedicated adventurers who check all 7 of those, they have a ~45% chance to find a crystal skull containing a set of imperial elven armor, but only a ~25% chance to get useful and upgradeable armor. The armor can then be removed from the skull via a [[trephination kit]] with charges - removing the armor directly from the summoned monster will cause it to vanish when that monster does. Note that the material can be random, and therefore potentially metallic. However, this is still of middling use considering it cannot be further upgraded without Dantalion - or for Tourists, by making prolonged eye contact with your summon. For sufficiently determined adventurers, it is nonetheless still technically possible and potentially strong, despite only being doable in under a quarter of games.\n\nFor extremely affluent Tourists with plenty of wishes available, wishing for imperial elven gear (most likely the body armor) is still an option. This requires at least one wish for each piece of gear, but does not solve the problem of your inability to upgrade them. You can wish for a figurine of a Star-elf to grant you the ability to upgrade it as well (if you don't already have Dantalion), but the armor they have is unupgradeable and therefore not worth your time. If this is your chosen route, wishing for mithril imperial elven armor is likely your best bet. Mithril grants an outstanding 9/9 base AC/DR, up from the 6/6 of wood, for only 146 weight (36 more). Furthermore, the body armor offers most of the majorly impactful upgrades. If you have the materials and upgrade kits available, this might actually even be worth your time and wishes.\n{{variant-343}}\n[[Category:dNetHack armor]]\n[[Category:notdNetHack armor]]"}

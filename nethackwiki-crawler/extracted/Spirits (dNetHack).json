{"title":"Spirits (dNetHack)","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Spirits_(dNetHack)","type":"markdown","data":"**Spirits** are a mechanic specific to [dNetHack](/wiki/DNetHack \"DNetHack\"), and a core component of the [Binder](/wiki/Binder_\\(dNetHack_role\\) \"Binder (dNetHack role)\") role, though other roles can often partially interact with them, allowing for additional flexibility and utility outside of the ordinary for that role.\n\nA user has suggested improving this page or section as follows:\n\n*\"Strategy section on usefulness of particular spirits to other roles?\"*\n\nA spirit typically consists of the following:\n\n- An engraved seal, used to bind the spirit, and an associated binding ritual, which requires the player fulfill certain criteria to bind to a given spirit.\n- A taboo, a condition that must be true in order for the spirit to stay bound. Violating a taboo causes the associated spirit to unbind and drain a level from the player, ignoring drain resistance.\n- Zero or more skills (typically at least one), which are permanently [unrestricted](/wiki/Unrestricted \"Unrestricted\") and which may be advanced further while the spirit is bound.\n- Zero or more active powers (typically at least one), which may be used up to once every 25 turns by means of the command ^F or #power.\n- Zero or more passive powers (typically at least one), which are used automatically.\n- A mark which, if not concealed, will cause [priests](/wiki/Aligned_priest \"Aligned priest\") and [shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper \"Shopkeeper\") to ban you from their establishments at minimum. A higher number of visible binding marks will cause them to call the [Keter Sephiroth](/wiki/Keter_Sephiroth \"Keter Sephiroth\") (specifically, the [Daat Sephiroth](/wiki/Keter_Sephiroth#Daat_Sephirah \"Keter Sephiroth\")). Priests may additionally summon a number of servants from their deity to strike you down.\n\nAlmost all bindings expire after 5000 turns, requiring them to be bound again.\n\nMost roles only have a single slot to bind a spirit to, while Binders gain many more as they level up, and also possess several special slots to hold unique spirits in.\n\nMany active powers use a spirit die to determine the potency of their effects. The spirit die increases along with your level, according to the following table. Binders and non-Binders alike use the same die sizes.\n\n| Level range | Rank Title   | Die size |\n| ----------- | ------------ | -------- |\n| 1-2         | Exile        | 1        |\n| 3-5         | Heretic      | d2       |\n| 6–9         | Cultist      | d3       |\n| 10–13       | Binder       | d4       |\n| 14–17       | Akousmatikoi | d5       |\n| 18–21       | Mathematikoi | d6       |\n| 22–25       | Doctor       | d7       |\n| 26–29       | Unbinder     | d8       |\n| 30          | Gnostikos    | d9       |\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 The Spirits of the Near Void](#The_Spirits_of_the_Near_Void)\n\n  - [1.1 Ahazu, the Seizer](#Ahazu.2C_the_Seizer)\n  - [1.2 Amon, the Shadow Before the Altar](#Amon.2C_the_Shadow_Before_the_Altar)\n  - [1.3 Andrealphus, Marquis of Angles](#Andrealphus.2C_Marquis_of_Angles)\n  - [1.4 Andromalius, the Repentant Rogue](#Andromalius.2C_the_Repentant_Rogue)\n  - [1.5 Astaroth, the Broken Clockmaker](#Astaroth.2C_the_Broken_Clockmaker)\n  - [1.6 Balam, the Last Sacrifice](#Balam.2C_the_Last_Sacrifice)\n  - [1.7 Berith, the Red Horseman](#Berith.2C_the_Red_Horseman)\n  - [1.8 Buer, who walks all places](#Buer.2C_who_walks_all_places)\n  - [1.9 Chupoclops the Hope-trapper](#Chupoclops_the_Hope-trapper)\n  - [1.10 Dantalion, Star Emperor](#Dantalion.2C_Star_Emperor)\n  - [1.11 Echidna, Mother of Monsters](#Echidna.2C_Mother_of_Monsters)\n  - [1.12 Eden, the First Garden](#Eden.2C_the_First_Garden)\n  - [1.13 Enki, God of the First City](#Enki.2C_God_of_the_First_City)\n  - [1.14 Eurynome, the Lonely Dancer](#Eurynome.2C_the_Lonely_Dancer)\n  - [1.15 Eve, the First Sinner](#Eve.2C_the_First_Sinner)\n  - [1.16 Fafnir, Jotunn Dragon](#Fafnir.2C_Jotunn_Dragon)\n  - [1.17 Huginn and Muninn, Thought and Memory](#Huginn_and_Muninn.2C_Thought_and_Memory)\n  - [1.18 Iris, Friend from Afar](#Iris.2C_Friend_from_Afar)\n  - [1.19 Jack, of the Lantern](#Jack.2C_of_the_Lantern)\n  - [1.20 Malphas, Prince of Crows](#Malphas.2C_Prince_of_Crows)\n  - [1.21 Marionette, Puppet of Screams](#Marionette.2C_Puppet_of_Screams)\n  - [1.22 Mother, who beheld beauty](#Mother.2C_who_beheld_beauty)\n  - [1.23 Naberius, mysterious councilor](#Naberius.2C_mysterious_councilor)\n  - [1.24 Orthos, Sovereign of the Howling Dark](#Orthos.2C_Sovereign_of_the_Howling_Dark)\n  - [1.25 Ose, Dreamer in a Drowned City](#Ose.2C_Dreamer_in_a_Drowned_City)\n  - [1.26 Otiax, the Key to the Gate](#Otiax.2C_the_Key_to_the_Gate)\n  - [1.27 Paimon, the Fell Archivist](#Paimon.2C_the_Fell_Archivist)\n  - [1.28 Shiro, the stone soldier](#Shiro.2C_the_stone_soldier)\n  - [1.29 Simurgh, who roosts on the Tree of Life](#Simurgh.2C_who_roosts_on_the_Tree_of_Life)\n  - [1.30 Tenebrous, the Demonic Shadow](#Tenebrous.2C_the_Demonic_Shadow)\n  - [1.31 Ymir, Lord of the Grassless Gap](#Ymir.2C_Lord_of_the_Grassless_Gap)\n\n- [2 The Two Spirits of the Gate](#The_Two_Spirits_of_the_Gate)\n\n  - [2.1 Dahlver-Nar, the First Binder](#Dahlver-Nar.2C_the_First_Binder)\n  - [2.2 Acererak, the Demi-Lich](#Acererak.2C_the_Demi-Lich)\n\n- [3 The Seven Spirits of Conflict](#The_Seven_Spirits_of_Conflict)\n\n  - [3.1 Cosmos, Goddess of Crystal](#Cosmos.2C_Goddess_of_Crystal)\n  - [3.2 Mediator, shard of the Living Gate](#Mediator.2C_shard_of_the_Living_Gate)\n  - [3.3 Telperion and Laurelin, the Two Trees](#Telperion_and_Laurelin.2C_the_Two_Trees)\n  - [3.4 Miska, the Wolf-Spider](#Miska.2C_the_Wolf-Spider)\n  - [3.5 Nudzirath, the Mirrored Destructor](#Nudzirath.2C_the_Mirrored_Destructor)\n  - [3.6 The Alignment Thing](#The_Alignment_Thing)\n  - [3.7 The Unknown God](#The_Unknown_God)\n\n- [4 The Spirits of the Outer Void](#The_Spirits_of_the_Outer_Void)\n\n  - [4.1 The Council of Elements](#The_Council_of_Elements)\n  - [4.2 Numina, The Whispering Multitude](#Numina.2C_The_Whispering_Multitude)\n\n- [5 The Spirit of Shadow](#The_Spirit_of_Shadow)\n  - [5.1 The Black Web Entity](#The_Black_Web_Entity)\n\n- [6 References](#References)\n\n# The Spirits of the Near Void\n\nThe 31 Spirits of the Near Void are the most basic and common of the spirits in dNethack. Binders passively learn all 31 seals as they level up. By level 13, they'll know all 31. Other roles can learn them from finding the seal on the ground or by using artifacts such as [The Book of Lost Names](/wiki/DNetHack_artifacts#The_Book_of_Lost_Names \"DNetHack artifacts\") or the [Necronomicon](/wiki/DNetHack_artifacts#The_Necronomicon \"DNetHack artifacts\").\n\nBinders have a certain number of spirit slots for them per level, but non-Binders can bind a maximum of one Spirit of the Near Void at a time.\n\n| Level range | Binder rank title | Max spirits bound | Total seals known |\n| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |\n| 1           | Exile             | 1                 | 3                 |\n| 2           |                   |                   | 5                 |\n| 3           | Heretic           | 2                 | 7                 |\n| 4           |                   |                   | 10                |\n| 5           |                   |                   | 12                |\n| 6           | Cultist           |                   | 14                |\n| 7           |                   | 17                |                   |\n| 8           |                   | 19                |                   |\n| 9           |                   | 21                |                   |\n| 10          | Binder            | 3                 | 24                |\n| 11          |                   |                   | 26                |\n| 12          |                   |                   | 28                |\n| 13          |                   |                   | 31                |\n| 14–17       | Akousmatikoi      |                   |                   |\n| 18–21       | Mathematikoi      | 4                 |                   |\n| 22–25       | Doctor            |                   |                   |\n| 26–29       | Unbinder          | 5                 |                   |\n| 30          | Gnostikos         |                   |                   |\n\n## Ahazu, the Seizer\n\nAll shall feed the Shattered Night.\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nAhazu's seal must be drawn in a square containing a pit trap.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not become weak with hunger while bound to Ahazu.\n\n**Mark**\n\nThere is a starry void in the back of your throat.\n\nThis mark won't be detected from a distance, and can be hidden by wearing a mask or R'lyehian faceplate.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nYou are immune to engulfing attacks.\n\n**Skill**\n\nFlails, including iron balls. Hitting with an iron ball will train flail skill as it does for [Convicts](/wiki/Convict \"Convict\").\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Abduction**: Attempt to remove single adjacent monster from the game. You must have injured the monster with a melee attack or a thrown or fired projectile. The monster is not killed, so this will not count as it being slain for any purposes, it merely vanishes. You do not receive any experience, the monster is not counted as killed for quest or other purposes (including the Temple of Chaos artifacts), and there is no way to bring it back. All of their inventory vanishes with them, except unique items or indestructible artifacts - which only includes alignment keys, the Annulus, the Silver Key & the Pen of the Void. Your [prayer timeout](/wiki/Prayer_timeout \"Prayer timeout\") or god's [anger](/wiki/Anger \"Anger\") is decreased as though you had [sacrificed](/wiki/Sacrifice \"Sacrifice\") the victim, and you gain any beneficial effects that you would have gained from eating their corpse, while avoiding any harmful effects. You do not gain any [nutrition](/wiki/Nutrition \"Nutrition\") from abducted creatures.\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Engulf**: Creatures you attack in melee will be abducted at 10% hp or less. This is meant to be as much a hindrance as a help.\n- **Shadow Well**: Creatures you attack in melee have a 20% chance of losing their next move.\n- **Swallow**: You can eat any meal in 1 turn. You still suffer any negative effects of the food (acidic, poisonous, etc.) unlike abduction. The duration of any [temporary intrinsic](/wiki/Temporary_intrinsic \"Temporary intrinsic\") you receive by eating corpses is reduced by 10%.\n- **Hunger**: You lose nutrition at an increased rate (1 extra point per 10 turns).\n\n## Amon, the Shadow Before the Altar\n\n\"You shall have no other gods before Me.  \n  \nYou shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth.  \n  \nYou shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing loving kindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.  \n  \n\\[ Deuteronomy 5:6-21 ]\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nAmon can be contacted from anywhere; however, if there is an altar on the level the contract is immediately broken, draining a level and setting the spirit timeout.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not pray or donate to priests. The full atheist conduct is not required, other actions such as altar-testing are allowed.\n\n**Mark**\n\nYou grow a large pair of horns.\n\nThe horns can easily be seen from a distance, but will merge with any metal helm to become disguised.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nYou are immune to cold damage.\n\n**Skill**\n\nAmon grants skill in clerical spellcasting.\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Fire Breath**: Breathe a ray of fire, much like a red dragon. The ray deals 5 dice of fire damage to all creatures it hits, but requires to-hit rolls.\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Horns**: Your horns grant you an extra melee attack, a headbutt dealing 1d9 physical damage.\n- **See in Darkness**: You can see perfectly in darkness (Reversed for drows who can see perfect in light instead).\n\n## Andrealphus, Marquis of Angles\n\n\"Angles and curves multiply about me. I perceive great segments of time through curves. There is curved time, and angular time. The beings that exist in angular time cannot enter curved time. It is very strange.\"  \n  \nHis voice had risen to a scream. \"Frank, Frank, a terrible and unspeakable deed was done in the beginning. Before time, the deed, and from the deed—\"  \n  \nHe had risen and was hysterically pacing the room. \"The seeds of the deed move through angles in dim recesses of time. They are hungry and athirst!\"  \n  \n\\[ The Hounds of Tindalos (1929), by Frank Belknap Long]\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nAndrealphus exists in corners. His seal must be drawn in the corner of a room, and you must #chat to the seal such that the corner is across from you.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not dig through walls. It is permissible to dig through rough stone.\n\n**Mark**\n\nYour shadow takes on the semblance of depth.\n\nFrom a distance, the strangeness of your shadow can't be seen, and it can be hidden by standing in a dark square.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nYou gain teleport control.\n\n**Skill**\n\nAndrealphus grants skill in escape spells.\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Transdimensional Ray**: Fire an invisible beam that passes through walls, teleports struck monsters, and deals 1d5 dice of damage to them.\n- **Teleport**: Hungerless teleport.\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Angle-fighter**: When you stand in a corner, you get a (lvl/2)+1 bonus to AC.\n- **Strange angles**: You can always fit through narrow openings, regardless of your current carried weight.\n\n## Andromalius, the Repentant Rogue\n\nThere is a legend.  \n  \nOnce, there was a rogue, the favorite servant of the Thief God. With his dying breath, the rogue renounced theft, thereby stealing his soul from the God.\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nAndromalius's seal must contain any two of the following: a sack, a silver key, a golden ring, a coin, a dagger, an apple, a scroll, a tin whistle, a mirror, an egg (any kind), a potion, a dead cave spider, a dead member of your own race, a dead elf/dwarf/gnome/orc/hobbit/human/or primate, a spellbook, a bell, a set of lockpicks, a live sewer rat.\n\nThe chosen objects are removed from the game. In their place, Andromalius gives you a third item drawn from the list. You may receive a tame sewer rat as your third item.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not make use of any item that was stolen from a shopkeeper, nor directly steal from a shop. Warning: the binder's starting food and weapons are stolen, so (for example) eating the starting food will immediately unbind Andromalius.\n\n**Mark**\n\nYour facial features take on the rigidity of a bad disguise.\n\nYour odd face will not be noticed from a distance. You can also wear a mask or stay out of the light to disguise it.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nYou are immune to theft. This applies to both item and gold stealing theft attacks. This does apply to seduction theft attacks from nymphs and similar, but not standard seduction attacks from foocubi and similar.\n\n**Skill**\n\nAndromalius grants skill in daggers.\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Jester's Mirth**: Immobilize a single adjacent monster with laughter. If they pass a monster MR check, it will freeze them for 1 turn. Otherwise, freezes them for turns equal to a single binder die roll. They will be vulnerable to sneak attacks while immobilized.\n- **Thief's Instincts**: Detect hidden doors and traps.\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Detect Thieves**: You gain warning against all monsters with a theft attack. Which may be less useful than it sounds, given that they can't steal from you.\n- **Sneak attack**: You may make [sneak attacks](/wiki/Backstab \"Backstab\") like a Rogue.\n- **Know Stolen**: Any stolen items in your inventory are known to be stolen.\n\n## Astaroth, the Broken Clockmaker\n\nHe is very old. He is hurting very badly. He is underwater, in space, and everywhere else. He cannot get off his chair. He is stuck there forever because he is so badly hurt.  \n  \n\\[ SCP-1348, SCP Foundation ]  \n  \n…not afraid of The Lord, for He is as we are, broken and scattered. As we restore the body of God, so we restore ourselves. To join with the Lord is good. As we give honor and worship to the Lord, so does He honor us. To serve the Lord is good. As we guard the Lord from harm, so does He…  \n  \n\\[ Church of the Broken God Bible Fragments, SCP Foundation ]\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nAn eroded item (rusty, corroded, rotted, or burnt) item must be placed in the seal. The item is repaired as part of the ritual. Negative enchantment is also fixed, but a negatively enchanted item is not sufficient for the ritual to proceed, the item must also be eroded.\n\nAstaroth's ritual is different when binding him into the Pen of the Void. In the Pen's ritual, the Pen itself must be rusty or corroded.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not deliberately break inventory items. Breaking non-inventory items such as doors and iron bars is permissible. Fired ammunition mulching counts as deliberately broken.\n\n**Mark**\n\nYou weep tears of black oil.\n\nYour tears can be easily seen from a distance, so you must wear a blindfold, towel, or a mask to keep them hidden.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nWhile Astaroth is bound to you:\n\n- You have [shock resistance](/wiki/Shock_resistance \"Shock resistance\").\n- You are [breathless](/wiki/Breathless \"Breathless\").\n\n**Skill**\n\nAstaroth grants skill in crossbows and shuriken.\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Astaroth's Assembly**: Projects an invisible beam up to 5 spaces in the chosen direction. A electrical explosion centers on the first target struck. This explosion loses 1 die of damage per square traveled, causing a maximum of 5 dice of damage when centered in an adjacent square, and a minimum of 1 die of damage when centered in a square 5 spaces away. You gain 1 point of [protection](/wiki/Spellbook_of_protection \"Spellbook of protection\") as per the spell for each square that the beam travels without exploding, to a maximum of 5 points. 1 point of this protection wears off every 5 turns.\n- **Astaroth's Shards**: Fires a barrage of shuriken along random ranks. The barrage consists of shuriken equal to your die size + your level/10 + 1. You take damage equal to your die size. The barrage may be concentrated by activating it while standing in a corridor or other narrow space.\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Rusting**: You take 1 damage per turn from being underwater.\n\n## Balam, the Last Sacrifice\n\nMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish?  \n  \n\\[Psalm 22]\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nBalam's seal must be drawn on an icy square. You must wield a weapon when addressing Balam.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not sacrifice intelligent creatures.\n\n**Mark**\n\nFreezing water leaks from deep wounds in your wrists, ankles, and neck.\n\nBalam's mark can be seen at a distance, and is harder to disguise up close. A cloak or torso armor is sufficient at a distance, but up close you will also require gloves and boots to disguise it.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nYou gain [half spell damage](/wiki/Half_spell_damage \"Half spell damage\").\n\n**Skill**\n\nBalam grants skill in whips.\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Icy Glare**: Deals 5 dice of ice damage to the first target in the indicated direction, and half damage to all targets in a \\~90 degree wedge centered on the chosen direction. Blinds you for 5 turns. Also freezes water in the wedge. This power's range is 1 square/2 levels.\n- **Balam's Anointing**: Makes a touch attack (requiring a to-hit roll) against a single adjacent creature. Target takes 5 dice of cold damage. A target with a head and without thick skin may be killed outright (10% chance). A target with a head, eyes, and thick skin instead takes double damage and is blinded. Otherwise, this power has no extra effect.\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Balam's Martyrdom**: When you have DR above 10, you roll twice for DR when hit.\n\n## Berith, the Red Horseman\n\nFrom Baal: God, and Berith: Covenant. The name of a deity worshiped in ancient Canaan, reviled as a demon by the early Israelites, and later the Christians.\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nBerith requires that his seal be drawn around a set of riding gloves, riding boots, a saddle, a saber, a longsword, a bow, or a lance.\n\nAlternatively, the binder must wear a blessed silver ring on their left hand while chatting to the seal.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not kill a pet or former pet.\n\n**Mark**\n\nYou appear drenched in blood, as does your mount (if any).\n\nThe blood can be easily seen from a distance. If you wear torso armor, gloves, boots, and a helm the red color will take the form of enamel, rather than blood. You must dismount from your steed, however.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nYour mount (if any) benefits from some of your resistances. Resistances to fire, cold, shock, poison, acid, sleep, disintegration, stoning, drain, magic, death (ala Ose), and sickness are carried over. Notably, reflection is not.\n\n**Skill**\n\nBerith grants skill in lances, sabers, riding, and shields. He also increases your BAB to full (i.e. +1 to-hit per level), and makes you regenerate health twice as fast as normal.\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Blood Mercenary**: Fires an invisible beam dealing 5 dice of damage in a chosen direction. Damage is non-elemental, but must be financed by your visible gold; i.e., you lose gold equal to the total damage dealt by this attack.\n- **Sow Discord**: Monsters on the level attack each other for 5 turns + your die size.\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Blood-price**: Monsters may drop gold instead of corpses.\n\n## Buer, who walks all places\n\nWho are you, and where are you going?\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nThere are no restrictions or requirements to bind Buer.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not use death magic (wands of death and finger of death)\n\n**Mark**\n\nYour legs bifurcate into four cloven hooved feet.\n\nYour strange feet can be seen from a distance, but they can be hidden by wearing boots.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nYou gain extra health regeneration, approximately 6 \\* spirit die size hp per 90 turns. This is affected by a lit [Atma Weapon](/wiki/DNetHack_artifacts \"DNetHack artifacts\") as normal.\n\n**Skill**\n\nBuer grants skill in healing spells and martial arts. Binding Buer once will permanently teach you martial arts.\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Gift of Healing**: Heal single adjacent target of 5 dice of damage. May also be used to heal yourself. Is perhaps best used to keep your pets alive, as monster healing is MUCH slower than PC healing (1 hp per 20 turns).\n- **Gift of Health**: Clear most status ailments from single target.

He was the keeper of the divine powers called Me, the gifts of civilization. His image is a double-helix snake, or the Caduceus, very similar to the Rod of Asclepius used to symbolize medicine. He is often shown with the horned crown of divinity dressed in the skin of a carp.  \n  \nConsidered the master shaper of the world, god of wisdom and of all magic, Enki was characterized as the lord of the Abzu (Apsu in Akkadian), the freshwater sea or groundwater located within the earth. In the later Babylonian epic Enûma Eliš, Abzu, the \"begetter of the gods\", is inert and sleepy but finds his peace disturbed by the younger gods, so sets out to destroy them. His grandson Enki, chosen to represent the younger gods, puts a spell on Abzu \"casting him into a deep sleep\", thereby confining him deep underground. Enki subsequently sets up his home \"in the depths of the Abzu.\" Enki thus takes on all of the functions of the Abzu, including his fertilising powers as lord of the waters and lord of semen.  \n  \n\\[ Wikipedia ]\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nEnki's seal must be drawn in the center of at least a 5x5 open space.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not refuse any seduction attempts, although you can use an engagement ring to ward them off.\n\n**Mark**\n\nWater runs off your body in steady rivulets.\n\nThe water can be seen from a distance, so wear either a cloak or torso armor to disguise it.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nEnki protects your inventory from water damage.\n\n**Skill**\n\nEnki grants skill in short swords, hammers, sling, dart, and boomerang.

This means a non-martial artist will have die sizes of d2-d10, and a normal martial artist will have die sizes of d4-d12, re-rolling the size on every attack made.

Quick to the drink but short on paying for it, Jack had few friends and was known to curse a lovely day as often as a miserable one.  \n  \nOne night late, when all civil folk were home abed, Jack was at a pub near the crossroads outside his village. A stranger in a long coat and hat sat near. Hoping for sympathy, Jack moaned aloud that he would give his soul to the Devil if he had the money for one last drink. Quick as can be, the stranger beside him disappeared and close to Jack's hand lay the coins for his drink.  \n  \nNow although Jack was a drinking man, he was also a clever man and he knew now that stranger was no mere man. Being the thinking man, Jack snatched the coins from the counter and pocketed them in his purse where he kept a small silver cross. Trapped by the silver cross, the stranger, who was actually the Devil in disguise, had to agree not to claim Jack's soul for another ten years in order to escape Jack's pocket.  \n  \nNow time went by and as time does and Jack's ways never changed. Without family or friend, Jack contented himself walking about late after the pub had closed and one night, ten years hence, he came across the Devil himself on a dark country road.  \n  \nThe Devil reminded Jack of their bargain and Jack, still not eager to leave life, agreed to go if the Devil would feed his terrible hunger with an apple from a nearby tree. Hopping upon Jack's shoulder's, the Devil hoisted himself into the tree to get the apple. Quickly Jack took his small knife and carved a cross in the tree. Now as we all know, the Devil has no power in the air and was trapped in the tree by the cross on its trunk. This time Jack made the Devil promise never to come for him again. Having no choice, the Devil agreed.  \n  \nSome years later, Jack did meet his natural end. Because of his miserly and drinking ways, he was denied entrance to Heaven. The Devil himself turned him away at the entrance to Hell because he had promised years before never to take his soul. As the night was dark and the wind was howling, Jack begged the Devil for light to find his way. The Devil threw him an ember from the very fires of hell and Jack kept it lit inside a bit of rotten turnip that he found.  \n  \nEver since then, Jack has wandered the night with his wee lantern. He was seen from time to time, and still is, a bobbing light in the darkness, on windy nights out on the moors or along lonely country roads.

She could survive dragons, giants, waves of entropy, or even the stress of warping space-time.  \n  \nYet she was afraid, as were all of the conjurers in their own diamond circles that surrounded a larger circle which circumscribed her own along with a red-black blood-painted circle of binding. She could see it on their faces, even those demented alienists who were in truth prisoners barred from leaving the School's grounds. They seemed to be confounded that anyone might claim rulership over the Far Realms, yet rather than disdain their faces showed a newly minted fear of the plane they'd given themselves over to.  \n  \n\\[...]  \n  \nTwo binders of Otiax shifted uncomfortably, throwing glances at the locked iron doors that led out of this vast summoning chamber. The Key to the Gate, a vestige believed to have some connection to the Far Realm, would perhaps provide some revelations of its own to this event. It seemed dangerous and Thaakir had proclaimed their presence the very epitome of mages' obsession with knowledge leading to their downfall. But it had been Rhian who had calmed him. She sensed, in a way that no one else could, that the vestiges would not let her come to harm. Their need for her, palpable across realities, ensured their lack of betrayal.  \n  \nShe felt breath on her shoulder, and could feel a presence behind her though unseen.

It appears as a peacock with the head of a dog and the claws of a lion - sometimes, however, also with a human face. The simurgh is inherently benevolent and unambiguously female.  \n  \n\"Si-\", the first element in the name, has been connected in folk etymology to Modern Persian si (\"thirty\"). Although this prefix is not historically related to the origin of the name simurgh, \"thirty\" has nonetheless been the basis for legends incorporating that number - for instance, that the simurgh was as large as thirty birds or had thirty colours (siræng).  \n  \nIranian legends consider the bird so old that it had seen the destruction of the world three times over. The simurgh learned so much by living so long that it is thought to possess the knowledge of all the ages.  \n  \n\\[ Wikipedia ]\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nSimurgh's seal must be drawn outdoors (windowless tower level 1, or some parts of quests).\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not fall through trap doors or holes.\n\n**Mark**\n\nYou gain iron claws and prismatic feathers around your head.\n\nYour claws and feathers can be seen from a distance.

The fabled teeth of Dahlver-Nar, to which all the legends attribute miraculous powers, were neither his own nor those of the dragon he battled. They were the teeth of beings that became vestiges after death, and they could grant abilities similar to those that the vestiges themselves imparted. Pact magic treatises relate that Dahlver-Nar pulled out his own teeth and replaced them with those of the vestiges, but that using them all drove him mad. What happened thereafter is a matter of debate, but the texts maintain that Dahlver-Nar eventually died, and the teeth were lost, divided up among the squabbling followers he had managed to gain and then spread across the world. Today, Dahlver-Nar exists as a vestige in his own right—perhaps brought to that state through his close association with so many others.  \n  \n\\[ Tome of Magic, by Matthew Sernett et al. ]  \n  \nThirty-two horses on a red hill,  \nFirst they champ,  \nThen they stamp,  \nThen they stand still.  \n  \n\\[ Adapted from the Hobbit, by J.

Breaking this taboo does not drain a level and has no timeout.\n\n**Mark**\n\nBroken rings of fragmentary glyphs form and dissolve in the dustlight behind you. This mark cannot be hidden in any way.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nNone\n\n**Skill**\n\nNone\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Pseudonatural Surge**: When activated, paralyzes the user for 5 turns and begins an attack routine consisting of attacking all monsters within 2 tiles of you with tentacle attacks that have a 4⁄5 of hitting. Free action will not prevent this paralysis. These tentacles deal 5d(spirit die) damage, skipping over monsters that would be too dangerous to attack, such as stoning monsters, or Pale Night.\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Light of Balance**: The HP of you and all your pets is pooled and shared between you. Your combined current HP and maximum HP are added up, and each individual ends up with the same HP percentage as the others. This effect is recalculated at the end of every turn, including both your and monster turns.\n- **Lawful Mask**: You can handle lawful artifacts without them evading your grasp.\n- **Lawful Resonance**: The Pen of the Void deals an extra 2d4 damage to chaotic targets and 1d4 damage to neutral targets. After you complete your quest, this damage increases to 8d4 and 4d4 respectively.\n\n## Telperion and Laurelin, the Two Trees\n\n\"A! the Trees of Light, tall and shapely,  \ngold and silver, more glorious than the sun\"  \n\\[ The Flight of the Noldoli from Valinor, by J. R. R. Tolkien ]\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nThe Two Trees must have their seal drawn adjacent to a tree or plant monster, and the Binder must be directly across the seal from it when the ritual is performed. The seal of The Two Trees is learned from the Shard of Morgoth's Crown, recovered from the depths of the Mordor Borehole.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not bind another alignment quest spirit while bound to The Two Trees. Breaking this taboo does not drain a level and has no timeout.\n\n**Mark**\n\nGlorious dappled light dances on your body. This mark cannot be hidden in any way, except by being invisible.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nNone\n\n**Skill**\n\nNone\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Silver Dew**: Heals an adjacent tame or peaceful monster by 5d(spirit die), curing sleeping as well. Used on an adjacent hostile monster, deals 5d20 silver (if silver-hating) and 5d(spirit die) damage. Non-silver hating and non-flaming amphibious monsters take no damage, while silver-hating or flaming ones do take the full damage.\n- **Golden Dew**: Encourages an adjacent tame or peaceful monster by 5d(spirit die). Used on an adjacent hostile monster, deals 5d20 holy (if holy-hating) and 5d(spirit die) damage. Non-holy hating and non-flaming amphibious monsters take no damage, while holy-hating or flaming ones do take the full damage.\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Lawful Mask**: You can handle lawful artifacts without them evading your grasp.\n- **Lawful Resonance**: The Pen of the Void deals an extra 2d4 damage to chaotic targets and 1d4 damage to neutral targets. After you complete your quest, this damage increases to 8d4 and 4d4 respectively.\n\n## Miska, the Wolf-Spider\n\nA canvas's colors of blood and ichor soak the ground upon the fields of Pesh, mountains of corpses surrounding a creature whose body wavers between forms arachnid and lupine. Miska the Wolf-Spyder.  \n  \nThe wind dukes and their servants (slaves?) are falling, the former comets being doused and the latter as if a wind put darkens a field of candles. One duke is a pillar for the forces of Law and its allies, shining in its gorgeous androgyne nudity despite the vastness of Miska's shadow which flows through forms like quicksilver. In his hand is a simple black rod, elegant in its minimalism as befitting the nature of its orderly creators.  \n  \nWhat happens next is unclear - those who might have recalled these moments better are lost even to the great powers shining their light on this ancient past. One of the wind dukes that was there before the tide of the demonic horde fell upon them is dead, his body torn by gaping but perfectly circular holes. One of the Vaati has speared the body of the Miska the Wolf-Spyder, who is in his drider like form, his eye-holes pouring out light that strangely resembles rotted gold.  \n\\[ Blade of Innocence, Sciborg ]  \n  \nStricken, Miska wailed in anguish, and his screams were so terrible that every soldier on the battlefield was briefly transfixed. As Miska writhed in agony, his foul blood covered and penetrated the Rod. As the absolute Law imbued in the Rod mingled with the Chaos in Miska's blood, the fabric of the multiverse was ripped asunder. The Rod shattered into seven pieces and Miska was cast through a planar rift. The hordes of Chaos surged to the scene, but the Rod bearer gathered up the fragments and dove through the rift, sealing it.  \n\\[ The Rod of Seven Parts, Skip Williams ]\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nMiska's seal must be drawn in front of a square containing lava. Miska's seal is found engraved on the Rod of Seven Parts, at the top of the Arcadian Tower.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not bind another alignment quest spirit while bound to Miska. Breaking this taboo does not drain a level and has no timeout.\n\n**Mark**\n\nYou have 4 arms, and a wolf's head sprouts from both hips.\n\nYour distorted form can be seen from a distance, and cannot be disguised in any way, except for being invisible or being under level 10.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nNone\n\n**Skill**\n\nMiska grants skill in [two-weapon combat](/wiki/Twoweapon \"Twoweapon\").\n\n**Active Powers**\n\nNone\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Miska's Form**: Your distorted form grants you extra attacks, based on your level.\n\n  - **10th level and above**: A wolf head sprouts from your hip. You gain a poisonous bite attack, dealing 2d4 physical damage with a chance of poison.\n  - **18th level and above**: A second wolf head sprouts from your other hip. You gain a second poisonous bite attack.\n  - **26th level and above**: Two extra arms grow out of your back, granting you two additional weapon attacks. These attacks pick weapons or weapon-tools from your inventory and make a simple attack with them, as if you hit with it normally. Only one-handed items that could be normally held in your offhand are eligible, the weight of the eligible weapon is restricted by your [two weapon skill and size](/wiki/Twoweapon#dNetHack \"Twoweapon\"). The first two eligible weapons in order of a-z then A-Z are chosen and used.\n\n- **Chaotic Mask**: You can handle chaotic artifacts without them evading your grasp. The insight-gated effects of your [mercurial](/wiki/Mercurial \"Mercurial\") weapons are enabled (if you have sufficient insight), regardless of your [alignment](/wiki/Alignment \"Alignment\").\n\n- **Chaotic Resonance**: The Pen of the Void deals an extra 2d4 damage to lawful targets and 1d4 damage to neutral targets. After you complete your quest, this damage increases to 8d4 and 4d4 respectively.\n\n## Nudzirath, the Mirrored Destructor\n\nIn the center of the great rilmani city Sum of All, a building of strange angles stands, obviously not of rilmani construction. Ancient even amongst their number, the Mirrored Library once known as Timaresh holds untold amounts of lore from across the Multiverse.  \n\\[ Timaresh, the Mirrored Library, www\\.rilmani.org ]\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nNudzirath's seal must be drawn in a square containing a non-artifact mirror. The mirror is destroyed as part of the ritual. The seal is found on the surface of the Hand-Mirror of Cthylla, located in place of The Silver Key in R'lyeh for Binders. It can also be learned from some of the rare neutral Outlands artifact spawns, including Infinity's Mirrored Arc, Sansara Mirror, the Staff of Twelve Mirrors, and the Mirrored Mask.\n\nNudzirath is the only Spirit of Conflict bindable by non-Binders, but they must have learned Nudzirath's seal from somewhere else to bind it successfully. Finding the seal in bones or elsewhere is not enough, as that will not teach it to non-Binders. The neutral Outlands artifacts will not teach the seal to non-Binders. Learning the seal is left as an exercise for the player.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not bind another alignment quest spirit while bound to Nudzirath. Breaking this taboo does not drain a level and has no timeout.\n\n**Mark**\n\nA nimbus of tiny mirrored shards surrounds your head.\n\nThe nimbus can be seen from a distance, and cannot be hidden in any way.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nNone\n\n**Skill**\n\nNone\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Mirror Shatter**: You must wield a mirror to use this power. Choose a direction. If there is a mirror on the ground or in a monster's open inventory in the chosen direction, both that mirror and the one you wield will explode, and a beam of mirror fragments connects the two mirrors. Both the beam and the explosions deal 5 dice of damage, plus 1d20 silver damage to silver-hating monsters. If a monster is caught in both explosions and the beam, it takes a total of 15 dice of damage plus 3d20. You can throw a mirror to activate this power where the mirror lands, if it's off cooldown.\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Mirror Magic**: 2x damage for beam and ray spells (as Knight with Magic Mirror of Merlin).\n- **Mirror Soul**: Dead enemies drop mirrors with increased frequency. There is a 1⁄4 chance of one dropping from any enemy that would normally drop a corpse, and this does not replace the corpse or any other items.\n- **Fractured Heart**: The luck penalty for breaking mirrors is inverted, so you gain +2 luck for every mirror shattered.\n- **Obsidian Shards**: Thrown or fired obsidian weapons will explode wherever they land, causing 1d5 dice of damage. This stacks with the damage dealt by a thrown or fired obsidian weapon.\n- **Neutral Mask**: You can handle neutral artifacts without them evading your grasp. This only works for Binders.\n- **Neutral Resonance**: The Pen of the Void deals an extra 1d6 damage to chaotic and lawful targets. After you complete your quest, this damage increases to 4d6.\n\n## The Alignment Thing\n\nIt is called the Alignment Thing, and the Storm of Ideals. It is called Mother and Father. None of these phrases truly encapsulate what it is.  \n  \nIt is at once a creature, a planar layer, and a disturbance within the multi-dimensional matrix of Outside. It is a storm. It is an infection, bleeding astral pus. It is a parasite. It is another level of being. It is a community, a tribe, a memetic ecology, a multiverse in itself. It is bodiless mind. It is an endless sea of bodies. It is a war. It is love. It is sex. It is hunger. It is fear.  \n  \nIt is the accumulation of alien philosophies in the Realm Outside. It is Law, Chaos, Good, Evil, and Balance collected and reinterpreted, digested and recreated in the other, alien reality beyond space and time. Somehow, these forces have gained an altogether new sentience, neither unified nor separate, a great spiraling current around an unseen attractor. It is alive.  \n  \nLike most living things, it seeks to grow and propagate itself. Therefore it seeks portals into the Great Wheel from which its original substance comes so that it may gather more of these thoughts so foreign to its dimension and so familiar to our own.  \n  \nFor this reason the Storm of Ideals is often the first layer encountered by those foolish enough to cross the veil of Eternity and explore the unfathomable Beyond.  \n  \nA staggering variety of creatures inhabit and make up the substance of the Storm, each becoming stranger and more complex with every movement. The beings who make up the Thing continually exchange parts of their bodies and essence, never remaining the same for long. This is the current that fuels the Storm.  \n  \nAny who touch the substance of the Alignment Thing assumes an alignment subtype - either Good, Evil, Lawful, Chaotic, or none. Sometimes more than one subtype is gained. This subtype is permanent, probably the only permanent thing an inhabitant of the Storm of Ideals will ever know again as everything from bones and sinew to spell-like or psi-like abilities are exchanged with those up and downstream. The possessor of this subtype need not live up to it in their deeds and actions, since the alien nature of that which bequeathed it understands these notions very poorly. However, most will be influenced by their subtype to some extent.  \n  \n\\[ a layer of the far realms of insanity, by ripvanwormer ]\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nThe Alignment Thing's seal may be drawn anywhere. The Alignment Thing's seal is found etched in parts onto the second of each set of Alignment Keys, and once a Binder has held each key once, the seal will be learned.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not bind another alignment quest spirit while bound to the Alignment Thing. Breaking this taboo does not drain a level and has no timeout.\n\n**Mark**\n\nThere's a small black halo just behind your head. There is an eye in the center, staring at you.\n\nThe halo can be seen up close, and cannot be disguised in any way.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nYou aggravate monsters and have polymorph control.\n\n**Skill**\n\nNone\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Flowing Forms**: Polymorph yourself or a monster. This has a range of one square (so at yourself or adjacent). If nothing is targeted, does not go on cooldown. Monsters may resist as normal, as if you had cast a polymorph spell at them.\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Alignment Mask**: You can handle artifacts of all alignments without them evading your grasp.\n- **Alignment Resonance**: The Pen of the Void randomly deals an extra 2d4, 1d4, or no extra damage to all targets (equal odds). After you complete your quest, this damage increases to 8d4, 4d4, or still no extra damage respectively.\n\n## The Unknown God\n\n\"To the Gods of Asia and Europe and Africa,  \nto the unknown and strange gods.\"  \n\\[ Inscription found on an altar at Athens, \\~60AD ]\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nThe Unknown God's seal may be drawn anywhere. The seal is learned after donating an artifact to all 5 Priests of an Unknown God, located in the depths of the Neutral Quest.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nYou must not bind another alignment quest spirit while bound to the Unknown God. Breaking this taboo does not drain a level and has no timeout.\n\n**Mark**\n\nNone\n\n**Immunity**\n\nNone\n\n**Skill**\n\nNone\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Phase Step**: You are invulnerable for 5 turns, and can walk through anything. This is effectively phasing but stronger, and you are entirely untouched by the passage of time, the attacks of foes, and any effects that try to affect you. However, you can still perform actions of your own, including using items, attacking, and casting spells. Most effects you apply to yourself will apply as normal, but some timed effects may only begin to happen after Phase Step is over.\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Energy Fount**: You recover magic energy faster. This is an extra 6\\*your die size energy per 90 turns, and stacks with other sources of energy regeneration, for approximately 0.6 energy per turn at level 30.\n- **Unknown Resonance**: The Pen of the Void's enchantment is doubled and applied to your AC, not your damage. This effect only applies when the Pen is wielded, and is not affected by your quest completion status.\n\n# The Spirits of the Outer Void\n\nThese spirits represent the endgame for Binders, giving them a greater degree of control over the other spirits they have bound. They may only be bound by Binders, even if their seals are found in bones.\n\n## The Council of Elements\n\nWe are the Council of Elements  \nGuardians of the Material world  \nYou who straddle the line between our world and the void beyond  \nyou shall be our emissary to that which gave rise to us all\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nThe Council of Elements is bound automatically when a Binder is crowned. This spirit will never be unbound by time or taboo.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nNone - this will never be unbound.\n\n**Mark**\n\nYour eyes shine like stars.\n\nYour eyes can be seen from a distance, and can be disguised by covering your face. Note that lenses and living masks are see-through, and won't work.\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Embassy of Elements**: Allows you to bind a spirit of the near void to a special slot, without needing a binding ritual. This effectively gives you an extra spirit slot, albeit a somewhat limited one. Using the power while another spirit is already bound in the extra slot will unbind the first without penalty or timeout. You must have previously bound this spirit at least once before, and its binding cannot currently be on cooldown.\n\n## Numina, The Whispering Multitude\n\nThe literal meaning is simply \"a nod\", or more accurately, for it is a passive formation, \"that which is produced by nodding\", just as flamen is \"that which is produced by blowing\", i.e., a gust of wind. It came to mean \"the product or expression of power\" — not, be it noted, power itself.  \n  \n\\[ H. J. Rose ]\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nThe Numina can only be bound by 30th level Binders. The seal is silently learned once the Binder reaches level 30.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nThe Numina's pact breaks if the Binder ever loses a level.\n\n**Mark**\n\nThe Binder is surrounded by whispers.\n\nThe whispers can only be hear up close. The whispers can not be disguised.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nThe Numina grant immunity to [stun](/wiki/Stun \"Stun\") and [confusion](/wiki/Confusion \"Confusion\").\n\n**Skill**\n\nThe Numina allows access to all skills, but does not unrestrict nor grant a bonus to any skill.\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Identify**: Identifies inventory.\n- **Clairvoyance**: Map the local area.\n- **Find the Path**: Detect nearby magic portals.\n- **Gnostic Premonition**: Allows use of Gnostic Premonition despite having spirits bound (Bind any spirit of your choice for 5 turns). Cooldown is 25 turns instead of 125.\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Whispersense**: Intrinsic monster detection\n\n# The Spirit of Shadow\n\nThis spirit is the only spirit that Binders do not naturally have access to. Female myrkalfar (drow) Anachrononauts are permanently bound to it as part of their starting kit. Lawful male droven Priests, Rangers, Rogues, or Wizards learn the seal upon being crowned and can bind it conventionally. It occupies the same slot as the quest spirits (the Spirits of the Gate), and for Binders who learn this seal, it will behave the same when binding as them.\n\n## The Black Web Entity\n\nThe Black Web is a Far Realms entity that represents an inversion of the natural order; in which the shadows cast by webs are imbued with agency, and the thoughts and actions of living things flow deterministically from the choices of these shadows.  \n\\[ The Great Scribe ]\n\n**Binding Ritual**\n\nThe seal must be engraved on a lit square containing a web. This is flavored as using the shadow of the web. Binding the Black Web is not entirely healthy for those not of the Far Realms, so you're afflicted with minor damage. Due to direct contact with the Black Web Entity, you are blinded and made to hallucinate for 5 turns and lose (d8)d(d5+1) hp, and without poison resistance will additionally take 3-7 points of damage to a random ability score.\n\n**Taboo**\n\nNone.\n\n**Mark**\n\nYour shadow is wrapped in the black web. This black web can be seen if you're in a lit square and not invisible.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nNone.\n\n**Skill**\n\nNone.\n\n**Active Powers**\n\n- **Black Bolt**: Fires a poisoned stained faded (armor-phasing) shadowsteel spike in a given direction. The enchantment of the spike is 8+5d(spirit dice). This spike phases through walls to to hit a target. When it hits the target, creates a web and traps the target inside.\n- **Weave a Black Web**: For the next 5 turns, makes 4d8 shadowblade attacks to all adjacent hostile monsters. Hitting a monster during this period will trigger this again, but excluding the struck monster.\n\n**Passive Powers**\n\n- **Affinity for Entanglement**: You gain a -8 bonus to AC and +8 movement points when trapped in a web. You cannot destroy webs by any means, but tearing, burning, etc. out of a web will free you instantly as normal.\n- **Sharpened Shadows**: Your unarmed attacks are replaced with 4d8 shadowy spiritual weapon attacks known as shadowblades. As spiritual weapon attacks they bypass the AC/DR from the target's worn armor, and are guaranteed to hit shades/etc. like armor-phasing weapons. Shadowblades are always poisoned with normal poison. These attacks don't count as hitting with a wielded weapon or get any strength/skill/etc. bonus damage, but also get no unarmed combat bonuses from gloves, rings, or similar. Additionally, you can two-weapon with an empty offhand (which is replaced by a shadowblade). This offhand shadowblade is not affected by lack of two-weapon skill but does require a free hand like normal.\n\n# References\n\n1.

Quick to the drink but short on paying for it, Jack had few friends and was known to curse a lovely day as often as a miserable one.<br />\n<br />\nOne night late, when all civil folk were home abed, Jack was at a pub near the crossroads outside his village. A stranger in a long coat and hat sat near. Hoping for sympathy, Jack moaned aloud that he would give his soul to the Devil if he had the money for one last drink. Quick as can be, the stranger beside him disappeared and close to Jack's hand lay the coins for his drink.<br />\n<br />\nNow although Jack was a drinking man, he was also a clever man and he knew now that stranger was no mere man. Being the thinking man, Jack snatched the coins from the counter and pocketed them in his purse where he kept a small silver cross. Trapped by the silver cross, the stranger, who was actually the Devil in disguise, had to agree not to claim Jack's soul for another ten years in order to escape Jack's pocket.<br />\n<br />\nNow time went by and as time does and Jack's ways never changed. Without family or friend, Jack contented himself walking about late after the pub had closed and one night, ten years hence, he came across the Devil himself on a dark country road.<br />\n<br />\nThe Devil reminded Jack of their bargain and Jack, still not eager to leave life, agreed to go if the Devil would feed his terrible hunger with an apple from a nearby tree. Hopping upon Jack's shoulder's, the Devil hoisted himself into the tree to get the apple. Quickly Jack took his small knife and carved a cross in the tree. Now as we all know, the Devil has no power in the air and was trapped in the tree by the cross on its trunk. This time Jack made the Devil promise never to come for him again. Having no choice, the Devil agreed.<br />\n<br />\nSome years later, Jack did meet his natural end. Because of his miserly and drinking ways, he was denied entrance to Heaven. The Devil himself turned him away at the entrance to Hell because he had promised years before never to take his soul. As the night was dark and the wind was howling, Jack begged the Devil for light to find his way. The Devil threw him an ember from the very fires of hell and Jack kept it lit inside a bit of rotten turnip that he found.<br />\n<br />\nEver since then, Jack has wandered the night with his wee lantern. He was seen from time to time, and still is, a bobbing light in the darkness, on windy nights out on the moors or along lonely country roads. He became known as \"Jack-of-the Lantern,\" and over time just \"Jack-o-Lantern.\" <br />\n<br />\n[ Stingy Jack, retold by C.

The fabled teeth of Dahlver-Nar, to which all the legends attribute miraculous powers, were neither his own nor those of the dragon he battled. They were the teeth of beings that became vestiges after death, and they could grant abilities similar to those that the vestiges themselves imparted. Pact magic treatises relate that Dahlver-Nar pulled out his own teeth and replaced them with those of the vestiges, but that using them all drove him mad. What happened thereafter is a matter of debate, but the texts maintain that Dahlver-Nar eventually died, and the teeth were lost, divided up among the squabbling followers he had managed to gain and then spread across the world. Today, Dahlver-Nar exists as a vestige in his own right—perhaps brought to that state through his close association with so many others.<br />\n<br />\n[ Tome of Magic, by Matthew Sernett et al. ]<br />\n<br />\nThirty-two horses on a red hill,<br />\nFirst they champ,<br />\nThen they stamp,<br />\nThen they stand still.    <br />\n<br />\n[ Adapted from the Hobbit, by J.

It is called Mother and Father. None of these phrases truly encapsulate what it is.<br />\n<br />\nIt is at once a creature, a planar layer, and a disturbance within the multi-dimensional matrix of Outside. It is a storm. It is an infection, bleeding astral pus. It is a parasite. It is another level of being. It is a community, a tribe, a memetic ecology, a multiverse in itself. It is bodiless mind. It is an endless sea of bodies. It is a war. It is love. It is sex. It is hunger. It is fear.<br />\n<br />\nIt is the accumulation of alien philosophies in the Realm Outside. It is Law, Chaos, Good, Evil, and Balance collected and reinterpreted, digested and recreated in the other, alien reality beyond space and time. Somehow, these forces have gained an altogether new sentience, neither unified nor separate, a great spiraling current around an unseen attractor. It is alive.<br />\n<br />\nLike most living things, it seeks to grow and propagate itself. Therefore it seeks portals into the Great Wheel from which its original substance comes so that it may gather more of these thoughts so foreign to its dimension and so familiar to our own.<br />\n<br />\nFor this reason the Storm of Ideals is often the first layer encountered by those foolish enough to cross the veil of Eternity and explore the unfathomable Beyond.<br />\n<br />\nA staggering variety of creatures inhabit and make up the substance of the Storm, each becoming stranger and more complex with every movement. The beings who make up the Thing continually exchange parts of their bodies and essence, never remaining the same for long. This is the current that fuels the Storm.<br />\n<br />\nAny who touch the substance of the Alignment Thing assumes an alignment subtype - either Good, Evil, Lawful, Chaotic, or none. Sometimes more than one subtype is gained. This subtype is permanent, probably the only permanent thing an inhabitant of the Storm of Ideals will ever know again as everything from bones and sinew to spell-like or psi-like abilities are exchanged with those up and downstream. The possessor of this subtype need not live up to it in their deeds and actions, since the alien nature of that which bequeathed it understands these notions very poorly. However, most will be influenced by their subtype to some extent.<br />\n<br />\n[ a layer of the far realms of insanity, by ripvanwormer ]<br />\n</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:right\"> </div>\n</div></div>\n<p><b>Binding Ritual</b>\n</p><p>The Alignment Thing's seal may be drawn anywhere.

are a mechanic specific to [[dNetHack]], and a core component of the [[Binder_(dNetHack_role)|Binder]] role, though other roles can often partially interact with them, allowing for additional flexibility and utility outside of the ordinary for that role.\n\n{{todo|Strategy section on usefulness of particular spirits to other roles?}}\n\nA spirit typically consists of the following:\n*An engraved seal, used to bind the spirit, and an associated binding ritual, which requires the player fulfill certain criteria to bind to a given spirit.\n*A taboo, a condition that must be true in order for the spirit to stay bound. Violating a taboo causes the associated spirit to unbind and drain a level from the player, ignoring drain resistance.\n*Zero or more skills (typically at least one), which are permanently [[unrestricted]] and which may be advanced further while the spirit is bound.\n*Zero or more active powers (typically at least one), which may be used up to once every 25 turns by means of the command ^F or #power.\n*Zero or more passive powers (typically at least one), which are used automatically.\n*A mark which, if not concealed, will cause [[aligned priest|priests]] and [[shopkeeper]]s to ban you from their establishments at minimum. A higher number of visible binding marks will cause them to call the [[Keter Sephiroth]] (specifically, the [[Keter Sephiroth#Daat_Sephirah|Daat Sephiroth]]). Priests may additionally summon a number of servants from their deity to strike you down.\n\nAlmost all bindings expire after 5000 turns, requiring them to be bound again.\n\nMost roles only have a single slot to bind a spirit to, while Binders gain many more as they level up, and also possess several special slots to hold unique spirits in.\n\nMany active powers use a spirit die to determine the potency of their effects. The spirit die increases along with your level, according to the following table. Binders and non-Binders alike use the same die sizes.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n! Level range !! Rank Title !! Die size \n|-\n| 1-2 || Exile || 1\n|-\n| 3-5 || Heretic || d2\n|-\n| 6–9 || Cultist || d3\n|-\n| 10–13 || Binder || d4\n|-\n| 14–17 || Akousmatikoi || d5\n|-\n| 18–21 || Mathematikoi || d6\n|-\n| 22–25 || Doctor || d7\n|-\n| 26–29 || Unbinder || d8\n|-\n| 30 || Gnostikos || d9\n|}\n\n\n= The Spirits of the Near Void =\nThe 31 Spirits of the Near Void are the most basic and common of the spirits in dNethack. Binders passively learn all 31 seals as they level up. By level 13, they'll know all 31. Other roles can learn them from finding the seal on the ground or by using artifacts such as [[DNetHack_artifacts#The_Book_of_Lost_Names|The Book of Lost Names]] or the [[DNetHack_artifacts#The_Necronomicon|Necronomicon]].\n\nBinders have a certain number of spirit slots for them per level, but non-Binders can bind a maximum of one Spirit of the Near Void at a time.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n! Level range !! Binder rank title !! Max spirits bound !! Total seals known\n|-\n| 1 || rowspan=2 | Exile || rowspan=2 | 1 || 3\n|-\n| 2 || 5\n|-\n| 3 || rowspan=3 | Heretic || rowspan=7 | 2 || 7\n|-\n| 4 || 10\n|-\n| 5 || 12\n|-\n| 6 || rowspan=4 | Cultist || 14\n|-\n| 7 || 17\n|-\n| 8 || 19\n|-\n| 9 || 21\n|-\n| 10 || rowspan=4 | Binder || rowspan=5 | 3 || 24\n|-\n| 11 || 26\n|-\n| 12 || 28\n|-\n| 13 || rowspan=6 | 31\n|-\n| 14–17 || Akousmatikoi\n|-\n| 18–21 || Mathematikoi || rowspan=2 | 4\n|-\n| 22–25 || Doctor\n|-\n| 26–29 || Unbinder || rowspan=2 | 5\n|-\n| 30 || Gnostikos\n|}\n\n== Ahazu, the Seizer ==\n\n{{encyclopedia|\nAll shall feed the Shattered Night.\n}}\n\n'''Binding Ritual'''\n\nAhazu's seal must be drawn in a square containing a pit trap.\n\n'''Taboo'''\n\nYou must not become weak with hunger while bound to Ahazu.\n\n'''Mark'''\n\nThere is a starry void in the back of your throat.\n\nThis mark won't be detected from a distance, and can be hidden by wearing a mask or R'lyehian faceplate.\n\n'''Immunity'''\n\nYou are immune to engulfing attacks.\n\n'''Skill'''\n\nFlails, including iron balls. Hitting with an iron ball will train flail skill as it does for [[Convict]]s.\n\n''' Active Powers'''\n*'''Abduction''':  Attempt to remove single adjacent monster from the game. You must have injured the monster with a melee attack or a thrown or fired projectile. The monster is not killed, so this will not count as it being slain for any purposes, it merely vanishes. You do not receive any experience, the monster is not counted as killed for quest or other purposes (including the Temple of Chaos artifacts), and there is no way to bring it back. All of their inventory vanishes with them, except unique items or indestructible artifacts - which only includes alignment keys, the Annulus, the Silver Key & the Pen of the Void. Your [[prayer timeout]] or god's [[anger]] is decreased as though you had [[sacrifice]]d the victim, and you gain any beneficial effects that you would have gained from eating their corpse, while avoiding any harmful effects. You do not gain any [[nutrition]] from abducted creatures.\n\n'''Passive Powers'''\n*'''Engulf''': Creatures you attack in melee will be abducted at 10% hp or less. This is meant to be as much a hindrance as a help.\n*'''Shadow Well''': Creatures you attack in melee have a 20% chance of losing their next move.\n*'''Swallow''': You can eat any meal in 1 turn. You still suffer any negative effects of the food (acidic, poisonous, etc.) unlike abduction. The duration of any [[temporary intrinsic]] you receive by eating corpses is reduced by 10%.\n*'''Hunger''': You lose nutrition at an increased rate (1 extra point per 10 turns).\n\n== Amon, the Shadow Before the Altar ==\n{{encyclopedia|\n\"You shall have no other gods before Me.\n\nYou shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth.\n\nYou shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing loving kindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.\n\n[ Deuteronomy 5:6-21 ]\n}}\n\n'''Binding Ritual'''\n\nAmon can be contacted from anywhere; however, if there is an altar on the level the contract is immediately broken, draining a level and setting the spirit timeout.\n\n''' Taboo '''\n\nYou must not pray or donate to priests. The full atheist conduct is not required, other actions such as altar-testing are allowed.\n\n'''Mark'''\n\nYou grow a large pair of horns.\n\nThe horns can easily be seen from a distance, but will merge with any metal helm to become disguised.\n\n'''Immunity'''\n\nYou are immune to cold damage.\n\n'''Skill'''\n\nAmon grants skill in clerical spellcasting.\n\n'''Active Powers'''\n*'''Fire Breath''': Breathe a ray of fire, much like a red dragon. The ray deals 5 dice of fire damage to all creatures it hits, but requires to-hit rolls.\n\n'''Passive Powers'''\n*'''Horns''': Your horns grant you an extra melee attack, a headbutt dealing 1d9 physical damage.\n*'''See in Darkness''': You can see perfectly in darkness (Reversed for drows who can see perfect in light instead).\n\n== Andrealphus, Marquis of Angles ==\n{{encyclopedia|\n\"Angles and curves multiply about me. I perceive great segments of time through curves. There is curved time, and angular time. The beings that exist in angular time cannot enter curved time. It is very strange.\"\n\nHis voice had risen to a scream. \"Frank, Frank, a terrible and unspeakable deed was done in the beginning. Before time, the deed, and from the deed—\"\n\nHe had risen and was hysterically pacing the room. \"The seeds of the deed move through angles in dim recesses of time. They are hungry and athirst!\"\n\n[ The Hounds of Tindalos (1929), by Frank Belknap Long]\n}}\n\n'''Binding Ritual'''\n\nAndrealphus exists in corners. His seal must be drawn in the corner of a room, and you must #chat to the seal such that the corner is across from you.\n\n'''Taboo'''\n\nYou must not dig through walls. It is permissible to dig through rough stone.\n\n'''Mark'''\n\nYour shadow takes on the semblance of depth.\n\nFrom a distance, the strangeness of your shadow can't be seen, and it can be hidden by standing in a dark square.\n\n'''Immunity'''\n\nYou gain teleport control.\n\n'''Skill'''\n\nAndrealphus grants skill in escape spells.\n\n'''Active Powers'''\n*'''Transdimensional Ray''': Fire an invisible beam that passes through walls, teleports struck monsters, and deals 1d5 dice of damage to them.\n*'''Teleport''': Hungerless teleport.\n\n'''Passive Powers'''\n*'''Angle-fighter''': When you stand in a corner, you get a (lvl/2)+1 bonus to AC. \n*'''Strange angles''': You can always fit through narrow openings, regardless of your current carried weight.\n\n== Andromalius, the Repentant Rogue ==\n{{encyclopedia|\nThere is a legend.\n\nOnce, there was a rogue, the favorite servant of the Thief God. With his dying breath, the rogue renounced theft, thereby stealing his soul from the God.\n}}\n'''Binding Ritual'''\n\nAndromalius's seal must contain any two of the following: a sack, a silver key, a golden ring, a coin, a dagger, an apple, a scroll, a tin whistle, a mirror, an egg (any kind), a potion, a dead cave spider, a dead member of your own race, a dead elf/dwarf/gnome/orc/hobbit/human/or primate, a spellbook, a bell, a set of lockpicks, a live sewer rat.\n\nThe chosen objects are removed from the game. In their place, Andromalius gives you a third item drawn from the list.  You may receive a tame sewer rat as your third item.\n\n'''Taboo'''\n\nYou must not make use of any item that was stolen from a shopkeeper, nor directly steal from a shop. Warning: the binder's starting food and weapons are stolen, so (for example) eating the starting food will immediately unbind Andromalius.\n\n'''Mark'''\n\nYour facial features take on the rigidity of a bad disguise.\n\nYour odd face will not be noticed from a distance. You can also wear a mask or stay out of the light to disguise it.\n\n'''Immunity'''\n\nYou are immune to theft. This applies to both item and gold stealing theft attacks. This does apply to seduction theft attacks from nymphs and similar, but not standard seduction attacks from foocubi and similar.\n\n'''Skill'''\n\nAndromalius grants skill in daggers.\n\n'''Active Powers'''\n*'''Jester's Mirth''': Immobilize a single adjacent monster with laughter. If they pass a monster MR check, it will freeze them for 1 turn. Otherwise, freezes them for turns equal to a single binder die roll. They will be vulnerable to sneak attacks while immobilized.\n*'''Thief's Instincts''': Detect hidden doors and traps.\n\n'''Passive Powers'''\n*'''Detect Thieves''': You gain warning against all monsters with a theft attack. Which may be less useful than it sounds, given that they can't steal from you.\n*'''Sneak attack''': You may make [[Backstab|sneak attacks]] like a Rogue.\n*'''Know Stolen''': Any stolen items in your inventory are known to be stolen.\n\n== Astaroth, the Broken Clockmaker ==\n{{encyclopedia|\n\nHe is very old. He is hurting very badly. He is underwater, in space, and everywhere else. He cannot get off his chair. He is stuck there forever because he is so badly hurt.\n\n[ SCP-1348, SCP Foundation ]\n\n…not afraid of The Lord, for He is as we are, broken and scattered. As we restore the body of God, so we restore ourselves. To join with the Lord is good. As we give honor and worship to the Lord, so does He honor us. To serve the Lord is good. As we guard the Lord from harm, so does He…\n\n[ Church of the Broken God Bible Fragments, SCP Foundation ]\n}}\n\n'''Binding Ritual'''\n\nAn eroded item (rusty, corroded, rotted, or burnt) item must be placed in the seal. The item is repaired as part of the ritual. Negative enchantment is also fixed, but a negatively enchanted item is not sufficient for the ritual to proceed, the item must also be eroded.\n\nAstaroth's ritual is different when binding him into the Pen of the Void. In the Pen's ritual, the Pen itself must be rusty or corroded.\n\n'''Taboo'''\n\nYou must not deliberately break inventory items. Breaking non-inventory items such as doors and iron bars is permissible. Fired ammunition mulching counts as deliberately broken.\n\n'''Mark'''\n\nYou weep tears of black oil.\n\nYour tears can be easily seen from a distance, so you must wear a blindfold, towel, or a mask to keep them hidden.\n\n'''Immunity'''\n\nWhile Astaroth is bound to you:\n*You have [[shock resistance]].\n*You are [[breathless]].\n\n'''Skill'''\n\nAstaroth grants skill in crossbows and shuriken.\n\n'''Active Powers'''\n*'''Astaroth's Assembly''': Projects an invisible beam up to 5 spaces in the chosen direction. A electrical explosion centers on the first target struck. This explosion loses 1 die of damage per square traveled, causing a maximum of 5 dice of damage when centered in an adjacent square, and a minimum of 1 die of damage when centered in a square 5 spaces away.

He was the keeper of the divine powers called Me, the gifts of civilization. His image is a double-helix snake, or the Caduceus, very similar to the Rod of Asclepius used to symbolize medicine. He is often shown with the horned crown of divinity dressed in the skin of a carp.\n\nConsidered the master shaper of the world, god of wisdom and of all magic, Enki was characterized as the lord of the Abzu (Apsu in Akkadian), the freshwater sea or groundwater located within the earth. In the later Babylonian epic Enûma Eliš, Abzu, the \"begetter of the gods\", is inert and sleepy but finds his peace disturbed by the younger gods, so sets out to destroy them. His grandson Enki, chosen to represent the younger gods, puts a spell on Abzu \"casting him into a deep sleep\", thereby confining him deep underground. Enki subsequently sets up his home \"in the depths of the Abzu.\" Enki thus takes on all of the functions of the Abzu, including his fertilising powers as lord of the waters and lord of semen.\n\n[ Wikipedia ]\n}}\n\n'''Binding Ritual'''\n\nEnki's seal must be drawn in the center of at least a 5x5 open space.\n\n'''Taboo'''\n\nYou must not refuse any seduction attempts, although you can use an engagement ring to ward them off.\n\n'''Mark'''\n\nWater runs off your body in steady rivulets.\n\nThe water can be seen from a distance, so wear either a cloak or torso armor to disguise it.\n\n'''Immunity'''\n\nEnki protects your inventory from water damage.\n\n'''Skill'''\n\nEnki grants skill in short swords, hammers, sling, dart, and boomerang.

Wearing the Great Claws of Urdlen increases your multiplier by 2. This means a non-martial artist will have die sizes of d2-d10, and a normal martial artist will have die sizes of d4-d12, re-rolling the size on every attack made. If the size rolled is lower than your normal (without Eurynome bound) die size, your normal die size will be used instead.

Quick to the drink but short on paying for it, Jack had few friends and was known to curse a lovely day as often as a miserable one.\n\nOne night late, when all civil folk were home abed, Jack was at a pub near the crossroads outside his village. A stranger in a long coat and hat sat near. Hoping for sympathy, Jack moaned aloud that he would give his soul to the Devil if he had the money for one last drink. Quick as can be, the stranger beside him disappeared and close to Jack's hand lay the coins for his drink.\n\nNow although Jack was a drinking man, he was also a clever man and he knew now that stranger was no mere man. Being the thinking man, Jack snatched the coins from the counter and pocketed them in his purse where he kept a small silver cross. Trapped by the silver cross, the stranger, who was actually the Devil in disguise, had to agree not to claim Jack's soul for another ten years in order to escape Jack's pocket.\n\nNow time went by and as time does and Jack's ways never changed. Without family or friend, Jack contented himself walking about late after the pub had closed and one night, ten years hence, he came across the Devil himself on a dark country road.\n\nThe Devil reminded Jack of their bargain and Jack, still not eager to leave life, agreed to go if the Devil would feed his terrible hunger with an apple from a nearby tree. Hopping upon Jack's shoulder's, the Devil hoisted himself into the tree to get the apple. Quickly Jack took his small knife and carved a cross in the tree. Now as we all know, the Devil has no power in the air and was trapped in the tree by the cross on its trunk. This time Jack made the Devil promise never to come for him again. Having no choice, the Devil agreed.\n\nSome years later, Jack did meet his natural end. Because of his miserly and drinking ways, he was denied entrance to Heaven. The Devil himself turned him away at the entrance to Hell because he had promised years before never to take his soul. As the night was dark and the wind was howling, Jack begged the Devil for light to find his way. The Devil threw him an ember from the very fires of hell and Jack kept it lit inside a bit of rotten turnip that he found.\n\nEver since then, Jack has wandered the night with his wee lantern. He was seen from time to time, and still is, a bobbing light in the darkness, on windy nights out on the moors or along lonely country roads. He became known as \"Jack-of-the Lantern,\" and over time just \"Jack-o-Lantern.\" \n\n[ Stingy Jack, retold by C.

The fabled teeth of Dahlver-Nar, to which all the legends attribute miraculous powers, were neither his own nor those of the dragon he battled. They were the teeth of beings that became vestiges after death, and they could grant abilities similar to those that the vestiges themselves imparted. Pact magic treatises relate that Dahlver-Nar pulled out his own teeth and replaced them with those of the vestiges, but that using them all drove him mad. What happened thereafter is a matter of debate, but the texts maintain that Dahlver-Nar eventually died, and the teeth were lost, divided up among the squabbling followers he had managed to gain and then spread across the world.

Miska the Wolf-Spyder.\n\nThe wind dukes and their servants (slaves?) are falling, the former comets being doused and the latter as if a wind put darkens a field of candles. One duke is a pillar for the forces of Law and its allies, shining in its gorgeous androgyne nudity despite the vastness of Miska's shadow which flows through forms like quicksilver. In his hand is a simple black rod, elegant in its minimalism as befitting the nature of its orderly creators. \n\nWhat happens next is unclear - those who might have recalled these moments better are lost even to the great powers shining their light on this ancient past. One of the wind dukes that was there before the tide of the demonic horde fell upon them is dead, his body torn by gaping but perfectly circular holes. One of the Vaati has speared the body of the Miska the Wolf-Spyder, who is in his drider like form, his eye-holes pouring out light that strangely resembles rotted gold.\n[ Blade of Innocence, Sciborg ]\n\nStricken, Miska wailed in anguish, and his screams were so terrible that every soldier on the battlefield was briefly transfixed. As Miska writhed in agony, his foul blood covered and penetrated the Rod. As the absolute Law imbued in the Rod mingled with the Chaos in Miska's blood, the fabric of the multiverse was ripped asunder. The Rod shattered into seven pieces and Miska was cast through a planar rift. The hordes of Chaos surged to the scene, but the Rod bearer gathered up the fragments and dove through the rift, sealing it.\n[ The Rod of Seven Parts, Skip Williams ]\n}}\n\n'''Binding Ritual'''\n\nMiska's seal must be drawn in front of a square containing lava.

You gain a second poisonous bite attack.\n**'''26th level and above''': Two extra arms grow out of your back, granting you two additional weapon attacks. These attacks pick weapons or weapon-tools from your inventory and make a simple attack with them, as if you hit with it normally. Only one-handed items that could be normally held in your offhand are eligible, the weight of the eligible weapon is restricted by your [[Twoweapon#dNetHack|two weapon skill and size]]. The first two eligible weapons in order of a-z then A-Z are chosen and used. \n*'''Chaotic Mask''': You can handle chaotic artifacts without them evading your grasp. The insight-gated effects of your [[mercurial]] weapons are enabled (if you have sufficient insight), regardless of your [[alignment]].\n*'''Chaotic Resonance''': The Pen of the Void deals an extra 2d4 damage to lawful targets and 1d4 damage to neutral targets.

The mirror is destroyed as part of the ritual. The seal is found on the surface of the Hand-Mirror of Cthylla, located in place of The Silver Key in R'lyeh for Binders. It can also be learned from some of the rare neutral Outlands artifact spawns, including Infinity's Mirrored Arc, Sansara Mirror, the Staff of Twelve Mirrors, and the Mirrored Mask.\n\nNudzirath is the only Spirit of Conflict bindable by non-Binders, but they must have learned Nudzirath's seal from somewhere else to bind it successfully. Finding the seal in bones or elsewhere is not enough, as that will not teach it to non-Binders. The neutral Outlands artifacts will not teach the seal to non-Binders. Learning the seal is left as an exercise for the player.\n\n'''Taboo'''\n\nYou must not bind another alignment quest spirit while bound to Nudzirath. Breaking this taboo does not drain a level and has no timeout. \n\n'''Mark'''\n\nA nimbus of tiny mirrored shards surrounds your head.\n\nThe nimbus can be seen from a distance, and cannot be hidden in any way.\n\n'''Immunity'''\n\nNone\n\n'''Skill'''\n\nNone\n\n'''Active Powers'''\n*'''Mirror Shatter''':  You must wield a mirror to use this power. Choose a direction. If there is a mirror on the ground or in a monster's open inventory in the chosen direction, both that mirror and the one you wield will explode, and a beam of mirror fragments connects the two mirrors. Both the beam and the explosions deal 5 dice of damage, plus 1d20 silver damage to silver-hating monsters. If a monster is caught in both explosions and the beam, it takes a total of 15 dice of damage plus 3d20. You can throw a mirror to activate this power where the mirror lands, if it's off cooldown.\n\n'''Passive Powers'''\n*'''Mirror Magic''': 2x damage for beam and ray spells (as Knight with Magic Mirror of Merlin).\n*'''Mirror Soul''': Dead enemies drop mirrors with increased frequency. There is a {{frac|4}} chance of one dropping from any enemy that would normally drop a corpse, and this does not replace the corpse or any other items.\n*'''Fractured Heart''': The luck penalty for breaking mirrors is inverted, so you gain +2 luck for every mirror shattered.\n*'''Obsidian Shards''': Thrown or fired obsidian weapons will explode wherever they land, causing 1d5 dice of damage.  This stacks with the damage dealt by a thrown or fired obsidian weapon.\n*'''Neutral Mask''': You can handle neutral artifacts without them evading your grasp. This only works for Binders.\n*'''Neutral Resonance''': The Pen of the Void deals an extra 1d6 damage to chaotic and lawful targets. After you complete your quest, this damage increases to 4d6.\n\n== The Alignment Thing ==\n{{encyclopedia|\nIt is called the Alignment Thing, and the Storm of Ideals. It is called Mother and Father. None of these phrases truly encapsulate what it is.\n\nIt is at once a creature, a planar layer, and a disturbance within the multi-dimensional matrix of Outside. It is a storm. It is an infection, bleeding astral pus. It is a parasite. It is another level of being. It is a community, a tribe, a memetic ecology, a multiverse in itself. It is bodiless mind. It is an endless sea of bodies. It is a war. It is love. It is sex. It is hunger. It is fear.\n\nIt is the accumulation of alien philosophies in the Realm Outside. It is Law, Chaos, Good, Evil, and Balance collected and reinterpreted, digested and recreated in the other, alien reality beyond space and time. Somehow, these forces have gained an altogether new sentience, neither unified nor separate, a great spiraling current around an unseen attractor. It is alive.\n\nLike most living things, it seeks to grow and propagate itself. Therefore it seeks portals into the Great Wheel from which its original substance comes so that it may gather more of these thoughts so foreign to its dimension and so familiar to our own.\n\nFor this reason the Storm of Ideals is often the first layer encountered by those foolish enough to cross the veil of Eternity and explore the unfathomable Beyond.\n\nA staggering variety of creatures inhabit and make up the substance of the Storm, each becoming stranger and more complex with every movement. The beings who make up the Thing continually exchange parts of their bodies and essence, never remaining the same for long. This is the current that fuels the Storm.\n\nAny who touch the substance of the Alignment Thing assumes an alignment subtype - either Good, Evil, Lawful, Chaotic, or none. Sometimes more than one subtype is gained. This subtype is permanent, probably the only permanent thing an inhabitant of the Storm of Ideals will ever know again as everything from bones and sinew to spell-like or psi-like abilities are exchanged with those up and downstream. The possessor of this subtype need not live up to it in their deeds and actions, since the alien nature of that which bequeathed it understands these notions very poorly. However, most will be influenced by their subtype to some extent.\n\n[ a layer of the far realms of insanity, by ripvanwormer ]\n}}\n\n'''Binding Ritual'''\n\nThe Alignment Thing's seal may be drawn anywhere. The Alignment Thing's seal is found etched in parts onto the second of each set of Alignment Keys, and once a Binder has held each key once, the seal will be learned.\n\n'''Taboo'''\n\nYou must not bind another alignment quest spirit while bound to the Alignment Thing. Breaking this taboo does not drain a level and has no timeout. \n\n'''Mark'''\n\nThere's a small black halo just behind your head. There is an eye in the center, staring at you.\n\nThe halo can be seen up close, and cannot be disguised in any way.\n\n'''Immunity'''\n\nYou aggravate monsters and have polymorph control.\n\n'''Skill'''\n\nNone\n\n'''Active Powers'''\n*'''Flowing Forms''': Polymorph yourself or a monster. This has a range of one square (so at yourself or adjacent). If nothing is targeted, does not go on cooldown. Monsters may resist as normal, as if you had cast a polymorph spell at them.\n\n'''Passive Powers'''\n*'''Alignment Mask''': You can handle artifacts of all alignments without them evading your grasp.\n*'''Alignment Resonance''': The Pen of the Void randomly deals an extra 2d4, 1d4, or no extra damage to all targets (equal odds).

This is effectively phasing but stronger, and you are entirely untouched by the passage of time, the attacks of foes, and any effects that try to affect you. However, you can still perform actions of your own, including using items, attacking, and casting spells. Most effects you apply to yourself will apply as normal, but some timed effects may only begin to happen after Phase Step is over.\n\n'''Passive Powers'''\n*'''Energy Fount''': You recover magic energy faster. This is an extra 6*your die size energy per 90 turns, and stacks with other sources of energy regeneration, for approximately 0.6 energy per turn at level 30.\n*'''Unknown Resonance''': The Pen of the Void's enchantment is doubled and applied to your AC, not your damage. This effect only applies when the Pen is wielded, and is not affected by your quest completion status.\n\n= The Spirits of the Outer Void =\nThese spirits represent the endgame for Binders, giving them a greater degree of control over the other spirits they have bound. They may only be bound by Binders, even if their seals are found in bones.\n\n== The Council of Elements ==\n{{encyclopedia|\nWe are the Council of Elements\nGuardians of the Material world\nYou who straddle the line between our world and the void beyond\nyou shall be our emissary to that which gave rise to us all\n}}\n\n'''Binding Ritual'''\n\nThe Council of Elements is bound automatically when a Binder is crowned. This spirit will never be unbound by time or taboo.\n\n'''Taboo'''\n\nNone - this will never be unbound.\n\n'''Mark'''\n\nYour eyes shine like stars.\n\nYour eyes can be seen from a distance, and can be disguised by covering your face. Note that lenses and living masks are see-through, and won't work.\n\n'''Active Powers'''\n*'''Embassy of Elements''': Allows you to bind a spirit of the near void to a special slot, without needing a binding ritual. This effectively gives you an extra spirit slot, albeit a somewhat limited one. Using the power while another spirit is already bound in the extra slot will unbind the first without penalty or timeout. You must have previously bound this spirit at least once before, and its binding cannot currently be on cooldown.\n\n== Numina, The Whispering Multitude ==\n{{encyclopedia|\nThe literal meaning is simply \"a nod\", or more accurately, for it is a passive formation, \"that which is produced by nodding\", just as flamen is \"that which is produced by blowing\", i.e., a gust of wind. It came to mean \"the product or expression of power\" — not, be it noted, power itself.\n\n[ H. J. Rose ]\n}}\n\n'''Binding Ritual'''\n\nThe Numina can only be bound by 30th level Binders.

The whispers can not be disguised.\n\n'''Immunity'''\n\nThe Numina grant immunity to [[stun]] and [[confusion]].\n\n'''Skill'''\n\nThe Numina allows access to all skills, but does not unrestrict nor grant a bonus to any skill.\n\n'''Active Powers'''\n*'''Identify''': Identifies inventory.\n*'''Clairvoyance''': Map the local area.\n*'''Find the Path''': Detect nearby magic portals.\n*'''Gnostic Premonition''': Allows use of Gnostic Premonition despite having spirits bound (Bind any spirit of your choice for 5 turns). Cooldown is 25 turns instead of 125.\n\n'''Passive Powers'''\n*'''Whispersense''': Intrinsic monster detection\n\n= The Spirit of Shadow =\nThis spirit is the only spirit that Binders do not naturally have access to. Female myrkalfar (drow) Anachrononauts are permanently bound to it as part of their starting kit. Lawful male droven Priests, Rangers, Rogues, or Wizards learn the seal upon being crowned and can bind it conventionally. It occupies the same slot as the quest spirits (the Spirits of the Gate), and for Binders who learn this seal, it will behave the same when binding as them.\n\n== The Black Web Entity ==\n{{encyclopedia|\nThe Black Web is a Far Realms entity that represents an inversion of the natural order; in which the shadows cast by webs are imbued with agency, and the thoughts and actions of living things flow deterministically from the choices of these shadows.\n[ The Great Scribe ]\n}}\n\n'''Binding Ritual'''\n\nThe seal must be engraved on a lit square containing a web. This is flavored as using the shadow of the web. Binding the Black Web is not entirely healthy for those not of the Far Realms, so you're afflicted with minor damage. Due to direct contact with the Black Web Entity, you are blinded and made to hallucinate for 5 turns and lose (d8)d(d5+1) hp, and without poison resistance will additionally take 3-7 points of damage to a random ability score.\n\n'''Taboo'''\n\nNone.\n\n'''Mark'''\n\nYour shadow is wrapped in the black web. This black web can be seen if you're in a lit square and not invisible.\n\n'''Immunity'''\n\nNone.\n\n'''Skill'''\n\nNone.\n\n'''Active Powers'''\n*'''Black Bolt''': Fires a poisoned stained faded (armor-phasing) shadowsteel spike in a given direction. The enchantment of the spike is 8+5d(spirit dice). This spike phases through walls to to hit a target. When it hits the target, creates a web and traps the target inside.\n*'''Weave a Black Web''': For the next 5 turns, makes 4d8 shadowblade attacks to all adjacent hostile monsters. Hitting a monster during this period will trigger this again, but excluding the struck monster.\n\n'''Passive Powers'''\n*'''Affinity for Entanglement''': You gain a -8 bonus to AC and +8 movement points when trapped in a web. You cannot destroy webs by any means, but tearing, burning, etc. out of a web will free you instantly as normal.\n*'''Sharpened Shadows''': Your unarmed attacks are replaced with 4d8 shadowy spiritual weapon attacks known as shadowblades. As spiritual weapon attacks they bypass the AC/DR from the target's worn armor, and are guaranteed to hit shades/etc. like armor-phasing weapons. Shadowblades are always poisoned with normal poison. These attacks don't count as hitting with a wielded weapon or get any strength/skill/etc. bonus damage, but also get no unarmed combat bonuses from gloves, rings, or similar. Additionally, you can two-weapon with an empty offhand (which is replaced by a shadowblade). This offhand shadowblade is not affected by lack of two-weapon skill but does require a free hand like normal.\n\n= References =\n<references />\n{{variant-343}}\n[[Category:dNetHack]]\n[[Category:notdNetHack]]\n[[Category:dNetHack spirits]]\n[[Category:notdNetHack spirits]]"}

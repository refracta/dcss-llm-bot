[User:Hackemslashem](/wiki/User:Hackemslashem \"User:Hackemslashem\") with the goal of becoming the next successor to [SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\"). Simply put, Hack'EM is \"Hack, Extended Mechanics.\" Starting with version 1.3.0, [User:malor](/index.php?title=User:Malor\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"User:Malor (page does not exist)\") has taken over to keep Hack'EM alive and help it continue to evolve!\n\n## Main menu\n\n[Template:HackEMMonsters](/index.php?title=Template:HackEMMonsters\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Template:HackEMMonsters (page does not exist)\")\n\nClick on a glyph to go to that monster's page.\n\n- [Hack'EM Frequently Asked Questions](/wiki/Hack%27EM_Frequently_Asked_Questions \"Hack'EM Frequently Asked Questions\")\n- [Hack'EM strategy guide for vanilla players](/wiki/Hack%27EM_strategy_guide_for_vanilla_players \"Hack'EM strategy guide for vanilla players\")\n\n**Info on new content and changes to existing content:**\n\n- [Item (Hack'EM)](/wiki/Item_\\(Hack%27EM\\) \"Item (Hack'EM)\")\n- [Monster (Hack'EM)](/wiki/Monster_\\(Hack%27EM\\) \"Monster (Hack'EM)\") [(Unabridged listing of all monsters)](/wiki/Monster_\\(Hack%27EM\\)/Full_list \"Monster (Hack'EM)/Full list\")\n- [Roles and races (Hack'EM)](/wiki/Roles_and_races_\\(Hack%27EM\\) \"Roles and races (Hack'EM)\")\n- [Artifact (Hack'EM)](/wiki/Artifact_\\(Hack%27EM\\) \"Artifact (Hack'EM)\")\n\nScript generated pages:\n\n- [Hack'EM monsters](/wiki/Hack%27EM_monsters \"Hack'EM monsters\")\n- [Hack'EM items](/wiki/Hack%27EM_items \"Hack'EM items\")\n\n## About\n\n### Welcome to Hack'EM!\n\nWhen hackemslashem first started this project, it was an attempt to modernize [SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\") and bring it to a modern post-NetHack 3.4.3 environment. He started with [EvilHack](/wiki/EvilHack \"EvilHack\") as a base because he was intrigued by the challenging reputation of EvilHack and the comprehensive feature set it contained. However, as the project proceeded he found many other interesting mechanics and ideas to refine and mix in from other forks. The result was a game where the skeleton is SLASH'EM, but the innards are composed of EvilHack, [SpliceHack](/wiki/SpliceHack \"SpliceHack\"), [SlashTHEM](/wiki/SlashTHEM \"SlashTHEM\"), [xNetHack](/wiki/XNetHack \"XNetHack\"), [UnNetHack](/wiki/UnNetHack \"UnNetHack\"), and almost every other fork. In particular, the content of SpliceHack and SlashTHEM were of importance - because these forks have a goldmine of content but their development has largely stalled, resulting in a backlog of bugs. Now players can find many of the features from those forks in Hack'EM, with less bugs and refined mechanics.\n\nThe main design philosophies still stand:\n\n- If something doesn't work, is buggy, or is easily abusable, attempt to improve it or remove it.\n- If something is bland or feels unfinished - attempt to flesh it out.\n- Add all the quality-of-life features that are available in the variant market.\n\nBut a couple of new ideas have also evolved:\n\n- **Make the game accessible to both NetHack newbies and veterans.** This was mostly accomplished by updating the object lookup to show more information on objects, monsters, and artifacts. A player doesn't have to run to the wiki (or wonder if the wiki is up-to-date).\n- **Make the game challenging for NetHack veterans, even if completely spoiled.** We want to keep people coming back for more, and we want to encourage different tactics as the texture of the game reveals itself.\n- **Make the game difficult - but fair.** Many new challenges have been introduced, but the player shouldn't feel that a situation is completely out of their control unless the RNG is really bad that day. For each new challenge, a counter-balance has usually been achieved. The opposite is also true, for any powerful effect in the player's favor, a counter-effect is usually balanced. The end-goal is to present the player with interesting situations.\n- **Nudge players to make more creative decisions.** If a mechanic, item, or feature makes for a completely decisionless strategy, this is usually viewed as a sign that something needs to be adjusted.\n\n## Quality-of-life features\n\n**Object lookup has been fleshed out:**\n\n- **If you are new to Hack'EM, the object lookup will be your new best friend!**\n- There are a few ways to access the lookup info:\n\n```\n   - Open your inventory (i), and then press the inventory letter associated with your item.\n   - Farlook: Press ; then : on a monster or item.\n   - Type / and ?, and manually type in the item/monster to query (e.g. \"potion of acid\")\n```\n\n- Object lookup shows a lot of useful information for items, including object properties and special effects from materials.\n\n- Object lookup for corpses now shows intrinsics conferred, and other info about eating them (like if they are poisonous or acidic).\n\n- Weapons show bonus damage and effects resulting from materials.\n\n- Artifacts can also be looked up to reveal all the special effects they confer or attacks they inflict.\n\n- You can see if a monster doesn't respect Elbereth or can't be magically scared in the Pokedex.\n\n- Special item manipulation tricks will also be displayed if they pertain to the item:\n\n  - fermentation recipes with fruit juice (Lookup \"fruit juice\" for full listing)\n  - gem alchemy (Lookup \"acid\" or \"gem alchemy\" for a full listing of recipes)\n  - forging recipes\n  - tinker/upgrade paths\n\n### Auto-identification\n\n- All roles start out having these basic items pre-identified:\n\n  - potions of water\n  - blank scrolls\n  - scrolls of identify\n\n- Many items are auto-identified on wear, first use, or when their effects should logically be reveals (ie: water walking boots are identified when you walk over water)\n\n- Almost all wands are identified when seeing their engraving effects or zap usage.\n\n- If a wand shares an engrave message with others, it can be auto-identified by process of elimination if its counterparts are already identified.\n\n- Auto-ID rings dropped into a sink when message is shown (Un)\n\n- Auto-ID amulets dropped into toilets, if possible (slex)\n\n- Auto-ID flintstones when rubbed on iron weapons (evil)\n\n- Rustproof/erodeproof/fixed status is known by default for all items (DynaHack)\n\n- After a period of using a wielded weapon and gaining experience with it, you will fully identify it (evil)\n\n- Throne insight now recursively identifies all items in your possession and in your containers (fiq)\n\n- Blessed stethoscopes can identify eggs (on the floor)\n\n- Projectile un-identification has been left out (this prevents merging of previously known projectiles in 3.7)\n\n### Magic chests\n\n- The ultimate quality-of-life feature has been imported from EvilHack!\n- Magic chests provide a convenient place to centralize your stash.\n- There are many magic chests in the dungeon, and they all magically share the same contents. So you can store your goods in the Minetown stash, run down to Sokoban, and voila - there they are!\n- Nothing this good comes without a catch though, and since all magic chests start out locked, you will need a special magic key to access them. Magic keys can be found in [Mine's End](/wiki/Mine%27s_End \"Mine's End\"), the [Pleasant Valley](/wiki/Pleasant_Valley \"Pleasant Valley\") village level (in Goda's hideout), or at [Grund's Stronghold](/wiki/Grund%27s_Stronghold \"Grund's Stronghold\").\n- You can also use the alignment quest keys because they double as magic keys.\n- Note: Monster can and will loot your magic chests - so always make sure to lock them when away!\n\n**Magic chest locations:**\n\n- Minetown\n- Sokoban (first level)\n- The Pleasant Valley\n- Your role's quest home level\n- The Lawful Quest\n- Fort Ludios\n- The Black Market\n- The Temple of Moloch\n- The Castle\n- Orcus town\n\n### Other QoL\n\n**Many effects are explicitly displayed for the player's benefit:**\n\n- The player's magic cancellation (MC) is shown in the status bar (evil)\n- Phasing status is also shown in the status bar. (from EvilHack)\n- Realtime display option is now available (from EvilHack)\n- Show prayer stats in Attributes menu \\[^X screen] (from UnNetHack, originally from dNetHack)\n- Firearms that have different modes of operation display their modes in the player's inventory.\n- The number of gifts received appears in the #conduct screen.\n- When transmogrifying or using the add property service, the same property will not ever be re-applied. You should always expect to see a different property as a result.\n\n**New options are available for the player's convenience:**\n\n- Config option for auto-stair travel (**autostairtravel**)\n- Config option for kicking shortcuts (**ctrlkick**)\n- Config option to play without the bloody tile coloring (**bloodless**)\n- **Paranoid swim** and **paranoid trap** options can be set.\n- **showdmg option** (from SLASH'EM): This shows damage vs the player in (parentheses) and damage vs monsters in \\[brackets]. It also toggles the flanking bonus display on and off.\n\n**Effortless dungeon navigation features**\n\n- \\> < to auto-travel to stairs (from Unnethack)\n- Control+Direction now kicks in that direction\n- The Astral Plane is always lit (xnh)\n- Removed all random secret corridors (xnh)\n- Don't hide magic portals (from xNetHack)\n- Removed the Quest turn limit (Un)\n- Removed the mysterious force\n- Deliberate level teleporter activation ignores magic resistance (3.7)\n- Switching between your main and alternative weapon does not take any turns (from dnh)\n- Prevent stopping on graves and engravings when running.\n- Punishment no longer stops you from displacing pets (DynaHack)\n- The passtune range has been extended by 1 so you can now play one step farther away from the drawbridge (xnh)\n\n**Better inventory management**\n\n- When identified, scrolls of enchant armor ask what armor to enchant.\n- When identified, scrolls of transmogrify ask what item to target.\n- Remove \"Auto-select every item\" when putting into containers (Un)\n- Default shopkeeper sell prompt to N (xnh)\n- **Magical Explosions:** Players cannot put known wands of cancellation or magical bags into bags of holding anymore (dnh). This also applies when #tipping into your bag of holding, you will flick away explosive items if you have the item and the BoH identified.\n- Magicbane is safe for any Bag of Holding, it does not cause BoH explosions.\n- If a player charges a depleted Bag of Tricks/Rats with contents - it will now explode and scatter the contents instead of deleting them.\n- You can tip into containers on the ground, as well as empty bags of tricks/rats.\n\n**End Game Log Changes**\n\n- Total damage the player has done now shows in the end game log.\n- Total damage the player has taken now shows in the end game log.\n\n**Misc other features:**\n\n- Regeneration only causes additional hunger when injured (Un)\n- Having hunger prevents choking on food (3.7)\n- 1-damage hits still train weapon/unarmed skills (from DynaHack)\n- Chargeable rings may get charged when hit with electricity (3.7)\n- Lower chances of rings exploding during charging. Rings with enchantment +3 or lower will no longer have a chance of exploding when charged, making them similar to enchanting armor and more intuitive. Rings at -5 or lower will only explode from cursed charging. (DynaHack/SporkHack)\n- Useless +0 rings are generate very rarely (xnh)\n- Monsters are prevented from picking up gold in shops (Un)\n- Monsters don't blame the player for falling down holes the player dug. Pit traps still count.\n- Potions have been made more useful from a small collection of patches (see the Alchemy Mechanics section)\n- Allow all position prompts to be aborted (DynaHack).\n- Extrinsic resistances protect items from elemental damage. For example, wearing a ring of fire resistance will protect your scrolls and potions from fire damage.\n- Wielding/wearing item giving stoning res will cure stoning (EvilHack).\n- Phasing allows escape from being engulfed. (EvilHack)\n- When a spell of yours gets under the 100 turn threshold, you will get a reminder that it is fading.\n\n* All roles (except Caveman) get their special spell granted when they reach level 12 (SpliceHack)\n* Pets will not use rings of teleportation.\n* Players can use gaze attacks in melee range when poly'd into a form with one.\n* Greased/oilskin objects have a chance of resisting theft. (from EvilHack)\n* Merged scimitar and saber skills.\n\n### New options and commands\n\n- \\#force can also be used on doors while wielding a weapon (SLASH'EM)\n- \\#naming glitches have been nerfed - Players can no longer #name items for identification clues. On attempting to name a regular object with a related artifact name (e.g. naming a candle \"The Candle of Eternal Flame\"), your hand will always slip.\n- Monks can break boulders and statues using martial arts skill at skilled level or higher (shift + f and then a movement key).\n- Rogues can steal from monsters by using 'thievery', (must be bare-handed to use, press shift + f and then a movement key).\n- Convicts can #chat with rats to pacify or tame them.\n- Necromancers can #chat with zombies to pacify or tame them.\n- Changed #forge to #craft.\n- \\#tech accesses your role's available techniques.\n- \\#loot can be used at your pet to both give and take away items from its inventory. You cannot give an unpaid item to a pet by using #loot.\n- Add #genocided command to view what species have already been eliminated\n\n### Wizard mode updates\n\n- \\#wizclear (^z), clears all monsters on level (splice)\n- Can wish for monsters with ^w (Un)\n- Wishing does not trigger the normal game wishing penalties on luck or increased monster generation.\n\n### New conducts\n\n- Added celibate conduct (SLASH'EM)\n- Added conduct for performing (or refusing to perform) techniques.\n- Added a conduct for buying or selling from shopkeepers.\n\n### Wishing shortcuts\n\nNote: Capitalization does not matter when using these.\n\n| Item                        | Shortcut |\n| --------------------------- | -------- |\n| Amulet of ESP               | AoESP    |\n| Amulet of Life Saving       | AoLS     |\n| Bag of Holding              | BoH      |\n| Cloak of Displacement       | CoD      |\n| Cloak of Invisibility       | CoL      |\n| Cloak of Magic Resistance   | CoMR     |\n| Gauntlets of Dexterity      | GoD      |\n| Gauntlets of Power          | GoP      |\n| Helm of Brilliance          | HoB      |\n| Helm of Opposite Alignment  | HoOA     |\n| Helm of Telepathy           | HoT      |\n| Levitation Boots            | BoL      |\n| Magic Lamp                  | ML       |\n| Magic Marker                | MM       |\n| Potion of Extra Healing     | PoEH     |\n| Potion of Gain Level        | PoGL     |\n| Potion of Monster Detection | PmD      |\n| Potion of Water             | PoW      |\n| Ring of Conflict            | RoC      |\n| Ring of Polymorph Control   | RoPC     |\n| Ring of Teleport Control    | RoTC     |\n| Scroll of Identify          | SoI      |\n| Scroll of Remove Curse      | SoRC     |\n| Scroll of Charging          | SoC      |\n| Scroll of Enchant Armor     | SoEA     |\n| Scroll of Enchant Weapon    | SoEW     |\n| Shield of Reflection        | SoR      |\n| Speed Boots                 | BoS      |\n| Unicorn Horn                | UH       |\n| Wand of Create Monster      | WoCM     |\n| Wand of Teleportation       | WoT      |\n| Wand of Undead Turning      | WoUT     |\n| Water Walking Boots         | BoWW     |\n| Kiku-ichimonji              | kiku     |\n\n## Major changes\n\nThese are changes you should definitely know about first, especially coming from other variants.\n\n### Priests and donations\n\n- When donating to priests - the gold vanishes upon receipt.\n\n### Wishing mechanics\n\n- Using wishes in Hack'EM has long term consequences. Wishing can impact your base luck, the monster spawn rate, and the difficulty of monsters.\n- After the 2nd wish (the first 2 are free from consequences), the player's **base luck** gets lowered by -1 for every new wish they make. So 3 wishes = -1 base luck, 4 wishes = -2 base luck, and so on.\n- Base luck cannot be lowered more than -10.\n\nTo clarify any confusion about the adjustment to base luck - this means that your luck will now time out to this amount. Your maximum luck is still potentially +10 (or +13 with a blessed luckstone) can still be reached by altar sacrifice or gaining luck from unicorn gem-tossing. If your base luck is quite low, keep in mind that the luck will timeout fairly quickly if it is maximized.\n\nThis table lays out the exact adjustments for how many wishes the player has made.\n\n| # of wishes | base Luck | spawn rate | difficulty spike |\n| ----------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------------- |\n| 1           | 0         | 1x         | 0                |\n| 2           | 0         | 1x         | 0                |\n| 3           | -1        | 1x         | 2                |\n| 4           | -2        | 2x         | 3                |\n| 5           | -3        | 3x         | 4                |\n| 6           | -4        | 4x         | 5                |\n| 7           | -5        | 5x         | 6                |\n| 8           | -6        | 6x         | 7                |\n| 9           | -7        | 7x         | 8                |\n| 10          | -8        | 8x         | 9                |\n| 11          | -9        | 8x         | 10               |\n| 12          | -10       | 8x         | 11               |\n| 13          | -10       | 16x        | 12               |\n\n**Other wishing notes:**\n\n- Note: Magic lamps are more rare, *but always guaranteed to grant wishes.* You can bank on the Sunless Sea to have a magic lamp with a wish.\n- Monsters can no longer use wands of wishing to get wishes - if they get a wish from a smoky potion they will still attempt to get something powerful.\n\n**Wishing for artifacts:**\n\n- Instead of being based off of how many artifacts exist in the game total (vanilla NetHack method), success is based off of how many artifacts the player has wished for (successful or not).\n- The first two artiwishes are guaranteed.\n\n### Astral rain\n\n- Taming is much more difficult on the Astral Plane.\n- When attempting to use a scroll of taming, a magic harp, the charm monster spell, or any other source of taming - there is only a 10% chance of success.\n- Figurines still function as normal.\n\n### Polymorphing mechanics\n\n- **Polymorphing non-magical items** Inspired by dNetHack, this change significantly reduces the likelihood of polymorphing generic non-magical items.\n\n- The following items will only have a 1% chance of transforming into something magical:\n\n  - [blank scroll](/wiki/Blank_scroll \"Blank scroll\")\n  - [scroll of amnesia](/wiki/Scroll_of_amnesia \"Scroll of amnesia\")\n  - [potion of water](/wiki/Potion_of_water \"Potion of water\")\n  - [potion of blood](/wiki/Potion_of_blood \"Potion of blood\")\n  - [potion of amnesia](/wiki/Potion_of_amnesia \"Potion of amnesia\")\n  - [blank spellbook](/wiki/Blank_spellbook \"Blank spellbook\")\n  - [wand of nothing](/wiki/Wand_of_nothing \"Wand of nothing\")\n  - [wand of wonder](/wiki/Wand_of_wonder \"Wand of wonder\")\n\n### Bones mechanics\n\n- When bones files are left, there's a significant chance of items being polymorphed or shuddering away. This makes bones file peeking and bones stuffing a bit less reliable.\n\n### SLASH'EM style unicorn horns\n\nThe probability of a unicorn horn curing ailments is changed. Blessed horns try to fix all problems, each with the given probability, and uncursed horns try to fix a single problem, with the same probability.\n\n| Enchantment | Chance |\n| ----------- | ------ |\n| 0 or less   | 30%    |\n| 1           | 40%    |\n| 2           | 50%    |\n| 3           | 60%    |\n| 4           | 70%    |\n| 5           | 80%    |\n| 6 or more   | 90%    |\n\n### SLASH'EM style wraith corpses\n\nIn [SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\"), wraith corpses have different effects if eaten:\n\n| Possibility | Effect                            | Message                                      |\n| ----------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| 10%         | You lose experience.              | \"You feel that was a bad idea.\"              |\n| 10%         | Your maximum HP and Pw decreases. | \"You don't feel so good ...\"                 |\n| 20%         | Nothing happens.                  | \"You feel something strange for a moment.\"   |\n| 10%         | Your maximum HP and Pw increases. | \"You feel physically and mentally stronger!\" |\n| 50%         | You gain experience.              | \"You feel that was a smart thing to do.\"     |\n\n- [Necromancers](/wiki/Necromancer \"Necromancer\") will always benefit from eating wraith corpses and default to gaining a level.\n- [Undead Slayers](/wiki/Undead_Slayer \"Undead Slayer\") get a -5 alignment penalty for eating a wraith corpse.\n\n### Elbereth\n\nInitially, players must discover Elbereth within the game, either through rumors or by reading about it, with exceptions made for elves and hobbits, who innately possess this knowledge. When conflict is in effect, the protective power of Elbereth is nullified. Orcs, regardless of their form, are incapable of learning Elbereth. In a significant development, when a lawful character is crowned as the Hand of Elbereth, they gain knowledge of Elbereth if they didn't possess it before. The alignment penalty for attacking while invoking Elbereth has been reduced to a modest -1.\n\nNotably, there are some creatures that show no reverence for Elbereth's protection:\n\n- Any @ monsters, including shopkeepers and guards\n- [minotaurs](/wiki/Minotaur \"Minotaur\")\n- [elder minotaurs](/wiki/Elder_minotaur \"Elder minotaur\")\n- [giant praying mantis](/wiki/Giant_praying_mantis \"Giant praying mantis\")\n- [neothelids](/wiki/Neothelid_\\(EvilHack\\) \"Neothelid (EvilHack)\")\n- unique monsters\n- monsters in Gehennom\n- peaceful monsters\n- blind monsters\n\n### Scare monster\n\nSeveral more monsters have immunity to the [scroll of scare monster](/wiki/Scroll_of_scare_monster \"Scroll of scare monster\") as well, with the complete list below:\n\n- All unique monsters such as the formidable Wizard of Yendor, quest nemeses, and the Riders\n- All [angelic beings](/wiki/Angelic_being \"Angelic being\")\n- All [human or elf](/wiki/Human_or_elf \"Human or elf\") monsters\n- All [player monsters](/index.php?title=Player_monster_\\(Hack%27EM\\)\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Player monster (Hack'EM) (page does not exist)\")\n- Any monster in a [berserk state](/wiki/Berserk_\\(EvilHack\\) \"Berserk (EvilHack)\")\n- Any monster under [conflict](/wiki/Conflict \"Conflict\")\n- Any [mindless](/wiki/Mindless \"Mindless\") monster\n\n### Genocide\n\nThe [scroll of genocide](/wiki/Scroll_of_genocide \"Scroll of genocide\") functions as in [UnNetHack](/wiki/UnNetHack \"UnNetHack\"): an uncursed scroll eliminates all of a chosen monster on the current level; a blessed scroll permanently removes a chosen monster from the game; and a cursed scroll will generate a few of the chosen monster as in *NetHack*.\n\n## Mechanics changes\n\n### Combat\n\n- Major change from SLASH'EM - Artifact weapons do not deal flat +x damage - they deal damage based on their dice rolls.\n- All edged weapons can be poisoned (ex: daggers, swords)\n\n* When a player attempts to strike a monster using a weapon they are either restricted or unskilled in, or any non-weapon item, their likelihood of successfully landing a hit will never exceed 75%. Notably, bare-handed combat remains an exception to this rule.\n\n- **Launchers now contribute to damage**.\n\n  - The enchantment of a launcher applies to missiles shot from it. However, the enchantment on a launcher and missiles does not stack. This means you only need to enchant the launcher and can save scrolls of enchant weapon for other uses.\n  - Example #1: You have a +7 bow and +0 arrows. The arrows will act as if +7.\n  - Example #2: You have a +0 bow and +7 arrows. The arrows will act as if +7.\n  - Example #3: You have a +7 bow and +7 arrows. The arrows will act as if +7.\n  - Example #4: You have a +3 bow and +2 arrows. The arrows will act as if +3.\n\n* **Strength bonus for two-handed weaponry is x1.5** (from EvilHack)\n  - The standard damage bonus for strength is multiplied 1.5 times when wielding a weapon using two hands, or if you're a giant one-handing a two-handed weapon (they're heavy)\n\n- **Gloves' enchantment is now added to unarmed damage.**\n  - Example: Fighting bare-handed with +3 gloves adds +3 damage to hits.\n\n* Stoning – monsters being stoned is a slow-stoning process, just as it is for the player.\n\n### Skill system overhaul with crosstraining\n\nThe skill system for achieving proficiency in weapons and spells has been overhauled and adapted to the UnNetHack system.\n\n[UnNetHack](/wiki/UnNetHack \"UnNetHack\") changes the number of successful uses of a skill required to reach each level. These values are:\n\n| Skill level  | Successful uses | Old value |\n| ------------ | --------------- | --------- |\n| Unskilled    | 0               | 0         |\n| Basic        | 100             | 20        |\n| Skilled      | 200             | 80        |\n| Expert       | 400             | 180       |\n| Master       | 800             | 320       |\n| Grand Master | 1600            | 500       |\n\nSpell skills, however, advance four times as fast until the player is Skilled in the relevant skill, after that, the skill only advances twice as fast as shown in the table above.\n\n**Crosstraining skills:**\n\nHowever, in addition - we have also brought in crosstraining from DynaHack. As you level up a weapon skill, it will enable faster training of related skills. You will notice a 2x by a skill that gets a double bonus, or even a 3x or 4x bonus.\n\nAlso from DynaHack a couple tweaks were made to skill bonuses that increase the effect of skills on weapon to-hit/damage.\n\n**Crosstraining bonuses:**\n\nWhile you are training up weapons, you will also get rare bonus training points for related skills. As an example you might get a bonus to mace skill when exercising club skill because they are both \"bludgeon\" weapons. As your skill grows, the bonuses will become more frequent. As a result, it might be worth maxing out a strong skill your role starts with to benefit from all the crosstraining bonuses. Once a skill can be advanced (100%) it will stop receiving random crosstraining bonuses.\n\n### Shield skill\n\nA new trainable skill from EvilHack, shield skill gives the player a new avenue of defense (and even offense) to train up. Roles that can highly train shields will benefit from much higher AC and gain some nice offensive bonuses. The shield skill also works in conjunction with the Power Shield technique, which you gain access to on attaining skilled level in shields. This technique can be a lifesaver if you get caught in a sudden ambush.\n\n**AC bonuses:**\n\n- To get these bonuses, you must be wearing a shield and have the required skill.\n\n| Skill level          | AC bonus |\n| -------------------- | -------- |\n| unskilled/restricted | +0AC     |\n| BASIC skill:         | +1AC     |\n| SKILLED skill:       | +3AC     |\n| EXPERT skill:        | +5AC     |\n| MASTER skill:        | +8AC     |\n\nIf your role allows for it, you can train up your shield skill while wearing a shield. If you block an attack outright with your shield, that automatically trains shield skill. Otherwise, there's a small chance of training shield skill while wearing one and a regular miss event occurs.\n\n**Shield Bashing:**\n\nIf shield skill is basic or higher, and a shield is being worn, there's a chance the player will receive an extra 'shield bash' attack along with their regular attack. The greater the shield skill, the greater the chance of the extra shield bash attack occurring.\n\n- Small shields do 2-4 damage, Tower shields do 2-13 damage.\n- All other shields do 3-8 damage (not counting material hatred, which is factored in).\n- Expert skill or higher gets an extra small damage bonus\n- Expert/master skill in shields gives a chance of stunning your target with a shield bash.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n- If expert skill or higher in shields, your shield will be prevented from being taken away via dwarvish bearded axe attack.\n\n**The roles that can train in shields are:**\n\n| Role          | Shield Skill |\n| ------------- | ------------ |\n| Archaeologist | BASIC        |\n| Barbarian     | SKILLED      |\n| Caveperson    | BASIC        |\n| Convict       | BASIC        |\n| Knight        | EXPERT       |\n| Necromancer   | SKILLED      |\n| Priest        | SKILLED      |\n| Rogue         | BASIC        |\n| Ranger        | SKILLED      |\n| Tourist       | BASIC        |\n| Undead Slayer | SKILLED      |\n| Valkyrie      | MASTER       |\n| Yeoman        | BASIC        |\n\n- Knights and Valkyries start at basic skill.\n\n### Mold and fungus resurrection\n\n- This content has been imported from xnh, which, in turn, had borrowed it from SLASH'EM.\n- Corpses have a chance over time to grow moldy and produce a random F monster.\n- The corpses of petrifying monsters (ie: cockatrices) will only grow green molds.\n- The resurrection rates have been tapered back a bit, so it's not as pervasive as in Slash'EM - but there are now more molds that can spawn (including moldiers at deeper levels).\n- Moldy corpses can be used with different potions (see the [brewing patch details](#Malcolm_Ryan.27s_Brewing_Patch))\n\n### Conflict\n\nA significant change has been introduced in the way conflict is triggered in the game. Now, when inciting conflict, the player's charisma score plays a crucial role in the process.\n\nThe formula behind this calculation is: (CHA - monster level + player level).\n\nIf this result exceeds 19, it is capped at 19. Subsequently, there is a percentage-based chance, determined by a random roll of the dice (rnd(20)), to determine whether the conflict actually takes effect or not. Even with maximum charisma and experience level, there's still a 5% chance of conflict failing to activate. Another crucial aspect is that the monsters must have visual contact with the player for conflict to activate.\n\n### Dexterity based AC\n\n- Dexterity can directly affect the player's AC, for better or worse. See the chart below for details.\n\n  - **Being encumbered negates AC bonuses from dexterity.**\n  - **Wearing any kind of heavy metallic body armor (not mithril) or other rigid material (bone, stone, wood) also negates dexterity bonuses.**\n\n| Dexterity | AC change |\n| --------- | --------- |\n| <= 6      | +3        |\n| 7-9       | +1        |\n| 10-14     | none      |\n| 15-16     | -1        |\n| 17-18     | -2        |\n| 19-20     | -3        |\n| 21-23     | -4        |\n| 24-25     | -5        |\n\n### Amnesia\n\n- Can make you lose Elbereth knowledge if you had it.\n- Can make you lose intrinsic telepathy.\n- Can make you forget about shambling horrors.\n- Can make you lose \"eaten knowledge\", which doppelgangers use to poly into different forms.\n- Psychic resistance protects from amnesia loss, however the only sources are wearing a [tinfoil hat](/wiki/Tinfoil_hat \"Tinfoil hat\") or playing as an illithid form.\n\n* Potions of amnesia can also inflict this effect if imbibed or inhaled. Potions of amnesia always have the \"sparkling\" appearance. Keep in mind that monsters can throw these potions at you.\n\n### Religion, prayer, altars\n\n- If an unaligned altar generates with a priest of Moloch, that priest will be hostile to all roles except infidels.\n- This means the VoTD priest is always hostile and unable to give donations (unless, of course, you are an infidel.)\n- Sacrifice offerings can sometimes bless random objects (From SLASH'EM)\n\n### Minions\n\n- SLASH'EM had a mechanic for getting aligned minions as gifts from your god when you sacrifice or pray with low health. This has been ported over but with some restrictions.\n\n* Minions will not be granted when:\n\n  - You are praying.\n  - You have negative luck.\n  - You have been crowned\n  - You have completed the quest\n  - You have been expelled from the quest\n  - You have any pets on the current level (prevents overcrowding)\n\nAs the number of altar gifts increases, the odds of getting a minion decrease.\n\n- The minions granted are a little bit different from SLASH'EM but generally follow the same pattern.\n- Minion pets are not subject to the same tameness expiration as normal pets - they should remain tame forever unless abused or their tameness is reduced in some other fashion.\n\n### Dungeon growth patch\n\nAnother feature ported over from Slash'EM. This enables trees to slowly branch out in the dungeon and occasionally drop ripe fruits/leaves, offering potential resources to the player.\n\nThis encourages the growth of various herbs that are left on the ground or placed in water. Herbs left unattended will periodically sprout more of the same type in the surrounding tiles. These herbs comprise [garlic](/wiki/Garlic \"Garlic\"), [wolfsbane](/wiki/Wolfsbane \"Wolfsbane\"), [catnip](/wiki/Catnip \"Catnip\"), [carrots](/wiki/Carrot \"Carrot\"), [mushrooms](/wiki/Mushroom \"Mushroom\"), [pineapples](/wiki/Pineapple \"Pineapple\"), and [kelp fronds](/wiki/Kelp_frond \"Kelp frond\"). While some of these may not be technically herbs, they still exhibit prolific growth.\n\nOne intriguing strategy is to leave these items on the ground early in the game and return after a significant number of turns to see what has been \"farmed.\"\n\nLevels containing trees have a chance of yielding an extra axe, which can be helpful for managing potential overgrowth caused by the spreading trees.\n\n### Oily Corpses patch\n\n- There is a 20% chance of making your fingers slippery upon starting to eat a corpse of certain slippery monsters (e.g. most slithy, non-snakelike monsters and most blobby monsters). Tins of those monsters are not slippery unless caused by the tin preparation.\n\n### Slow Luck timeouts (modified)\n\nIn Hack'EM, Luck items greatly slow down Luck timeout rather than stopping it completely - this is similar to how it works in UnNetHack and EvilHack, however, the timeouts have been modified and extended to cover extremely negative base luck situations (this could occur from wishing and incurring many base luck penalties). The timeouts have also been reduced heavily from the UnNetHack calculations.\n\nThe modified Luck timeout depends on how far your Luck is from your base Luck: the higher or lower your Luck, the less the timeout is slowed. The timeout is calculated every turn, meaning gaining or losing a point of Luck could result in that point timing out immediately.\n\nThe modified Luck timeout is calculated by the following formula:\n\n```\n   Timeout = 25 * (20 - base_distance) * (20 - base_distance)\n```\n\nbase\\_distance is how far you are from your base luck. If your base luck is 0 and you have 3 Luck, the base\\_distance is 3. If you have -10 base luck and 10 Luck, the base\\_distance is 20.\n\nAdditionally, [Archaeologists](/wiki/Archaeologist \"Archaeologist\") gain a +1 bonus to base Luck from wearing a [fedora](/wiki/Fedora \"Fedora\"). Putting on or taking off the fedora also changes your natural Luck accordingly.\n\n| base distance | Timeout | Time to base Luck |\n| ------------- | ------- | ----------------- |\n| 0             | ∞       | 0                 |\n| 1             | 9 025   | 9 025             |\n| 2             | 8 100   | 17 125            |\n| 3             | 7 225   | 24 350            |\n| 4             | 6 400   | 30 750            |\n| 5             | 5 625   | 36 375            |\n| 6             | 4 900   | 41 275            |\n| 7             | 4 225   | 45 500            |\n| 8             | 3 600   | 49 100            |\n| 9             | 3 025   | 52 125            |\n| 10            | 2 500   | 54 625            |\n| 11            | 2 025   | 56 650            |\n| 12            | 1 600   | 58 250            |\n| 13            | 1 225   | 59 475            |\n| 14            | 900     | 60 375            |\n| 15            | 625     | 61 000            |\n| 16            | 400     | 61 400            |\n| 17            | 225     | 61 625            |\n| 18            | 100     | 61 725            |\n| 19            | 25      | 61 750            |\n| 20            | 0       | 61 750            |\n\nIf you have the Amulet or your god is angry with you, halve all times in this table.\n\n### Ascending with a helm of opposite alignment\n\n- When attempting to ascend using a helm of opposite alignment, there is a 1⁄3 chance that your original deity destroys the helm and you do not ascend. You do not lose the game in this situation, but your luck will be reduced by 5 and your god will be angry. You can still win by going to your normal altar, or by trying another helm of opposite alignment.\n\n### Bribing devil princes\n\nBribing a lawful [demon prince](/wiki/Demon_prince \"Demon prince\") can only be done if you meet them while they are still meditating, and typically costs 200 gold times the hero's level.\n\n### Attack specialization\n\nHack'EM allows you to use the #tech menu to specialize in any of the combat-oriented skills, including [twoweaponing](/wiki/Twoweapon \"Twoweapon\") or [attack spells](/wiki/Attack_spells \"Attack spells\").\n\nEntering the name of the skill will provide a +1 damage bonus when using that skill for each of the following milestones:\n\n- Obtain the Sokoban prize\n- Kill [Medusa](/wiki/Medusa \"Medusa\")\n- Kill [Cerberus](/wiki/Cerberus_\\(EvilHack\\) \"Cerberus (EvilHack)\")\n- Defeat any of the [alignment key](/wiki/Alignment_key \"Alignment key\") bosses\n- Pick up the the [Bell of Opening](/wiki/Bell_of_Opening \"Bell of Opening\")\n- Be [crowned](/wiki/Crowned \"Crowned\") by your [god](/wiki/God \"God\")\n\nThe skill chosen can be changed with a cooldown of 1,000 to 1,500 turns if desired.\n\n## Intrinsics and resistances\n\n### Partial resistances\n\n- Intrinsic resistances are no longer binary, but are percentages instead. The spread is 5% to 50% resistance gained from eating per corpse. Damage reduction from various attacks is determined by how much partial resistance the player has to it.\n\n### Partial reflection\n\n- Reflection is not 100%; it can lessen the effects of an attack it reflects, but will never negate it.\n\n### Partial magic resistance\n\n- The \"shower of missiles\" monster attack is not completely negated by [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\").\n\n### The afraid and fearless conditions\n\n- The player can sometimes become too afraid to control their actions and will run away in fear.\n- This is similar to the effects of being stunned or confused. You won't be able to control your movement or attacks, but you can still use items as normal.\n\n**Causes of fear:**\n\n- Hearing or seeing a [dragon](/wiki/Dragon \"Dragon\") roar\n- Being caught in the blast of an [ethereal light](/index.php?title=Ethereal_light\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Ethereal light (page does not exist)\")\n- Hearing the scream of a [monstrous spider](/index.php?title=Monstrous_spider\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Monstrous spider (page does not exist)\") or [banshee](/index.php?title=Banshee\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Banshee (page does not exist)\")\n- Seeing the gaze of a [bodak](/index.php?title=Bodak\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Bodak (page does not exist)\") or an [eye of fear and flame](/index.php?title=Eye_of_fear_and_flame\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Eye of fear and flame (page does not exist)\")\n- Breaking a [wand of fear](/wiki/Wand_of_fear \"Wand of fear\") or being zapped by a wand of fear\n- Applying a cursed [Nighthorn](/wiki/Nighthorn \"Nighthorn\") or carrying a cursed Nighthorn\n- Magic trap effect (1 in 21 chance)\n\n-\\* If you get caught in an explosion type that you are vulnerable to, it can cause a brief panic attack. This only occurs 1 in 3 times and if the damage exceeds a 3d6 roll.\n\n**Curing fear:**\n\n- If the monster you are afraid of dies, your fear will subside as well.\n- Quaff a [potion of booze](/wiki/Potion_of_booze \"Potion of booze\"). Quaffing booze actually gives you intrinsic fearlessness. If blessed it grants for 8d6 (more) turns, otherwise 8d3 turns - even after the confusion wears off.\n- Quaff a [potion of amnesia](/wiki/Potion_of_amnesia \"Potion of amnesia\") (Note: this will make you forget many valuable things, so use extreme caution when considering this strategy)\n- Let it time out\n- Applying a non-cursed Nighthorn\n- Invoking the [Staff of Aesculapius](/wiki/Staff_of_Aesculapius \"Staff of Aesculapius\")\n- Using the calm steed technique as a centaur\n\n**Preventing fear:**\n\n- Wear a [tinfoil hat](/wiki/Tinfoil_hat \"Tinfoil hat\")\n- Wield a weapon with the \"rage\" property\n- Wear the large shield [Pridwen](/index.php?title=Pridwen\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Pridwen (page does not exist)\")\n- Wield [Dragonbane](/wiki/Dragonbane \"Dragonbane\") to protect from dragon roars\n- Knights are also specifically immune to dragon roars\n- Play as a Necromancer, they start with intrinsic fearlessness\n\nNote: Wearing or wielding extrinsic sources of fearlessness that prevent fear don't actually cure fear, but wearing them does nullify the effects. If you remove the item, the fear will still be active until it times out or is actually cured.\n\n### Extreme stability\n\n- Some monsters have a new clobber attack which can knock you senseless.\n- You are vulnerable to this attack if you are smaller than a huge monster and are solid.\n- A successful clobber attack occurs 1 in 6 times and will send you flying back 1 to 2 squares.\n- Furthermore, after being hurtled back, there is a 1 in 4 chance of being stunned for 2-3 turns.\n- The stability property protects you(or monsters) from clobber attacks, it won't reduce the damage, but it will keep you from moving and being stunned.\n\nBe very wary of your surroundings in encounters with monsters that clobber. You don't want to be next to lava or water tiles because you could easily be hurtled back to your death.\n\n### Sonic damage and resistance\n\n- Ported from SpliceHack\n\nSonic damage comes in two main forms: rays and monster attacks. The sources of sonic rays are primarily [wands of noise](/wiki/Wand_of_noise \"Wand of noise\"), [violet dragons](/wiki/Violet_dragon \"Violet dragon\"), and the [sonic boom spell](/index.php?title=Spellbook_of_sonic_boom\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Spellbook of sonic boom (page does not exist)\"). These rays can be reflected (with a source of reflection) or resisted with sonic resistance. Sonic rays are quite destructive and will easily shatter anything made of glass in a monsters inventory, your inventory, or even on the floor. Glass objects include potions, rings, wands, tools, armor, or weapons. It is possible to shatterproof your items by wielding one and reading a [scroll of enchant weapon](/wiki/Scroll_of_enchant_weapon \"Scroll of enchant weapon\") while confused. Sonic rays can also destroy iron bars, toilets, sinks, boulders, and statues.\n\nThere are a handful of monsters which possess potent sonic or \"scream\" attacks. The common theme is that they are all ranged and can be launched from about 12 squares from the hero. They can also be used in melee range.\n\n- [concussive spheres](/index.php?title=Concussive_sphere\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Concussive sphere (page does not exist)\"): A one-time explosive sonic blast (similar to flaming spheres)\n- [violet dragons](/wiki/Violet_dragon \"Violet dragon\"): Sonic breath attack, and passive sonic damage.\n- [screamer](/index.php?title=Screamer\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Screamer (page does not exist)\"): Similar to a shrieker, but deals a sonic scream\n- [nazgul](/wiki/Nazgul \"Nazgul\"): Scream which stuns\n- [monstrous spider](/index.php?title=Monstrous_spider\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Monstrous spider (page does not exist)\"): Scream which inflicts fear\n- [mobat](/wiki/Mobat \"Mobat\"): Piercing scream\n- [banshee](/index.php?title=Banshee\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Banshee (page does not exist)\"): Scream which inflicts fear\n- [harpy](/wiki/Harpy \"Harpy\"): Song which paralyzes.\n- [gibberling](/wiki/Gibberling \"Gibberling\"): Possesses a plethora of attacks, each inflicting a unique but twisted effect (similar to a cursed unicorn horn)\n\nAll of the scream attacks can also shatter glass objects. The gibberlings and harpies don't scream, but are quite dangerous anyway.\n\nAlso - there are [sonic bombs](/wiki/Sonic_bomb \"Sonic bomb\"), and spellcasting monsters can make you vulnerable to sonic damage.\n\nAs you can see, in Hack'EM the player must have a game-plan for dealing with sonic damage going into the late game. How can you protect against it or at least mitigate the damage? There is no source of intrinsic sonic resistance, unless you polymorph into a monster that innately has it. All sources are extrinsic but once obtained will also protect your items from shattering.\n\n**Sources of sonic resistance:**\n\n- violet dragon scales\n- violet dragon scaled armor\n- [resonant shield](/wiki/Resonant_shield \"Resonant shield\")\n- [ring of sonic resistance](/index.php?title=Ring_of_sonic_resistance\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Ring of sonic resistance (page does not exist)\")\n- Wielding or wearing an item with the sonic resistance property.\n- Wielding [Thunderstruck](/index.php?title=Thunderstruck\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Thunderstruck (page does not exist)\")\n\nThe [tortle](/wiki/Tortle \"Tortle\") race also starts with a [toque](/wiki/Toque \"Toque\"), which doesn't grant explicit sonic resistance - but it will protect the player from sonic damage and nullify the effects of sonic attacks. Unfortunately, it will not protect your glass items from destruction. Becoming deaf also accomplishes the same thing.\n\nOne other obscure source of sonic resistance is simply being underwater. This automatically dispels any sonic damage and grants you (and monsters) sonic resistance while submerged.\n\n**Using sonic damage for offense:**\n\n- It may look daunting seeing all the sonic threats facing the player - but keep in mind that if you are able to obtain Thunderstruck, or a decent weapon that has the scream property (which does sonic damage), you now wield a weapon that the majority of monsters in Hack'EM do not resist. Only about 5% of monsters are sonic resistant. There are almost double the amount of acid resistant monsters at \\~10%, which shows how niche this attack vector is.\n\n### Psychic damage and resistance\n\n- (from Splice and EvilHack)\n\nLike sonic damage, psychic damage also comes in a few forms. The form most players will be familiar with is the mind flayers psychic blast, which can target you from a wide range. A few new monster now also have a melee based psychic attack: the gnomish psyker and the dream thief. Ethereal lights also are fast and will explode on contact, inflicting psychic damage as well as fear on the player.\n\n**Psychic resistance:**\n\n- The only source of extrinsic psychic resistance is the [tinfoil hat](/wiki/Tinfoil_hat \"Tinfoil hat\").\n- Protects you from forgetting skills, spells, and other things from potions and scrolls of amnesia, as well as mind flayer and zombie brain eating attack.\n- Illithids start with psychic resistance.\n- Illithid player characters are immune to the mind flayer brain eating attack but are not immune to zombie brain eating.\n- Protects you from an illithids psionic wave and tentacle attacks.\n\n### Larva carrier property\n\n- Some monsters can infect you with dangerous eggs! If their larva are allowed to hatch, they emerge from your body dealing a significant amount of damage in the process. Plus, you have to deal with a new set of monsters in front of you. The only way to defend against this attack, other than canceling the injector, is to be polymorphed into a monster with thick skin.\n\nLuckily, you can cure this condition using a few different methods:\n\n- quaffing [potions of sickness](/wiki/Potion_of_sickness \"Potion of sickness\") (this kills the larva from inside)\n- drink from a [toilet](/wiki/Toilet \"Toilet\") (poisonous water)\n- receiving a disease attack from a monster\n- eating a [pill](/wiki/Pill \"Pill\")\n- invoking the [Staff of Aesculapius](/wiki/Staff_of_Aesculapius \"Staff of Aesculapius\")\n- invoking the Healing Hands technique\n- being zapped by a cure sickness spell\n\nThere are only three monsters that can infect you with larva, remember them well: [giant ichneumon](/wiki/Giant_ichneumon \"Giant ichneumon\"), [gibberlings](/wiki/Gibberling \"Gibberling\"), and [spibrawulfs](/index.php?title=Spibrawulf\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Spibrawulf (page does not exist)\").\n\n### Regeneration\n\n- The player is unable to regenerate hit points while in the Valley of the Dead – healing via other methods (potions, healing spells) is still possible.\n- Regeneration only causes additional hunger when injured.\n- Restful sleep regenerates HP (we can get restful sleep property from the [amulet of restful sleep](/wiki/Amulet_of_restful_sleep \"Amulet of restful sleep\") or a [ring of sleeping](/wiki/Ring_of_sleeping \"Ring of sleeping\"))\n\n## Item manipulation\n\n### Item generation\n\n- 1/80 of random non-artifact weapons will be generated erodeproof (xnh)\n- 1/80 of random non-artifact items will be generated as pre-eroded (xnh)\n- Grease will generate on an erodible object every once in a great while - 1 in 1000 chance (xnh/3.7)\n\nThe following effects of items with certain [randomized appearances](/wiki/Randomized_appearance \"Randomized appearance\") are adapted from [dNetHack](/wiki/DNetHack \"DNetHack\"):\n\n- Combat boots grant +1 AC and +1 to-hit when attacking.\n- Mud boots make you more resistant to wrap attacks.\n- Hiking boots grant +100 to carrying capacity while you are grounded (e.g., not [levitating](/wiki/Levitating \"Levitating\") or [riding](/wiki/Riding \"Riding\") a steed).\n- Jungle boots prevent many types of leg injury.\n- Padded gloves grant +1 AC.\n- Old gloves can't be eroded.\n- Fencing gloves grant +2 to-hit with a one-handed weapon and no shield\n\n### Object materials\n\n- Object materials were inherited from EvilHack. For details see [EvilHack § Object materials](/wiki/EvilHack#Object_materials \"EvilHack\")\n- Many objects and items can spawn made from something other than its base material.\n- In Hack'EM - you will also notice rings and unicorn horns appearing in new strange materials. Ring appearances were completely overhauled to enable more diverse materials appear.\n- Any item or object that is susceptible to being rusted, corroded, rotted, burned, or fractured can be completely destroyed via those methods unless fixed.\n- Any item or object can be fixed (wielding the object and reading a scroll of enchant weapon while confused) if its material allows for it.\n\n* The dragonhide AC bonus has been reduced from 8AC to 5AC.\n* Shirts can only be cloth.\n* Mummy wrappings can be leather or dragonhide.\n\n- Gold objects are notable because they are the frequent targets of leprechaun theft.\n- Glass objects should be handled with care because they are vulnerable to shattering from sonic attacks.\n\nKeep in mind that if the material of an object is not working for you, it may be possible to alter with a [scroll of transmogrify](/wiki/Scroll_of_transmogrify \"Scroll of transmogrify\").\n\n### Object properties\n\nThe [object properties](/wiki/Object_properties \"Object properties\") patch exists in a handful variants – the code used for Hack'EM was taken from [EvilHack](/wiki/EvilHack \"EvilHack\"), which in turn was taken from [GruntHack](/wiki/GruntHack \"GruntHack\") and then modified significantly.\n\nAn object property is a magical attribute associated with an item – in other variants that have object properties, the number of magical properties and the number and types of items they can be applied to is rather broad, and finding such properties on these items is not uncommon. In Hack'EM, there are many object properties, they can be applied to weapons, armor, and rings, but the chances of finding such items at random is quite rare. There are new alternate methods to both discover and manipulate object properties since they will be a powerful resource to the player.\n\nIn version 1.3.0 and beyond it is once again possible to wish for object properties when wishing for an item.\n\n**Eligible items** for object properties are: weapons, armor, and rings (with some restrictions).\n\n**Restricted items:** non-weapons (ie: cockatrice corpses), artifacts, dragon scales, and unique items.\n\n- A players' starting inventory will never spawn with an object property (with the exception of the Undead Slayer-Vampire who starts with a jacket of fire resistance)\n- Changing a regular item with object properties into an artifact (e.g., dipping for [Excalibur](/wiki/Excalibur \"Excalibur\")) will strip that item of its object properties.\n- Extrinsic properties that are applied to weapons or armor are active only when those objects are wielded/worn. With weapons, extrinsic properties also work in the offhand whilst [twoweaponing](/wiki/Twoweaponing \"Twoweaponing\").\n\n#### Generation odds\n\n**Random item generation:**\n\n- Odds of an eligible item having a magical property: 1 in 150\n- Odds improve deeper into the dungeon\n- The chances of an item having 2 properties on creation is 1 in 100000.\n\n**Player monsters:**\n\n- Odds of their weapon having a magical property: 1 in 20 if high level or encountered on the Astral Plane\n\n**Angel-class monsters:**\n\n- 1 in 10 chance of their long sword having a magical property\n\n**Two properties:** 1 in 100,000 chance of an eligible item randomly spawning with two properties.\n\n#### Identifying object properties\n\n- Observing the effects of most properties in action should auto-identify the property.\n\n- The shopkeeper identify service will reveal properties on weapons, armor, and rings.\n\n- Adding a property via confused scroll of transmogrification or shopkeeper service will auto-identify the property on successful grafting.\n\n- Some properties will auto-id upon wielding or wearing, like the stealth, slow, oilskin, and rage properties.\n\n  - Trying to sell *stench items*, the shopkeepers will refuse - identifying them.\n  - Items with the excellence, vigilance, or prowess properties usually auto-identify because they modify stats like charisma or wisdom.\n  - If an item of sustainability or toughness resists draining or destruction, the property is revealed.\n  - Using items with the swimming or surfing property on water auto-identifies them.\n  - The pirate's first gift, The Marauder's Map, has a useful #invoke ability that reveals artifacts and items with properties.\n\n- Wizards have an innate ability to 'sense' if an item is magical (much like a Priest being able to know the beatitude of all items).\n\n- **Dipping weapons with offensive properties** into fountains or toilets can reveal what property it has. The weapon properties that interact with water are: fire, frost, shock, decay, scream, sizzle, rage, venom, filth, and sleep.\n\n- Wielding or wearing an item with the *insight property* will grant you the ability to sense magical properties.\n\n- Reading scrolls of magic detection reveals properties.\n\n- Zapping wands of probing at items reveals their properties.\n\n- If playing as a Jedi, you start with a droid pet. This pet is capable of walking over items and revealing their properties.\n\n- Archaeologists can use their appraisal technique to reveal properties on items.\n\n- In other cases, use your own judgment and logic to narrow down the property.\n\n#### Manipulating object properties\n\n**Shopkeeper's Add Property service:**\n\n- Non-magical items have a base charge of 750.\n- Magical items have a base charge of 2250.\n- The shopkeeper can add a random property to an item of your choosing. The item type depends on the shop type, so a ring shop can add properties to rings, and so on.\n- After adding a property, the weapon is also fully identified.\n- If a weapon already has a property, the shopkeeper will offer to remove it for a base price of 200. There is a 1 in 4 chance of successful removal.\n\n**Upgrade/tinker and property transfers:**\n\n- Upgrading/tinkering objects will not remove or change any properties on the item.\n\n**Forging and property transfers:**\n\n- Properties will never spontaneously appear from forging results, the property has to come from the first or second ingredient.\n- Forging will take the secondary object property over the primary. If you have formally identified the object property of one of the recipe objects, you'll know the object property of the newly forged object.\n\n**Dipping into a potion of invulnerability:**\n\n- Items can be dipped into potions of invulnerability to gain the toughness property.\n\n**Polypiling and Property transfers:**\n\n- Polymorphing items that are cursed always wipes the properties from an obj.\n- An uncursed object has a luck dependent chance of *retaining* its properties.\n\n```\n   LUCK:     <0      0     +2     +5     +8    +11\n   SUCCESS: 0.5%  20.0%  39.5%  59.0%  78.5%  98.0%\n```\n\n**The Scroll of Transmogrify:**\n\n- Confused readings can be used to altar the properties of objects.\n- A confused cursed scroll will remove any properties on an item.\n- An confused uncursed scroll will change an existing property on an item (depending on luck)\n- Reading a confused blessed scroll will add a random property to the item. If it's a magical item (ie: speet boots or cloak of magic resistance), a successful property addition also depends on luck, similar to the above odds.\n\n```\n   LUCK:     <0      0     +2     +5     +8    +11\n   SUCCESS: 0.5%  20.0%  39.5%  59.0%  78.5%  98.0%\n```\n\n- When changing or adding properties, any property is valid - even those with negative effects.\n\n#### Table of object

This allows you to buy the new, possibly more expensive potion at the cost of the fruit juice.\n\n### Pouring potions into sinks\n\n- (from xnh)\n- Allows for safer identification of potions by dumping them down the drain, leaving the hero to suffer only vapor effects.\n- This is done by selecting a potion to #dip while standing on top of a sink. If a potion of polymorph is poured down a sink, it polymorphs it.\n\n### Gem alchemy\n\n- Acid is no longer a useless endgame potion!\n- Gems dissolve in acid to produce new potions, based on the gem's and potion's color (meaning the same gem will produce different potions from game to game).\n  - Diamonds do not dissolve in acid at all.\n- If the acid is cursed or the gem is a [dilithium crystal](/wiki/Dilithium_crystal \"Dilithium crystal\"), there is a guaranteed alchemical explosion, otherwise there is always a 1 in 30 chance of an explosion.\n- Use the object lookup (on a gem) to see what potion is created from a particular gem.\n- Note: Smoky, milky, and clear potions cannot be produced with this method.\n\n### Upgrading and tinkering\n\nHack'EM features an upgrading mechanic facilitated by potions of gain level or the tinkering technique or the tinkering service sometimes offered by gnomish shopkeepers, a feature adapted from SLASH'EM.\n\nThe upgrade process has seen some improvements, offering an accessible object lookup system to display upgrade information for each item. Each item now maintains a one-to-one relationship, directly mapping to the specific item it upgrades into. This transition also brings about changes in the power of magical item upgrades, as their properties are retained in their new forms, resulting in a reduction in the potency of many magical item upgrades to maintain game equilibrium.\n\n**New Upgrade Table:**\n\n- \"->\" Indicates a one-way transformation path\n- \"<->\" indicates the two items upgrade back-and-forth.\n\n| item 1

This was the primary attribute of techniques that was broken in SLASH'EM. One could simply lower their HP and gain unlimited access to some of the techs for some fairly unbalanced advantages.\n\n* Maintaining your techniques requires eliminating harmful conditions from your play. While suffering from most harmful ailments, your tech cooldowns will expire much slower. This includes most major physical and mental ailments, as well as being too hungry or satiated. If you are wielding a weapon with the prowess property, the normal timeout will always apply.\n* Tech cooldowns will also not expire if the player is just waiting or searching on one square.\n\n- Revised tech cooldown times. There are four broad categories of techniques. Premium techs are really powerful, so they have a long cooldown of 1500-2500 turns. Strong techs are very useful and comprise most of the techs, so the standard cooldown is 1000-1500 turns. Mid-strong techs are not too abusable, but deserve some kind of timeout so they are 500-1000 turns. Utility techs are very useful techs and meant to be quite accessible, so they are only 100-200 turns.

You can engage them in battle, and if you kill your quest leader, this unlocks the quest. You can then complete your quest as you normally would. However, quest leaders are not weak, and your deity may not be pleased with you killing them.\n\n**Alignment Impact:** Your alignment record can still be positive, but abusing your alignment can have a direct effect on how your quest ends. Alignment abuse is tracked throughout the game. Any negative alignment adjustment counts as one abuse point, and this can be checked at any time via #conduct. Compared to the standard game, you'll receive more feedback when abusing alignment.\n\n**Permanent Abuse Record:** Unlike your alignment record, which can be adjusted back into positive standing, your alignment abuse record is permanent.\n\n**Quest Artifact Forfeiture:** Quest leaders might ask you to forfeit the quest artifact if you have abused your alignment.\n\n**Options for Forfeiture:** You have two options at this point – either hand over the quest artifact peacefully or decline. Declining will anger your quest leader, and they will attack. Handing over the quest artifact peacefully will flag the quest as complete.\n\n**Incomplete Quest Consequences:** Declining to turn over the quest artifact does not complete the quest. At some point, your quest leader will need to be defeated before the quest is flagged as complete. Attempting to evade your quest leader will not help in the long run, as the Bell of Opening has been 'cursed'. The only way to lift the curse is to complete the quest. The Bell will not function for the invocation until this is done.\n\n**Luck boon:** If you complete the quest with under 13 alignment abuse, you will receive a luck boon (+1 to permanent luck).\n\n**Alternative Scenarios:** The game considers alternative scenarios. For instance, if you angered your quest leader before starting the quest and you killed them, you simply need to defeat your quest nemesis to flag the quest as complete. Conversely, if you've killed the quest nemesis and return but somehow anger your quest leader before you speak to them, killing them also flags the quest as complete.\n\n## Dungeon features\n\n### Trap mechanics\n\nSeveral new trap features have been added to the game:\n\n*Ice Traps:* These traps are only generated after level 8. They shoot a freezing jet of icy air, which can freeze and slow down the player upon activation. This blast of icy mist is dangerous - it will do 4d8 cold damage and can remove your intrinsic cold resistance! (adapted from xnh)\n\n*Magic Beam Traps:* Magic beam traps are now part of the game, but they cannot generate above level 16. Notably, these traps now produce a random type of magical beam upon activation, offering more variety compared to their previous static beam type.\n\n*Rust Trap Changes:* Players now have the ability to untrap rust traps using the #untrap command, which transforms them into fountains. However, disarming rust traps from a distance, whether through telekinesis or zapping with acid, will not yield a fountain.\n\n*Fire Trap Untrapping:* Fire traps can be deactivated using #untrap, but it requires water to do so.\n\n*Spear Trap Yield:* When disarming a spear trap, there is a chance of obtaining a spear or stake. Flyers also still have a 50% chance of being poked by a spear trap. If you (or a monster) are levitating, you will be too high to reach.\n\n*Web Destruction:* Players can now force-fight webs with a bladed weapon to destroy them.\n\n*Castle Drawbridge:* It's worth noting that the Castle drawbridge doesn't always close with the passtune as it did before.\n\n*Temporary Invisibility:* Invisibility gained from magic traps is temporary and not permanent.\n\n*Polymorph Traps:* The mechanics of polytraps have been adjusted, with a 1/7 chance that the polymorph trap disappears after polymorphing a monster. This mechanic was adapted from SpliceHack.\n\n### Breaking wands creates related traps\n\n**Breaking wands will usually create related traps (Un)**\n\n| Wand                  | Trap created      |\n| --------------------- | ----------------- |\n| wand of cold          | ice trap          |\n| wand of opening       | trap door         |\n| wand of fire          | fire trap         |\n| wand of magic missile | magic trap        |\n| wand of teleportation | teleport trap     |\n| wand of polymorph     | poly trap         |\n| wand of sleep         | sleeping gas trap |\n| wand of cancellation  | anti-magic trap   |\n| wand of deluge        | rust trap         |\n| wand of shock         | magic beam trap   |\n| wand of poison gas    | magic beam trap   |\n| wand of corrosion     | magic beam trap   |\n| wand of noise         | magic beam trap   |\n\n**wand of detection:** When broken this does not create a trap, however it will now detect traps and portals.\n\n### Breakable iron bars\n\n- Iron bars can be destroyed in a couple of different ways.\n- You can shatter them with wands of striking, wands of noise, spells of force bolt, or spells of sonic boom.\n- You can punch and shatter them when wearing [gauntlets of force](/index.php?title=Gauntlets_of_force\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Gauntlets of force (page does not exist)\").\n- You can zap them with an acid ray or breath to dissolve them\n\nIf you shatter them, some [iron chains](/wiki/Iron_chain \"Iron chain\") may be randomly flung out as a result.\n\n### Grass\n\n- Pulled from SpliceHack/xNetHack, we now have lush grass in the dungeon!\n- Grass appears sparsely in the early levels, peaks around level 15, and then tapers off after level 22.\n- Although grass is mostly ornamental, keep in mind that some monsters can use it as clever method of concealment. In deeper levels, it's possible a dangerous asphynx or even giant centipede could be hidden in the thickets...\n\nIf you want to clear out grass from levels, there are a couple methods. Rays of fire, acid, and death will quickly kill and remove the offending grass squares.\n\n### Bloody tiles\n\n- Ported from SpliceHack\n- When monsters are killed, they have a chance of spraying blood in a random direction, coloring one or more tiles red. No real effect on gameplay, purely aesthetic.\n- The amount of blood depends on monster size.\n- Spraying bloody tiles with a ray of water (e.g. from a wand of deluge) will clear the tile of its blood.\n- When bloody tile is walked over, there is a 1 in 20 chance it will erode away.\n- Orc blood is black.\n- There is also a bloodless game option to play without the tile coloring.\n\n### Vents\n\n- Ported from SpliceHack, vents appear as a bright cyan (#) tile.\n- Vents appear after level 3. They will never appear in rooms with stairs. After level 8, some vents will emit poison gas instead of harmless mist.\n- Vents have a 3/5 chance of being destroyed when [bombs](/wiki/Bomb \"Bomb\") are dropped or thrown into them, releasing a small earthquake in the process.\n\n* Polymorphed sinks can turn into vents\n\n**Vents act as occasional monster generators:**\n\n- Spiders, snakes, and rats can randomly pop out of vents.\n- Monsters can use vents to conceal themselves. Since they can also be covered by the vent fog or poison clouds, exercise a little more vigilance when by a vent.\n\n### Toilets\n\nToilets may seem a bit whimsical, but in the game, they've received enhancements to make them more engaging and practical. These improvements were inspired by their inclusion in SLASH'EM. Notably, toilets can now appear on their own, separate from sinks, whereas in SLASH'EM, they only came in pairs with sinks. The addition of fishing in toilets introduces a quirky element to the game.\n\n- Enabled fishing in toilets\n- Dropping a ring of poly into a sink can poly into a toilet.\n- Toilet prayer can now stop the vomiting process\n- If giants sit on toilets, they break.\n\n**Toilet kicking:**\n\n- Like sinks, toilets now have a couple different effects from kicking them, including a few [YAFM](/wiki/YAFM \"YAFM\").\n- Kicking now only breaks the toilet 1/7 chance (was 1/4 in SLASH'EM)\n- Kicking can generate [giant cockroaches](/wiki/Giant_cockroaches \"Giant cockroaches\") and [sewage](/wiki/Sewage \"Sewage\") from kicking (1 in 17 chance)\n- Kicking can generate [brown puddings](/wiki/Brown_pudding \"Brown pudding\") (only once per toilet)\n- Kicking can generate a random tool. Normally this tool will weigh under 15aum, but sometimes you'll get a large tool that bonks against the piping. If a large tool bonks 3x - you'll get that tool no matter now big it is and the toilet is destroyed in the process.\n\n**Amulet identification in toilets (SLEX)**\n\n- Amulets can be dropped down toilets and possibly identified.\n- Amulets of flying are always regurgitated from toilets.\n- Amulets of change will polymorph the toilet into a sink\n\n### Sinks\n\n- Random sink effect: noxious gas cloud (from 3.7)\n\n### Forges\n\n- Inherited from EvilHack\n- Forges have the same appearance as fountains but are orange in color.\n- Just like fountains, dipping things into them can have desirable or adverse affects.\n- They can be used to dispose of anything that is flammable\n- They can also be used to repair corrosion/rust damage to any metallic object (if your luck is greater than 0).\n- There is a rare chance that a lava demon can be summoned via dipping, which will be hostile most times, but can sometimes spawn tame (same odds as getting a wish from a water demon/fountain).\n- Having negative luck can cause a forge to explode when used, which can cause considerable fire damage.\n- Players can also use a forge to remove an attached ball & chain.\n- Forges can be blown up by rays of water.\n\n#### Forging and #craft\n\n- Using the #craft command, you can also combine two objects to forge something new.\n- When forging, if either item has erodeproofing, the resulting item will be erodeproof.\n\n## Dungeon changes\n\n- Adjust secret passage frequency and exclude them from DL 1-4 (xnh)\n- Random doors are secret less of the time (xnh)\n- Kicking a \"wall\" that is actually a secret of some sort will never injure the player and will always produce an unambiguous message that there's something there. This makes it a valid strategy to kick every wall suspected of hiding something, because a single kick will give a yes/no on whether it's a regular wall or not. It's still not a *great* strategy, because the real walls will still hurt and wound legs like normal (xnh)\n\n* Main dungeon length is capped at 35-40 levels.\n* The fountains in Delphi can sometimes cause hallucination (Splice)\n* The Rogue level has been removed\n* Additional variants of the Castle, Fort Ludios, Sokoban, Mine Town and Mines End have been added.\n\n### The SLASH'EM levels\n\n- The main dungeon layout has been adjusted to more closely follow SLASH'EM.\n\n| Appears | Level                   |\n| ------- | ----------------------- |\n| 2-4:    | The Gnomish Mines       |\n| 5-9:    | The Oracle              |\n| 6-10:   | Sokoban                 |\n| 7-11:   | Town branch             |\n| 10-39:  | Fort Ludios             |\n| 10-11:  | Rat level (50%)         |\n| 11-12:  | Kobold level (50%)      |\n| 12-13:  | Grund's Stronghold      |\n| 15-19:  | The Quest               |\n| 15-19:  | Lawful Quest            |\n| 15-19:  | Neutral Quest           |\n| 15-19:  | Chaotic Quest           |\n| 20-21:  | The Wyrm Caves          |\n| 22-23:  | One-eyed Sam's Market   |\n| 21-24:  | The Lost Tomb           |\n| 26-29:  | The Spider Caves        |\n| 28-31:  | The Sunless Sea         |\n| 32-35:  | The Temple of Moloch    |\n| 32-35   | The Giant Caverns       |\n| 8-24:   | Aphrodite's level (45%) |\n| 10-29:  | The Big room            |\n| 19-26:  | The Storage Room        |\n| 25-34:  | Ozymandias' Tomb (45%)  |\n\n### Gnomish Mines\n\nDifferent types of gnomes, dwarves, and thieves have been added to the mines. Dwarf and gnome thieves are now found in most town and Minetown variants. The presence of undead in the mines is no longer tied to alignment (as in SLASH'EM) but depends on the dungeon depth. The deeper you go, the higher the chance of encountering undead versions of the regular denizens, making the later stages more challenging.\n\nHack'EM has integrated Minetown variants from SlashTHEM and SpliceHack, along with Mine's End levels from SlashTHEM. Additionally, the Gnome King's ending from SLASH'EM and SlashTHEM is available. One Minetown variant features a drawbridge. However, players should be cautious, as destroying the drawbridge in the presence of guards will anger them. The mine rivers that are present in GruntHack and EvilHack are still in the mines - but they will be found only deeper than Minetown and not before.\n\n### Sokoban\n\n- The last room of Sokoban has more prize variety, with a catch.\n- Imported levels from SLASH'EM, SlashTHEM, and NetHack Fourk.\n- Following in the footsteps of NetHack Fourk, all levels have been given names to make them easier to reference.\n- The map numbers in the listing below follow the format in the sokoban.des file (1-\\* is the top level and 4-\\* is the bottom level).\n\n| Map # | Map Name                    |

From SlashTHEM/UnNethack\n- Appears 2-3 levels below the Oracle.\n- Created a \"Raided Angband\" level that is been ransacked by bandits and thieves.\n- You can always find the Master Sword guarded by a gang of bandits in the village.\n\n### Rat level\n\nA single randomized level picked from:\n\n- The Rat Level (Slash'EM)\n- The Rat Level (SlashTHEM)\n\n### Alignment quests\n\n- Appears on DL 15-19, from SLASH'EM\n- As in SLASH'EM, two of the three alignment keys are needed for Vlad's Tower\n- Some elements of the quests have been changed:\n\n* Instead of the randomized Chaotic quest that SLASH'EM had, we have replaced it with Vecna's Manse from SlashTHEM.\n* The difficulty of Vecna has been reduced to be closer to the SLASH'EM version, but he still gets the extra clerical spell attack from Evil.\n\n### Big Room\n\n- Imported a bunch of new big room variations from UnNethack, SpliceHack, and SLASHTHEM.\n\n### [Grund's Stronghold](/wiki/Grund%27s_Stronghold \"Grund's Stronghold\")\n\n- Added more traps and the moat is double wide now, the stronghold wall is also phaseproof.\n- Grund's Stronghold now has a large cache of ammunition in one of the storage rooms.\n- If one of the iron safes doesn't have a magic marker, it will have a scroll of acquirement in its place.\n\n### Fort Ludios\n\n- Ludios appears on the first eligible level with a vault.\n- Fort Ludios can also appear below Medusa's.\n- An extra dungeon prison has been added below Fort Ludios. This is a leftover from the Lethe branch and it seemed to fit here!\n\n### Wyrm Caves\n\n- Created an entrance level (from dNetHack's Erebor quest)\n- At the bottom is a dangerous dragon nest which guards a massive treasure horde (from UnNetHack)\n\n### Black Market\n\n- The Black Market prices have been reduced a bit from SLASH'EM.\n- The layout of the level has been cut down in size to reduce the tedium involved in combing through all the items.\n- A small area has been dedicated to the player as a \"break room\", complete with furniture and even a magic chest for convenience.\n- To prevent theft, the level has been made undiggable and phase-proof. When attempting to tame monsters in the Black Market, you won't anger everybody, but the taming will simply have no effect. Scrolls of earth can be also be used without consequence, but beware, One-Eyed Sam can break through boulders like butter.\n\n### The Storage Room\n\n- Added 4 variations from dnh\n\n### Gehennom\n\n- No longer a series of mazes, but are mines-style levels with lava.\n- Areas such as the Sanctum and the entrance to the Wizard's Tower have also been adjusted.\n- Cerberus now guards the entrance to Gehennom.\n- Vlad the Impaler's tower is the SLASH'EM version\n- Vibrating square: messages when player is near\n\n### Elemental planes\n\n- The first four Planes levels are randomized and appear in a different order every game.\n- Updated monsters on the plane of water with deepest ones, things from below, and mermaids.\n\n## New special rooms\n\n- Fungus Farm (SLASH'EM)\n- Migo Hive (SLASH'EM)\n- Dragon Lair (SLASH'EM)\n- Real Zoo (SLASH'EM)\n- Bad Food Shop (SLASH'EM)\n- Giant Court (SLASH'EM)\n- Lemure Pit\n- Mini Guild (Hack'EM)\n  - These replace the Guild of Disgruntled Adventurers in SLASH'EM.\n- Clinic room (SlashTHEM)\n- Terror hall (SlashTHEM)\n- Zouthern room (Hack'EM)\n\n### Themed rooms\n\n- EvilHack already had most of the themed rooms but more have been added.\n\n- Added any missing flipped versions of rooms (from UnNetHack) for completeness\n\n- Added minimum levels to all themed Rooms\n\n  - The dungeon is pretty clean of themed rooms until level 8.\n  - At levels 8, 11, and 17 we introduce more variety.\n\n## Shops\n\n- Shopkeepers can be a variety of different races.\n- Removed the racial shopkeeper price adjustments.\n- Imported shopkeeper hollering (from SlashTHEM)\n- Shopkeepers start with more than double their usual gold.\n\n### Shopkeeper services\n\n- Instead of every store offering a general Identify service - every shop offers premier identify services based on their shop type or the race of the shopkeeper.\n- Streamlined the service menu interface. Previously navigating the services was tedious. Now when you press 'p', you are immediately presented with a full menu of all the available services - no submenus within menus.\n- Removed shopkeepers stealing all your money when you charge a wand of wishing.\n- Only Black Market can have the \"identify any\" service\n- The service charge \"smoothing\" rewards higher charisma.\n- All shop identify services are basic (and half price).\n\n```\n   - Shopkeeper services can be accessed by #chatting with the shopkeeper \n   - The black market has a chance of offering any service.\n   - Adjust odds for general store services.\n   - Shopkeeper tinkering costs a lot more.\n```\n\n#### Firearms training service\n\n- In addition to the weapon practice technique, this is a shopkeeper service for making firearms more accessible.\n\n- Gun shops always offer this up to Expert skill.\n\n- Weapon shops, armor shops offer 20% of the time, up to max Skilled.\n\n- General stores offer it 10% of the time, up to max Basic.\n\n  - $500 for Basic skill\n  - $1000 for Skilled\n  - $2000 for expert\n\n#### Tinker service\n\n- Only gnomes offer this service\n- Allows you to upgrade an object to a similar or related form, works the same as dipping an item into a potion of gain level or using the tinker technique.\n- Here the service only takes 1 turn (shopkeepers are either very good at tinkering or just cheating with a hidden potion of gain level behind the counter)\n- Base charge is $500\n- Low intelligence (under 18 INT) players are subject to $500 price gouge\n- Lower intelligence (under 13 INT) players are subject to $1000 price gouge\n- Non-gnomes are charged double\n\n#### Add property\n\n- Weapon, armor, and ring shops can offer this service.\n- Base charge is $2000 for adding properties\n\n1. To remove properties, it costs $250 - but there is only a 1 in 4 chance of success.\n\n- Only one property can be added to an item at a time, if you attempt to add to an item with an existing property, the shopkeeper will prompt you to remove it.\n\n#### Charging service\n\n- Some shops offer a charging service where you can buy a 'basic' recharge that usually does 1 point of charging (like an uncursed scroll of charging, or even a 'premier' charge that acts as a blessed charging.\n\n* Any shop that offers charging will always offer both the basic and premier service with the exception of general stores. Because they are so common, general stores only offer basic charging.\n* Premier charging is restricted to only specialty items that the shop offers (ie: In a ring shop you can only buy premier charging for rings)\n* Basic charging is unrestricted and can be performed on any item in any shop.\n\n#### Service details\n\n| Shop/Race         | Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| All shops:        | -

In its place we can apply dragon scales to any armor. Since robes are now body armor - we can even create dragon scaled robes! Evil introduced some passive effects, these have been expanded so that every dragon scale provides a form of passive attack. The scales' abilities have also been slightly modified. Dragon scales worn on their own only exhibit their primary effect.\n\n| Dragon     | Primary            | Secondary                    | Passive             |\n| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |\n| Black      | Disintegration res |                              | Disintegration (!!) |\n| Blue       | Shock res          | Speed                        | Shock (!!)          |\n| Deep       | Drain res          | Slow digestion               | Drain life          |\n| Gold       | Light              | Infravision Clairvoyant      | Blinding            |\n| Gray       | Magic res          | Cancel protection            | Cancellation (!!)   |\n| Green      | Poison res         | Sickness res                 | Poison              |\n| Orange     | Sleep res          | Free action                  | Slow                |\n| Red        | Fire res           | +1d6 melee damage            | Fire (!!)           |\n| Shimmering | Displacement       | Stun Resistance              | Confuse/Stun/Slow   |\n| Silver     | Reflection         | Cold resistance Blinding res | Scaring             |\n| Sea        | Magical breathing  | Swimming                     | Water/rust (!!)     |\n| White      | Cold res           | Freeze water/Lava walk       | Cold (!!)           |\n| Yellow     | Acid res           | Stoning res                  | Acid (!!)           |\n| Violet     | Sonic res          | Flying                       | Sonic (!!)          |\n\n!! - Risks item destruction from the type of attack - Most of the passive attacks only trigger 33% of the time.\n\n## Spellcasting\n\n### Spellcasting changes\n\n- Like in SLASH'EM, the standard retention for spellbooks is 10000 turns. The reinforce memory technique can be used to extend your spell memory when a spell gets low. You can even use it when the spell has less than half its life left (5000 turns).\n- Removed the BODY spell school in SLASH'EM, moved to the ESCAPE spells\n- Removed PROTECTION spell school in SlashEM, moved to the CLERIC spells\n- Removed CLERIC spell school and created a NECROMANCY spell school to support the new spin on the Necromancer role. The spells from the CLERIC school have been distributed among the other schools as appropriate.\n- Spellbook weights are now based on their level.\n- Spellcasting while wearing body armor will negatively affect your spell success rate. The exception to this is [crystal plate mail](/wiki/Crystal_plate_mail \"Crystal plate mail\"), which does not adversely affect spellcasting in any way.\n- Casting any spell successfully adds +500 turns to your memory of it (from SLASH'EM).\n- You can reread a spellbook to refresh your memory at any time\n\n## Variant changes\n\nHere is where Hack'EM diverges from its ancestors.\n\n### Changes from SLASH'EM\n\n- The [Drow](/wiki/Drow_\\(starting_race\\) \"Drow (starting race)\") has not been ported, but may be inherited from EvilHack's implementation in the future.\n\n* [Techniques](/wiki/Techniques \"Techniques\") have been implemented with updates and bug fixes.\n* New techniques are featured! See the [techniques section](/wiki/Hack%27EM#Techniques \"Hack'EM\") for more details.\n\nThese features have been removed or replaced:\n\n- Skipped races: [Lycanthrope](/wiki/Lycanthrope_\\(starting_race\\) \"Lycanthrope (starting race)\").\n\n- Skipped monsters: [Gypsies](/wiki/Gypsies \"Gypsies\"), Doctor Frankenstein, Frankenstein's Monster\n\n- Skipped items:\n\n  - [wand of fireball](/wiki/Wand_of_fireball \"Wand of fireball\")\n  - [lab coat](/wiki/Lab_coat \"Lab coat\")\n  - heavy hammer (evil had heavy war hammer)\n  - [rocket launcher](/wiki/Rocket_launcher \"Rocket launcher\"), [grenade launcher](/wiki/Grenade_launcher \"Grenade launcher\"), [rocket](/wiki/Rocket \"Rocket\"), [stick of dynamite](/wiki/Stick_of_dynamite \"Stick of dynamite\")\n  - all droven items\n  - [Giantkiller](/wiki/Giantkiller \"Giantkiller\") (Evil has [Giantslayer](/wiki/Giantslayer \"Giantslayer\")).\n\n- Skipped spellbooks:\n\n  - [spellbook of enchant armor](/wiki/Spellbook_of_enchant_armor \"Spellbook of enchant armor\")\n  - [spellbook of enchant weapon](/wiki/Spellbook_of_enchant_weapon \"Spellbook of enchant weapon\")\n  - [spellbook of resist poison](/wiki/Spellbook_of_resist_poison \"Spellbook of resist poison\")\n  - [spellbook of resist sleep](/wiki/Spellbook_of_resist_sleep \"Spellbook of resist sleep\")\n  - [spellbook of endure cold](/wiki/Spellbook_of_endure_cold \"Spellbook of endure cold\")\n  - [spellbook of endure heat](/wiki/Spellbook_of_endure_heat \"Spellbook of endure heat\")\n  - [spellbook of insulate](/wiki/Spellbook_of_insulate \"Spellbook of insulate\")\n  - These all require implementing a IMMUNE property for full 100% temporary resistances, which doesn't really work with Evil's partial resistance system.\n\n- The [Guild of Disgruntled Adventurers](/wiki/Guild_of_Disgruntled_Adventurers \"Guild of Disgruntled Adventurers\") is removed and replaced by mini-guild special rooms\n\n- [Frankenstein's Lab](/wiki/Frankenstein%27s_Lab \"Frankenstein's Lab\") is removed\n\n- The variations on the vibrating square levels have NOT been imported - the EvilHack version remains.\n\n- None of the SLASH'EM Demon prince lairs have been imported.\n\n- Removed [\"Hits as +x weapon\"](/wiki/Monsters_with_hits_creatures_as_a_%2Bx_weapon_\\(SLASH%27EM\\) \"Monsters with hits creatures as a +x weapon (SLASH'EM)\") property from SLASH'EM monsters\n\n- Removed [\"Need +x weapon to be hit\"](/wiki/Monsters_with_need_%2Bx_weapon_to_hit_\\(SLASH%27EM\\) \"Monsters with need +x weapon to hit (SLASH'EM)\") property from SLASH'EM monsters\n\n- Removed the extra [artifact blasting](/wiki/Artifact_blast \"Artifact blast\") (6d6 to 8d10) from SLASH'EM; this mechanic does not seem to add much to the game other than making early wishes less useful and killing unknowing players.\n\n- Removed [wraith](/wiki/Wraith \"Wraith\") corpse nerf. In SLASH'EM there was a reduced probability of gaining levels with a mix of other effects.\n\n- Removed the [temporary polymorph](/wiki/Polymorph#SLASH.27EM \"Polymorph\") mechanic for objects. There is no \"hazy\" status for polymorphed objects. This mechanic was not imported for 2 reasons: it makes it possible to create overpowered weapons (e.g. +127 weapons) and it is also not intuitive for new players since it contradicts the vanilla behavior of polymorphed items.\n\n- Removed SLASH'EM's invisible objects. For now, there has not been a compelling reason to bring this mechanic in.\n\n- Removed SLASH'EM polymorph behavior for monsters; when killed shapeshifters could immediately poly into their polyform (or different form if a chameleon or similar). This mechanic was quite frustrating to deal with, especially concerning new threats like [weretigers](/wiki/Weretiger \"Weretiger\") or [werepanthers](/wiki/Werepanther \"Werepanther\"). In SLASH'EM you could be forced to kill the same shapechanger many times before it would finally die in its base form. The EvilHack behavior replaces this so that a shapechanger cannot poly again once it has been killed in its polyform.\n\n### Changes from EvilHack\n\n- Removed the [Goblin Town](/wiki/Goblin_Town \"Goblin Town\") branch.\n- Removed the Ice Queen branch.\n- Removed the Vecna's Domain branch. We still have Vecna but in a different level for the Chaotic Quest.\n- Removed the indestructible drawbridge from the VotD; it can be destroyed like a regular drawbridge now.\n- Demon lords and princes no longer negate being able to self-teleport or use cursed potions of gain level.\n- Removed the [Wand of Orcus](/wiki/Wand_of_Orcus \"Wand of Orcus\"). Orcus gets his standard wand of death now.\n- Some of the dragon scales have had buffs or different secondary effects added. All scales grant passive effects now. See the section on Dragon Scales for details.\n- Removed chromatic dragon scales.\n- \\#forge has been renamed to #craft for working with [forges](/wiki/Forge_\\(dungeon_feature\\) \"Forge (dungeon feature)\"). The reason is to make #force and #craft auto-complete. #forge still has the same meta shortcut: M('F')\n- Removed two-weaponing weight-based restrictions.\n- Removed the monster riding monster mechanic.\n- Monster spawn rates depend on the number of wishes made, not on game progress.\n- Zapping light around peaceful monsters could anger them. This mechanic has been removed except for when you break a wand of light.\n- Spellcasting monsters have to see you in order to cast summon nasties.\n- Spellcasting monsters have had their spell range limited by their level (gnomish mages are level 3 and can only cast fire bolt in a radius of 2-3 tiles instead of 13).\n- Changed timeout for monster spell of stone to flesh to timeout 2d7 instead of rn2(7).\n- Removed engulfing attack from gelatinous cube, water elemental, earth elemental, and fire elemental. The Splice elementals (magma, mud, ice, acid) still can engulf.\n- Removed cursed weapons reverse hitting (was in EvilHack and Splice). Instead, cursed weapons will miss their target 25% of the time.\n- Revert the standard cursed wand backfire chance from 1-in-30 to 1-in-100.\n- Revert EvilHack sacrifice gift changes: Instead of a mix of regular items and artifacts, players will receive only artifacts (unless you get a minion as a gift).\n- Removed accompanying artifact defenders when wishing for artifacts.\n- Lowered the poison insta-death resistance threshold from 35% to 25%. If your poison resistance is under 25% you have a chance of insta-death from poison dart traps, poison bite, etc.\n- In EvilHack the Amulet of Yendor has a chance of teleporting randomly if dropped on the floor, this random chance of teleport has been removed.\n- Revert cursed amulet of life saving effects\n- Revert Amulet of life saving will not work if the player is in nonliving form.\n- Revert Amulet of life saving does not fully heal the wearer.\n\n* Illithids used to get flying at level 12, now they start with flying.\n* Centaurs used to get jumping at level 5, now they start with jumping.\n* Giants can wear mummy wrappings, giant robes, and dragon scales.\n* Any giant can wear [large splint mail](/wiki/Large_splint_mail \"Large splint mail\").\n* Tortles can wear robes, mummy wrappings, and dragon scales.\n\n## Funny or silly changes\n\n- Gnomes hate eggs (from EvilHack)\n- Vampires can't use toilets.\n\n[![This is a featured article.

He started with <a href=\"/wiki/EvilHack\" title=\"EvilHack\">EvilHack</a> as a base because he was intrigued by the challenging reputation of EvilHack and the comprehensive feature set it contained. However, as the project proceeded he found many other interesting mechanics and ideas to refine and mix in from other forks. The result was a game where the skeleton is SLASH'EM, but the innards are composed of EvilHack, <a href=\"/wiki/SpliceHack\" title=\"SpliceHack\">SpliceHack</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/SlashTHEM\" title=\"SlashTHEM\">SlashTHEM</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/XNetHack\" title=\"XNetHack\">xNetHack</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/UnNetHack\" title=\"UnNetHack\">UnNetHack</a>, and almost every other fork. In particular, the content of SpliceHack and SlashTHEM were of importance - because these forks have a goldmine of content but their development has largely stalled, resulting in a backlog of bugs. Now players can find many of the features from those forks in Hack'EM, with less bugs and refined mechanics.\n</p><p>The main design philosophies still stand:\n</p>\n<ul><li>If something doesn't work, is buggy, or is easily abusable, attempt to improve it or remove it.</li>\n<li>If something is bland or feels unfinished - attempt to flesh it out.</li>\n<li>Add all the quality-of-life features that are available in the variant market.</li></ul>\n<p>But a couple of new ideas have also evolved:\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Make the game accessible to both NetHack newbies and veterans.</b> This was mostly accomplished by updating the object lookup to show more information on objects, monsters, and artifacts. A player doesn't have to run to the wiki (or wonder if the wiki is up-to-date).</li>\n<li><b>Make the game challenging for NetHack veterans, even if completely spoiled.</b> We want to keep people coming back for more, and we want to encourage different tactics as the texture of the game reveals itself.</li>\n<li><b>Make the game difficult - but fair.</b> Many new challenges have been introduced, but the player shouldn't feel that a situation is completely out of their control unless the RNG is really bad that day. For each new challenge, a counter-balance has usually been achieved. The opposite is also true, for any powerful effect in the player's favor, a counter-effect is usually balanced. The end-goal is to present the player with interesting situations.</li>\n<li><b>Nudge players to make more creative decisions.</b> If a mechanic, item, or feature makes for a completely decisionless strategy, this is usually viewed as a sign that something needs to be adjusted.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Quality-of-life_features\">Quality-of-life features</span></h2>\n<p><b>Object lookup has been fleshed out:</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>If you are new to Hack'EM, the object lookup will be your new best friend!</b></li>\n<li>There are a few ways to access the lookup info:</li></ul>\n<pre>   - Open your inventory (i), and then press the inventory letter associated with your item.\n   - Farlook: Press&#160;; then&#160;: on a monster or item.\n   - Type / and&#160;?, and manually type in the item/monster to query (e.g. \"potion of acid\")\n</pre>\n<ul><li>Object lookup shows a lot of useful information for items, including object properties and special effects from materials.</li>\n<li>Object lookup for corpses now shows intrinsics conferred, and other info about eating them (like if they are poisonous or acidic).</li>\n<li>Weapons show bonus damage and effects resulting from materials.</li>\n<li>Artifacts can also be looked up to reveal all the special effects they confer or attacks they inflict.</li>\n<li>You can see if a monster doesn't respect Elbereth or can't be magically scared in the Pokedex.</li>\n<li>Special item manipulation tricks will also be displayed if they pertain to the item:\n<ul><li>fermentation recipes with fruit juice (Lookup \"fruit juice\" for full listing)</li>\n<li>gem alchemy (Lookup \"acid\" or \"gem alchemy\" for a full listing of recipes)</li>\n<li>forging recipes</li>\n<li>tinker/upgrade paths</li></ul></li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Auto-identification\">Auto-identification</span></h3>\n<ul><li>All roles start out having these basic items pre-identified:\n<ul><li>potions of water</li>\n<li>blank scrolls</li>\n<li>scrolls of identify</li></ul></li>\n<li>Many items are auto-identified on wear, first use, or when their effects should logically be reveals (ie: water walking boots are identified when you walk over water)</li>\n<li>Almost all wands are identified when seeing their engraving effects or zap usage.</li>\n<li>If a wand shares an engrave message with others, it can be auto-identified by process of elimination if its counterparts are already identified.</li>\n<li>Auto-ID rings dropped into a sink when message is shown (Un)</li>\n<li>Auto-ID amulets dropped into toilets, if possible (slex)</li>\n<li>Auto-ID flintstones when rubbed on iron weapons (evil)</li>\n<li>Rustproof/erodeproof/fixed status is known by default for all items (DynaHack)</li>\n<li>After a period of using a wielded weapon and gaining experience with it, you will fully identify it (evil)</li>\n<li>Throne insight now recursively identifies all items in your possession and in your containers (fiq)</li>\n<li>Blessed stethoscopes can identify eggs (on the floor)</li>\n<li>Projectile un-identification has been left out (this prevents merging of previously known projectiles in 3.7)</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Magic_chests\">Magic chests</span></h3>\n<ul><li>The ultimate quality-of-life feature has been imported from EvilHack!</li>\n<li>Magic chests provide a convenient place to centralize your stash.</li>\n<li>There are many magic chests in the dungeon, and they all magically share the same contents.

The timeouts have also been reduced heavily from the UnNetHack calculations.\n</p><p>The modified Luck timeout depends on how far your Luck is from your base Luck: the higher or lower your Luck, the less the timeout is slowed. The timeout is calculated every turn, meaning gaining or losing a point of Luck could result in that point timing out immediately.\n</p><p>The modified Luck timeout is calculated by the following formula:\n</p>\n<pre>   Timeout = 25 * (20 - base_distance) * (20 - base_distance)\n</pre>\n<p>base_distance is how far you are from your base luck. If your base luck is 0 and you have 3 Luck, the base_distance is 3. If you have -10 base luck and 10 Luck, the base_distance is 20.\n</p><p>Additionally, <a href=\"/wiki/Archaeologist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Archaeologist\">Archaeologists</a> gain a +1 bonus to base Luck from wearing a <a href=\"/wiki/Fedora\" title=\"Fedora\">fedora</a>.

The sources of sonic rays are primarily <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_noise\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wand of noise\">wands of noise</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Violet_dragon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Violet dragon\">violet dragons</a>, and the <a href=\"/index.php?title=Spellbook_of_sonic_boom&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Spellbook of sonic boom (page does not exist)\">sonic boom spell</a>. These rays can be reflected (with a source of reflection) or resisted with sonic resistance. Sonic rays are quite destructive and will easily shatter anything made of glass in a monsters inventory, your inventory, or even on the floor. Glass objects include potions, rings, wands, tools, armor, or weapons. It is possible to shatterproof your items by wielding one and reading a <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_enchant_weapon\" title=\"Scroll of enchant weapon\">scroll of enchant weapon</a> while confused. Sonic rays can also destroy iron bars, toilets, sinks, boulders, and statues.\n</p><p>There are a handful of monsters which possess potent sonic or \"scream\" attacks. The common theme is that they are all ranged and can be launched from about 12 squares from the hero. They can also be used in melee range.\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/index.php?title=Concussive_sphere&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Concussive sphere (page does not exist)\">concussive spheres</a>: A one-time explosive sonic blast (similar to flaming spheres)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Violet_dragon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Violet dragon\">violet dragons</a>: Sonic breath attack, and passive sonic damage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/index.php?title=Screamer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Screamer (page does not exist)\">screamer</a>: Similar to a shrieker, but deals a sonic scream</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Nazgul\" title=\"Nazgul\">nazgul</a>: Scream which stuns</li>\n<li><a href=\"/index.php?title=Monstrous_spider&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Monstrous spider (page does not exist)\">monstrous spider</a>: Scream which inflicts fear</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Mobat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mobat\">mobat</a>: Piercing scream</li>\n<li><a href=\"/index.php?title=Banshee&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Banshee (page does not exist)\">banshee</a>: Scream which inflicts fear</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Harpy\" title=\"Harpy\">harpy</a>: Song which paralyzes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Gibberling\" title=\"Gibberling\">gibberling</a>: Possesses a plethora of attacks, each inflicting a unique but twisted effect (similar to a cursed unicorn horn)</li></ul>\n<p>All of the scream attacks can also shatter glass objects.

How can you protect against it or at least mitigate the damage? There is no source of intrinsic sonic resistance, unless you polymorph into a monster that innately has it. All sources are extrinsic but once obtained will also protect your items from shattering.\n</p><p><b>Sources of sonic resistance:</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>violet dragon scales</li>\n<li>violet dragon scaled armor</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Resonant_shield\" title=\"Resonant shield\">resonant shield</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/index.php?title=Ring_of_sonic_resistance&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Ring of sonic resistance (page does not exist)\">ring of sonic resistance</a></li>\n<li>Wielding or wearing an item with the sonic resistance property.</li>\n<li>Wielding <a href=\"/index.php?title=Thunderstruck&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Thunderstruck (page does not exist)\">Thunderstruck</a></li></ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Tortle\" title=\"Tortle\">tortle</a> race also starts with a <a href=\"/wiki/Toque\" title=\"Toque\">toque</a>, which doesn't grant explicit sonic resistance - but it will protect the player from sonic damage and nullify the effects of sonic attacks. Unfortunately, it will not protect your glass items from destruction. Becoming deaf also accomplishes the same thing.\n</p><p>One other obscure source of sonic resistance is simply being underwater. This automatically dispels any sonic damage and grants you (and monsters) sonic resistance while submerged.\n</p><p><b>Using sonic damage for offense:</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>It may look daunting seeing all the sonic threats facing the player - but keep in mind that if you are able to obtain Thunderstruck, or a decent weapon that has the scream property (which does sonic damage), you now wield a weapon that the majority of monsters in Hack'EM do not resist. Only about 5% of monsters are sonic resistant. There are almost double the amount of acid resistant monsters at ~10%, which shows how niche this attack vector is.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Psychic_damage_and_resistance\">Psychic damage and resistance</span></h3>\n<ul><li>(from Splice and EvilHack)</li></ul>\n<p>Like sonic damage, psychic damage also comes in a few forms. The form most players will be familiar with is the mind flayers psychic blast, which can target you from a wide range. A few new monster now also have a melee based psychic attack: the gnomish psyker and the dream thief. Ethereal lights also are fast and will explode on contact, inflicting psychic damage as well as fear on the player. \n</p><p><b>Psychic resistance:</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The only source of extrinsic psychic resistance is the <a href=\"/wiki/Tinfoil_hat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tinfoil hat\">tinfoil hat</a>.</li>\n<li>Protects you from forgetting skills, spells, and other things from potions and scrolls of amnesia, as well as mind flayer and zombie brain eating attack.</li>\n<li>Illithids start with psychic resistance.</li>\n<li>Illithid player characters are immune to the mind flayer brain eating attack but are not immune to zombie brain eating.</li>\n<li>Protects you from an illithids psionic wave and tentacle attacks.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Larva_carrier_property\">Larva carrier property</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Some monsters can infect you with dangerous eggs!

Strong techs are very useful and comprise most of the techs, so the standard cooldown is 1000-1500 turns. Mid-strong techs are not too abusable, but deserve some kind of timeout so they are 500-1000 turns. Utility techs are very useful techs and meant to be quite accessible, so they are only 100-200 turns.

You can engage them in battle, and if you kill your quest leader, this unlocks the quest. You can then complete your quest as you normally would. However, quest leaders are not weak, and your deity may not be pleased with you killing them.\n</p><p><b>Alignment Impact:</b> Your alignment record can still be positive, but abusing your alignment can have a direct effect on how your quest ends. Alignment abuse is tracked throughout the game. Any negative alignment adjustment counts as one abuse point, and this can be checked at any time via #conduct. Compared to the standard game, you'll receive more feedback when abusing alignment.\n</p><p><b>Permanent Abuse Record:</b> Unlike your alignment record, which can be adjusted back into positive standing, your alignment abuse record is permanent.\n</p><p><b>Quest Artifact Forfeiture:</b> Quest leaders might ask you to forfeit the quest artifact if you have abused your alignment.\n</p><p><b>Options for Forfeiture:</b> You have two options at this point – either hand over the quest artifact peacefully or decline. Declining will anger your quest leader, and they will attack. Handing over the quest artifact peacefully will flag the quest as complete.\n</p><p><b>Incomplete Quest Consequences:</b> Declining to turn over the quest artifact does not complete the quest. At some point, your quest leader will need to be defeated before the quest is flagged as complete. Attempting to evade your quest leader will not help in the long run, as the Bell of Opening has been 'cursed'. The only way to lift the curse is to complete the quest. The Bell will not function for the invocation until this is done.\n</p><p><b>Luck boon:</b> If you complete the quest with under 13 alignment abuse, you will receive a luck boon (+1 to permanent luck).\n</p><p><b>Alternative Scenarios:</b> The game considers alternative scenarios. For instance, if you angered your quest leader before starting the quest and you killed them, you simply need to defeat your quest nemesis to flag the quest as complete. Conversely, if you've killed the quest nemesis and return but somehow anger your quest leader before you speak to them, killing them also flags the quest as complete.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dungeon_features\">Dungeon features</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trap_mechanics\">Trap mechanics</span></h3>\n<p>Several new trap features have been added to the game:\n</p><p><i>Ice Traps:</i> These traps are only generated after level 8. They shoot a freezing jet of icy air, which can freeze and slow down the player upon activation. This blast of icy mist is dangerous - it will do 4d8 cold damage and can remove your intrinsic cold resistance! (adapted from xnh)\n</p><p><i>Magic Beam Traps:</i> Magic beam traps are now part of the game, but they cannot generate above level 16. Notably, these traps now produce a random type of magical beam upon activation, offering more variety compared to their previous static beam type.\n</p><p><i>Rust Trap Changes:</i> Players now have the ability to untrap rust traps using the #untrap command, which transforms them into fountains. However, disarming rust traps from a distance, whether through telekinesis or zapping with acid, will not yield a fountain.\n</p><p><i>Fire Trap Untrapping:</i> Fire traps can be deactivated using #untrap, but it requires water to do so.\n</p><p><i>Spear Trap Yield:</i> When disarming a spear trap, there is a chance of obtaining a spear or stake. Flyers also still have a 50% chance of being poked by a spear trap. If you (or a monster) are levitating, you will be too high to reach.\n</p><p><i>Web Destruction:</i> Players can now force-fight webs with a bladed weapon to destroy them.\n</p><p><i>Castle Drawbridge:</i> It's worth noting that the Castle drawbridge doesn't always close with the passtune as it did before.\n</p><p><i>Temporary Invisibility:</i> Invisibility gained from magic traps is temporary and not permanent.\n</p><p><i>Polymorph Traps:</i> The mechanics of polytraps have been adjusted, with a 1/7 chance that the polymorph trap disappears after polymorphing a monster. This mechanic was adapted from SpliceHack.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Breaking_wands_creates_related_traps\">Breaking wands creates related traps</span></h3>\n<p><b>Breaking wands will usually create related traps (Un)</b>\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Wand</th>\n<th>Trap created\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wand of cold</td>\n<td>ice trap\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wand of opening</td>\n<td>trap door\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wand of fire</td>\n<td>fire trap\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wand of magic missile</td>\n<td>magic trap\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wand of teleportation</td>\n<td>teleport trap\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wand of polymorph</td>\n<td>poly trap\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wand of sleep</td>\n<td>sleeping gas trap\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wand of cancellation</td>\n<td>anti-magic trap\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wand of deluge</td>\n<td>rust trap\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wand of shock</td>\n<td>magic beam trap\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wand of poison gas</td>\n<td>magic beam trap\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wand of corrosion</td>\n<td>magic beam trap\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wand of noise</td>\n<td>magic beam trap\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><b>wand of detection:</b> When broken this does not create a trap, however it will now detect traps and portals.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Breakable_iron_bars\">Breakable iron bars</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Iron bars can be destroyed in a couple of different ways.</li>\n<li>You can shatter them with wands of striking, wands of noise, spells of force bolt, or spells of sonic boom.</li>\n<li>You can punch and shatter them when wearing <a href=\"/index.php?title=Gauntlets_of_force&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Gauntlets of force (page does not exist)\">gauntlets of force</a>.</li>\n<li>You can zap them with an acid ray or breath to dissolve them</li></ul>\n<p>If you shatter them, some <a href=\"/wiki/Iron_chain\" title=\"Iron chain\">iron chains</a> may be randomly flung out as a result.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Grass\">Grass</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Pulled from SpliceHack/xNetHack, we now have lush grass in the dungeon!</li>\n<li>Grass appears sparsely in the early levels, peaks around level 15, and then tapers off after level 22.</li>\n<li>Although grass is mostly ornamental, keep in mind that some monsters can use it as clever method of concealment.

These improvements were inspired by their inclusion in SLASH'EM. Notably, toilets can now appear on their own, separate from sinks, whereas in SLASH'EM, they only came in pairs with sinks. The addition of fishing in toilets introduces a quirky element to the game.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Enabled fishing in toilets</li>\n<li>Dropping a ring of poly into a sink can poly into a toilet.</li>\n<li>Toilet prayer can now stop the vomiting process</li>\n<li>If giants sit on toilets, they break.</li></ul>\n<p><b>Toilet kicking:</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Like sinks, toilets now have a couple different effects from kicking them, including a few <a href=\"/wiki/YAFM\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"YAFM\">YAFM</a>.</li>\n<li>Kicking now only breaks the toilet 1/7 chance (was 1/4 in SLASH'EM)</li>\n<li>Kicking can generate <a href=\"/wiki/Giant_cockroaches\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Giant cockroaches\">giant cockroaches</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Sewage\" title=\"Sewage\">sewage</a> from kicking (1 in 17 chance)</li>\n<li>Kicking can generate <a href=\"/wiki/Brown_pudding\" title=\"Brown pudding\">brown puddings</a> (only once per toilet)</li>\n<li>Kicking can generate a random tool.

Dwarf and gnome thieves are now found in most town and Minetown variants. The presence of undead in the mines is no longer tied to alignment (as in SLASH'EM) but depends on the dungeon depth. The deeper you go, the higher the chance of encountering undead versions of the regular denizens, making the later stages more challenging.\n</p><p>Hack'EM has integrated Minetown variants from SlashTHEM and SpliceHack, along with Mine's End levels from SlashTHEM. Additionally, the Gnome King's ending from SLASH'EM and SlashTHEM is available. One Minetown variant features a drawbridge. However, players should be cautious, as destroying the drawbridge in the presence of guards will anger them. The mine rivers that are present in GruntHack and EvilHack are still in the mines - but they will be found only deeper than Minetown and not before.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"

In SLASH'EM there was a reduced probability of gaining levels with a mix of other effects.</li>\n<li>Removed the <a href=\"/wiki/Polymorph#SLASH.27EM\" title=\"Polymorph\">temporary polymorph</a> mechanic for objects. There is no \"hazy\" status for polymorphed objects. This mechanic was not imported for 2 reasons: it makes it possible to create overpowered weapons (e.g. +127 weapons) and it is also not intuitive for new players since it contradicts the vanilla behavior of polymorphed items.</li>\n<li>Removed SLASH'EM's invisible objects. For now, there has not been a compelling reason to bring this mechanic in.</li>\n<li>Removed SLASH'EM polymorph behavior for monsters; when killed shapeshifters could immediately poly into their polyform (or different form if a chameleon or similar). This mechanic was quite frustrating to deal with, especially concerning new threats like <a href=\"/wiki/Weretiger\" title=\"Weretiger\">weretigers</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Werepanther\" title=\"Werepanther\">werepanthers</a>. In SLASH'EM you could be forced to kill the same shapechanger many times before it would finally die in its base form. The EvilHack behavior replaces this so that a shapechanger cannot poly again once it has been killed in its polyform.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Changes_from_EvilHack\">Changes from EvilHack</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Removed the <a href=\"/wiki/Goblin_Town\" title=\"Goblin Town\">Goblin Town</a> branch.</li>\n<li>Removed the Ice Queen branch.</li>\n<li>Removed the Vecna's Domain branch. We still have Vecna but in a different level for the Chaotic Quest.</li>\n<li>Removed the indestructible drawbridge from the VotD; it can be destroyed like a regular drawbridge now.</li>\n<li>Demon lords and princes no longer negate being able to self-teleport or use cursed potions of gain level.</li>\n<li>Removed the <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_Orcus\" title=\"Wand of Orcus\">Wand of Orcus</a>. Orcus gets his standard wand of death now.</li>\n<li>Some of the dragon scales have had buffs or different secondary effects added. All scales grant passive effects now. See the section on Dragon Scales for details.</li>\n<li>Removed chromatic dragon scales.</li>\n<li>#forge has been renamed to #craft for working with <a href=\"/wiki/Forge_(dungeon_feature)\" title=\"Forge (dungeon feature)\">forges</a>. The reason is to make #force and #craft auto-complete. #forge still has the same meta shortcut:  M('F')</li>\n<li>Removed two-weaponing weight-based restrictions.</li>\n<li>Removed the monster riding monster mechanic.</li>\n<li>Monster spawn rates depend on the number of wishes made, not on game progress.</li>\n<li>Zapping light around peaceful monsters could anger them. This mechanic has been removed except for when you break a wand of light.</li>\n<li>Spellcasting monsters have to see you in order to cast summon nasties.</li>\n<li>Spellcasting monsters have had their spell range limited by their level (gnomish mages are level 3 and can only cast fire bolt in a radius of 2-3 tiles instead of 13).</li>\n<li>Changed timeout for monster spell of stone to flesh to timeout 2d7 instead of rn2(7).</li>\n<li>Removed engulfing attack from gelatinous cube, water elemental, earth elemental, and fire elemental. The Splice elementals (magma, mud, ice, acid) still can engulf.</li>\n<li>Removed cursed weapons reverse hitting (was in EvilHack and Splice). Instead, cursed weapons will miss their target 25% of the time.</li>\n<li>Revert the standard cursed wand backfire chance from 1-in-30 to 1-in-100.</li>\n<li>Revert EvilHack sacrifice gift changes: Instead of a mix of regular items and artifacts, players will receive only artifacts (unless you get a minion as a gift).</li>\n<li>Removed accompanying artifact defenders when wishing for artifacts.</li>\n<li>Lowered the poison insta-death resistance threshold from 35% to 25%. If your poison resistance is under 25% you have a chance of insta-death from poison dart traps, poison bite, etc.</li>\n<li>In EvilHack the Amulet of Yendor has a chance of teleporting randomly if dropped on the floor, this random chance of teleport has been removed.</li>\n<li>Revert cursed amulet of life saving effects</li>\n<li>Revert Amulet of life saving will not work if the player is in nonliving form.</li>\n<li>Revert Amulet of life saving does not fully heal the wearer.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Illithids used to get flying at level 12, now they start with flying.</li>\n<li>Centaurs used to get jumping at level 5, now they start with jumping.</li>\n<li>Giants can wear mummy wrappings, giant robes, and dragon scales.</li>\n<li>Any giant can wear <a href=\"/wiki/Large_splint_mail\" title=\"Large splint mail\">large splint mail</a>.</li>\n<li>Tortles can wear robes, mummy wrappings, and dragon scales.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Funny_or_silly_changes\">Funny or silly changes</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Gnomes hate eggs (from EvilHack)</li>\n<li>Vampires can't use toilets.</li></ul>\n<div style=\"display:none; right:10px;\" class=\"metadata topicon nopopups\" id=\"featured-star\"><div style=\"margin-top: 0px\"><a href=\"/wiki/NetHackWiki:Featured_articles\" title=\"This is a featured article.

project started by [[User:Hackemslashem]] with the goal of becoming the next successor to [[SLASH'EM]]. Simply put, Hack'EM is \"Hack, Extended Mechanics.\"\nStarting with version 1.3.0, [[User:malor]] has taken over to keep Hack'EM alive and help it continue to evolve!\n\n== Main menu ==\n\n{{float right|{{caption|{{HackEMMonsters}}|Click on a glyph to go to that monster's page.}}}}\n\n* [[Hack'EM Frequently Asked Questions]]\n* [[Hack'EM strategy guide for vanilla players]]\n\n'''Info on new content and changes to existing content:'''\n* [[Item (Hack'EM)]]\n* [[Monster (Hack'EM)]] [[Monster (Hack'EM)/Full list|(Unabridged listing of all monsters)]]\n* [[Roles and races (Hack'EM)]]\n* [[Artifact (Hack'EM)]]\n\nScript generated pages:\n* [[Hack'EM monsters]] \n* [[Hack'EM items]] \n\n== About ==\n=== Welcome to Hack'EM! ===\nWhen hackemslashem first started this project, it was an attempt to modernize [[SLASH'EM]] and bring it to a modern post-NetHack 3.4.3 environment. He started with [[EvilHack]] as a base because he was intrigued by the challenging reputation of EvilHack and the comprehensive feature set it contained. However, as the project proceeded he found many other interesting mechanics and ideas to refine and mix in from other forks. The result was a game where the skeleton is SLASH'EM, but the innards are composed of EvilHack, [[SpliceHack]], [[SlashTHEM]], [[xNetHack]], [[UnNetHack]], and almost every other fork. In particular, the content of SpliceHack and SlashTHEM were of importance - because these forks have a goldmine of content but their development has largely stalled, resulting in a backlog of bugs. Now players can find many of the features from those forks in Hack'EM, with less bugs and refined mechanics.\n\nThe main design philosophies still stand:\n* If something doesn't work, is buggy, or is easily abusable, attempt to improve it or remove it.\n* If something is bland or feels unfinished - attempt to flesh it out.\n* Add all the quality-of-life features that are available in the variant market.\n\nBut a couple of new ideas have also evolved:\n* '''Make the game accessible to both NetHack newbies and veterans.''' This was mostly accomplished by updating the object lookup to show more information on objects, monsters, and artifacts. A player doesn't have to run to the wiki (or wonder if the wiki is up-to-date).\n* '''Make the game challenging for NetHack veterans, even if completely spoiled.''' We want to keep people coming back for more, and we want to encourage different tactics as the texture of the game reveals itself.\n* '''Make the game difficult - but fair.''' Many new challenges have been introduced, but the player shouldn't feel that a situation is completely out of their control unless the RNG is really bad that day. For each new challenge, a counter-balance has usually been achieved. The opposite is also true, for any powerful effect in the player's favor, a counter-effect is usually balanced. The end-goal is to present the player with interesting situations. \n* '''Nudge players to make more creative decisions.''' If a mechanic, item, or feature makes for a completely decisionless strategy, this is usually viewed as a sign that something needs to be adjusted.\n\n== Quality-of-life features ==\n\n'''Object lookup has been fleshed out:'''\n* '''If you are new to Hack'EM, the object lookup will be your new best friend!'''\n* There are a few ways to access the lookup info:\n    - Open your inventory (i), and then press the inventory letter associated with your item.\n    - Farlook: Press ; then : on a monster or item.\n    - Type / and ?, and manually type in the item/monster to query (e.g. \"potion of acid\")\n* Object lookup shows a lot of useful information for items, including object properties and special effects from materials.\n* Object lookup for corpses now shows intrinsics conferred, and other info about eating them (like if they are poisonous or acidic).\n* Weapons show bonus damage and effects resulting from materials.\n* Artifacts can also be looked up to reveal all the special effects they confer or attacks they inflict.\n* You can see if a monster doesn't respect Elbereth or can't be magically scared in the Pokedex. \n* Special item manipulation tricks will also be displayed if they pertain to the item:\n** fermentation recipes with fruit juice (Lookup \"fruit juice\" for full listing)\n** gem alchemy (Lookup \"acid\" or \"gem alchemy\" for a full listing of recipes)\n** forging recipes\n** tinker/upgrade paths\n\n=== Auto-identification ===\n\n* All roles start out having these basic items pre-identified: \n** potions of water\n** blank scrolls\n** scrolls of identify\n* Many items are auto-identified on wear, first use, or when their effects should logically be reveals (ie: water walking boots are identified when you walk over water)\n* Almost all wands are identified when seeing their engraving effects or zap usage.\n* If a wand shares an engrave message with others, it can be auto-identified by process of elimination if its counterparts are already identified.\n* Auto-ID rings dropped into a sink when message is shown (Un)\n* Auto-ID amulets dropped into toilets, if possible (slex)\n* Auto-ID flintstones when rubbed on iron weapons (evil)\n* Rustproof/erodeproof/fixed status is known by default for all items (DynaHack)\n* After a period of using a wielded weapon and gaining experience with it, you will fully identify it (evil)\n* Throne insight now recursively identifies all items in your possession and in your containers (fiq)\n* Blessed stethoscopes can identify eggs (on the floor)\n* Projectile un-identification has been left out (this prevents merging of previously known projectiles in 3.7)\n\n=== Magic chests ===\n\n* The ultimate quality-of-life feature has been imported from EvilHack!\n* Magic chests provide a convenient place to centralize your stash.\n* There are many magic chests in the dungeon, and they all magically share the same contents. So you can store your goods in the Minetown stash, run down to Sokoban, and voila - there they are!\n* Nothing this good comes without a catch though, and since all magic chests start out locked, you will need a special magic key to access them. Magic keys can be found in [[Mine's End]], the [[Pleasant Valley]] village level (in Goda's hideout), or at [[Grund's Stronghold]].\n* You can also use the alignment quest keys because they double as magic keys.\n* Note: Monster can and will loot your magic chests - so always make sure to lock them when away!\n\n'''Magic chest locations:'''\n* Minetown\n* Sokoban (first level)\n* The Pleasant Valley\n* Your role's quest home level\n* The Lawful Quest\n* Fort Ludios\n* The Black Market\n* The Temple of Moloch\n* The Castle\n* Orcus town\n\n=== Other QoL ===\n\n'''Many effects are explicitly displayed for the player's benefit:'''\n* The player's magic cancellation (MC) is shown in the status bar (evil)\n* Phasing status is also shown in the status bar. (from EvilHack)\n* Realtime display option is now available (from EvilHack)\n* Show prayer stats in Attributes menu [^X screen] (from UnNetHack, originally from dNetHack)\n* Firearms that have different modes of operation display their modes in the player's inventory.\n* The number of gifts received appears in the #conduct screen.\n* When transmogrifying or using the add property service, the same property will not ever be re-applied. You should always expect to see a different property as a result.\n\n'''New options are available for the player's convenience:'''\n* Config option for auto-stair travel ('''autostairtravel''')\n* Config option for kicking shortcuts ('''ctrlkick''')\n* Config option to play without the bloody tile coloring ('''bloodless''')\n* '''Paranoid swim''' and '''paranoid trap''' options can be set.\n* '''showdmg option''' (from SLASH'EM): This shows damage vs the player in (parentheses) and damage vs monsters in [brackets]. It also toggles the flanking bonus display on and off. \n\n'''Effortless dungeon navigation features''' \n* > < to auto-travel to stairs (from Unnethack)\n* Control+Direction now kicks in that direction\n* The Astral Plane is always lit (xnh)\n* Removed all random secret corridors (xnh)\n* Don't hide magic portals (from xNetHack)\n* Removed the Quest turn limit (Un)\n* Removed the mysterious force\n* Deliberate level teleporter activation ignores magic resistance (3.7)\n* Switching between your main and alternative weapon does not take any turns (from dnh)\n* Prevent stopping on graves and engravings when running.\n* Punishment no longer stops you from displacing pets (DynaHack)\n* The passtune range has been extended by 1 so you can now play one step farther away from the drawbridge (xnh)\n\n'''Better inventory management'''\n* When identified, scrolls of enchant armor ask what armor to enchant.\n* When identified, scrolls of transmogrify ask what item to target.\n* Remove \"Auto-select every item\" when putting into containers (Un)\n* Default shopkeeper sell prompt to N (xnh)\n* '''Magical Explosions:''' Players cannot put known wands of cancellation or magical bags into bags of holding anymore (dnh). This also applies when #tipping into your bag of holding, you will flick away explosive items if you have the item and the BoH identified.\n* Magicbane is safe for any Bag of Holding, it does not cause BoH explosions.\n* If a player charges a depleted Bag of Tricks/Rats with contents - it will now explode and scatter the contents instead of deleting them.\n* You can tip into containers on the ground, as well as empty bags of tricks/rats.\n\n'''End Game Log Changes'''\n* Total damage the player has done now shows in the end game log.\n* Total damage the player has taken now shows in the end game log.\n\n'''Misc other features:'''\n* Regeneration only causes additional hunger when injured (Un)\n* Having hunger prevents choking on food (3.7)\n* 1-damage hits still train weapon/unarmed skills (from DynaHack)\n* Chargeable rings may get charged when hit with electricity (3.7)\n* Lower chances of rings exploding during charging. Rings with enchantment +3 or lower will no longer have a chance of exploding when charged, making them similar to enchanting armor and more intuitive. Rings at -5 or lower will only explode from cursed charging. (DynaHack/SporkHack)\n* Useless +0 rings are generate very rarely (xnh)\n* Monsters are prevented from picking up gold in shops (Un)\n* Monsters don't blame the player for falling down holes the player dug. Pit traps still count.\n* Potions have been made more useful from a small collection of patches (see the Alchemy Mechanics section)\n* Allow all position prompts to be aborted (DynaHack).\n* Extrinsic resistances protect items from elemental damage. For example, wearing a ring of fire resistance will protect your scrolls and potions from fire damage.\n* Wielding/wearing item giving stoning res will cure stoning (EvilHack).\n* Phasing allows escape from being engulfed. (EvilHack)\n* When a spell of yours gets under the 100 turn threshold, you will get a reminder that it is fading.\n\n* All roles (except Caveman) get their special spell granted when they reach level 12 (SpliceHack)\n* Pets will not use rings of teleportation.\n* Players can use gaze attacks in melee range when poly'd into a form with one. \n* Greased/oilskin objects have a chance of resisting theft. (from EvilHack)\n* Merged scimitar and saber skills.\n\n=== New options and commands ===\n\n* #force can also be used on doors while wielding a weapon (SLASH'EM)\n* #naming glitches have been nerfed - Players can no longer #name items for identification clues. On attempting to name a regular object with a related artifact name (e.g. naming a candle \"The Candle of Eternal Flame\"), your hand will always slip.\n* Monks can break boulders and statues using martial arts skill at skilled level or higher (shift + f and then a movement key).\n* Rogues can steal from monsters by using 'thievery', (must be bare-handed to use, press shift + f and then a movement key).\n* Convicts can #chat with rats to pacify or tame them.\n* Necromancers can #chat with zombies to pacify or tame them.\n* Changed #forge to #craft.\n* #tech accesses your role's available techniques.\n* #loot can be used at your pet to both give and take away items from its inventory. You cannot give an unpaid item to a pet by using #loot.\n* Add #genocided command to view what species have already been eliminated\n\n=== Wizard mode updates ===\n\n* #wizclear (^z), clears all monsters on level (splice)\n* Can wish for monsters with ^w (Un)\n* Wishing does not trigger the normal game wishing penalties on luck or increased monster generation.\n\n=== New conducts ===\n\n* Added celibate conduct (SLASH'EM)\n* Added conduct for performing (or refusing to perform) techniques.\n* Added a conduct for buying or selling from shopkeepers.\n\n=== Wishing shortcuts ===\n\nNote: Capitalization does not matter when using these.\n\n{|class=\"prettytable sortable\"\n!Item !!

Wishing can impact your base luck, the monster spawn rate, and the difficulty of monsters.\n* After the 2nd wish (the first 2 are free from consequences), the player's '''base luck''' gets lowered by -1 for every new wish they make. So 3 wishes = -1 base luck, 4 wishes = -2 base luck, and so on.\n* Base luck cannot be lowered more than -10.\n\nTo clarify any confusion about the adjustment to base luck - this means that your luck will now time out to this amount. Your maximum luck is still potentially +10 (or +13 with a blessed luckstone) can still be reached by altar sacrifice or gaining luck from unicorn gem-tossing. If your base luck is quite low, keep in mind that the luck will timeout fairly quickly if it is maximized.\n\nThis table lays out the exact adjustments for how many wishes the player has made.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!# of wishes !! base Luck !! spawn rate || difficulty spike\n|-\n\n|1 || 0 || 1x || 0\n|-\n\n|2 || 0 || 1x || 0\n|-\n\n|3 || -1 || 1x || 2\n|-\n\n|4 || -2 || 2x || 3\n|-\n\n|5 || -3 || 3x || 4\n|-\n\n|6 || -4 || 4x || 5\n|-\n\n|7 || -5 || 5x || 6\n|-\n\n|8 || -6 || 6x || 7\n|-\n\n|9 || -7 || 7x || 8\n|-\n\n|10 || -8 || 8x || 9\n|-\n\n|11 || -9 || 8x || 10\n|-\n\n|12 || -10 || 8x || 11\n|-\n\n|13 || -10 || 16x || 12\n|}\n\n'''Other wishing notes:'''\n* Note: Magic lamps are more rare, ''but always guaranteed to grant wishes.'' You can bank on the Sunless Sea to have a magic lamp with a wish.\n* Monsters can no longer use wands of wishing to get wishes - if they get a wish from a smoky potion they will still attempt to get something powerful.\n\n'''Wishing for artifacts:'''\n* Instead of being based off of how many artifacts exist in the game total (vanilla NetHack method), success is based off of how many artifacts the player has wished for (successful or not). \n* The first two artiwishes are guaranteed.\n\n=== Astral rain ===\n\n* Taming is much more difficult on the Astral Plane.\n* When attempting to use a scroll of taming, a magic harp, the charm monster spell, or any other source of taming - there is only a 10% chance of success. \n* Figurines still function as normal.\n\n=== Polymorphing mechanics ===\n\n* '''Polymorphing non-magical items''' Inspired by dNetHack, this change significantly reduces the likelihood of polymorphing generic non-magical items. \n* The following items will only have a 1% chance of transforming into something magical:\n** [[blank scroll]]\n** [[scroll of amnesia]]\n** [[potion of water]]\n** [[potion of blood]]\n** [[potion of amnesia]]\n** [[blank spellbook]]\n** [[wand of nothing]]\n** [[wand of wonder]]\n\n=== Bones mechanics ===\n* When bones files are left, there's a significant chance of items being polymorphed or shuddering away. This makes bones file peeking and bones stuffing a bit less reliable.\n\n=== SLASH'EM style unicorn horns ===\n\nThe probability of a unicorn horn curing ailments is changed. Blessed horns try to fix all problems, each with the given probability, and uncursed horns try to fix a single problem, with the same probability.\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n!Enchantment !! Chance\n|-\n|| 0 or less || 30%\n|-\n|| 1 || 40%\n|-\n|| 2 || 50%\n|-\n|| 3 || 60%\n|-\n|| 4 || 70%\n|-\n|| 5 || 80%\n|-\n|| 6 or more || 90%\n|}\n\n=== SLASH'EM style wraith corpses ===\n\nIn [[SLASH'EM]], wraith corpses have different effects if eaten:\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n! Possibility !! Effect !! Message\n|-\n| 10% || You lose experience. || \"You feel that was a bad idea.\"\n|-\n| 10% || Your maximum HP and Pw decreases. || \"You don't feel so good ...\"\n|-\n| 20% || Nothing happens. || \"You feel something strange for a moment.\"\n|-\n| 10% || Your maximum HP and Pw increases. || \"You feel physically and mentally stronger!\"\n|-\n| 50% || You gain experience. || \"You feel that was a smart thing to do.\"\n|}\n\n* [[Necromancer]]s will always benefit from eating wraith corpses and default to gaining a level.\n* [[Undead Slayer]]s get a -5 alignment penalty for eating a wraith corpse.\n\n=== Elbereth ===\nInitially, players must discover Elbereth within the game, either through rumors or by reading about it, with exceptions made for elves and hobbits, who innately possess this knowledge. When conflict is in effect, the protective power of Elbereth is nullified. Orcs, regardless of their form, are incapable of learning Elbereth. In a significant development, when a lawful character is crowned as the Hand of Elbereth, they gain knowledge of Elbereth if they didn't possess it before. The alignment penalty for attacking while invoking Elbereth has been reduced to a modest -1.\n\nNotably, there are some creatures that show no reverence for Elbereth's protection:\n* Any @ monsters, including shopkeepers and guards\n* [[minotaur]]s\n* [[elder minotaur]]s\n* [[giant praying mantis]]\n* [[Neothelid (EvilHack)|neothelids]]\n* unique monsters\n* monsters in Gehennom\n* peaceful monsters\n* blind monsters\n\n===Scare monster===\nSeveral more monsters have immunity to the [[scroll of scare monster]] as well, with the complete list below:\n\n* All unique monsters such as the formidable Wizard of Yendor, quest nemeses, and the Riders\n* All [[angelic being]]s\n* All [[human or elf]] monsters\n* All [[Player monster (Hack'EM)|player monsters]]\n* Any monster in a [[Berserk (EvilHack)|berserk state]]\n* Any monster under [[conflict]]\n* Any [[mindless]] monster\n\n===Genocide===\nThe [[scroll of genocide]] functions as in [[UnNetHack]]: an uncursed scroll eliminates all of a chosen monster on the current level; a blessed scroll permanently removes a chosen monster from the game; and a cursed scroll will generate a few of the chosen monster as in ''NetHack''.\n\n== Mechanics changes ==\n\n=== Combat ===\n\n* Major change from SLASH'EM - Artifact weapons do not deal flat +x damage - they deal damage based on their dice rolls.\n* All edged weapons can be poisoned (ex: daggers, swords)\n\n* When a player attempts to strike a monster using a weapon they are either restricted or unskilled in, or any non-weapon item, their likelihood of successfully landing a hit will never exceed 75%. Notably, bare-handed combat remains an exception to this rule.\n\n* '''Launchers now contribute to damage'''.\n** The enchantment of a launcher applies to missiles shot from it. However, the enchantment on a launcher and missiles does not stack. This means you only need to enchant the launcher and can save scrolls of enchant weapon for other uses.\n** Example #1: You have a +7 bow and +0 arrows. The arrows will act as if +7.\n** Example #2: You have a +0 bow and +7 arrows. The arrows will act as if +7.\n** Example #3: You have a +7 bow and +7 arrows. The arrows will act as if +7.\n** Example #4: You have a +3 bow and +2 arrows. The arrows will act as if +3.\n\n* '''Strength bonus for two-handed weaponry is x1.5''' (from EvilHack)\n** The standard damage bonus for strength is multiplied 1.5 times when wielding a weapon using two hands, or if you're a giant one-handing a two-handed weapon (they're heavy)\n\n* '''Gloves' enchantment is now added to unarmed damage.\n** Example: Fighting bare-handed with +3 gloves adds +3 damage to hits.\n\n* Stoning – monsters being stoned is a slow-stoning process, just as it is for the player.\n\n=== Skill system overhaul with crosstraining ===\n\nThe skill system for achieving proficiency in weapons and spells has been overhauled and adapted to the UnNetHack system. \n\n[[UnNetHack]] changes the number of successful uses of a skill required to reach each level.  These values are:\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n!Skill level\n!Successful uses\n!Old value\n|-\n|Unskilled\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|Basic\n|100\n|20\n|-\n|Skilled\n|200\n|80\n|-\n|Expert\n|400\n|180\n|-\n|Master\n|800\n|320\n|-\n|Grand Master\n|1600\n|500\n|}\n\nSpell skills, however, advance four times as fast until the player is Skilled in the relevant skill, after that, the skill only advances twice as fast as shown in the table above.\n\n'''Crosstraining skills:'''\n\nHowever, in addition - we have also brought in crosstraining from DynaHack. As you level up a weapon skill, it will enable faster training of related skills. You will notice a 2x by a skill that gets a double bonus, or even a 3x or 4x bonus.\n\nAlso from DynaHack a couple tweaks were made to skill bonuses \nthat increase the effect of skills on weapon to-hit/damage.\n\n'''Crosstraining bonuses:'''\n\nWhile you are training up weapons, you will also get rare bonus training points for related skills. As an example you might get a bonus to mace skill when exercising club skill because they are both \"bludgeon\" weapons. As your skill grows, the bonuses will become more frequent. As a result, it might be worth maxing out a strong skill your role starts with to benefit from all the crosstraining bonuses. Once a skill can be advanced (100%) it will stop receiving random crosstraining bonuses. \n\n=== Shield skill ===\n\nA new trainable skill from EvilHack, shield skill gives the player a new avenue of defense (and even offense) to train up. Roles that can highly train shields will benefit from much higher AC and gain some nice offensive bonuses. The shield skill also works in conjunction with the Power Shield technique, which you gain access to on attaining skilled level in shields. This technique can be a lifesaver if you get caught in a sudden ambush.\n\n'''AC bonuses:'''\n\n* To get these bonuses, you must be wearing a shield and have the required skill.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Skill level!!AC bonus\n|-\n| unskilled/restricted || +0AC\n|-\n| BASIC skill: || +1AC\n|-\n| SKILLED skill: || +3AC\n|-\n| EXPERT skill: || +5AC\n|-\n| MASTER skill: || +8AC \n|}\n\nIf your role allows for it, you can train up your shield skill while wearing a shield. If you block an attack outright with your shield, that automatically trains shield skill. Otherwise, there's a small chance of training shield skill while wearing one and a regular miss event occurs.\n\n'''Shield Bashing:'''\n\nIf shield skill is basic or higher, and a shield is being worn, there's a chance the player will receive an extra 'shield bash' attack along with their regular attack. The greater the shield skill, the greater the chance of the extra shield bash attack occurring.\n* Small shields do 2-4 damage, Tower shields do 2-13 damage.\n* All other shields do 3-8 damage (not counting material hatred, which is factored in). \n* Expert skill or higher gets an extra small damage bonus\n* Expert/master skill in shields gives a chance of stunning your target with a shield bash.\n\n'''Misc:'''\n* If expert skill or higher in shields, your shield will be prevented from being taken away via dwarvish bearded axe attack.\n\n'''The roles that can train in shields are:'''\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n!Role\n!Shield Skill\n|-\n|Archaeologist\n|BASIC\n|-\n|Barbarian\n|SKILLED\n|-\n|Caveperson\n|BASIC\n|-\n|Convict\n|BASIC\n|-\n|Knight\n|EXPERT\n|-\n|Necromancer\n|SKILLED\n|-\n|Priest\n|SKILLED\n|-\n|Rogue\n|BASIC\n|-\n|Ranger\n|SKILLED\n|-\n|Tourist\n|BASIC\n|-\n|Undead Slayer\n|SKILLED\n|-\n|Valkyrie\n|MASTER\n|-\n|Yeoman\n|BASIC\n|}\n\n* Knights and Valkyries start at basic skill.\n\n=== Mold and fungus resurrection ===\n\n* This content has been imported from xnh, which, in turn, had borrowed it from SLASH'EM.\n* Corpses have a chance over time to grow moldy and produce a random F monster.\n* The corpses of petrifying monsters (ie: cockatrices) will only grow green molds.\n* The resurrection rates have been tapered back a bit, so it's not as pervasive as in Slash'EM - but there are now more molds that can spawn (including moldiers at deeper levels).\n* Moldy corpses can be used with different potions (see the [[#Malcolm Ryan's Brewing Patch|brewing patch details]])\n\n=== Conflict ===\n\nA significant change has been introduced in the way conflict is triggered in the game. Now, when inciting conflict, the player's charisma score plays a crucial role in the process.\n\nThe formula behind this calculation is: (CHA - monster level + player level).\n\nIf this result exceeds 19, it is capped at 19. Subsequently, there is a percentage-based chance, determined by a random roll of the dice (rnd(20)), to determine whether the conflict actually takes effect or not. Even with maximum charisma and experience level, there's still a 5% chance of conflict failing to activate. Another crucial aspect is that the monsters must have visual contact with the player for conflict to activate.\n\n=== Dexterity based AC ===\n\n* Dexterity can directly affect the player's AC, for better or worse. See the chart below for details.\n** '''Being encumbered negates AC bonuses from dexterity.'''\n** '''Wearing any kind of heavy metallic body armor (not mithril) or other rigid material (bone, stone, wood) also negates dexterity bonuses.'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Potions of amnesia always have the \"sparkling\" appearance. Keep in mind that monsters can throw these potions at you.\n\n=== Religion, prayer, altars ===\n\n* If an unaligned altar generates with a priest of Moloch, that priest will be hostile to all roles except infidels. \n* This means the VoTD priest is always hostile and unable to give donations (unless, of course, you are an infidel.)\n* Sacrifice offerings can sometimes bless random objects (From SLASH'EM)\n\n=== Minions ===\n\n* SLASH'EM had a mechanic for getting aligned minions as gifts from your god when you sacrifice or pray with low health. This has been ported over but with some restrictions.\n\n* Minions will not be granted when:\n** You are praying.\n** You have negative luck.\n** You have been crowned\n** You have completed the quest\n** You have been expelled from the quest\n** You have any pets on the current level (prevents overcrowding)\n\nAs the number of altar gifts increases, the odds of getting a minion decrease.\n\n* The minions granted are a little bit different from SLASH'EM but generally follow the same pattern.\n* Minion pets are not subject to the same tameness expiration as normal pets - they should remain tame forever unless abused or their tameness is reduced in some other fashion.\n\n=== Dungeon growth patch ===\n\nAnother feature ported over from Slash'EM. This enables trees to slowly branch out in the dungeon and occasionally drop ripe fruits/leaves, offering potential resources to the player.\n\nThis encourages the growth of various herbs that are left on the ground or placed in water. Herbs left unattended will periodically sprout more of the same type in the surrounding tiles. These herbs comprise [[garlic]], [[wolfsbane]], [[catnip]], [[carrot]]s, [[mushroom]]s, [[pineapple]]s, and [[kelp frond]]s. While some of these may not be technically herbs, they still exhibit prolific growth. \n\nOne intriguing strategy is to leave these items on the ground early in the game and return after a significant number of turns to see what has been \"farmed.\"\n\nLevels containing trees have a chance of yielding an extra axe, which can be helpful for managing potential overgrowth caused by the spreading trees.\n\n=== Oily Corpses patch ===\n\n* There is a 20% chance of making your fingers slippery upon starting to eat a corpse of certain slippery monsters (e.g. most slithy, non-snakelike monsters and most blobby monsters). Tins of those monsters are not slippery unless caused by the tin preparation.\n\n=== Slow Luck timeouts (modified) ===\n\nIn Hack'EM, Luck items greatly slow down Luck timeout rather than stopping it completely - this is similar to how it works in UnNetHack and EvilHack, however, the timeouts have been modified and extended to cover extremely negative base luck situations (this could occur from wishing and incurring many base luck penalties). The timeouts have also been reduced heavily from the UnNetHack calculations.\n\nThe modified Luck timeout depends on how far your Luck is from your base Luck: the higher or lower your Luck, the less the timeout is slowed. The timeout is calculated every turn, meaning gaining or losing a point of Luck could result in that point timing out immediately.\n\nThe modified Luck timeout is calculated by the following formula:\n\n    Timeout = 25 * (20 - base_distance) * (20 - base_distance)\n\nbase_distance is how far you are from your base luck. If your base luck is 0 and you have 3 Luck, the base_distance is 3. If you have -10 base luck and 10 Luck, the base_distance is 20.\n\nAdditionally, [[Archaeologist]]s gain a +1 bonus to base Luck from wearing a [[fedora]]. Putting on or taking off the fedora also changes your natural Luck accordingly.\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n!base<br/>distance !! Timeout !!

You do not lose the game in this situation, but your luck will be reduced by 5 and your god will be angry. You can still win by going to your normal altar, or by trying another helm of opposite alignment.\n\n===Bribing devil princes ===\nBribing a lawful [[demon prince]] can only be done if you meet them while they are still meditating, and typically costs 200 gold times the hero's level.\n\n===Attack specialization===\nHack'EM allows you to use the #tech menu to specialize in any of the combat-oriented skills, including [[twoweapon]]ing or [[attack spells]].\n\nEntering the name of the skill will provide a +1 damage bonus when using that skill for each of the following milestones:\n\n* Obtain the Sokoban prize\n* Kill [[Medusa]]\n* Kill [[Cerberus (EvilHack)|Cerberus]]\n* Defeat any of the [[alignment key]] bosses\n* Pick up the the [[Bell of Opening]]\n* Be [[crowned]] by your [[god]]\n\nThe skill chosen can be changed with a cooldown of 1,000 to 1,500 turns if desired.\n\n== Intrinsics and resistances ==\n\n=== Partial resistances ===\n\n* Intrinsic resistances are no longer binary, but are percentages instead. The spread is 5% to 50% resistance gained from eating per corpse. Damage reduction from various attacks is determined by how much partial resistance the player has to it.\n\n=== Partial reflection ===\n\n* Reflection is not 100%; it can lessen the effects of an attack it reflects, but will never negate it.\n\n=== Partial magic resistance ===\n\n* The \"shower of missiles\" monster attack is not completely negated by [[magic resistance]].\n\n=== The afraid and fearless conditions ===\n\n* The player can sometimes become too afraid to control their actions and will run away in fear.\n* This is similar to the effects of being stunned or confused. You won't be able to control your movement or attacks, but you can still use items as normal.\n\n'''Causes of fear:'''\n* Hearing or seeing a [[dragon]] roar\n* Being caught in the blast of an [[ethereal light]]\n* Hearing the scream of a [[monstrous spider]] or [[banshee]]\n* Seeing the gaze of a [[bodak]] or an [[eye of fear and flame]]\n* Breaking a [[wand of fear]] or being zapped by a wand of fear\n* Applying a cursed [[Nighthorn]] or carrying a cursed Nighthorn\n* Magic trap effect (1 in 21 chance)\n-* If you get caught in an explosion type that you are vulnerable to, it can cause a brief panic attack. This only occurs 1 in 3 times and if the damage exceeds a 3d6 roll.\n\n'''Curing fear:'''\n* If the monster you are afraid of dies, your fear will subside as well.\n* Quaff a [[potion of booze]]. Quaffing booze actually gives you intrinsic fearlessness. If blessed it grants for 8d6 (more) turns, otherwise 8d3 turns - even after the confusion wears off.\n* Quaff a [[potion of amnesia]] (Note: this will make you forget many valuable things, so use extreme caution when considering this strategy)\n* Let it time out\n* Applying a non-cursed Nighthorn\n* Invoking the [[Staff of Aesculapius]]\n* Using the calm steed technique as a centaur\n\n'''Preventing fear:'''\n* Wear a [[tinfoil hat]]\n* Wield a weapon with the \"rage\" property\n* Wear the large shield [[Pridwen]]\n* Wield [[Dragonbane]] to protect from dragon roars\n* Knights are also specifically immune to dragon roars\n* Play as a Necromancer, they start with intrinsic fearlessness\n\nNote: Wearing or wielding extrinsic sources of fearlessness that prevent fear don't actually cure fear, but wearing them does nullify the effects. If you remove the item, the fear will still be active until it times out or is actually cured.\n\n=== Extreme stability ===\n\n* Some monsters have a new clobber attack which can knock you senseless.\n* You are vulnerable to this attack if you are smaller than a huge monster and are solid.\n* A successful clobber attack occurs 1 in 6 times and will send you flying back 1 to 2 squares.\n* Furthermore, after being hurtled back, there is a 1 in 4 chance of being stunned for 2-3 turns.\n* The stability property protects you(or monsters) from clobber attacks, it won't reduce the damage, but it will keep you from moving and being stunned.\n\nBe very wary of your surroundings in encounters with monsters that clobber. You don't want to be next to lava or water tiles because you could easily be hurtled back to your death.\n\n=== Sonic damage and resistance ===\n\n* Ported from SpliceHack\n\nSonic damage comes in two main forms: rays and monster attacks. The sources of sonic rays are primarily [[wand of noise|wands of noise]], [[violet dragon]]s, and the [[spellbook of sonic boom|sonic boom spell]]. These rays can be reflected (with a source of reflection) or resisted with sonic resistance. Sonic rays are quite destructive and will easily shatter anything made of glass in a monsters inventory, your inventory, or even on the floor. Glass objects include potions, rings, wands, tools, armor, or weapons. It is possible to shatterproof your items by wielding one and reading a [[scroll of enchant weapon]] while confused. Sonic rays can also destroy iron bars, toilets, sinks, boulders, and statues.\n\nThere are a handful of monsters which possess potent sonic or \"scream\" attacks. The common theme is that they are all ranged and can be launched from about 12 squares from the hero. They can also be used in melee range.\n\n* [[concussive sphere]]s: A one-time explosive sonic blast (similar to flaming spheres)\n* [[violet dragon]]s: Sonic breath attack, and passive sonic damage.\n* [[screamer]]: Similar to a shrieker, but deals a sonic scream\n* [[nazgul]]: Scream which stuns\n* [[monstrous spider]]: Scream which inflicts fear\n* [[mobat]]: Piercing scream\n* [[banshee]]: Scream which inflicts fear\n* [[harpy]]: Song which paralyzes.\n* [[gibberling]]: Possesses a plethora of attacks, each inflicting a unique but twisted effect (similar to a cursed unicorn horn)\n\nAll of the scream attacks can also shatter glass objects. The gibberlings and harpies don't scream, but are quite dangerous anyway.\n\nAlso - there are [[sonic bomb]]s, and spellcasting monsters can make you vulnerable to sonic damage.\n\nAs you can see, in Hack'EM the player must have a game-plan for dealing with sonic damage going into the late game.  How can you protect against it or at least mitigate the damage? There is no source of intrinsic sonic resistance, unless you polymorph into a monster that innately has it. All sources are extrinsic but once obtained will also protect your items from shattering.\n\n'''Sources of sonic resistance:'''\n* violet dragon scales\n* violet dragon scaled armor\n* [[resonant shield]]\n* [[ring of sonic resistance]]\n* Wielding or wearing an item with the sonic resistance property.\n* Wielding [[Thunderstruck]]\n\nThe [[tortle]] race also starts with a [[toque]], which doesn't grant explicit sonic resistance - but it will protect the player from sonic damage and nullify the effects of sonic attacks. Unfortunately, it will not protect your glass items from destruction. Becoming deaf also accomplishes the same thing.\n\nOne other obscure source of sonic resistance is simply being underwater. This automatically dispels any sonic damage and grants you (and monsters) sonic resistance while submerged.\n\n'''Using sonic damage for offense:'''\n* It may look daunting seeing all the sonic threats facing the player - but keep in mind that if you are able to obtain Thunderstruck, or a decent weapon that has the scream property (which does sonic damage), you now wield a weapon that the majority of monsters in Hack'EM do not resist. Only about 5% of monsters are sonic resistant. There are almost double the amount of acid resistant monsters at ~10%, which shows how niche this attack vector is.\n\n=== Psychic damage and resistance ===\n\n* (from Splice and EvilHack)\n\nLike sonic damage, psychic damage also comes in a few forms. The form most players will be familiar with is the mind flayers psychic blast, which can target you from a wide range. A few new monster now also have a melee based psychic attack: the gnomish psyker and the dream thief. Ethereal lights also are fast and will explode on contact, inflicting psychic damage as well as fear on the player. \n\n'''Psychic resistance:'''\n* The only source of extrinsic psychic resistance is the [[tinfoil hat]].\n* Protects you from forgetting skills, spells, and other things from potions and scrolls of amnesia, as well as mind flayer and zombie brain eating attack.\n* Illithids start with psychic resistance.\n* Illithid player characters are immune to the mind flayer brain eating attack but are not immune to zombie brain eating.\n* Protects you from an illithids psionic wave and tentacle attacks.\n\n=== Larva carrier property ===\n\n* Some monsters can infect you with dangerous eggs! If their larva are allowed to hatch, they emerge from your body dealing a significant amount of damage in the process. Plus, you have to deal with a new set of monsters in front of you. The only way to defend against this attack, other than canceling the injector, is to be polymorphed into a monster with thick skin.\n\nLuckily, you can cure this condition using a few different methods:\n* quaffing [[potion of sickness|potions of sickness]] (this kills the larva from inside)\n* drink from a [[toilet]] (poisonous water)\n* receiving a disease attack from a monster\n* eating a [[pill]]\n* invoking the [[Staff of Aesculapius]]\n* invoking the Healing Hands technique\n* being zapped by a cure sickness spell\n\nThere are only three monsters that can infect you with larva, remember them well: [[giant ichneumon]], [[gibberling]]s, and [[spibrawulf]]s.\n\n=== Regeneration ===\n\n* The player is unable to regenerate hit points while in the Valley of the Dead – healing via other methods (potions, healing spells) is still possible.\n* Regeneration only causes additional hunger when injured.\n* Restful sleep regenerates HP (we can get restful sleep property from the [[amulet of restful sleep]] or a [[ring of sleeping]])\n\n== Item manipulation == \n\n=== Item generation ===\n\n* 1/80 of random non-artifact weapons will be generated erodeproof (xnh)\n* 1/80 of random non-artifact items will be generated as pre-eroded (xnh)\n* Grease will generate on an erodible object every once in a great while - 1 in 1000 chance (xnh/3.7)\n\nThe following effects of items with certain [[randomized appearance]]s are adapted from [[dNetHack]]:\n\n* Combat boots grant +1 AC and +1 to-hit when attacking.\n* Mud boots make you more resistant to wrap attacks.\n* Hiking boots grant +100 to carrying capacity while you are grounded (e.g., not [[levitating]] or [[riding]] a steed).\n* Jungle boots prevent many types of leg injury.\n* Padded gloves grant +1 AC.\n* Old gloves can't be eroded.\n* Fencing gloves grant +2 to-hit with a one-handed weapon and no shield\n\n=== Object materials ===\n\n* Object materials were inherited from EvilHack. For details see [[EvilHack#Object materials|EvilHack § Object materials]]\n* Many objects and items can spawn made from something other than its base material.\n* In Hack'EM - you will also notice rings and unicorn horns appearing in new strange materials. Ring appearances were completely overhauled to enable more diverse materials appear.\n* Any item or object that is susceptible to being rusted, corroded, rotted, burned, or fractured can be completely destroyed via those methods unless fixed.\n* Any item or object can be fixed (wielding the object and reading a scroll of enchant weapon while confused) if its material allows for it.\n\n* The dragonhide AC bonus has been reduced from 8AC to 5AC.\n* Shirts can only be cloth.\n* Mummy wrappings can be leather or dragonhide.\n\n* Gold objects are notable because they are the frequent targets of leprechaun theft.\n* Glass objects should be handled with care because they are vulnerable to shattering from sonic attacks.\n\nKeep in mind that if the material of an object is not working for you, it may be possible to alter with a [[scroll of transmogrify]].\n\n=== Object properties ===\n\nThe [[object properties]] patch exists in a handful variants &ndash; the code used for Hack'EM was taken from [[EvilHack]], which in turn was taken from [[GruntHack]] and then modified significantly.\n\nAn object property is a magical attribute associated with an item &ndash; in other variants that have object properties, the number of magical properties and the number and types of items they can be applied to is rather broad, and finding such properties on these items is not uncommon. In Hack'EM, there are many object properties, they can be applied to weapons, armor, and rings, but the chances of finding such items at random is quite rare. There are new alternate methods to both discover and manipulate object properties since they will be a powerful resource to the player.\n\nIn version 1.3.0 and beyond it is once again possible to wish for object properties when wishing for an item.\n\n'''Eligible items''' for object properties are: weapons, armor, and rings (with some restrictions).\n\n'''Restricted items:''' non-weapons (ie: cockatrice corpses), artifacts, dragon scales, and unique items.\n\n* A players' starting inventory will never spawn with an object property (with the exception of the Undead Slayer-Vampire who starts with a jacket of fire resistance)\n* Changing a regular item with object properties into an artifact (e.g., dipping for [[Excalibur]]) will strip that item of its object properties.\n* Extrinsic properties that are applied to weapons or armor are active only when those objects are wielded/worn. With weapons, extrinsic properties also work in the offhand whilst [[twoweaponing]].\n\n==== Generation odds ====\n\n'''Random item generation:'''\n* Odds of an eligible item having a magical property: 1 in 150\n* Odds improve deeper into the dungeon\n* The chances of an item having 2 properties on creation is 1 in 100000.\n\n'''Player monsters:'''\n* Odds of their weapon having a magical property: 1 in 20 if high level or encountered on the Astral Plane\n'''Angel-class monsters:'''\n* 1 in 10 chance of their long sword having a magical property\n'''Two properties:''' 1 in 100,000 chance of an eligible item randomly spawning with two properties.\n\n==== Identifying object properties ====\n\n* Observing the effects of most properties in action should auto-identify the property.\n* The shopkeeper identify service will reveal properties on weapons, armor, and rings.\n* Adding a property via confused scroll of transmogrification or shopkeeper service will auto-identify the property on successful grafting.\n* Some properties will auto-id upon wielding or wearing, like the stealth, slow, oilskin, and rage properties. \n** Trying to sell ''stench items'', the shopkeepers will refuse - identifying them.\n** Items with the excellence, vigilance, or prowess properties usually auto-identify because they modify stats like charisma or wisdom.\n** If an item of sustainability or toughness resists draining or destruction, the property is revealed.\n** Using items with the swimming or surfing property on water auto-identifies them.\n** The pirate's first gift, The Marauder's Map, has a useful #invoke ability that reveals artifacts and items with properties.\n* Wizards have an innate ability to 'sense' if an item is magical (much like a Priest being able to know the beatitude of all items).\n* '''Dipping weapons with offensive properties''' into fountains or toilets can reveal what property it has. The weapon properties that interact with water are: fire, frost, shock, decay, scream, sizzle, rage, venom, filth, and sleep.\n* Wielding or wearing an item with the ''insight property'' will grant you the ability to sense magical properties.\n* Reading scrolls of magic detection reveals properties.\n* Zapping wands of probing at items reveals their properties.\n* If playing as a Jedi, you start with a droid pet. This pet is capable of walking over items and revealing their properties.\n* Archaeologists can use their appraisal technique to reveal properties on items.\n* In other cases, use your own judgment and logic to narrow down the property. \n\n==== Manipulating object properties ====\n\n'''Shopkeeper's Add Property service:'''\n* Non-magical items have a base charge of 750.\n* Magical items have a base charge of 2250.\n* The shopkeeper can add a random property to an item of your choosing. The item type depends on the shop type, so a ring shop can add properties to rings, and so on.\n* After adding a property, the weapon is also fully identified. \n* If a weapon already has a property, the shopkeeper will offer to remove it for a base price of 200. There is a 1 in 4 chance of successful removal. \n\n'''Upgrade/tinker and property transfers:'''\n* Upgrading/tinkering objects will not remove or change any properties on the item.\n\n'''Forging and property transfers:'''\n* Properties will never spontaneously appear from forging results, the property has to come from the first or second ingredient.\n* Forging will take the secondary object property over the primary. If you have formally identified the object property of one of the recipe objects, you'll know the object property of the newly forged object.\n\n'''Dipping into a potion of invulnerability:'''\n* Items can be dipped into potions of invulnerability to gain the toughness property. \n\n'''Polypiling and Property transfers:'''\n* Polymorphing items that are cursed always wipes the properties from an obj.\n* An uncursed object has a luck dependent chance of ''retaining'' its properties.\n\n    LUCK:     <0      0     +2     +5     +8    +11\n    SUCCESS: 0.5%  20.0%  39.5%  59.0%  78.5%  98.0%\n\n'''The Scroll of Transmogrify:'''\n* Confused readings can be used to altar the properties of objects. \n* A confused cursed scroll will remove any properties on an item.\n* An confused uncursed scroll will change an existing property on an item (depending on luck)\n* Reading a confused blessed scroll will add a random property to the item. If it's a magical item (ie: speet boots or cloak of magic resistance), a successful property addition also depends on luck, similar to the above odds.\n\n    LUCK:     <0      0     +2     +5     +8    +11\n    SUCCESS: 0.5%  20.0%  39.5%  59.0%  78.5%  98.0%\n\n* When changing or adding properties, any property is valid - even those with negative effects.\n\n\n==== Table of object properties ====\nThe table below lists all available magical properties, what items they can be applied to, and what their function is.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\n!Object property !!

This allows you to buy the new, possibly more expensive potion at the cost of the fruit juice.\n\n=== Pouring potions into sinks ===\n\n* (from xnh)\n* Allows for safer identification of potions by dumping them down the drain, leaving the hero to suffer only vapor effects.\n* This is done by selecting a potion to #dip while standing on top of a sink. If a potion of polymorph is poured down a sink, it polymorphs it.\n\n=== Gem alchemy ===\n\n* Acid is no longer a useless endgame potion!\n* Gems dissolve in acid to produce new potions, based on the gem's and potion's color (meaning the same gem will produce different potions from game to game).\n** Diamonds do not dissolve in acid at all.\n* If the acid is cursed or the gem is a [[dilithium crystal]], there is a guaranteed alchemical explosion, otherwise there is always a 1 in 30 chance of an explosion.\n* Use the object lookup (on a gem) to see what potion is created from a particular gem.\n* Note: Smoky, milky, and clear potions cannot be produced with this method.\n\n=== Upgrading and tinkering ===\n\nHack'EM features an upgrading mechanic facilitated by potions of gain level or the tinkering technique or the tinkering service sometimes offered by gnomish shopkeepers, a feature adapted from SLASH'EM. \n\nThe upgrade process has seen some improvements, offering an accessible object lookup system to display upgrade information for each item. Each item now maintains a one-to-one relationship, directly mapping to the specific item it upgrades into. This transition also brings about changes in the power of magical item upgrades, as their properties are retained in their new forms, resulting in a reduction in the potency of many magical item upgrades to maintain game equilibrium.\n\n'''New Upgrade Table:'''\n* \"->\" Indicates a one-way transformation path\n* \"<->\" indicates the two items upgrade back-and-forth.\n\n{|class=\"prettytable sortable\"\n!item 1 !! to !! item 2\n|-\n| [[orcish arrow]] || -> || [[arrow]]\n|-\n|[[arrow]] || -> || [[elven arrow]]\n|-\n|[[elven arrow]] || -> || [[orcish arrow]]\n|-\n|[[ya]] || <-> || [[light arrow]]\n|-\n|[[boomerang]] || <-> || [[chakram]]\n|-\n|[[orcish spear]] || -> || [[spear]]\n|-\n|[[spear]] || -> || [[elven spear]]\n|-\n|[[elven spear]] || -> || [[dwarvish spear]]\n|-\n|[[dwarvish spear]] || -> || [[orcish spear]]\n|-\n|[[orcish dagger]] || -> || [[dagger]]\n|-\n|[[dagger]] || -> || [[elven dagger]]\n|-\n|[[elven dagger]] || -> || [[stake]]\n|-\n|[[stake]] || -> || [[great dagger]]\n|-\n|[[great dagger]] || -> || [[orcish dagger]]\n|-\n|[[knife]] || <-> || [[stiletto]]\n|-\n|[[axe]] || <-> || [[throwing axe]]\n|-\n|[[dwarvish bearded axe]] || <-> || [[battle axe]]\n|-\n|[[pick-axe]] || <-> || [[dwarvish mattock]]\n|-\n|[[orcish short sword]] || -> || [[short sword]]\n|-\n|[[short sword]] || -> || [[elven short sword]]\n|-\n|[[elven short sword]] || -> || [[dwarvish short sword]]\n|-\n|[[dwarvish short sword]] || -> || [[orcish short sword]]\n|-\n|[[orcish scimitar]] || <-> || [[scimitar]]\n|-\n|[[saber]] || <-> || [[rapier]]\n|-\n|[[broadsword]] || <-> || [[elven broadsword]]\n|-\n|[[orcish long sword]] || -> || [[long sword]]\n|-\n|[[long sword]] || -> || [[elven long sword]]\n|-\n|[[elven long sword]] || -> || [[orcish long sword]]\n|-\n|[[mace]] || <-> || [[heavy mace]]\n|-\n|[[morning star]] || <-> || [[orcish morning star]]\n|-\n|[[war hammer]] || <-> || [[heavy war hammer]]\n|-\n|[[club]] || <-> || [[aklys]]\n|-\n|[[orcish bow]] || -> || [[bow]]\n|-\n|[[bow]] || -> || [[elven bow]]\n|-\n|[[elven bow]] || -> || [[orcish bow]]\n|-\n|[[quarterstaff]] || <-> || [[silver capped staff]]\n|-\n|[[staff of escape]] || <-> || [[staff of matter]]\n|-\n|[[staff of war]] || <-> || [[staff of divination]]\n|-\n|[[staff of necromancy]] || <-> || [[staff of healing]]\n|-\n|[[cornuthaum]] || <-> || [[dunce cap]]\n|-\n|[[fedora]] || <-> || [[elven helm]]\n|-\n|[[orcish helm]] || <-> || [[dwarvish helm]]\n|-\n|[[helm of madness]] || <-> || [[helm of brilliance]]\n|-\n|[[helm of telepathy]] || <-> || [[tinfoil hat]]\n|-\n|[[dwarvish chain mail]] || <-> || [[elven chain mail]]\n|-\n|[[chain mail]] || <-> || [[orcish chain mail]]\n|-\n|[[splint mail]] || <-> || [[large splint mail]]\n|-\n|[[ring mail]] || <-> || [[orcish ring mail]]\n|-\n|[[light armor]] || <-> || [[jacket]]\n|-\n|[[robe]] || <-> || [[large robe]]\n|-\n|[[robe of weakness]] || -> || [[robe of power]]\n|-\n|[[robe of power]] || -> || [[robe of protection]]\n|-\n|[[robe of protection]] || -> || [[robe of weakness]]\n|-\n|[[striped shirt]] || <-> || [[t-shirt]]\n|-\n|[[mummy wrapping]] || <-> || [[plain cloak]]\n|-\n|[[orcish cloak]] || -> || [[dwarvish cloak]]\n|-\n|[[dwarvish cloak]] || -> || [[elven cloak]]\n|-\n|[[elven cloak]] || -> || [[orcish cloak]]\n|-\n|[[poisonous cloak]] || <-> || [[alchemy smock]]\n|-\n|[[orcish shield]] || <-> || [[dwarvish roundshield]]\n|-\n|[[large shield]] || <-> || [[tower shield]]\n|-\n|[[small shield]] || <-> || [[elven shield]]\n|-\n|[[gauntlets of fumbling]] || <-> || [[gauntlets of dexterity]]\n|-\n|[[low boots]] || <-> || [[high boots]]\n|-\n|[[fumble boots]] || <-> || [[elven boots]]\n|-\n|[[levitation boots]] || <-> || [[water walking boots]]\n|-\n|[[sack]] || <-> || [[oilskin sack]]\n|-\n|[[oilskin sack]] || <-> || [[bag of holding]]\n|-\n|[[bag of rats]] || <-> || [[bag of holding]]\n|-\n|[[bag of tricks]] || <-> || [[bag of holding]]\n|-\n|[[bag of holding]] || <-> || [[sack]]\n|-\n|[[skeleton key]] || <-> || [[lock pick]]\n|-\n|[[mirror]] || <-> || [[expensive camera]]\n|-\n|[[eight ball]] || <-> || [[crystal ball]]\n|-\n|[[lenses]] || <-> || [[goggles]]\n|-\n|[[towel]] || <-> || [[blindfold]]\n|-\n|[[leash]] || <-> || [[saddle]]\n|-\n|[[tin opener]] || <-> || [[tinning kit]]\n|-\n|[[pea whistle]] || <-> || [[magic whistle]]\n|-\n|[[flute]] || <-> || [[magic flute]]\n|-\n|[[tooled horn]] || <-> || [[horn of plenty]]\n|-\n|[[fire horn]] || <-> || [[frost horn]]\n|-\n|[[harp]] || <-> || [[magic harp]]\n|-\n|[[leather drum]] || <-> || [[drum of earthquake]]\n|-\n|[[whetstone]] || <-> || [[luckstone]]\n|-\n|[[loadstone]] || <-> || [[healthstone]]\n|}\n\n== Techniques ==\n\n=== Changes to techniques ===\n\n* Removed limit breaking from techniques. This was the primary attribute of techniques that was broken in SLASH'EM. One could simply lower their HP and gain unlimited access to some of the techs for some fairly unbalanced advantages.\n\n* Maintaining your techniques requires eliminating harmful conditions from your play. While suffering from most harmful ailments, your tech cooldowns will expire much slower. This includes most major physical and mental ailments, as well as being too hungry or satiated. If you are wielding a weapon with the prowess property, the normal timeout will always apply.\n* Tech cooldowns will also not expire if the player is just waiting or searching on one square.\n\n* Revised tech cooldown times. There are four broad categories of techniques. Premium techs are really powerful, so they have a long cooldown of 1500-2500 turns. Strong techs are very useful and comprise most of the techs, so the standard cooldown is 1000-1500 turns. Mid-strong techs are not too abusable, but deserve some kind of timeout so they are 500-1000 turns. Utility techs are very useful techs and meant to be quite accessible, so they are only 100-200 turns. There are also some techs which don't have any timeout at all.\n\n* [[Revivification]] technique and the spirit bomb spell (which was the Monk's [[Spirit bomb]] technique).\n\n* Double damage (from DeathVision or Staff of Rot) is handled properly for techs.\n\n=== List of techniques === \n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n!Technique\n!Notes\n!Origin\n|-\n\n|[[air dash]]\n|\n* Monk blitz tech\n* Cannot air dash while trapped or underwater.\n* Using the air dash tech while confused, stunned, or fumbling goes in a random direction.\n|SLASH'EM\n|-\n|[[Berserk (technique)|Berserk]]\n|\n* +2 to hit and +4 damage for 2d8 + (TECHLEVEL/5) +2 turns\n* Barbarian\n|SLASH'EM\n|-\n|[[blessing]]\n|\n* Priest\n|SLASH'EM\n|-\n\n|[[blink]]\n|\n* Hobbits\n|SLASH'EM\n|-\n\n|[[blood magic]]\n|\n* Adapted the Blood Magic skill from SpliceHack into a technique for necromancers.\n|Hack'EM/Splice\n|-\n\n|[[booze]]\n|\n* For the deferred Drunk role from SlashTHEM.\n|SLEX\n|-\n\n|[[break rock]]\n|\n* Adapted the monk's boulder breaking ability from EvilHack into a technique.\n* It it still available by using force attack (F) on boulders or statues.\n|Hack'EM/Evil\n|-\n\n|[[calm steed]]\n|\n* Yeoman\n* Cures fear when used in centaur form/race.\n|SLASH'EM\n|-\n\n|[[chained blitz]]\n|\n* Monk blitz tech\n* Chain blitz tech now shows how many blitz moves you have available and input feedback as you type the blitz commands.\n* Chain blitz shows helpful feedback for incorrect inputs.\n* Chain blitz only costs energy if a successful command sequence is input; invalid commands also don't use up the tech.\n* Chain blitz commands can also be terminated with ; or :\n* Updated blitz commands to be shorter and more intuitive; \n* commands with 2 versions are always mirrored.\n* Instead of wasting a move when making a mistake in chain blitz, it just cancels the tech and let's the player try again.\n|SLASH'EM\n|-\n\n|[[charge saber]]\n|\n* Jedi\n|SlashTHEM\n|-\n\n|[[chi strike]]\n|\n* Monk blitz tech\n|SLASH'EM\n|-\n\n|[[chi healing]]\n|\n* Monk blitz tech\n|SLASH'EM\n|-\n\n|[[critical strike]]\n|\n* Rogue\n|SLASH'EM\n|-\n\n|[[cutthroat]]\n|\n* Rogue\n|SLASH'EM\n|-\n\n|[[dazzle]]\n|\n* Vampirics\n|SLASH'EM\n|-\n\n|[[disarm]]\n|\n* Any role can get this tech by advancing a non-ranged weapon skill to Skilled.\n* In SLASH'EM, you could get this tech by advancing any weapon skill except whips.\n* In Hack'EM, we have instead excluded ranged weapons, since it's awkward to explain how you would disarm somebody with a dart or arrow.

Displacing a monster into a trap always confuses them.\n|Hack'EM/Splice\n|-\n\n|[[turn undead]]\n|\n* As in SLASH'EM, #turn is now a technique.\n* Knights, priests, and undead slayers get this technique.\n|SLASH'EM\n|-\n\n|[[uppercut]]\n|\n* New blitz tech for monks.\n* It's a powerful alternate to ground slam which creates a pit.\n* Does double damage to targets with heads.\n* Influenced by stunning fist skill from Splice.\n|Hack'EM\n|-\n\n|[[vanish]]\n|\n* Gnomes\n|SLASH'EM\n|-\n\n|[[weapon practice]]\n|\n* General tech for some melee roles to let them train up skills without fighting.\n|SLASH'EM\n|-\n\n|[[whistle undead]]\n|\n* Necromancer\n* Acts as a magic whistle effect for undead.\n|Hack'EM\n|}\n\n===Techniques left out from SLASH'EM===\nThe Monk retains their standard resistances, rendering the following warding techs unnecessary: [[Ward against flame]], [[Ward against ice]], and  [[Ward against lightning]]\n\nAll the sigil techniques were removed, as some of these sigils have been rendered obsolete by skilled/expert spellcasting: [[Sigil of control]], [[Sigil of tempest]], and [[Sigil of discharge]].\n\n== The Quest ==\n\n'''Quest Variety:''' Various changes have been made to each role's Quest to make the experience more varied and interesting for the player.\n\n'''Lowered Level Requirement:''' The minimum experience level needed to be accepted for the quest has been lowered to 10 (from the default 14).\n\n'''Dealing with an Angry Quest Leader:''' If you've made your quest leader angry for whatever reason, this no longer makes the game unwinnable. You can engage them in battle, and if you kill your quest leader, this unlocks the quest. You can then complete your quest as you normally would. However, quest leaders are not weak, and your deity may not be pleased with you killing them.\n\n'''Alignment Impact:''' Your alignment record can still be positive, but abusing your alignment can have a direct effect on how your quest ends. Alignment abuse is tracked throughout the game. Any negative alignment adjustment counts as one abuse point, and this can be checked at any time via #conduct. Compared to the standard game, you'll receive more feedback when abusing alignment.\n\n'''Permanent Abuse Record:''' Unlike your alignment record, which can be adjusted back into positive standing, your alignment abuse record is permanent.\n\n'''Quest Artifact Forfeiture:''' Quest leaders might ask you to forfeit the quest artifact if you have abused your alignment.\n\n'''Options for Forfeiture:''' You have two options at this point – either hand over the quest artifact peacefully or decline. Declining will anger your quest leader, and they will attack. Handing over the quest artifact peacefully will flag the quest as complete.\n\n'''Incomplete Quest Consequences:''' Declining to turn over the quest artifact does not complete the quest. At some point, your quest leader will need to be defeated before the quest is flagged as complete. Attempting to evade your quest leader will not help in the long run, as the Bell of Opening has been 'cursed'. The only way to lift the curse is to complete the quest. The Bell will not function for the invocation until this is done.\n\n'''Luck boon:''' If you complete the quest with under 13 alignment abuse, you will receive a luck boon (+1 to permanent luck).\n\n'''Alternative Scenarios:''' The game considers alternative scenarios. For instance, if you angered your quest leader before starting the quest and you killed them, you simply need to defeat your quest nemesis to flag the quest as complete. Conversely, if you've killed the quest nemesis and return but somehow anger your quest leader before you speak to them, killing them also flags the quest as complete.\n\n== Dungeon features ==\n\n=== Trap mechanics ===\n\nSeveral new trap features have been added to the game:\n\n''Ice Traps:'' These traps are only generated after level 8. They shoot a freezing jet of icy air, which can freeze and slow down the player upon activation. This blast of icy mist is dangerous - it will do 4d8 cold damage and can remove your intrinsic cold resistance! (adapted from xnh)\n\n''Magic Beam Traps:'' Magic beam traps are now part of the game, but they cannot generate above level 16. Notably, these traps now produce a random type of magical beam upon activation, offering more variety compared to their previous static beam type.\n\n''Rust Trap Changes:'' Players now have the ability to untrap rust traps using the #untrap command, which transforms them into fountains. However, disarming rust traps from a distance, whether through telekinesis or zapping with acid, will not yield a fountain.\n\n''Fire Trap Untrapping:'' Fire traps can be deactivated using #untrap, but it requires water to do so.\n\n''Spear Trap Yield:'' When disarming a spear trap, there is a chance of obtaining a spear or stake. Flyers also still have a 50% chance of being poked by a spear trap. If you (or a monster) are levitating, you will be too high to reach.\n\n''Web Destruction:'' Players can now force-fight webs with a bladed weapon to destroy them.\n\n''Castle Drawbridge:'' It's worth noting that the Castle drawbridge doesn't always close with the passtune as it did before.\n\n''Temporary Invisibility:'' Invisibility gained from magic traps is temporary and not permanent.\n\n''Polymorph Traps:'' The mechanics of polytraps have been adjusted, with a 1/7 chance that the polymorph trap disappears after polymorphing a monster. This mechanic was adapted from SpliceHack.\n\n=== Breaking wands creates related traps ===\n\n'''Breaking wands will usually create related traps (Un)'''\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Wand !! Trap created\n|-\n|wand of cold || ice trap\n|-\n|wand of opening || trap door\n|-\n|wand of fire || fire trap\n|-\n|wand of magic missile || magic trap\n|-\n|wand of teleportation || teleport trap\n|-\n|wand of polymorph || poly trap\n|-\n|wand of sleep || sleeping gas trap\n|-\n|wand of cancellation || anti-magic trap\n|-\n|wand of deluge || rust trap\n|-\n|wand of shock || magic beam trap\n|-\n|wand of poison gas || magic beam trap\n|-\n|wand of corrosion || magic beam trap\n|-\n|wand of noise || magic beam trap\n|}\n\n'''wand of detection:''' When broken this does not create a trap, however it will now detect traps and portals.\n\n\n=== Breakable iron bars ===\n\n* Iron bars can be destroyed in a couple of different ways.\n* You can shatter them with wands of striking, wands of noise, spells of force bolt, or spells of sonic boom.\n* You can punch and shatter them when wearing [[gauntlets of force]].\n* You can zap them with an acid ray or breath to dissolve them\n\nIf you shatter them, some [[iron chain]]s may be randomly flung out as a result.\n\n=== Grass ===\n\n* Pulled from SpliceHack/xNetHack, we now have lush grass in the dungeon!\n* Grass appears sparsely in the early levels, peaks around level 15, and then tapers off after level 22.\n* Although grass is mostly ornamental, keep in mind that some monsters can use it as clever method of concealment. In deeper levels, it's possible a dangerous asphynx or even giant centipede could be hidden in the thickets...\n\nIf you want to clear out grass from levels, there are a couple methods. Rays of fire, acid, and death will quickly kill and remove the offending grass squares.\n\n=== Bloody tiles ===\n\n* Ported from SpliceHack\n* When monsters are killed, they have a chance of spraying blood in a random direction, coloring one or more tiles red. No real effect on gameplay, purely aesthetic.\n* The amount of blood depends on monster size.\n* Spraying bloody tiles with a ray of water (e.g. from a wand of deluge) will clear the tile of its blood.\n* When bloody tile is walked over, there is a 1 in 20 chance it will erode away.\n* Orc blood is black.\n* There is also a bloodless game option to play without the tile coloring.\n\n=== Vents ===\n\n* Ported from SpliceHack, vents appear as a bright cyan (#) tile.\n* Vents appear after level 3. They will never appear in rooms with stairs. After level 8, some vents will emit poison gas instead of harmless mist.\n* Vents have a 3/5 chance of being destroyed when [[bomb]]s are dropped or thrown into them, releasing a small earthquake in the process.\n\n* Polymorphed sinks can turn into vents\n\n'''Vents act as occasional monster generators:'''\n* Spiders, snakes, and rats can randomly pop out of vents.\n* Monsters can use vents to conceal themselves. Since they can also be covered by the vent fog or poison clouds, exercise a little more vigilance when by a vent.\n\n\n=== Toilets ===\n\nToilets may seem a bit whimsical, but in the game, they've received enhancements to make them more engaging and practical. These improvements were inspired by their inclusion in SLASH'EM. Notably, toilets can now appear on their own, separate from sinks, whereas in SLASH'EM, they only came in pairs with sinks. The addition of fishing in toilets introduces a quirky element to the game.\n\n* Enabled fishing in toilets\n* Dropping a ring of poly into a sink can poly into a toilet.\n* Toilet prayer can now stop the vomiting process\n* If giants sit on toilets, they break.\n\n'''Toilet kicking:'''\n* Like sinks, toilets now have a couple different effects from kicking them, including a few [[YAFM]].\n* Kicking now only breaks the toilet 1/7 chance (was 1/4 in SLASH'EM)\n* Kicking can generate [[giant cockroaches]] and [[sewage]] from kicking (1 in 17 chance)\n* Kicking can generate [[brown pudding]]s (only once per toilet)\n* Kicking can generate a random tool. Normally this tool will weigh under 15aum, but sometimes you'll get a large tool that bonks against the piping. If a large tool bonks 3x - you'll get that tool no matter now big it is and the toilet is destroyed in the process.\t\t\n\n'''Amulet identification in toilets (SLEX)'''\n* Amulets can be dropped down toilets and possibly identified.\n* Amulets of flying are always regurgitated from toilets.\n* Amulets of change will polymorph the toilet into a sink\n\n=== Sinks ===\n\n* Random sink effect: noxious gas cloud (from 3.7)\n\n=== Forges ===\n\n* Inherited from EvilHack\n* Forges have the same appearance as fountains but are orange in color. \n* Just like fountains, dipping things into them can have desirable or adverse affects.\n* They can be used to dispose of anything that is flammable\n* They can also be used to repair corrosion/rust damage to any metallic object (if your luck is greater than 0). \n* There is a rare chance that a lava demon can be summoned via dipping, which will be hostile most times, but can sometimes spawn tame (same odds as getting a wish from a water demon/fountain). \n* Having negative luck can cause a forge to explode when used, which can cause considerable fire damage.\n* Players can also use a forge to remove an attached ball & chain.\n* Forges can be blown up by rays of water.\n\n==== Forging and #craft ====\n* Using the #craft command, you can also combine two objects to forge something new.\n* When forging, if either item has erodeproofing, the resulting item will be erodeproof.\n\n== Dungeon changes ==\n\n* Adjust secret passage frequency and exclude them from DL 1-4 (xnh)\n* Random doors are secret less of the time (xnh)\n* Kicking a \"wall\" that is actually a secret of some sort will never injure the player and will always produce an unambiguous message that there's something there. This makes it a valid strategy to kick every wall suspected of hiding something, because a single kick will give a yes/no on whether it's a regular wall or not. It's still not a ''great'' strategy, because the real walls will still hurt and wound legs like normal (xnh)\n\n* Main dungeon length is capped at 35-40 levels.\n* The fountains in Delphi can sometimes cause hallucination (Splice)\n* The Rogue level has been removed\n* Additional variants of the Castle, Fort Ludios, Sokoban, Mine Town and Mines End have been added.\n\n=== The SLASH'EM levels ===\n\n* The main dungeon layout has been adjusted to more closely follow SLASH'EM.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Appears !!

Dwarf and gnome thieves are now found in most town and Minetown variants. The presence of undead in the mines is no longer tied to alignment (as in SLASH'EM) but depends on the dungeon depth. The deeper you go, the higher the chance of encountering undead versions of the regular denizens, making the later stages more challenging.\n\nHack'EM has integrated Minetown variants from SlashTHEM and SpliceHack, along with Mine's End levels from SlashTHEM. Additionally, the Gnome King's ending from SLASH'EM and SlashTHEM is available. One Minetown variant features a drawbridge. However, players should be cautious, as destroying the drawbridge in the presence of guards will anger them. The mine rivers that are present in GruntHack and EvilHack are still in the mines - but they will be found only deeper than Minetown and not before.\n\n=== Sokoban ===\n\n* The last room of Sokoban has more prize variety, with a catch.\n* Imported levels from SLASH'EM, SlashTHEM, and NetHack Fourk.\n* Following in the footsteps of NetHack Fourk, all levels have been given names to make them easier to reference.\n* The map numbers in the listing below follow the format in the sokoban.des file (1-* is the top level and 4-* is the bottom level).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Map # !!

is been ransacked by bandits and thieves.\n* You can always find the Master Sword guarded by a gang of bandits in the village.\n\n=== Rat level ===\n\nA single randomized level picked from:\n* The Rat Level (Slash'EM)\n* The Rat Level (SlashTHEM)\n\n=== Alignment quests ===\n\n* Appears on DL 15-19, from SLASH'EM\n* As in SLASH'EM, two of the three alignment keys are needed for Vlad's Tower\n* Some elements of the quests have been changed:\n\n* Instead of the randomized Chaotic quest that SLASH'EM had, we have replaced it with Vecna's Manse from SlashTHEM.\n* The difficulty of Vecna has been reduced to be closer to the SLASH'EM version, but he still gets the extra clerical spell attack from Evil.\n\n=== Big Room ===\n\n* Imported a bunch of new big room variations from UnNethack, SpliceHack, and SLASHTHEM.\n\n=== [[Grund's Stronghold]] ===\n\n* Added more traps and the moat is double wide now, the stronghold wall is also phaseproof.\n* Grund's Stronghold now has a large cache of ammunition in one of the storage rooms.\n* If one of the iron safes doesn't have a magic marker, it will have a scroll of acquirement in its place.\n\n=== Fort Ludios ===\n\n* Ludios appears on the first eligible level with a vault.\n* Fort Ludios can also appear below Medusa's.\n* An extra dungeon prison has been added below Fort Ludios. This is a leftover from the Lethe branch and it seemed to fit here!\n\n=== Wyrm Caves ===\n\n* Created an entrance level (from dNetHack's Erebor quest)\n* At the bottom is a dangerous dragon nest which guards a massive treasure horde (from UnNetHack)\n    \n=== Black Market ===\n\n* The Black Market prices have been reduced a bit from SLASH'EM.\n* The layout of the level has been cut down in size to reduce the tedium involved in combing through all the items.\n* A small area has been dedicated to the player as a \"break room\", complete with furniture and even a magic chest for convenience.\n* To prevent theft, the level has been made undiggable and phase-proof. When attempting to tame monsters in the Black Market, you won't anger everybody, but the taming will simply have no effect. Scrolls of earth can be also be used without consequence, but beware, One-Eyed Sam can break through boulders like butter.\n\n=== The Storage Room ===\n\n* Added 4 variations from dnh\n\n=== Gehennom ===\n\n* No longer a series of mazes, but are mines-style levels with lava. \n* Areas such as the Sanctum and the entrance to the Wizard's Tower have also been adjusted.\n* Cerberus now guards the entrance to Gehennom.\n* Vlad the Impaler's tower is the SLASH'EM version\n* Vibrating square: messages when player is near\n\n=== Elemental planes ===\n\n* The first four Planes levels are randomized and appear in a different order every game.\n* Updated monsters on the plane of water with deepest ones, things from below, and mermaids.\n\n== New special rooms ==\n\n* Fungus Farm (SLASH'EM)\n* Migo Hive (SLASH'EM)\n* Dragon Lair (SLASH'EM)\n* Real Zoo (SLASH'EM)\n* Bad Food Shop (SLASH'EM)\n* Giant Court (SLASH'EM)\n* Lemure Pit\n* Mini Guild (Hack'EM)\n** These replace the Guild of Disgruntled Adventurers in SLASH'EM. \n* Clinic room (SlashTHEM)\n* Terror hall (SlashTHEM)\n* Zouthern room (Hack'EM)\n\n=== Themed rooms ===\n\n* EvilHack already had most of the themed rooms but more have been added.\n* Added any missing flipped versions of rooms (from UnNetHack) for completeness\n* Added minimum levels to all themed Rooms\n** The dungeon is pretty clean of themed rooms until level 8. \n** At levels 8, 11, and 17 we introduce more variety.\n\n== Shops ==\n\n* Shopkeepers can be a variety of different races.\n* Removed the racial shopkeeper price adjustments.\n* Imported shopkeeper hollering (from SlashTHEM)\n* Shopkeepers start with more than double their usual gold.\n\n=== Shopkeeper services ===\n\n* Instead of every store offering a general Identify service - every shop offers premier identify services based on their shop type or the race of the shopkeeper.\n* Streamlined the service menu interface. Previously navigating the services was tedious. Now when you press 'p', you are immediately presented with a full menu of all the available services - no submenus within menus.\n* Removed shopkeepers stealing all your money when you charge a wand of wishing. \n* Only Black Market can have the \"identify any\" service\n* The service charge \"smoothing\" rewards higher charisma.\n* All shop identify services are basic (and half price).\n\n    - Shopkeeper services can be accessed by #chatting with the shopkeeper \n    - The black market has a chance of offering any service.\n    - Adjust odds for general store services.\n    - Shopkeeper tinkering costs a lot more.\n\n==== Firearms training service ====\n\n* In addition to the weapon practice technique, this is a shopkeeper service for making firearms more accessible.\n* Gun shops always offer this up to Expert skill.\n* Weapon shops, armor shops offer 20% of the time, up to max Skilled.\n* General stores offer it 10% of the time, up to max Basic.\n** $500 for Basic skill\n** $1000 for Skilled\n** $2000 for expert\n\n==== Tinker service ====\n\n* Only gnomes offer this service\n* Allows you to upgrade an object to a similar or related form, works the same as dipping an item into a potion of gain level or using the tinker technique.\n* Here the service only takes 1 turn (shopkeepers are either very good at tinkering or just cheating with a hidden potion of gain level behind the counter)\n* Base charge is $500\n* Low intelligence (under 18 INT) players are subject to $500 price gouge\n* Lower intelligence (under 13 INT) players are subject to $1000 price gouge\n* Non-gnomes are charged double\n\n==== Add property ====\n\n* Weapon, armor, and ring shops can offer this service.\n* Base charge is $2000 for adding properties\n# To remove properties, it costs $250 - but there is only a 1 in 4 chance of success.\n* Only one property can be added to an item at a time, if you attempt to add to an item with an existing property, the shopkeeper will prompt you to remove it.\n\n==== Charging service ====\n\n* Some shops offer a charging service where you can buy a 'basic' recharge that usually does 1 point of charging (like an uncursed scroll of charging, or even a 'premier' charge that acts as a blessed charging.\n\n* Any shop that offers charging will always offer both the basic and premier service with the exception of general stores. Because they are so common, general stores only offer basic charging.\n* Premier charging is restricted to only specialty items that the shop offers (ie: In a ring shop you can only buy premier charging for rings)\n* Basic charging is unrestricted and can be performed on any item in any shop.\n\n==== Service details ====\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n!Shop/Race\n!Services\n|-\n|All shops:\n|\n* 1 in 3 offer uncursing services.\n* 1 in 20 offer rumors\n|-\n\n|General stores:\n|\n* Capable of offering any type of identify service\n* 20% offer firearms training\n* 25% offer basic charging\n|-\n\n|Weapon shops:\n|\n* 75% offer weapon ID\n* 20% offer armor ID\n* 25% offer weapon fixing\n* 25% offer weapon enchanting\n* 25% offer weapon poisoning\n* 20% offer firearms training\n* 20% offer property grafting (for weapons)\n|-\n\n|Armor shops:\n|\n* 75% offer armor ID\n* 20% offer weapon ID\n* 25% offer armor fixing\n* 25% offer armor enchanting (Note: Armor shops will refuse to work with dragon scales)\n* 20% offer firearms training\n* 20% offer property grafting (for armor)\n|-\n\n|Scroll stores:\n|\n* 75% offer scroll ID\n* 20% offer book ID\n|-\n\n|Spellbook stores:\n|\n* 75% offer book ID\n* 20% offer scroll ID\n|-\n\n|Potion stores:\n|\n* 50% offer potion ID\n|-\n\n|Ring stores:\n|\n* 33% offer ring ID\n* 20% offer amulet ID\n* 20% offer gem ID\n* 25% offer basic charging\n* 20% offer property grafting (for rings)\n|-\n\n|Wand shops:\n|\n* 50% offer wand ID\n* 20% offer armor ID\n* 25% offer basic charging\n* 25% offer premium charging\n|-\n\n|Tool shops:\n|\n* 50% offer tool ID\n* 25% offer basic charging\n|-\n\n|Deli/food shops:\n|\n* 100% offer food ID\n* 10% offer potion ID\n|-\n\n|Pet shops:\n|\n* 50% offer food ID\n* 25% offer tool ID\n|-\n\n|Lighting shops:\n|\n* 10% offer potion ID\n|-\n\n|Dwarves:\n|\n* 20% offer weapon ID\n* 20% offer armor ID\n* 20% offer gem ID\n|-\n\n|Orcs:\n|\n* 25% offer weapon poisoning\n|-\n\n|Gnomes:\n|\n* 25% offer tool ID\n* 25% offer tinker\n|-\n\n|Giants: \n|\n* 20% offer gem ID\n|-\n\n|Nymphs: \n|\n* 10% offer ring ID\n* 20% offer potion ID\n|-\n\n|Hobbit:\n|\n* 50% offer food ID\n* 10% offer ring ID\n|-\n\n|Illithid:\n|\n* 25% offer scroll ID\n* 25% offer spellbook ID\n|}\n\n=== New shop types ===\n\n* Pet Shops (From UnNetHack)\n* Instrument Shop (From UnNetHack)\n* Tin Shop (From UnNetHack)\n* Junk shop (from SpliceHack): Features all your favorite items in one convenient place!\n* Mask shop (from SpliceHack)\n* Archery shop (from SpliceHack)\n* Gun shops (from SlashTHEM)\n\n=== Misc shop changes ===\n\n* Lighting shops can now carry wands/scrolls/spellbooks of light, as well as the rare wand of lightning.\n* Delis can carry meat sticks, royal jelly, and huge chunks of meat.\n* Hardware stores stock potions of oil and occasionally touchstones.\n* Archery shops will not appear if your character cannot attain proficiency in BOW.\n* Gun shops will not appear if your character cannot attain proficiency in FIREARM.\n* Gun shops can also carry assault rifles, flintlocks, grease, and towels.\n* Pet shops can carry bardings of all types.\n* Armor shops can enchant dragon scales via the enchant armor service.\n\n== Dragons and dragon scales == \nHack'EM inherited the dtsund patch from EvilHack for dragon scales, which means that dragon scale mail no longer exists. In its place we can apply dragon scales to any armor. Since robes are now body armor - we can even create dragon scaled robes! Evil introduced some passive effects, these have been expanded so that every dragon scale provides a form of passive attack. The scales' abilities have also been slightly modified. Dragon scales worn on their own only exhibit their primary effect.\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n\n!Dragon\n!Primary\n!Secondary\n!Passive\n|-\n\n|Black\n|Disintegration res\n|\n|Disintegration (!!)\n|-\n|Blue\n|Shock res\n|Speed\n|Shock (!!)\n|-\n|Deep\n|Drain res\n|Slow digestion\n|Drain life\n|-\n|Gold\n|Light\n|Infravision<br/>Clairvoyant\n|Blinding\n|-\n|Gray\n|Magic res\n|Cancel protection\n|Cancellation (!!)\n|-\n|Green\n|Poison res\n|Sickness res\n|Poison\n|-\n|Orange\n|Sleep res\n|Free action\n|Slow\n|-\n|Red\n|Fire res\n| +1d6 melee damage\n|Fire (!!)\n|-\n|Shimmering\n|Displacement\n|Stun Resistance\n|Confuse/Stun/Slow\n|-\n|Silver\n|Reflection\n|Cold resistance<br/>Blinding res\n|Scaring\n|-\n|Sea\n|Magical breathing\n|Swimming\n|Water/rust (!!)\n|-\n|White\n|Cold res\n|Freeze water/Lava walk\n|Cold (!!)\n|-\n|Yellow\n|Acid res\n|Stoning res\n|Acid (!!)\n|-\n|Violet\n|Sonic res\n|Flying\n|Sonic (!!)\n|}\n\n!! - Risks item destruction from the type of attack\n- Most of the passive attacks only trigger 33% of the time.\n\n== Spellcasting ==\n\n=== Spellcasting changes ===\n* Like in SLASH'EM, the standard retention for spellbooks is 10000 turns. The reinforce memory technique can be used to extend your spell memory when a spell gets low. You can even use it when the spell has less than half its life left (5000 turns).\n* Removed the BODY spell school in SLASH'EM, moved to the ESCAPE spells\n* Removed PROTECTION spell school in SlashEM, moved to the CLERIC spells\n* Removed CLERIC spell school and created a NECROMANCY spell school to support the new spin on the Necromancer role. The spells from the CLERIC school have been distributed among the other schools as appropriate.\n* Spellbook weights are now based on their level.\n* Spellcasting while wearing body armor will negatively affect your spell success rate. The exception to this is [[crystal plate mail]], which does not adversely affect spellcasting in any way.\n* Casting any spell successfully adds +500 turns to your memory of it (from SLASH'EM).\n* You can reread a spellbook to refresh your memory at any time\n\n== Variant changes ==\n\nHere is where Hack'EM diverges from its ancestors.\n\n=== Changes from SLASH'EM ===\n\n* The [[Drow (starting race)|Drow]] has not been ported, but may be inherited from EvilHack's implementation in the future.\n\n* [[Techniques]] have been implemented with updates and bug fixes. \n* New techniques are featured! See the [[Hack'EM#Techniques|techniques section]] for more details.\n\nThese features have been removed or replaced:\n* Skipped races: [[Lycanthrope (starting race)|Lycanthrope]].\n* Skipped monsters: [[Gypsies]], Doctor Frankenstein, Frankenstein's Monster\n* Skipped items: \n** [[wand of fireball]]\n** [[lab coat]]\n** heavy hammer (evil had heavy war hammer)\n** [[rocket launcher]], [[grenade launcher]], [[rocket]], [[stick of dynamite]]\n** all droven items\n** [[Giantkiller]] (Evil has [[Giantslayer]]).\n* Skipped spellbooks:\n** [[spellbook of enchant armor]]\n** [[spellbook of enchant weapon]]\n** [[spellbook of resist poison]]\n** [[spellbook of resist sleep]]\n** [[spellbook of endure cold]]\n** [[spellbook of endure heat]]\n** [[spellbook of insulate]]\n** These all require implementing a IMMUNE property for full 100% temporary resistances, which doesn't really work with Evil's partial resistance system.\n* The [[Guild of Disgruntled Adventurers]] is removed and replaced by mini-guild special rooms\n* [[Frankenstein's Lab]] is removed\n* The variations on the vibrating square levels have NOT been imported - the EvilHack version remains.\n* None of the SLASH'EM Demon prince lairs have been imported.\n* Removed [[Monsters with hits creatures as a +x weapon (SLASH'EM)|\"Hits as +x weapon\"]] property from SLASH'EM monsters\n* Removed [[Monsters with need +x weapon to hit (SLASH'EM)|\"Need +x weapon to be hit\"]] property from SLASH'EM monsters\n* Removed the extra [[artifact blast]]ing (6d6 to 8d10) from SLASH'EM; this mechanic does not seem to add much to the game other than making early wishes less useful and killing unknowing players.\n* Removed [[wraith]] corpse nerf. In SLASH'EM there was a reduced probability of gaining levels with a mix of other effects.\n* Removed the [[Polymorph#SLASH'EM|temporary polymorph]] mechanic for objects. There is no \"hazy\" status for polymorphed objects. This mechanic was not imported for 2 reasons: it makes it possible to create overpowered weapons (e.g. +127 weapons) and it is also not intuitive for new players since it contradicts the vanilla behavior of polymorphed items.\n* Removed SLASH'EM's invisible objects. For now, there has not been a compelling reason to bring this mechanic in.\n* Removed SLASH'EM polymorph behavior for monsters; when killed shapeshifters could immediately poly into their polyform (or different form if a chameleon or similar). This mechanic was quite frustrating to deal with, especially concerning new threats like [[weretiger]]s or [[werepanther]]s. In SLASH'EM you could be forced to kill the same shapechanger many times before it would finally die in its base form. The EvilHack behavior replaces this so that a shapechanger cannot poly again once it has been killed in its polyform.\n\n=== Changes from EvilHack ===\n\n* Removed the [[Goblin Town]] branch.\n* Removed the Ice Queen branch.\n* Removed the Vecna's Domain branch. We still have Vecna but in a different level for the Chaotic Quest.\n* Removed the indestructible drawbridge from the VotD; it can be destroyed like a regular drawbridge now.\n* Demon lords and princes no longer negate being able to self-teleport or use cursed potions of gain level.\n* Removed the [[Wand of Orcus]]. Orcus gets his standard wand of death now.\n* Some of the dragon scales have had buffs or different secondary effects added. All scales grant passive effects now. See the section on Dragon Scales for details.\n* Removed chromatic dragon scales.\n* #forge has been renamed to #craft for working with [[Forge (dungeon feature)|forges]]. The reason is to make #force and #craft auto-complete. #forge still has the same meta shortcut:  M('F')\n* Removed two-weaponing weight-based restrictions.\n* Removed the monster riding monster mechanic.\n* Monster spawn rates depend on the number of wishes made, not on game progress.\n* Zapping light around peaceful monsters could anger them. This mechanic has been removed except for when you break a wand of light.\n* Spellcasting monsters have to see you in order to cast summon nasties.\n* Spellcasting monsters have had their spell range limited by their level (gnomish mages are level 3 and can only cast fire bolt in a radius of 2-3 tiles instead of 13). \n* Changed timeout for monster spell of stone to flesh to timeout 2d7 instead of rn2(7).\n* Removed engulfing attack from gelatinous cube, water elemental, earth elemental, and fire elemental. The Splice elementals (magma, mud, ice, acid) still can engulf.\n* Removed cursed weapons reverse hitting (was in EvilHack and Splice). Instead, cursed weapons will miss their target 25% of the time.\n* Revert the standard cursed wand backfire chance from 1-in-30 to 1-in-100.\n* Revert EvilHack sacrifice gift changes: Instead of a mix of regular items and artifacts, players will receive only artifacts (unless you get a minion as a gift).\n* Removed accompanying artifact defenders when wishing for artifacts.\n* Lowered the poison insta-death resistance threshold from 35% to 25%. If your poison resistance is under 25% you have a chance of insta-death from poison dart traps, poison bite, etc.\n* In EvilHack the Amulet of Yendor has a chance of teleporting randomly if dropped on the floor, this random chance of teleport has been removed.\n* Revert cursed amulet of life saving effects\n* Revert Amulet of life saving will not work if the player is in nonliving form.\n* Revert Amulet of life saving does not fully heal the wearer.\n\n* Illithids used to get flying at level 12, now they start with flying.\n* Centaurs used to get jumping at level 5, now they start with jumping.\n* Giants can wear mummy wrappings, giant robes, and dragon scales.\n* Any giant can wear [[large splint mail]].\n* Tortles can wear robes, mummy wrappings, and dragon scales.\n\n== Funny or silly changes ==\n* Gnomes hate eggs (from EvilHack)\n* Vampires can't use toilets.\n\n{{featured}}\n[[Category:Hack'EM]]\n[[Category:Variants]]"}

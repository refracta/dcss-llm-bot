{"title":"Wish","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Wish","type":"markdown","data":"**[English]()**\n\n • [한국어](/wiki/Wish/ko \"Wish/ko\")\n\nIn *[NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\")*, a **wish** is an opportunity to be granted an [item](/wiki/Item \"Item\") of the player's choice.\n\nWishes are highly sought after and extremely powerful, especially in the [early game](/wiki/Early_game \"Early game\") where high-grade equipment is otherwise unavailable. A significant amount of [strategy](/wiki/Strategy \"Strategy\") exists around getting as many wishes as possible and choosing the best items to wish for. Two [conducts](/wiki/Conduct \"Conduct\") involve restrictions on wishing: the [wishless](/wiki/Wishless \"Wishless\") conduct for making no wishes, and the artifact-wishless conduct for playing without wishing for [artifacts](/wiki/Artifact \"Artifact\").\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Sources](#Sources)\n\n- [2 Restrictions](#Restrictions)\n\n  - [2.1 Forbidden items](#Forbidden_items)\n  - [2.2 Artifact wishing](#Artifact_wishing)\n\n- [3 Customization](#Customization)\n\n  - [3.1 Quantity](#Quantity)\n  - [3.2 Enchantment](#Enchantment)\n  - [3.3 Beatitude](#Beatitude)\n  - [3.4 Erosion-proofing](#Erosion-proofing)\n  - [3.5 Monster type](#Monster_type)\n  - [3.6 Charges](#Charges)\n  - [3.7 Other item properties](#Other_item_properties)\n  - [3.8 Nothing](#Nothing)\n\n- [4 Strategy](#Strategy)\n\n  - [4.1 Common wishes](#Common_wishes)\n\n    - [4.1.1 Early single wishes](#Early_single_wishes)\n\n    - [4.1.2 Early wands of wishing](#Early_wands_of_wishing)\n\n    - [4.1.3 Late game wishes](#Late_game_wishes)\n\n    - [4.1.4 Quest artifacts](#Quest_artifacts)\n\n      - [4.1.4.1 Lawful](#Lawful)\n      - [4.1.4.2 Neutral](#Neutral)\n      - [4.1.4.3 Chaotic](#Chaotic)\n\n    - [4.1.5 Asking on IRC](#Asking_on_IRC)\n\n  - [4.2 What not to wish for](#What_not_to_wish_for)\n\n- [5 Misspelled wish, non-existent item, and canceling at the prompt](#Misspelled_wish.2C_non-existent_item.2C_and_canceling_at_the_prompt)\n\n- [6 Messages](#Messages)\n\n- [7 Variants](#Variants)\n\n  - [7.1 SLASH'EM](#SLASH.27EM)\n\n    - [7.1.1 SLASH'EM wish sources](#SLASH.27EM_wish_sources)\n    - [7.1.2 Common SLASH'EM wishes](#Common_SLASH.27EM_wishes)\n\n  - [7.2 UnNetHack](#UnNetHack)\n\n  - [7.3 GruntHack](#GruntHack)\n    - [7.3.1 Monster wishes](#Monster_wishes)\n\n  - [7.4 xNetHack](#xNetHack)\n\n  - [7.5 dNetHack](#dNetHack)\n\n  - [7.6 FIQHack](#FIQHack)\n\n  - [7.7 EvilHack](#EvilHack)\n\n    - [7.7.1 Object materials and properties](#Object_materials_and_properties)\n    - [7.7.2 Wish sources](#Wish_sources)\n    - [7.7.3 Artifact wishes](#Artifact_wishes)\n    - [7.7.4 Wish strategy](#Wish_strategy)\n    - [7.7.5 Monster wishes](#Monster_wishes_2)\n\n- [8 External links](#External_links)\n\n- [9 References](#References)\n\n## Sources\n\nThere are several ways to obtain a wish in *NetHack*, including:\n\n- [Engraving](/wiki/Engraving \"Engraving\") with a [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\") or zapping it. A wand is the only guaranteed way, provided your [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") is 0 or greater. With negative Luck, the probability of a wish is 5 + Luck5, down to zero if Luck ≤ −5. Cursed wands can explode when zapped (1% chance), but not when engraved with. A newly generated [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\") has 1–3 charges before recharge, 3 more charges after recharge with a [blessed](/wiki/Blessed \"Blessed\") [scroll of charging](/wiki/Scroll_of_charging \"Scroll of charging\"), and then you can [wrest](/wiki/Wrest \"Wrest\") one last wish. Therefore, it grants a total of 5–7 wishes.\n- Rubbing a [magic lamp](/wiki/Magic_lamp \"Magic lamp\"), preferably [blessed](/wiki/Blessed \"Blessed\"), until a [djinni](/wiki/Djinni \"Djinni\") appears. For a blessed magic lamp, you have an 80% chance of obtaining a wish (20% for an uncursed lamp, 5% for a cursed lamp). The worst outcome is a djinni which attacks you instead of granting a wish (5% chance for a blessed magic lamp). After a djinni appears, the magic lamp becomes an oil lamp. Therefore, a blessed magic lamp grants 0.8 wishes on average. In theory you can have more than 120 djinn from lamps,[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1) but not from smoky potions.\n- Quaffing a [smoky potion](/wiki/Smoky_potion \"Smoky potion\"), preferably blessed. There is a chance of 113 + 2*d* that a djinni appears (where *d* is the number of djinn created this game) and, for a blessed smoky potion, a 4⁄5 further chance that he grants you a wish. The worst outcome is a djinni which attacks you (chance 1⁄20 for each djinni from a blessed smoky potion). When a djinni appears from a smoky potion, you never get the effect of the potion itself. Therefore, a blessed smoky potion grants, on average, 465 + 10*d* wishes. After 120 djinn appear in the game, they become extinct and never appear anymore.\n- Quaffing from (or dipping in) a [fountain](/wiki/Fountain \"Fountain\") above dungeon level 20, unless you have the Amulet. There is a chance of 1⁄30 that a [water demon](/wiki/Water_demon \"Water demon\") appears and a further 20 − *DL*100 chance that he grants a wish (where *DL* is the dungeon level); otherwise, he attacks you. The fountain has a 1⁄3 chance of drying up. Therefore, each fountain grants on average about 20 − *DL*1000 wishes. Possible side effects are dangerous, including [moccasins](/wiki/Water_moccasin \"Water moccasin\") appearing around you (1⁄30 chance), creating a [water nymph](/wiki/Water_nymph \"Water nymph\") (1⁄30 chance), or a hostile water demon appearing (80 + *DL*3000 chance).\n- Sitting on a [throne](/wiki/Throne \"Throne\"), chance 1⁄39. The throne has 1⁄3 chance of vanishing \"in a puff of logic\", unless you are teleported away. Therefore, each throne grants about 1⁄13 wishes.[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2) This may cause unpleasant alternate outcomes.\n- Pressing ^W in [wizard mode](/wiki/Wizard_mode \"Wizard mode\"). This is intended to be used for debugging.\n\nThe [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\") always has a wand of wishing in a chest in one of the four corner rooms. Unless you are trying for wishless [conduct](/wiki/Conduct \"Conduct\"), you should be able to do some wishing before you enter [Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\").\n\nA successful wish will increase your prayer timeout by 50 to 149 turns.[\\[3\\]](#cite_note-3)\n\n## Restrictions\n\n### Forbidden items\n\nThese items can never be granted by a wish outside [wizard mode](/wiki/Wizard_mode \"Wizard mode\").\n\n| Forbidden item                                                                           | Replacement                                                                                                                                                |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor \"Amulet of Yendor\")                            | [cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/Cheap_plastic_imitation_of_the_Amulet_of_Yendor \"Cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor\") |\n| [Candelabrum of Invocation](/wiki/Candelabrum_of_Invocation \"Candelabrum of Invocation\") | - [tallow candle](/wiki/Tallow_candle \"Tallow candle\") *(80% chance)*\n- [wax candle](/wiki/Wax_candle \"Wax candle\") *(20% chance)*                         |\n| [Bell of Opening](/wiki/Bell_of_Opening \"Bell of Opening\")                               | [bell](/wiki/Bell \"Bell\")                                                                                                                                  |\n| [Book of the Dead](/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead \"Book of the Dead\")                            | [blank spellbook](/wiki/Blank_spellbook \"Blank spellbook\")                                                                                                 |\n| your role's [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\")                      | nothing                                                                                                                                                    |\n| [magic lamp](/wiki/Magic_lamp \"Magic lamp\")                                              | [oil lamp](/wiki/Oil_lamp \"Oil lamp\")                                                                                                                      |\n| [venom](/wiki/Venom \"Venom\")                                                             | the item isn't recognized by the parser[\\[4\\]](#cite_note-4)                                                                                               |\n| [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\")                               | * wand of wishing (1:-1) *(90% chance)*\n* wand of wishing (1:0) *(10% chance)*                                                                             |\n\n### Artifact wishing\n\nIf you wish for an artifact, your chance of receiving it depends on the number of artifacts (but not [unique items](/wiki/Unique_item \"Unique item\")) that have already been generated:[\\[5\\]](#cite_note-5)\n\n| Generated artifacts | 0        | 1        | 2     | 3    | 4    | 5     | 6     | *n*                   |\n| ------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | --------------------- |\n| Chance 1 wish       | (always) | (always) | 0.666 | 0.5  | 0.4  | 0.333 | 0.285 | 2*n* + 1              |\n| Chance 2 wishes     | (always) | (always) | 0.888 | 0.75 | 0.64 | 0.555 | 0.488 | 1 − (1 − 2*n* + 1)2   |\n| Chance m wishes     | (always) | (always) |       |      |      |       |       | 1 − (1 − 2*n* + 1)*m* |\n\nOtherwise, you receive nothing and the wish is wasted (\"For a moment, you feel something in your hands, but it disappears!\"). Similarly, wishing for your own [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\") will never succeed (same message). If you wish for an artifact which has already been generated in the game, you will receive its base item instead.[\\[6\\]](#cite_note-6)\n\nIf you wish for a [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\"), you might receive it, but find yourself unable to use it. (See [intelligent artifacts](/wiki/Intelligent_artifact \"Intelligent artifact\") for more details.)\n\nWishing for an artifact will break the artifact-wishless conduct, regardless of whether you actually receive it.[\\[7\\]](#cite_note-7)\n\nDestroying artifacts will *not* increase the chance of successfully wishing for another, since the number *generated* is never decremented. Failed artifact wishes don't further decrease the chance of success, however.\n\n## Customization\n\n### Quantity\n\nYou may wish for only one unstackable item. If you wish for more, you still get only one.\n\nWhen wishing for a [stackable](/wiki/Stackable \"Stackable\") item, you may wish for more than one. If the amount you wish for is less than the roll of a *d6*, you get the desired amount; otherwise you get only one.[\\[8\\]](#cite_note-8)\n\n| Quantity     | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6+   |\n| ------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Success rate | 1    | 2⁄3  | 1⁄2  | 1⁄3  | 1⁄6  | 0    |\n| Average      | 1.00 | 1.67 | 2.00 | 2.00 | 1.67 | 1.00 |\n\nExceptions to this rule are:[\\[9\\]](#cite_note-9)[\\[10\\]](#cite_note-10)\n\n- [Candles](/wiki/Candle \"Candle\") – you may wish for up to 7\n- [Arrows](/wiki/Arrow \"Arrow\") (all kinds), [darts](/wiki/Dart \"Dart\"), [crossbow bolts](/wiki/Crossbow_bolt \"Crossbow bolt\"), [shuriken](/wiki/Shuriken \"Shuriken\"), [boomerangs](/wiki/Boomerang \"Boomerang\"), and [rocks](/wiki/Rock \"Rock\") – you may wish for up to 20\n- [Gold pieces](/wiki/Gold_piece \"Gold piece\") – you may wish for up to 5000\n\nFor gold pieces, any quantity above 5000 is treated as 5000. For the other exceptions, any quantity above the one listed will not be honored at all, and you will receive only 1.\n\nRanged weapons aside from the ones listed, including [javelins](/wiki/Javelin \"Javelin\"), [daggers](/wiki/Dagger \"Dagger\"), [spears](/wiki/Spear \"Spear\"), [knives](/wiki/Knife \"Knife\"), [gray stones](/wiki/Gray_stone \"Gray stone\"), and [gems](/wiki/Gem \"Gem\"), follow the same rules as any ordinary [stackable](/wiki/Stackable \"Stackable\") item.\n\nIf you wish for a plural of a stackable item, but don't specify a quantity (e.g. \"blessed scrolls of charging\"), the game treats it as if you wished for two, subject to the probability above. If you specify a quantity of a singular item (\"2 blessed scroll of charging\"), the parser ignores the singular and uses the quantity specified. Quantities of zero or less are ignored, and the singular or plural status will be used.\n\nMost players wish for 2 or 3 items. Wishing for 3 gives more items when averaged over many wishes, but wishing for 2 is more likely to increase the effectiveness of the current wish.\n\n### Enchantment\n\nWhen wishing for an item that can be [enchanted](/wiki/Enchantment \"Enchantment\"), you may specify the enchantment. If the enchantment you wish for is less than or equal to the roll of a *d5*, you get the desired enchantment; otherwise you get +0.[\\[11\\]](#cite_note-11)\n\nYou *can* wish for negatively-enchanted equipment, with the same chance of success as the equivalent positive enchantment. It's not clear why anyone would want to do this, however.\n\nIf your [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") is negative, any enchantment higher than +2 will automatically become negative.[\\[12\\]](#cite_note-12) This check takes place *after* the game decides whether it will grant you your specified enchantment, and it only applies for armor, weapons, and weapon tools. If you want to wish for a +6 wand of striking (a bad idea most likely) while your Luck is negative—assuming you get the wand at all—you will get a wand of striking with between 4 and 6 charges, just as if your Luck were positive.\n\n| Enchantment  | +0  | ±1  | ±2  | ±3  | ±4  | ±5  | ±(6+) |\n| ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----- |\n| Success rate | 1   | 1   | 4⁄5 | 3⁄5 | 2⁄5 | 1⁄5 | 0     |\n| Average      | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.6 | 1.8 | 1.6 | 1.0 | 0.0   |\n\nAs with quantities, most players wish for +2 or +3 equipment. +3 gives the best average enchantment, but +2's slightly lower average is less chancy. (If you're intending to immediately enchant the item further, however, +2 is strictly better because a blessed scroll is more efficient on a +2 item than on a +3; after using a single blessed scroll on the newly created item, the average enchantment is 3.6 for the +2 case versus only 3.5 for +3.)[\\[13\\]](#cite_note-13) +4 and +5 have lower averages than +3 *and* are more risky as well, so those are usually not used. +1 is certain to work, but its average enchantment is much lower than that of +2 or +3, so it's usually not a good choice unless you are [illiterate](/wiki/Illiterate \"Illiterate\") and unable to enchant items yourself. The other possible enchantments are obviously not ever very useful, unless you actually want nonpositive enchantment for some bizarre reason.\n\nWhen wishing for wands or chargeable tools, an enchantment written as \"+x\" will be interpreted as a wish for x charges. Conversely, a wish for a \"dagger (y:x)\" is a wish for a +x dagger (the first number has no effect). This occurs because charge and enchantment are the same variable in the structure for objects in *NetHack*, hence there are no simultaneously enchantable and chargeable objects.\n\n### Beatitude\n\nYou can specify whether the item should be blessed, uncursed, or cursed. If your [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") is zero or greater, your preference will be respected.\n\nIf your Luck is negative, explicitly wishing for a \"blessed\" or \"uncursed\" item will yield a cursed one instead.[\\[14\\]](#cite_note-14) (Wishing for a \"cursed\" item still works.)\n\nIf you do not specify a beatitude, the item will have a random beatitude as if the item had been randomly generated (regardless of Luck).[\\[15\\]](#cite_note-15) Specifying a negative enchantment as part of the wish (even \"-0\") will implicitly specify \"cursed\" unless you specify a beatitude explicitly.[\\[16\\]](#cite_note-16)\n\nYou should almost always wish for blessed items, unless you have negative Luck, or specifically want a cursed [potion](/wiki/Potion \"Potion\") or [scroll](/wiki/Scroll \"Scroll\"). [Magic markers](/wiki/Magic_marker \"Magic marker\") should be uncursed, so that cursed paper will produce cursed scrolls. If you desire both cursed and blessed copies of an item (such as [scrolls of genocide](/wiki/Scroll_of_genocide \"Scroll of genocide\") or [potions of gain level](/wiki/Potion_of_gain_level \"Potion of gain level\")), consider wishing for cursed ones, since it is easier to bless items than it is to curse them.\n\n### Erosion-proofing\n\nYou can ask for an item to be \"rustproof\", \"erodeproof\", \"corrodeproof\", \"[fixed](/wiki/Fixed \"Fixed\")\", \"fireproof\", or \"rotproof\". If your Luck is non-negative, and the item is subject to [erosion](/wiki/Erosion \"Erosion\") (or is a [crysknife](/wiki/Crysknife \"Crysknife\")), your preference will be respected.\n\n*NetHack* does not discriminate between the different types of erosion-proofing, so you may wish for \"corrodeproof [speed boots](/wiki/Speed_boots \"Speed boots\")\" or a \"fireproof crysknife\", and the game will substitute the appropriate type of protection.[\\[17\\]](#cite_note-17) Thus, some players recommend making it a habit to add \"fixed\" to *every* wish, to reduce the chance of forgetting to erosion-proof something.\n\nYou can also explicitly request an eroded item. If you wish for an item to be both eroded and erosion-proof, the item will *not* be erosion-proof.[\\[18\\]](#cite_note-18)\n\n### Monster type\n\nWhen wishing for a [tin](/wiki/Tin \"Tin\"), [corpse](/wiki/Corpse \"Corpse\"), [figurine](/wiki/Figurine \"Figurine\"), [egg](/wiki/Egg \"Egg\"), or [statue](/wiki/Statue \"Statue\"), you can specify what type of monster it should be.\n\nIf you wish for a tin containing a monster that has been [genocided](/wiki/Genocide \"Genocide\"), you get an empty tin.[\\[19\\]](#cite_note-19) Wishing for a tin containing a unique monster, a monster that cannot leave a corpse, or a monster giving zero [nutrition](/wiki/Nutrition \"Nutrition\") (such as a [wraith](/wiki/Wraith \"Wraith\")) will instead produce a random tin.[\\[20\\]](#cite_note-20) You can also wish for tins of [spinach](/wiki/Spinach \"Spinach\").[\\[21\\]](#cite_note-21)\n\nYou may not wish for the corpse of a unique monster, or a monster that cannot leave a corpse; doing so will produce a random corpse. Wishing for the corpse of a [quest guardian](/wiki/Quest_guardian \"Quest guardian\") will instead produce a corpse of the corresponding [player monster](/wiki/Player_monster \"Player monster\").[\\[22\\]](#cite_note-22) A partly eaten corpse is lighter than a non-eaten one, so many players prefer those when wishing.\n\nIf you wish for a figurine of a unique monster, any kind of human, or a [mail daemon](/wiki/Mail_daemon \"Mail daemon\"), you will instead receive a random figurine.[\\[23\\]](#cite_note-23)\n\nIf you wish for an egg from a non-[oviparous](/wiki/Oviparous \"Oviparous\") monster, you will get a random kind of egg. Wishing for a \"[Scorpius](/wiki/Scorpius \"Scorpius\") egg\" will give you a [scorpion](/wiki/Scorpion \"Scorpion\") egg. You *can* wish for an egg from a genocided species, but the egg will never hatch.[\\[24\\]](#cite_note-24)\n\nYou can wish for a statue of any monster, including unique and genocided ones. Bear in mind, however, that casting [stone to flesh](/wiki/Spellbook_of_stone_to_flesh \"Spellbook of stone to flesh\") on a statue will not always produce that monster—for example, animating a statue of a unique monster or quest guardian will instead produce a [doppelganger](/wiki/Doppelganger \"Doppelganger\") disguised as that monster.[\\[25\\]](#cite_note-25)\n\n### Charges\n\nAlthough you can wish for a specific number of charges (e.g. \"wand of death (0:7)\"), in a normal game you will always receive the lesser of the number of charges you wish for or the number of charges you would otherwise receive, making this an undesirable option. The capability was designed for [wizard mode](/wiki/Wizard_mode \"Wizard mode\"), where you always receive the number of charges you wish for.\n\nYou can also wish for charges by specifying an enchantment (so a wish for a \"+7 wand of death\" is equivalent to the above). Wishing for a \"+10 magic marker\" is a bad idea, because it will have at most 10 charges.\n\nYou cannot normally wish for negative charges.[\\[26\\]](#cite_note-26)[\\[27\\]](#cite_note-27) However, it is possible to wish for a negative enchantment instead, which means the same internally. Outside [wizard mode](/wiki/Wizard_mode \"Wizard mode\"), wishing for negative charges on a wand will give you a canceled wand (with -1 charges);[\\[28\\]](#cite_note-28) wishing for negative charges on a tool will give you 0 charges.[\\[29\\]](#cite_note-29)\n\n### Other item properties\n\nYou can also specify the following properties:[\\[30\\]](#cite_note-30)\n\n- \"holy\", \"unholy\" (sets BUC, even if not [potion of water](/wiki/Potion_of_water \"Potion of water\"))\n- \"lit\", \"burning\", \"unlit\", \"extinguished\" (for [lamps](/wiki/Lamp \"Lamp\"), [candles](/wiki/Candle \"Candle\"), and [potions of oil](/wiki/Potion_of_oil \"Potion of oil\"))\n- \"unlabeled\", \"unlabelled\", \"blank\" (for [scrolls](/wiki/Blank_scroll \"Blank scroll\") and [spellbooks](/wiki/Blank_spellbook \"Blank spellbook\"))\n- \"[poisoned](/wiki/Poison \"Poison\")\" (for poisonable weapons and comestibles, and for containers which can be trapped)\n- \"[greased](/wiki/Grease \"Grease\")\" (any item)\n- \"partly eaten\" (for [comestibles](/wiki/Comestible \"Comestible\"))\n- \"historic\" (for [statues](/wiki/Statue \"Statue\"))\n- \"diluted\" (for potions other than water)\n- \"empty\" (for [tins](/wiki/Tin \"Tin\"))\n- A general item category, e.g. \"scroll\" or \"spellbook\"; this will produce a random item in the chosen category. Pressing enter on a blank line, or escaping out of the wish, will produce a random item. This is still subject to the restrictions on wishing, so wishing for a \"lamp\" will always produce an oil lamp.\n\nMost of these are useless or worse, but \"greased\" can be a life-saver for [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\"), [weapons](/wiki/Weapon \"Weapon\"), [spellbooks](/wiki/Spellbook \"Spellbook\"), [scrolls](/wiki/Scroll \"Scroll\"), [potions](/wiki/Potion \"Potion\"), and [containers](/wiki/Container \"Container\"), \"poisoned\" can increase the effectiveness of weapons, and \"partly eaten\" can make wielded [chickatrice](/wiki/Chickatrice \"Chickatrice\") corpses lighter. Some players recommend applying \"greased fixed\" to every wish, as \"fixed\" is harmless, and \"greased\" is only harmful for [projectiles](/wiki/Projectile \"Projectile\") you intend to [throw](/wiki/Throw \"Throw\").\n\nYou should especially grease all [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\"), even pieces that can't be [eroded](/wiki/Erosion \"Erosion\"), as [greased](/wiki/Greased \"Greased\") [helms](/wiki/Helm \"Helm\"), [shirts](/wiki/Shirt \"Shirt\"), [cloaks](/wiki/Cloak \"Cloak\"), and [body armor](/wiki/Body_armor \"Body armor\") can protect you from [grabbing](/wiki/Grabbing \"Grabbing\"), [drowning](/wiki/Drowning \"Drowning\"), and [mind flayers](/wiki/Mind_flayer \"Mind flayer\").\n\n### Nothing\n\nSometimes, a player gets a wish prompt (for example from a throne or a smoky potion), but wants to keep the wishless conduct. In this case, the player can wish for \"nothing\", \"none\", or \"nil\" to avoid breaking the conduct.[\\[31\\]](#cite_note-31)\n\n## Strategy\n\n### Common wishes\n\nThe best use of a wish depends heavily on your situation in the game. Here we give some general advice for early and late game situations. This advice is only a guideline and does not apply to all situations. In some cases, if you already have everything you need, the best thing to do with a wand of wishing or magic lamp is to save it for later. Experienced players are able to weigh the value of an unused available wish and compare it to the benefit that would be provided by the most valuable item in the game in that situation. For inexperienced players, there is no substitute for experience—play and learn!\n\nThe following general principles apply in almost all situations:\n\n- If you encounter a wand of wishing, and you can't [identify](/wiki/Identify \"Identify\") how many charges it has, then your first wish should be either 2 (or 3) \"blessed [scrolls of charging](/wiki/Scroll_of_charging \"Scroll of charging\")\", or an \"uncursed [magic marker](/wiki/Magic_marker \"Magic marker\")\", so you can write your own blessed(!) scrolls to recharge the wand.\n\n  - Writing your own scrolls will only work reliably if you have already identified scrolls of charging, you have found and named (or identified) all four kinds of 300zm scrolls, or you are a [wizard](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\"); however, if you are willing to save some of your wishes for later, i.e. until after you have identified scrolls of charging, a magic marker is an overall more useful item (it can yield three scrolls of charging and still have enough ink to write several scrolls).\n  - Wands of wishing from bones levels might already have been recharged once.\n\nThe rest of this discussion assumes that you have a way to recharge your wand, if the wish is from a wand of wishing.\n\n#### Early single wishes\n\nThe most common source of early wishes is a [magic lamp](/wiki/Magic_lamp \"Magic lamp\") (if you disregard slightly suicidal early level fountain quaffers). As a rule, the best item to wish for early in the game is either gray or silver [dragon scale mail](/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail \"Dragon scale mail\"), unless you are playing a [Monk](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\"):\n\n- \"blessed greased +2 [gray dragon scale mail](/wiki/Gray_dragon_scale_mail \"Gray dragon scale mail\")\" (or +3) provides [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\"), and\n- \"blessed greased +2 [silver dragon scale mail](/wiki/Silver_dragon_scale_mail \"Silver dragon scale mail\")\" (or +3) provides [reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\").\n\nWhich one you should wish for is somewhat situational; if you already have one extrinsic, you should wish for the DSM which provides the other. For example, a [Wizard](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\") starts with a [cloak of magic resistance](/wiki/Cloak_of_magic_resistance \"Cloak of magic resistance\"), and would prefer SDSM. A character who gets the [amulet of reflection](/wiki/Amulet_of_reflection \"Amulet of reflection\") from [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\"), on the other hand, would be better served by GDSM. If you have neither magic resistance nor reflection, the choice is somewhat more difficult; see [GDSM versus SDSM](/wiki/GDSM_versus_SDSM \"GDSM versus SDSM\") for a more detailed discussion of the merits of each.\n\nFor a [Monk](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\"), the choice is drastically different, due to the large penalty for wearing body armor, which is especially problematic early in the game. Another class's quest artifact is a good choice for a [lawful](/wiki/Lawful \"Lawful\") or [neutral](/wiki/Neutral \"Neutral\") Monk (see [§ Quest artifacts](#Quest_artifacts) below). However, due to the absence of [chaotic](/wiki/Chaotic \"Chaotic\") quest artifacts that provide magic resistance, a chaotic Monk needing magic resistance should wish for a \"blessed greased fireproof +2 [cloak of magic resistance](/wiki/Cloak_of_magic_resistance \"Cloak of magic resistance\")\" (or +3). Alternatively, when magic resistance is not the highest priority, common and useful single wishes include [speed boots](/wiki/Speed_boots \"Speed boots\") or [gauntlets of power](/wiki/Gauntlets_of_power \"Gauntlets of power\"). [The Master Key of Thievery](/wiki/The_Master_Key_of_Thievery \"The Master Key of Thievery\") is another option for a chaotic Monk due to the extremely useful [half physical damage](/wiki/Half_physical_damage \"Half physical damage\") property, but be wary of its [artifact blast](/wiki/Artifact_blast \"Artifact blast\").\n\n#### Early wands of wishing\n\nA somewhat rarer source of wishes early in the game is a [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\"). With a wand of wishing, you will usually want to wish for some or all of the following items, depending on what you already have: [dragon scale mail](/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail \"Dragon scale mail\") (gray or silver), [amulet of life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\"), some [artifact weapon](/wiki/Artifact_weapon \"Artifact weapon\") (unless you're planning to sacrifice for one), a [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\") (if [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") doesn't provide one), and [speed boots](/wiki/Speed_boots \"Speed boots\"). All of the above should be blessed, and weapon and speed boots should be also fireproof. Some players wish for 2 blessed scrolls of charging, or a blessed magic marker, in order to access all the wishes immediately. You may also consider wishing for a quest artifact (see [§ Quest artifacts](#Quest_artifacts)), but its [artifact blast](/wiki/Artifact_blast \"Artifact blast\") might kill you.\n\nIf you encounter a [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\") in a shop, it is easy to [price identify](/wiki/Price_identification \"Price identification\") because its base cost is 500, shared only with the [wand of death](/wiki/Wand_of_death \"Wand of death\"). If you have a pet with you, [stealing](/wiki/Stealing_from_shops \"Stealing from shops\") the wand is easy enough. Those who were already planning to use a powerful pet (e.g. [pacifists](/wiki/Pacifist \"Pacifist\")) might wish for a blessed [figurine](/wiki/Figurine \"Figurine\") of an [Archon](/wiki/Archon \"Archon\"); this carries a 10% chance of backfiring, and a 10% chance of being wasted. Do not wish for a pet unless you are prepared to [take care of it](/wiki/Pet#Protect_your_pet \"Pet\"). Failing this, it is best to simply find 500zm worth of junk to sell to the shopkeeper and then buy the wand. If you're really not sure of your character's ability to survive long enough to do that, it's also possible to simply wish for 5000 [zorkmids](/wiki/Zorkmid \"Zorkmid\"), use some of them to pay the shopkeeper for the wand, and leave with a healthy monetary profit (and more to the point, a wand of wishing with only one charge spent). This is probably the lowest-risk strategy, but the potential rewards are lower too as gold is typically a waste of a wish. A more ostensibly \"profitable\" method is to wish for a [wand of death](/wiki/Wand_of_death \"Wand of death\") and use it to kill the shopkeeper, though that entails the penalty for [murder](/wiki/Murder \"Murder\").\n\n#### Late game wishes\n\nIn the later stages of the game, wishes typically serve the role of completing an [ascension kit](/wiki/Ascension_kit \"Ascension kit\").\n\nIf you need lots of items to complete your ascension kit, consider wishing for a [wand of polymorph](/wiki/Wand_of_polymorph \"Wand of polymorph\"). This wand is a very powerful item for players who are not averse to [polypiling](/wiki/Polypiling \"Polypiling\"). In most cases, it is far more efficient to polypile for ascension kit items and then wish for the few remaining missing pieces, rather than wishing directly for all the items from the start.\n\nAn uncursed [magic marker](/wiki/Magic_marker \"Magic marker\") can be used to write cursed [scrolls of genocide](/wiki/Scroll_of_genocide \"Scroll of genocide\"), which when read will summon a monster of your choice. This technique is often more efficient than wishing directly for monster-derived items, since a single uncursed magic marker (which takes one wish) can usually write at least four scrolls of genocide with recharging. For example, if your character is reasonably strong, you can obtain dragon scale mail by [reverse genociding](/wiki/Reverse_genocide \"Reverse genocide\") dragons instead of wishing directly for dragon scale mail. As another example, if you need a [cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") corpse, it may be more efficient to reverse genocide cockatrices than to wish for a corpse directly.\n\n#### Quest artifacts\n\n- *See [§ Artifact wishing](#Artifact_wishing) for general information about artifact wishing.*\n\nGenerally speaking you should *not* wish for cross-aligned quest artifacts. They will “evade your grasp” and fall to the floor, and you will be unable to pick them up. Early-game characters should also avoid wishing even for coaligned quest artifacts, unless they have enough current [HP](/wiki/HP \"HP\") to survive the inevitable [artifact blast](/wiki/Artifact_blast \"Artifact blast\"). It is technically possible to carry multiple artifacts of different alignments through careful use of alignment conversion or a [helm of opposite alignment](/wiki/Helm_of_opposite_alignment \"Helm of opposite alignment\"), but this tactic is rarely employed. A helm of opposite alignment also cannot cause chaotic or lawful characters to become neutral, so the only way for such characters to use wished-for neutral artifacts is to permanently convert themselves at an [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\").\n\nAs detailed above, you cannot get your own [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\") from wishes.\n\n##### Lawful\n\nFor lawful characters, the main contenders are [the Sceptre of Might](/wiki/The_Sceptre_of_Might \"The Sceptre of Might\"), [the Orb of Detection](/wiki/The_Orb_of_Detection \"The Orb of Detection\") and [the Magic Mirror of Merlin](/wiki/The_Magic_Mirror_of_Merlin \"The Magic Mirror of Merlin\"), which all offer magic resistance. The Sceptre offers ring-less [conflict](/wiki/Conflict \"Conflict\") and deals double damage against cross-aligned (non-lawful) monsters. The Mirror and the Orb both offer extrinsic telepathy; the Orb also offers [half spell damage](/wiki/Half_spell_damage \"Half spell damage\") and functions as a [crystal ball](/wiki/Crystal_ball \"Crystal ball\"), but is much heavier than the Sceptre or Mirror. If you already have magic resistance, [the Mitre of Holiness](/wiki/The_Mitre_of_Holiness \"The Mitre of Holiness\") is worth considering for a spellcaster due to the energy boost it provides when invoked.\n\n##### Neutral\n\nIf you are a [neutral](/wiki/Neutral \"Neutral\") character and want a quest artifact, there are at least four good choices:\n\n- \"blessed rustproof [Eye of the Aethiopica](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Aethiopica \"Eye of the Aethiopica\")\" (if you are *not* a [Wizard](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\")) to obtain [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\"), fast [power](/wiki/Power \"Power\") regeneration, [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\"), and to #invoke for [branchporting](/wiki/Branchport \"Branchport\")\n- \"blessed fireproof [Platinum Yendorian Express Card](/wiki/Platinum_Yendorian_Express_Card \"Platinum Yendorian Express Card\")\" (if you are *not* a [Tourist](/wiki/Tourist \"Tourist\")) to obtain [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\"), [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\"), and to #invoke for non-blessed [charging](/wiki/Charging \"Charging\")\n- \"blessed [Eyes of the Overworld](/wiki/Eyes_of_the_Overworld \"Eyes of the Overworld\")\" (if you are *not* a [Monk](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\")) to obtain [astral vision](/wiki/Astral_vision \"Astral vision\") and [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\"), and to #invoke for [enlightenment](/wiki/Enlightenment \"Enlightenment\")\n- \"blessed [Orb of Fate](/wiki/Orb_of_Fate \"Orb of Fate\")\" (if you are *not* a [Valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\")) to obtain [half physical damage](/wiki/Half_physical_damage \"Half physical damage\") and [half spell damage](/wiki/Half_spell_damage \"Half spell damage\"), and to #invoke to [level teleport](/wiki/Level_teleport \"Level teleport\") (but you will need to obtain [teleport control](/wiki/Teleport_control \"Teleport control\") separately)\n\n[The Eye of the Aethiopica](/wiki/The_Eye_of_the_Aethiopica \"The Eye of the Aethiopica\") is an especially valuable item for neutral [Monks](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\"); due to armor [to-hit](/wiki/To-hit \"To-hit\") penalty and weaponless [martial arts](/wiki/Martial_arts \"Martial arts\"), they will most likely spend a wish on [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\"). Comparing the [cloak](/wiki/Cloak_of_magic_resistance \"Cloak of magic resistance\") and the MR-granting quest artifacts, energy regeneration stands out as extremely useful, since Monks are decent [spellcasters](/wiki/Spellcaster \"Spellcaster\") and their starting spell (whatever it is) becomes vastly more powerful with energy regeneration. [Branchport](/wiki/Branchport \"Branchport\") and [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\") are also big bonuses that are difficult or impossible for vegetarian Monks to get in any other way.\n\n[The Eyes of the Overworld](/wiki/The_Eyes_of_the_Overworld \"The Eyes of the Overworld\") might be considered a lower priority than some of the others listed, but the [astral vision](/wiki/Astral_vision \"Astral vision\") they provide is useful for making the exploration of [Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\") less tedious without having to stockpile scrolls of magic mapping. However, if you can cast the divination spells of [magic mapping](/wiki/Spellbook_of_magic_mapping \"Spellbook of magic mapping\"), [detect treasure](/wiki/Spellbook_of_detect_treasure \"Spellbook of detect treasure\"), and [detect monsters](/wiki/Spellbook_of_detect_monsters \"Spellbook of detect monsters\") at a Skilled level, then these combined also provide the key benefits of the Eyes, even revealing information about the entire map at once—though this of course requires obtaining the appropriate spellbooks and being able to cast them somewhat reliably.\n\n##### Chaotic\n\nFor chaotic characters, [the Master Key of Thievery](/wiki/The_Master_Key_of_Thievery \"The Master Key of Thievery\") is usually considered better than [the Longbow of Diana](/wiki/The_Longbow_of_Diana \"The Longbow of Diana\"). No chaotic artifact grants magic resistance, making them somewhat less desirable than artifacts of other alignments. However, the Key still grants the very useful [half physical damage](/wiki/Half_physical_damage \"Half physical damage\") and [teleport control](/wiki/Teleport_control \"Teleport control\") properties, in addition to warning and its [invoke](/wiki/Invoke \"Invoke\") effect.\n\n#### Asking on IRC\n\nIf you want, you can just join #nethack on [Libera](/wiki/Libera \"Libera\") and ask them to suggest what to wish for. It helps if you know what items and perhaps spells, discoveries you already have.\n\n### What not to wish for\n\nThe [NetHack Wishing Spoiler](http://nh.gmuf.com/wish.html) has a list of good items to obtain without wishing. Here are a few more:\n\n- [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\") – This is a very common item after you start finding unicorns, and you won't need one very often before then. Early in the game, if you have no unicorn horn but find a wish, you probably want dragon scale mail.\n- [food ration](/wiki/Food_ration \"Food ration\") – You are fainting, cannot #[pray](/wiki/Pray \"Pray\"), and there is no food around? Prefer wishing for a [horn of plenty](/wiki/Horn_of_plenty \"Horn of plenty\"). If you're not fainting yet but out of food regardless, wishing for a [ring of slow digestion](/wiki/Ring_of_slow_digestion \"Ring of slow digestion\") may be better—NetHack is usually plentiful enough on food that you can find a monster or food item soon enough with the decreased hunger.\n- [potion of holy water](/wiki/Potion_of_holy_water \"Potion of holy water\") – If playing an [atheist](/wiki/Atheist \"Atheist\"), wish for two blessed [scrolls of remove curse](/wiki/Scroll_of_remove_curse \"Scroll of remove curse\"). Obtain lots of uncursed water, name each one differently so they don't stack, and have nothing but the water and one of the scrolls in your inventory. Read the scroll while confused, un-name all the water, and #[adjust](/wiki/Adjust \"Adjust\") them so they merge into three stacks. Figure out which is which by dipping a known-uncursed useless object (such as a rock) into them, checking for the cursed one with a pet, or [price identification](/wiki/Price_identification \"Price identification\") to find the uncursed one. If you only have two stacks, figure out those two and repeat with the other scroll.\n  - For illiterate atheist players, this is a reasonable wish. See also the [complete list of conduct-proof methods](/wiki/Potion_of_holy_water#Conduct_considerations \"Potion of holy water\").\n- [dragon scale mail](/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail \"Dragon scale mail\") (in the *mid to late game only*) – Once you have known-cursed paper and you know the [scroll of genocide](/wiki/Scroll_of_genocide \"Scroll of genocide\") (or are a [Wizard](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\") with high Luck), an uncursed [magic marker](/wiki/Magic_marker \"Magic marker\") is likely a better wish. If you cannot confidently write cursed scrolls of genocide, you may wish for them instead. [Reverse genocide](/wiki/Reverse_genocide \"Reverse genocide\") dragons, kill them, and write [enchant armor](/wiki/Scroll_of_enchant_armor \"Scroll of enchant armor\") to make mail from their scales. See the note on [acquiring dragon scales](/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail#Acquiring_dragon_scales \"Dragon scale mail\") for how to do this safely.\n\n## Misspelled wish, non-existent item, and canceling at the prompt\n\nIf what you enter at the \"For what do you wish?\" prompt cannot be parsed as a *NetHack* item, you will be notified (\"Nothing fitting that description exists in the game.\") and asked again.[\\[32\\]](#cite_note-32) \"Cannot be parsed\" is a quite loose definition, though; for example, \"figuring\" will successfully be (mis-)parsed as \"ring\". However, you have at most five tries; after failing five times you will be given a random object (\"That's enough tries!\").[\\[33\\]](#cite_note-33)\n\nPressing [Esc](/wiki/Esc \"Esc\") at the prompt will result in a random object being given to you. This breaks the [wishless](/wiki/Wishless \"Wishless\") conduct.[\\[34\\]](#cite_note-34) Pressing any of the arrow keys will have the same result as their representation contains an escape character.\n\n[NAO](/wiki/NAO \"NAO\")'s patched *NetHack* version only clears the input if you press escape; if the input line is already empty, pressing escape will have the same effect as in vanilla *NetHack*, however.\n\nBe careful if wishing for [gray dragon scale mail](/wiki/GDSM \"GDSM\"). If you omit \"scale\" and wish for \"blessed greased +2 gray dragon mail\", you will receive a [scroll of mail](/wiki/Scroll_of_mail \"Scroll of mail\")!\n\n## Messages\n\n- You may wish for an object.\n\n  You have been granted a wish.\n\n- Unfortunately, nothing happens.\n\n  You zapped or engraved with a wand of wishing which had no effect due to negative luck, wasting a charge.\n\n- Nothing happens.\n\n  Among other causes, this message appears when you zap a wand that has no charges, and may appear when rubbing any type of lamp.\n\n- Nothing fitting that description exists in the game.\n\n  You made a wish that couldn't be parsed or for an invalid object.\n\n- For a moment, you feel something in your hands, but it disappears!\n\n  You wished for an artifact that was not granted, wasting the wish.\n\n- Oops! The \\[object] drops to the floor!\n\n  You could not carry the object you wished for, probably because you have no free inventory slots or it is too heavy.\n\n## Variants\n\n### SLASH'EM\n\nIn [SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\"), there are not only several new ways to obtain wishes, there are many new targets for wishes and many other chances and ways to get ascension kit items that would be good wish targets in vanilla. The following are some key points to bear in mind.\n\n#### SLASH'EM wish sources\n\nSLASH'EM has two additional wish sources: [pills](/wiki/Pill \"Pill\") and [gypsies](/wiki/Gypsy \"Gypsy\"), of which the latter is the more important. A common mid- to late-game technique for a character who has a significant number of identified gemstones is to [reverse genocide](/wiki/Reverse_genocide \"Reverse genocide\") gypsies, which guarantees several wishes if the player has enough gems. Because this can be done repeatedly, it makes wishes less of a rarity than vanilla. By the time a SLASH'EM player reaches the castle, they rarely need the wand.\n\n#### Common SLASH'EM wishes\n\nSLASH'EM has many new artifacts and items which are well worth a wish. The following are some common wish targets:\n\n**Artifacts**\n\n- **Lawful**\n\n  - [The Crown of Saint Edward](/wiki/The_Crown_of_Saint_Edward \"The Crown of Saint Edward\"), the [Yeoman](/wiki/Yeoman \"Yeoman\") quest artifact, is a [helm of telepathy](/wiki/Helm_of_telepathy \"Helm of telepathy\") which also provides [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\") and [half spell damage](/wiki/Half_spell_damage \"Half spell damage\").\n  - [Firewall](/wiki/Firewall \"Firewall\") is a lawful [athame](/wiki/Athame \"Athame\") that provides fire resistance and does extra fire damage, both of which can be extremely helpful in the early game.\n  - [Grayswandir](/wiki/Grayswandir \"Grayswandir\"), the best artifact weapon in vanilla, is still arguably the best lawful artifact weapon in SLASH'EM; it's also harder to get via sacrifice, since there are so many other artifacts to compete with.\n  - [Holy Spear of Light](/wiki/Holy_Spear_of_Light \"Holy Spear of Light\") is a [silver spear](/wiki/Silver_spear \"Silver spear\") which can be invoked for to fry all undead around the player for significant damage.\n  - [Reaper](/wiki/Reaper \"Reaper\") is a [halberd](/wiki/Halberd \"Halberd\") which does +20 to damage, a great choice for [riding](/wiki/Riding \"Riding\") characters such as [Knights](/wiki/Knight \"Knight\"); as it is the second guaranteed sacrifice gift for [Yeomen](/wiki/Yeoman \"Yeoman\"), it is probably not worth a wish for them.\n  - [The Stake of Van Helsing](/wiki/The_Stake_of_Van_Helsing \"The Stake of Van Helsing\"), the [Undead Slayer](/wiki/Undead_Slayer \"Undead Slayer\") quest artifact, is a [wooden stake](/wiki/Wooden_stake \"Wooden stake\") (dagger skill) that does a flat +12 to damage and provides magic resistance.\n\n- **Neutral**\n\n  - [Disrupter](/wiki/Disrupter \"Disrupter\") is a mace which deals +30 to damage to [undead](/wiki/Undead \"Undead\").\n  - [Mjollnir](/wiki/Mjollnir \"Mjollnir\") is not new in SLASH'EM, but does vastly more damage (flat +24 to non-shock resistant monsters) and is the preferred neutral weapon for most fighting roles.\n\n- **Chaotic**\n\n  - [Bat from Hell](/wiki/Bat_from_Hell \"Bat from Hell\") is the most coveted weapon in SLASH'EM, a [baseball bat](/wiki/Baseball_bat \"Baseball bat\") (club skill) doing a flat +20 damage to all foes.\n  - [Deep Freeze](/wiki/Deep_Freeze \"Deep Freeze\") is an [athame](/wiki/Athame \"Athame\") that provides cold resistance and does extra cold damage.\n  - [Doomblade](/wiki/Doomblade \"Doomblade\") is a [short sword](/wiki/Short_sword \"Short sword\") which does +10 to damage with occasional bonus damage of 5d4; it is the second most powerful chaotic weapon after the [Bat from Hell](/wiki/Bat_from_Hell \"Bat from Hell\"), and may be a good choice for roles that can get Skilled in short swords but are restricted in clubs.\n  - [The Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa](/wiki/The_Great_Dagger_of_Glaurgnaa \"The Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa\") is the [Necromancer](/wiki/Necromancer \"Necromancer\") quest artifact; while less powerful as a weapon that many other chaotic artifacts, it provides magic resistance and can be #invoked to recharge energy (although non-Necromancers will be [blasted](/wiki/Artifact_blast \"Artifact blast\") for significant damage).\n  - [Serpent's Tongue](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Tongue \"Serpent's Tongue\") is not as powerful as the [Bat from Hell](/wiki/Bat_from_Hell \"Bat from Hell\") or [Doomblade](/wiki/Doomblade \"Doomblade\") at +0, but many roles that can't use either effectively can advance dagger to Expert.\n\n- **Unaligned**\n  - [Wallet of Perseus](/wiki/Wallet_of_Perseus \"Wallet of Perseus\") is a [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\") which reduces the weight of its contents to 1⁄3 when uncursed or 1⁄6 when blessed.\n\n**Non-artifacts**\n\n- [amulet of drain resistance](/wiki/Amulet_of_drain_resistance \"Amulet of drain resistance\") – Provides [drain resistance](/wiki/Drain_resistance \"Drain resistance\"), which is important against [wands of draining](/wiki/Wand_of_draining \"Wand of draining\") and [deep dragons](/wiki/Deep_dragon \"Deep dragon\"). It is most useful for players with no access to [Excalibur](/wiki/Excalibur \"Excalibur\") or [Stormbringer](/wiki/Stormbringer \"Stormbringer\").\n- [amulet of flying](/wiki/Amulet_of_flying \"Amulet of flying\") – Allows a character to fly, meaning they can avoid water, trapdoors, lava, etc. and still pick up items, go down stairs, etc.\n- [amulet versus stone](/wiki/Amulet_versus_stone \"Amulet versus stone\") – Like an [amulet of life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\") against [stoning](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\") attacks, only is re-usable if re-blessed, similar to a [scroll of scare monster](/wiki/Scroll_of_scare_monster \"Scroll of scare monster\").\n- [boots of water walking](/wiki/Boots_of_water_walking \"Boots of water walking\") – Only moderately useful in vanilla, some consider these more important than [speed boots](/wiki/Speed_boots \"Speed boots\") or [jumping boots](/wiki/Jumping_boots \"Jumping boots\") in SLASH'EM due to the new [create pool](/wiki/Create_pool \"Create pool\") spell that monsters will use against you.\n- [deep dragon scale mail](/wiki/Deep_dragon_scale_mail \"Deep dragon scale mail\") – Provides [drain resistance](/wiki/Drain_resistance \"Drain resistance\"), which is important against [wands of draining](/wiki/Wand_of_draining \"Wand of draining\") and [deep dragons](/wiki/Deep_dragon \"Deep dragon\"). It is most useful for players with no access to [Excalibur](/wiki/Excalibur \"Excalibur\") or [Stormbringer](/wiki/Stormbringer \"Stormbringer\").\n- [figurine](/wiki/Figurine \"Figurine\") of a [solar](/wiki/Solar \"Solar\") – A powerful pet, much stronger than an [Archon](/wiki/Archon \"Archon\").\n- [potion of gain level](/wiki/Potion_of_gain_level \"Potion of gain level\") – Wishing for 2 or 3 potions of gain level (in the early game) will allow you to [upgrade](/wiki/Upgrading_objects \"Upgrading objects\") mundane objects and obtain multiple [ascension kit](/wiki/Ascension_kit \"Ascension kit\") items with a single wish (such as a [helm of brilliance](/wiki/Helm_of_brilliance \"Helm of brilliance\"), [helm of telepathy](/wiki/Helm_of_telepathy \"Helm of telepathy\"), [cloak of magic resistance](/wiki/Cloak_of_magic_resistance \"Cloak of magic resistance\"), [magic whistle](/wiki/Magic_whistle \"Magic whistle\"), or [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\"), among others)\n- [ring of polymorph control](/wiki/Ring_of_polymorph_control \"Ring of polymorph control\") – Already a wish target in vanilla, this becomes even more important in SLASH'EM and can be used to transform into a very powerful [crystal golem](/wiki/Crystal_golem \"Crystal golem\") or the nigh-invincible [giant shoggoth](/wiki/Giant_shoggoth \"Giant shoggoth\") in conjunction with a [wand of polymorph](/wiki/Wand_of_polymorph \"Wand of polymorph\"), [ring of polymorph](/wiki/Ring_of_polymorph \"Ring of polymorph\"), [polymorph trap](/wiki/Polymorph_trap \"Polymorph trap\"), [sink](/wiki/Sink \"Sink\"), [chameleon](/wiki/Chameleon \"Chameleon\") corpse, or [genetic engineer](/wiki/Genetic_engineer \"Genetic engineer\").\n- [robe of power](/wiki/Robe_of_power \"Robe of power\") – Provides the spellcasting bonus of a [robe](/wiki/Robe \"Robe\") in vanilla. It is most useful for [Monks](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\").\n- [scroll of genocide](/wiki/Scroll_of_genocide \"Scroll of genocide\") – If you haven't found a scroll of genocide yet and have some identified gems, it's well worth a wish for a cursed scroll of genocide to reverse-genocide [gypsies](/wiki/Gypsy \"Gypsy\") for multiple wishes (though to do this safely, [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\") is required). After you've identified the scroll, you're better off going for a [magic marker](/wiki/Magic_marker \"Magic marker\") to write it yourself.\n\nIn general, SLASH'EM has an abundance of items compared to vanilla, given all the extra dungeon branches, not to mention the [black market](/wiki/Black_market_\\(SLASH%27EM\\) \"Black market (SLASH'EM)\"). If you happen to find an early [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\") or a mid-game [magic lamp](/wiki/Magic_lamp \"Magic lamp\"), you may want to hold off on using the last wish or two until you have cleared out some of these areas. Additionally, some items which would be wish targets in vanilla can be created by the process of [upgrading](/wiki/Upgrading_objects \"Upgrading objects\") common items in SLASH'EM, including:\n\n- [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\") (from [oilskin sack](/wiki/Oilskin_sack \"Oilskin sack\"), 100% chance, or [sack](/wiki/Sack \"Sack\"), 20% chance)\n- [cloak of magic resistance](/wiki/Cloak_of_magic_resistance \"Cloak of magic resistance\") (from an [elven cloak](/wiki/Elven_cloak \"Elven cloak\") or [oilskin cloak](/wiki/Oilskin_cloak \"Oilskin cloak\"), 25% chance)\n- [gauntlets of dexterity](/wiki/Gauntlets_of_dexterity \"Gauntlets of dexterity\") (from [leather gloves](/wiki/Leather_gloves \"Leather gloves\"), 50% chance)\n- [helm of brilliance](/wiki/Helm_of_brilliance \"Helm of brilliance\") (from a [dwarvish iron helm](/wiki/Dwarvish_iron_helm \"Dwarvish iron helm\"), 50% chance)\n- [helm of telepathy](/wiki/Helm_of_telepathy \"Helm of telepathy\") (from a [dwarvish iron helm](/wiki/Dwarvish_iron_helm \"Dwarvish iron helm\"), 50% chance)\n- [magic whistle](/wiki/Magic_whistle \"Magic whistle\") (from a [tin whistle](/wiki/Tin_whistle \"Tin whistle\"), 100% chance)\n- [saddle](/wiki/Saddle \"Saddle\") (from [leash](/wiki/Leash \"Leash\"), 100% chance)\n- [tinning kit](/wiki/Tinning_kit \"Tinning kit\") (from [tin opener](/wiki/Tin_opener \"Tin opener\"), 100% chance)\n\nOther upgradable objects whose base items are rare enough that they may still be worth wishing for include:\n\n- [fire horn](/wiki/Fire_horn \"Fire horn\") (from a [tooled horn](/wiki/Tooled_horn \"Tooled horn\"), 33% chance)\n- [frost horn](/wiki/Frost_horn \"Frost horn\") (from a [tooled horn](/wiki/Tooled_horn \"Tooled horn\"), 33% chance)\n- [magic flute](/wiki/Magic_flute \"Magic flute\") (from a [wooden flute](/wiki/Wooden_flute \"Wooden flute\"), 100% chance)\n- [magic marker](/wiki/Magic_marker \"Magic marker\") (from a [crystal ball](/wiki/Crystal_ball \"Crystal ball\"), 100% chance)\n- [magic harp](/wiki/Magic_harp \"Magic harp\") (from a [wooden harp](/wiki/Wooden_harp \"Wooden harp\"), 100% chance)\n- [horn of plenty](/wiki/Horn_of_plenty \"Horn of plenty\") (from a [tooled horn](/wiki/Tooled_horn \"Tooled horn\"), 33% chance)\n\nSome artifacts which are common wish targets in vanilla may be less useful in SLASH'EM:\n\n- [The Master Key of Thievery](/wiki/The_Master_Key_of_Thievery \"The Master Key of Thievery\")'s [half physical damage](/wiki/Half_physical_damage \"Half physical damage\") is superseded by [the Hand of Vecna](/wiki/The_Hand_of_Vecna_\\(SLASH%27EM\\) \"The Hand of Vecna (SLASH'EM)\"), which is available to all players; a better chaotic artifact wish may be [the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa](/wiki/The_Great_Dagger_of_Glaurgnaa \"The Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa\"). Even better yet is the [bat from hell](/wiki/Bat_from_hell \"Bat from hell\").\n- [The Orb of Fate](/wiki/The_Orb_of_Fate \"The Orb of Fate\")'s [half physical damage](/wiki/Half_physical_damage \"Half physical damage\") is also superseded by the Hand of Vecna; it is still useful for [half spell damage](/wiki/Half_spell_damage \"Half spell damage\") and [warning](/wiki/Warning \"Warning\") to a lesser extent.\n- [The Sceptre of Might](/wiki/The_Sceptre_of_Might \"The Sceptre of Might\") does +5 damage instead of double damage, though [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\") and toggle-able [conflict](/wiki/Conflict \"Conflict\") are still valuable.\n\nAdditionally, you cannot obtain any of the six [alignment quest](/wiki/Alignment_quest \"Alignment quest\") artifacts via wishing: The Hand of Vecna, [The Eye of the Beholder](/wiki/The_Eye_of_the_Beholder \"The Eye of the Beholder\"), [Nighthorn](/wiki/Nighthorn \"Nighthorn\"), and the three [alignment keys](/wiki/Alignment_key \"Alignment key\").\n\nFinally, [polypiling](/wiki/Polypiling \"Polypiling\") is tougher in SLASH'EM because you need to dip an item in a [potion of restore ability](/wiki/Potion_of_restore_ability \"Potion of restore ability\") to make the change permanent; while this may not matter for items that can be used immediately such as potions, scrolls, and spellbooks, it has implications when polypiling for equipment like [rings](/wiki/Ring \"Ring\") or [amulets](/wiki/Amulet \"Amulet\").\n\n### UnNetHack\n\nIn [UnNetHack](/wiki/UnNetHack \"UnNetHack\"), wands of wishing are [generated recharged once](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing#UnNetHack \"Wand of wishing\") and therefore cannot be recharged. Thus, you may not want to use your first wish on [scrolls of charging](/wiki/Scroll_of_charging \"Scroll of charging\") like in *NetHack*.\n\nOnly wishes from a wand can grant wishes for [magical items](/wiki/Magical_item \"Magical item\") or [artifacts](/wiki/Artifact \"Artifact\"). All other sources can only wish for non-magical items (with the message \"I'm sorry but I'm not able to provide you with magical items\" occurring if you try); shields of reflection are now non-magical), and thrones do not give wishes at all. Any wish is allowed to specify modifiers like \"blessed\" and \"+2\".\n\n[Magic lamps](/wiki/Magic_lamp \"Magic lamp\") can now be wished for, since wishes from them can only grant non-magical items. Projectiles can be wished for in quantities up to 100. (Daggers are *not* considered projectiles.)\n\nSince UnNetHack 5.1, wishing no longer increments prayer timeout. Since UnNetHack 6, the chance of receiving an artifact is not depending on the number of artifacts that have already been generated.\n\n[Chromatic dragon scales and scale mail](/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail#UnNetHack \"Dragon scale mail\") and [Thiefbane](/wiki/Thiefbane \"Thiefbane\") cannot be wished for; unidentified [dragon scale mail](/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail \"Dragon scale mail\") is replaced by a random one. Since UnNetHack 5.1, wishing for chromatic dragon eggs is no longer possible. Wishing for statues or figurines of chromatic dragons no longer work since UnNetHack 5.2.0. See [Chromatic dragon (UnNetHack)](/wiki/Chromatic_dragon_\\(UnNetHack\\) \"Chromatic dragon (UnNetHack)\") for details.\n\nWishing for \"reflecting/magic dragon scales (not mail)\" is allowed only if you have identified it; alternatively, wishing for \"guivre scales\" or \"leviathan scales\" is fine, but you will need to observe these dragons in combat to know which property is held by which race. If you find a wand of wishing before meeting a dragon, and would like dragon scale mail, wish for glowing dragon scale mail, as at the very least you end up with a permanent light source and could end up with (one in five chance of) reflection or [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\"). See [Dragon § UnNetHack](/wiki/Dragon#UnNetHack \"Dragon\") for changes to dragons in particular.\n\nGood non-magical items include:\n\n- [shield of reflection](/wiki/Shield_of_reflection \"Shield of reflection\")\n- [stethoscope](/wiki/Stethoscope \"Stethoscope\")\n- [athame](/wiki/Athame \"Athame\")\n- [can of grease](/wiki/Can_of_grease \"Can of grease\")\n- [tinning kit](/wiki/Tinning_kit \"Tinning kit\")\n- [oilskin sack](/wiki/Oilskin_sack \"Oilskin sack\")\n- 5000 [gold pieces](/wiki/Gold_piece \"Gold piece\")\n- [chickatrice](/wiki/Chickatrice \"Chickatrice\") corpse\n- [leather drum](/wiki/Leather_drum \"Leather drum\")\n- [tins of spinach](/wiki/Tin_of_spinach \"Tin of spinach\")\n- [silver saber](/wiki/Silver_saber \"Silver saber\")\n- [silver spear](/wiki/Silver_spear \"Silver spear\")\n- 100 [silver arrows](/wiki/Silver_arrow \"Silver arrow\")\n- [t-shirt](/wiki/T-shirt \"T-shirt\")\n- [oilskin cloak](/wiki/Oilskin_cloak \"Oilskin cloak\")\n- 3 [dragon](/wiki/Dragon \"Dragon\") eggs\n- [crystal pick](/wiki/Crystal_pick \"Crystal pick\")\n\n### GruntHack\n\n[GruntHack](/wiki/GruntHack \"GruntHack\") allows wishes for objects with compatible [materials](/wiki/Object_materials_\\(GruntHack\\) \"Object materials (GruntHack)\") and [properties](/wiki/Object_properties \"Object properties\"), including magical items, making wishes in general much more powerful. A few recommended wishes are listed below:\n\n- blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide cloak of magic resistance and reflection\n- blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide water walking boots of speed\n- blessed greased fixed +3 yellow dragon scale mail of drain resistance\n- blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide gauntlets of dexterity and power\n\n#### Monster wishes\n\nGruntHack also allows monsters to wish for items via a smoky potion or a wand of wishing - monsters will never use magic lamps. Monsters will wish for a [scroll of charging](/wiki/Scroll_of_charging \"Scroll of charging\") if they have a non-recharged wand of wishing, and will otherwise randomly wish for one of the following items:\n\n- blessed greased fixed +3 silver dragon scale mail\n- blessed greased fixed +3 gray dragon scale mail\n- blessed greased fixed +3 cloak of magic resistance\n- blessed greased fixed amulet of reflection\n- blessed greased fixed shield of reflection\n- blessed greased fixed +3 speed boots\n- blessed greased fixed +3 gauntlets of power\n- blessed greased fixed amulet of life saving\n- blessed greased fixed wand of death\n- blessed greased fixed partly eaten chickatrice corpse\n\nMonsters will not wish for items that grant properties they already have, e.g., a [strong](/wiki/Strong \"Strong\") monster will never wish for gauntlets of power, and an [Angel](/wiki/Angel \"Angel\") will never wish for a cloak of magic resistance. Additionally, they will never wish for things they cannot use - monsters that are too big for torso armor will not wish for cloaks or armor, and monsters who lack gloves and [stoning resistance](/wiki/Stoning_resistance \"Stoning resistance\") will never wish for a chickatrice corpse. If chickatrices are genocided, monsters will wish for a cockatrice corpse; if cockatrices are also genocided, they will try to wish for the corpse anyway and receive a random corpse.\n\n### xNetHack\n\nIn [xNetHack](/wiki/XNetHack \"XNetHack\"), wands of wishing always explode when recharged and will turn to dust when they reach 0 charges. xNetHack also allows you to wish for magic lamps, but unlike [UnNetHack](/wiki/UnNetHack \"UnNetHack\"), wishes from djinn are not restricted to non-magical items. Since you cannot get more than one wish from a magic lamp, the main use of this is for a permanent light source.\n\nThe probability of successfully wishing for an artifact is changed to 1*n* + 1, where *n* is the number of artifacts you have received by wishing. Artifacts generated in any other way are *not* taken into account. This means the first artifact wish is guaranteed, and subsequent ones have probabilities of 1⁄2, 1⁄3, 1⁄4, etc.\n\nAlthough xNetHack implements [object materials](/wiki/Object_materials_\\(xNetHack\\) \"Object materials (xNetHack)\"), the material of a wished-for item cannot be specified outside of [wizard mode](/wiki/Wizard_mode \"Wizard mode\"). An item received by wishing always has its base material.\n\n### dNetHack\n\nIn [dNetHack](/wiki/DNetHack \"DNetHack\"), wands of wishing have been removed and replaced with rings of wishing and [candles of invocation](/wiki/Candle_of_invocation \"Candle of invocation\"). A candle of invocation can be used once to summon either a djinn, pet, or demon and then is consumed; summoning a djinn grants one wish.\n\nRings of wishing can be used several times and must be worn and invoked to make a wish. A ring of wishing replaces the wand of wishing in the chest in the Castle.\n\nWishing for artifacts have been significantly reworked as well. Rather than counting the number of artifacts that already exist, the player starts with one artifact wish available and gains the ability to wish for another artifact based on two events:\n\n- Sitting on the [throne](/wiki/Throne \"Throne\") inside the [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\")\n- Giving an artifact to each of the five [priests of an unknown god](/wiki/Priest_of_an_unknown_god \"Priest of an unknown god\")\n\nEach event allows the player to wish for one more artifact. Gifts or named artifacts have no direct effects on your artifact wish abilities.\n\nWhile there are [many additional artifacts in dNetHack](/wiki/DNetHack_artifacts \"DNetHack artifacts\"), many of them are unwishable, including quest artifacts. However, there are several good candidates for wishing that should be considered:\n\n- [Aegis](/wiki/DNetHack_artifacts#Aegis \"DNetHack artifacts\"), which grants reflection and half physical damage and can be invoked downward for an instant triple Gorgoneia ward\n- The [Lance of Longinus](/wiki/DNetHack_artifacts#Lance_of_Longinus \"DNetHack artifacts\"), which when wielded, conveys half physical and spell damage, magic resistance, and reflection (though you could be in extreme peril if you lose the weapon or get disarmed)\n- The [Premium Heart](/wiki/DNetHack_artifacts#Premium_Heart \"DNetHack artifacts\"), gauntlets of power that also improve dexterity, provide double damage, and have increased damage multipliers for various status ailments\n\n### FIQHack\n\nIn [FIQHack](/wiki/FIQHack \"FIQHack\") you can wish for a magic lamp (and receive it).\n\n### EvilHack\n\n[EvilHack](/wiki/EvilHack \"EvilHack\") also allows wishes for objects with specific [materials](/wiki/EvilHack#Object_materials \"EvilHack\") and [properties](/wiki/EvilHack#Object_properties \"EvilHack\") similar to GruntHack, with several changes and refinements to wishing in general.\n\n#### Object materials and properties\n\nWishes for objects that are inherently magical will not apply additional object properties, though magical items can very rarely generate with them; wishing for a \"magical \\<magical armor>\" (e.g. \"magical dragonhide speed boots\") has a 1⁄10 chance of giving the resulting armor a random (possibly negative) object property. Wished items also cannot have more than one object property - however, there is a 1⁄100,000 chance of an eligible item randomly generating with two properties. Artifacts have fixed object materials, and cannot be wished for with other materials or object properties.\n\n#### Wish sources\n\nWishes from thrones are much more rare: there is close to a 3⁄200 chance (1.5%) of getting a wish from sitting on a throne, and the throne is guaranteed to disappear if the player is granted a wish.\n\nWands of wishing are much rarer to find via random generation, and will always generated as charged once (1:x). The Castle's guaranteed wand is always created as having never been charged (0:x).\n\n#### Artifact wishes\n\nSpecial rules are applied when wishing for artifacts: the odds of an artifact wish succeeding are 1⁄X + 1, where *X* is the number of previous artifact wishes made. However, if you would successfully receive the artifact, there is a chance that the artifact will instead be generated in the possession of its hostile 'owner', who is placed next to you. The odds that a wished artifact will not come with its owner is also 1⁄X + 1, where *X* is the number of previous artifact wishes made.\n\nThe owner of an artifact depends on the specific artifact that was wished for:\n\n- [Quest artifacts](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\") will almost always generate the quest leader associated with it - the sole exception is a [Tourist](/wiki/Tourist \"Tourist\") wishing for the Master Key of Thievery: as the [Master of Thieves](/wiki/Master_of_Thieves \"Master of Thieves\") is their nemesis, this wish will generate a [rogue](/wiki/Rogue_\\(player_monster\\) \"Rogue (player monster)\") [player monster](/wiki/Player_monster \"Player monster\") instead.\n- For other artifacts, those that have a specific role associated with them will generate a player monster of that role with the artifact. Artifacts that do not have a specific role associated with them will still generate a player monster of a specific role, with that role depending on your own alignment in certain cases.\n\nIn addition, the following artifacts cannot be generated by wishing, with the reason given for each:\n\n- [Lifestealer](/wiki/Lifestealer \"Lifestealer\"), always generated in the possession of [Vlad the Impaler](/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler \"Vlad the Impaler\")\n- The [Magic 8-Ball](/wiki/Magic_8-Ball \"Magic 8-Ball\"), always generated in the possession of [the Oracle](/wiki/Oracle_\\(monster\\) \"Oracle (monster)\")\n- [The Sword of Kas](/wiki/The_Sword_of_Kas \"The Sword of Kas\"), always generated in the possession of [Kas](/wiki/Kas \"Kas\")\n- The [Bag of the Hesperides](/wiki/Bag_of_the_Hesperides \"Bag of the Hesperides\"), always generated in the [Ice Queen's Realm](/wiki/Ice_Queen%27s_Realm \"Ice Queen's Realm\")\n- [Butcher](/wiki/Butcher \"Butcher\"), always generated in the possession of [Yeenoghu](/wiki/Yeenoghu \"Yeenoghu\")\n- [The Eye of Vecna](/wiki/The_Eye_of_Vecna \"The Eye of Vecna\") and [the Hand of Vecna](/wiki/The_Hand_of_Vecna_\\(EvilHack\\) \"The Hand of Vecna (EvilHack)\"), either of which is generated upon defeating [Vecna](/wiki/Vecna \"Vecna\") without disintegrating him, digesting him or stoning him\n- [The Wand of Orcus](/wiki/The_Wand_of_Orcus \"The Wand of Orcus\"), always generated in the possession of [Orcus](/wiki/Orcus \"Orcus\")\n- [The One Ring](/wiki/The_One_Ring \"The One Ring\"), always generated in [Gollum](/wiki/Gollum \"Gollum\")'s cave within [Goblin Town](/wiki/Goblin_Town \"Goblin Town\")\n- All [forge-made](/wiki/Forge_\\(dungeon_feature\\)#Artifacts \"Forge (dungeon feature)\") artifacts\n\n#### Wish strategy\n\n[Hardfought](/wiki/Hardfought \"Hardfought\") has [a wish tracker](https://www.hardfought.org/xlogfiles/evilhack/wishtracker) for EvilHack that keeps a list of wishes made by players on the server. The recommendations listed below are based on some of the recorded wishes.\n\nWorthwhile wishes for EvilHack characters include:\n\n- **blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide Hawaiian shirt/T-shirt of decay** - The shirt slot's armor is great for providing additional AC and properties to non-giant characters, and drain resistance is among the most valuable properties.\n- blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide speed boots\n- **blessed greased fixed +3 bone gauntlets of power** - This wish is common for illithid characters, who have incredibly low caps to [strength](/wiki/Strength \"Strength\") and [constitution](/wiki/Constitution \"Constitution\"), and bone is among the lightest possible materials for the gauntlets. Depending on personal preferences, stone may be a preferable material: it is much heavier compared to the base material of iron, but provides more base AC.\n- **uncursed magic marker** - Magic markers are as valuable as ever, and are made more so by the fact that they do not generate randomly, with a scant few levels where a marker may generate.\n- **Magic lamps** - magic lamps are a common choice of light source, and cursed magic lamps instead emit an aura of darkness in the same radius that overrides any light source. Magic lamps will keep working while the character is underwater or engulfed.\n\n#### Monster wishes\n\nEvilHack allows monsters to wish for items via a smoky potion or a wand of wishing. Additionally, if a player generates a hostile djinni from a lamp or potion, the djinni may choose to keep the wish for themselves. Monsters will not wish for items that grant properties they already have, and will never wish for things they cannot use. Monsters that have an empty wand of wishing and come across a scroll of charging will use that scroll on the wand.\n\nMonsters will randomly wish for one of the following items, with alternate wishes depending on whether or not the monster can use the original item rolled:\n\n- 1-3 blessed potions of gain level\n- A figurine of an Archon, balrog, vorpal jabberwock, or woodchuck, with an equal probability of each\n- blessed erodeproofed amulet of life saving\n- blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 cloak of displacement, or a wand of digging otherwise\n- blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 gauntlets of dexterity, or a blessed potion of full healing otherwise\n- blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 cloak of magic resistance, or a blessed erodeproofed wand of create monster otherwise\n- blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 crystal plate mail, or a blessed erodeproofed bag of holding otherwise\n- blessed erodeproofed amulet of flying, or a blessed potion of full healing otherwise\n- blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 water walking boots, or a blessed erodeproofed ring of slow digestion otherwise\n- blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 shield of reflection if humanoid, blessed erodeproofed amulet of reflection if non-humanoid, or a blessed potion of extra healing otherwise\n- blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 gauntlets of power, or a cursed potion of gain level otherwise\n- blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 speed boots, or a blessed potion of full healing otherwise\n- blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 helm of telepathy, or a blessed potion of extra healing otherwise\n- blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 helm of brilliance, or a blessed blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 unicorn horn otherwise\n- blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 cloak of protection, or a blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 ring of protection otherwise\n- a blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 random artifact that matches the monster's alignment - this wish can fail if it selects an artifact that is already generated\n- one of a wand of cancellation, a wand of polymorph or a wand of death, blessed and erodeproofed with an equal probability of each\n- 1-3 cockatrice eggs\n- cursed potion of gain level\n\n## External links\n\n- The [NetHack Wishing Spoiler](http://nh.gmuf.com/wish.html) by Peter Snelling, Stanislav Traykov, and others provides a detailed analysis of how to wish effectively, including a list of specific wishes ordered by priority.\n- In the [Dudley's dungeon](/wiki/Dudley%27s_dungeon \"Dudley's dungeon\") of [19 August 2005](http://www.nicolaas.net/dudley/index.php?f=20050819), Dudley wishes for a \"blessed greased fixed erodeproof disenchanterproof demonpossessionproof vacuumofdeepspaceproof proofremovalproof fully insured 100% all-natural materials completely and utterly intact, undamaged and structurally sound freshly washed and free of the stench of congealed human blood totally bereft of ancient unbreakable curses and absolutely NOT stolen from any nearby easily-angered shopkeepers +3 armor enhancement GRAY DRAGON SCALE MAIL\". The djinni granting the wish then gives Dudley the armor with all the specified requirements—but the armor is size XXXS (extra extra extra small).\n\n## References\n\n1.

[↑](#cite_ref-13) Strictly speaking, this is a somewhat self-defeating argument: we say that +2 is better despite a lower average enchantment, and then we \"prove\" it with another average enchantment figure. A more accurate metric would be the average number of scrolls it takes to raise the item to +5 (for most armor) or +7 (for elven armor and weapons). Wishing for +2 as opposed to +3 does save \\~0.030 and \\~0.019 scrolls in the +5 and +7 cases, respectively, but this data may be a bit too in-depth for the article.\n14.

Cursed wands can explode when zapped (1% chance), but not when engraved with. A newly generated <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_wishing\" title=\"Wand of wishing\">wand of wishing</a> has 1&#8211;3 charges before recharge, 3 more charges after recharge with a <a href=\"/wiki/Blessed\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Blessed\">blessed</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_charging\" title=\"Scroll of charging\">scroll of charging</a>, and then you can <a href=\"/wiki/Wrest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wrest\">wrest</a> one last wish.

For a blessed magic lamp, you have an 80% chance of obtaining a wish (20% for an uncursed lamp, 5% for a cursed lamp). The worst outcome is a djinni which attacks you instead of granting a wish (5% chance for a blessed magic lamp). After a djinni appears, the magic lamp becomes an oil lamp. Therefore, a blessed magic lamp grants 0.8 wishes on average.

(If you're intending to immediately enchant the item further, however, +2 is strictly better because a blessed scroll is more efficient on a +2 item than on a +3; after using a single blessed scroll on the newly created item, the average enchantment is 3.6 for the +2 case versus only 3.5 for +3.)<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> +4 and +5 have lower averages than +3 <i>and</i> are more risky as well, so those are usually not used. +1 is certain to work, but its average enchantment is much lower than that of +2 or +3, so it's usually not a good choice unless you are <a href=\"/wiki/Illiterate\" title=\"Illiterate\">illiterate</a> and unable to enchant items yourself. The other possible enchantments are obviously not ever very useful, unless you actually want nonpositive enchantment for some bizarre reason.\n</p><p>When wishing for wands or chargeable tools, an enchantment written as \"+x\" will be interpreted as a wish for x charges. Conversely, a wish for a \"dagger (y:x)\" is a wish for a +x dagger (the first number has no effect).

Here we give some general advice for early and late game situations. This advice is only a guideline and does not apply to all situations. In some cases, if you already have everything you need, the best thing to do with a wand of wishing or magic lamp is to save it for later. Experienced players are able to weigh the value of an unused available wish and compare it to the benefit that would be provided by the most valuable item in the game in that situation. For inexperienced players, there is no substitute for experience&#8212;play and learn!\n</p><p>The following general principles apply in almost all situations:\n</p>\n<ul><li>If you encounter a wand of wishing, and you can't <a href=\"/wiki/Identify\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Identify\">identify</a> how many charges it has, then your first wish should be either 2 (or 3) \"blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_charging\" title=\"Scroll of charging\">scrolls of charging</a>\", or an \"uncursed <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_marker\" title=\"Magic marker\">magic marker</a>\", so you can write your own blessed(!) scrolls to recharge the wand.\n<ul><li>Writing your own scrolls will only work reliably if you have already identified scrolls of charging, you have found and named (or identified) all four kinds of 300zm scrolls, or you are a <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard\" title=\"Wizard\">wizard</a>; however, if you are willing to save some of your wishes for later, i.e. until after you have identified scrolls of charging, a magic marker is an overall more useful item (it can yield three scrolls of charging and still have enough ink to write several scrolls).</li>\n<li>Wands of wishing from bones levels might already have been recharged once.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>The rest of this discussion assumes that you have a way to recharge your wand, if the wish is from a wand of wishing.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_single_wishes\">Early single wishes</span></h4>\n<p>The most common source of early wishes is a <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_lamp\" title=\"Magic lamp\">magic lamp</a> (if you disregard slightly suicidal early level fountain quaffers). As a rule, the best item to wish for early in the game is either gray or silver <a href=\"/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail\" title=\"Dragon scale mail\">dragon scale mail</a>, unless you are playing a <a href=\"/wiki/Monk\" title=\"Monk\">Monk</a>:\n</p>\n<ul><li>\"blessed greased +2 <a href=\"/wiki/Gray_dragon_scale_mail\" title=\"Gray dragon scale mail\">gray dragon scale mail</a>\" (or +3) provides <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a>, and</li>\n<li>\"blessed greased +2 <a href=\"/wiki/Silver_dragon_scale_mail\" title=\"Silver dragon scale mail\">silver dragon scale mail</a>\" (or +3) provides <a href=\"/wiki/Reflection\" title=\"Reflection\">reflection</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>Which one you should wish for is somewhat situational; if you already have one extrinsic, you should wish for the DSM which provides the other. For example, a <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard\" title=\"Wizard\">Wizard</a> starts with a <a href=\"/wiki/Cloak_of_magic_resistance\" title=\"Cloak of magic resistance\">cloak of magic resistance</a>, and would prefer SDSM. A character who gets the <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_reflection\" title=\"Amulet of reflection\">amulet of reflection</a> from <a href=\"/wiki/Sokoban\" title=\"Sokoban\">Sokoban</a>, on the other hand, would be better served by GDSM. If you have neither magic resistance nor reflection, the choice is somewhat more difficult; see <a href=\"/wiki/GDSM_versus_SDSM\" title=\"GDSM versus SDSM\">GDSM versus SDSM</a> for a more detailed discussion of the merits of each.\n</p><p>For a <a href=\"/wiki/Monk\" title=\"Monk\">Monk</a>, the choice is drastically different, due to the large penalty for wearing body armor, which is especially problematic early in the game. Another class's quest artifact is a good choice for a <a href=\"/wiki/Lawful\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lawful\">lawful</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Neutral\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Neutral\">neutral</a> Monk (see <a href=\"#Quest_artifacts\">§&#160;Quest artifacts</a> below). However, due to the absence of <a href=\"/wiki/Chaotic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chaotic\">chaotic</a> quest artifacts that provide magic resistance, a chaotic Monk needing magic resistance should wish for a \"blessed greased fireproof +2 <a href=\"/wiki/Cloak_of_magic_resistance\" title=\"Cloak of magic resistance\">cloak of magic resistance</a>\" (or +3). Alternatively, when magic resistance is not the highest priority, common and useful single wishes include <a href=\"/wiki/Speed_boots\" title=\"Speed boots\">speed boots</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Gauntlets_of_power\" title=\"Gauntlets of power\">gauntlets of power</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/The_Master_Key_of_Thievery\" title=\"The Master Key of Thievery\">The Master Key of Thievery</a> is another option for a chaotic Monk due to the extremely useful <a href=\"/wiki/Half_physical_damage\" title=\"Half physical damage\">half physical damage</a> property, but be wary of its <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact_blast\" title=\"Artifact blast\">artifact blast</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_wands_of_wishing\">Early wands of wishing</span></h4>\n<p>A somewhat rarer source of wishes early in the game is a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_wishing\" title=\"Wand of wishing\">wand of wishing</a>. With a wand of wishing, you will usually want to wish for some or all of the following items, depending on what you already have: <a href=\"/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail\" title=\"Dragon scale mail\">dragon scale mail</a> (gray or silver), <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving\" title=\"Amulet of life saving\">amulet of life saving</a>, some <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact_weapon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Artifact weapon\">artifact weapon</a> (unless you're planning to sacrifice for one), a <a href=\"/wiki/Bag_of_holding\" title=\"Bag of holding\">bag of holding</a> (if <a href=\"/wiki/Sokoban\" title=\"Sokoban\">Sokoban</a> doesn't provide one), and <a href=\"/wiki/Speed_boots\" title=\"Speed boots\">speed boots</a>. All of the above should be blessed, and weapon and speed boots should be also fireproof. Some players wish for 2 blessed scrolls of charging, or a blessed magic marker, in order to access all the wishes immediately. You may also consider wishing for a quest artifact (see <a href=\"#Quest_artifacts\">§&#160;Quest artifacts</a>), but its <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact_blast\" title=\"Artifact blast\">artifact blast</a> might kill you.\n</p><p>If you encounter a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_wishing\" title=\"Wand of wishing\">wand of wishing</a> in a shop, it is easy to <a href=\"/wiki/Price_identification\" title=\"Price identification\">price identify</a> because its base cost is 500, shared only with the <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_death\" title=\"Wand of death\">wand of death</a>. If you have a pet with you, <a href=\"/wiki/Stealing_from_shops\" title=\"Stealing from shops\">stealing</a> the wand is easy enough. Those who were already planning to use a powerful pet (e.g. <a href=\"/wiki/Pacifist\" title=\"Pacifist\">pacifists</a>) might wish for a blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Figurine\" title=\"Figurine\">figurine</a> of an <a href=\"/wiki/Archon\" title=\"Archon\">Archon</a>; this carries a 10% chance of backfiring, and a 10% chance of being wasted. Do not wish for a pet unless you are prepared to <a href=\"/wiki/Pet#Protect_your_pet\" title=\"Pet\">take care of it</a>. Failing this, it is best to simply find 500zm worth of junk to sell to the shopkeeper and then buy the wand. If you're really not sure of your character's ability to survive long enough to do that, it's also possible to simply wish for 5000 <a href=\"/wiki/Zorkmid\" title=\"Zorkmid\">zorkmids</a>, use some of them to pay the shopkeeper for the wand, and leave with a healthy monetary profit (and more to the point, a wand of wishing with only one charge spent). This is probably the lowest-risk strategy, but the potential rewards are lower too as gold is typically a waste of a wish. A more ostensibly \"profitable\" method is to wish for a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_death\" title=\"Wand of death\">wand of death</a> and use it to kill the shopkeeper, though that entails the penalty for <a href=\"/wiki/Murder\" title=\"Murder\">murder</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Late_game_wishes\">Late game wishes</span></h4>\n<p>In the later stages of the game, wishes typically serve the role of completing an <a href=\"/wiki/Ascension_kit\" title=\"Ascension kit\">ascension kit</a>.\n</p><p>If you need lots of items to complete your ascension kit, consider wishing for a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_polymorph\" title=\"Wand of polymorph\">wand of polymorph</a>. This wand is a very powerful item for players who are not averse to <a href=\"/wiki/Polypiling\" title=\"Polypiling\">polypiling</a>. In most cases, it is far more efficient to polypile for ascension kit items and then wish for the few remaining missing pieces, rather than wishing directly for all the items from the start.\n</p><p>An uncursed <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_marker\" title=\"Magic marker\">magic marker</a> can be used to write cursed <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_genocide\" title=\"Scroll of genocide\">scrolls of genocide</a>, which when read will summon a monster of your choice. This technique is often more efficient than wishing directly for monster-derived items, since a single uncursed magic marker (which takes one wish) can usually write at least four scrolls of genocide with recharging. For example, if your character is reasonably strong, you can obtain dragon scale mail by <a href=\"/wiki/Reverse_genocide\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Reverse genocide\">reverse genociding</a> dragons instead of wishing directly for dragon scale mail. As another example, if you need a <a href=\"/wiki/Cockatrice\" title=\"Cockatrice\">cockatrice</a> corpse, it may be more efficient to reverse genocide cockatrices than to wish for a corpse directly. \n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Quest_artifacts\">Quest artifacts</span></h4>\n<dl><dd><i>See <a href=\"#Artifact_wishing\">§&#160;Artifact wishing</a> for general information about artifact wishing.</i></dd></dl>\n<p>Generally speaking you should <i>not</i> wish for cross-aligned quest artifacts. They will “evade your grasp” and fall to the floor, and you will be unable to pick them up. Early-game characters should also avoid wishing even for coaligned quest artifacts, unless they have enough current <a href=\"/wiki/HP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HP\">HP</a> to survive the inevitable <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact_blast\" title=\"Artifact blast\">artifact blast</a>. It is technically possible to carry multiple artifacts of different alignments through careful use of alignment conversion or a <a href=\"/wiki/Helm_of_opposite_alignment\" title=\"Helm of opposite alignment\">helm of opposite alignment</a>, but this tactic is rarely employed. A helm of opposite alignment also cannot cause chaotic or lawful characters to become neutral, so the only way for such characters to use wished-for neutral artifacts is to permanently convert themselves at an <a href=\"/wiki/Altar\" title=\"Altar\">altar</a>.\n</p><p>As detailed above, you cannot get your own <a href=\"/wiki/Quest_artifact\" title=\"Quest artifact\">quest artifact</a> from wishes.\n</p>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lawful\">Lawful</span></h5>\n<p>For lawful characters, the main contenders are <a href=\"/wiki/The_Sceptre_of_Might\" title=\"The Sceptre of Might\">the Sceptre of Might</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/The_Orb_of_Detection\" title=\"The Orb of Detection\">the Orb of Detection</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/The_Magic_Mirror_of_Merlin\" title=\"The Magic Mirror of Merlin\">the Magic Mirror of Merlin</a>, which all offer magic resistance. The Sceptre offers ring-less <a href=\"/wiki/Conflict\" title=\"Conflict\">conflict</a> and deals double damage against cross-aligned (non-lawful) monsters. The Mirror and the Orb both offer extrinsic telepathy; the Orb also offers <a href=\"/wiki/Half_spell_damage\" title=\"Half spell damage\">half spell damage</a> and functions as a <a href=\"/wiki/Crystal_ball\" title=\"Crystal ball\">crystal ball</a>, but is much heavier than the Sceptre or Mirror. If you already have magic resistance, <a href=\"/wiki/The_Mitre_of_Holiness\" title=\"The Mitre of Holiness\">the Mitre of Holiness</a> is worth considering for a spellcaster due to the energy boost it provides when invoked.\n</p>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Neutral\">Neutral</span></h5>\n<p>If you are a <a href=\"/wiki/Neutral\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Neutral\">neutral</a> character and want a quest artifact, there are at least four good choices:\n</p>\n<ul><li>\"blessed rustproof <a href=\"/wiki/Eye_of_the_Aethiopica\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eye of the Aethiopica\">Eye of the Aethiopica</a>\" (if you are <i>not</i> a <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard\" title=\"Wizard\">Wizard</a>) to obtain <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a>, fast <a href=\"/wiki/Power\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Power\">power</a> regeneration, <a href=\"/wiki/Telepathy\" title=\"Telepathy\">telepathy</a>, and to #invoke for <a href=\"/wiki/Branchport\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Branchport\">branchporting</a></li>\n<li>\"blessed fireproof <a href=\"/wiki/Platinum_Yendorian_Express_Card\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Platinum Yendorian Express Card\">Platinum Yendorian Express Card</a>\" (if you are <i>not</i> a <a href=\"/wiki/Tourist\" title=\"Tourist\">Tourist</a>) to obtain <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Telepathy\" title=\"Telepathy\">telepathy</a>, and to #invoke for non-blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Charging\" title=\"Charging\">charging</a></li>\n<li>\"blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Eyes_of_the_Overworld\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eyes of the Overworld\">Eyes of the Overworld</a>\" (if you are <i>not</i> a <a href=\"/wiki/Monk\" title=\"Monk\">Monk</a>) to obtain <a href=\"/wiki/Astral_vision\" title=\"Astral vision\">astral vision</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a>, and to #invoke for <a href=\"/wiki/Enlightenment\" title=\"Enlightenment\">enlightenment</a></li>\n<li>\"blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Orb_of_Fate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Orb of Fate\">Orb of Fate</a>\" (if you are <i>not</i> a <a href=\"/wiki/Valkyrie\" title=\"Valkyrie\">Valkyrie</a>) to obtain <a href=\"/wiki/Half_physical_damage\" title=\"Half physical damage\">half physical damage</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Half_spell_damage\" title=\"Half spell damage\">half spell damage</a>, and to #invoke to <a href=\"/wiki/Level_teleport\" title=\"Level teleport\">level teleport</a> (but you will need to obtain <a href=\"/wiki/Teleport_control\" title=\"Teleport control\">teleport control</a> separately)</li></ul>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/The_Eye_of_the_Aethiopica\" title=\"The Eye of the Aethiopica\">The Eye of the Aethiopica</a> is an especially valuable item for neutral <a href=\"/wiki/Monk\" title=\"Monk\">Monks</a>; due to armor <a href=\"/wiki/To-hit\" title=\"To-hit\">to-hit</a> penalty and weaponless <a href=\"/wiki/Martial_arts\" title=\"Martial arts\">martial arts</a>, they will most likely spend a wish on <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a>.

Obtain lots of uncursed water, name each one differently so they don't stack, and have nothing but the water and one of the scrolls in your inventory. Read the scroll while confused, un-name all the water, and #<a href=\"/wiki/Adjust\" title=\"Adjust\">adjust</a> them so they merge into three stacks. Figure out which is which by dipping a known-uncursed useless object (such as a rock) into them, checking for the cursed one with a pet, or <a href=\"/wiki/Price_identification\" title=\"Price identification\">price identification</a> to find the uncursed one. If you only have two stacks, figure out those two and repeat with the other scroll.\n<ul><li>For illiterate atheist players, this is a reasonable wish.

A common mid- to late-game technique for a character who has a significant number of identified gemstones is to <a href=\"/wiki/Reverse_genocide\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Reverse genocide\">reverse genocide</a> gypsies, which guarantees several wishes if the player has enough gems. Because this can be done repeatedly, it makes wishes less of a rarity than vanilla. By the time a SLASH'EM player reaches the castle, they rarely need the wand.\n</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Common_SLASH'EM_wishes\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Common_SLASH.27EM_wishes\">Common SLASH'EM wishes</span></h4>\n<p>SLASH'EM has many new artifacts and items which are well worth a wish.

it's also harder to get via sacrifice, since there are so many other artifacts to compete with.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Holy_Spear_of_Light\" title=\"Holy Spear of Light\">Holy Spear of Light</a> is a <a href=\"/wiki/Silver_spear\" title=\"Silver spear\">silver spear</a> which can be invoked for to fry all undead around the player for significant damage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Reaper\" title=\"Reaper\">Reaper</a> is a <a href=\"/wiki/Halberd\" title=\"Halberd\">halberd</a> which does +20 to damage, a great choice for <a href=\"/wiki/Riding\" title=\"Riding\">riding</a> characters such as <a href=\"/wiki/Knight\" title=\"Knight\">Knights</a>; as it is the second guaranteed sacrifice gift for <a href=\"/wiki/Yeoman\" title=\"Yeoman\">Yeomen</a>, it is probably not worth a wish for them.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/The_Stake_of_Van_Helsing\" title=\"The Stake of Van Helsing\">The Stake of Van Helsing</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Undead_Slayer\" title=\"Undead Slayer\">Undead Slayer</a> quest artifact, is a <a href=\"/wiki/Wooden_stake\" title=\"Wooden stake\">wooden stake</a> (dagger skill) that does a flat +12 to damage and provides magic resistance.</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Neutral</b>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Disrupter\" title=\"Disrupter\">Disrupter</a> is a mace which deals +30 to damage to <a href=\"/wiki/Undead\" title=\"Undead\">undead</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Mjollnir\" title=\"Mjollnir\">Mjollnir</a> is not new in SLASH'EM, but does vastly more damage (flat +24 to non-shock resistant monsters) and is the preferred neutral weapon for most fighting roles.</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Chaotic</b>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Bat_from_Hell\" title=\"Bat from Hell\">Bat from Hell</a> is the most coveted weapon in SLASH'EM, a <a href=\"/wiki/Baseball_bat\" title=\"Baseball bat\">baseball bat</a> (club skill) doing a flat +20 damage to all foes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Deep_Freeze\" title=\"Deep Freeze\">Deep Freeze</a> is an <a href=\"/wiki/Athame\" title=\"Athame\">athame</a> that provides cold resistance and does extra cold damage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Doomblade\" title=\"Doomblade\">Doomblade</a> is a <a href=\"/wiki/Short_sword\" title=\"Short sword\">short sword</a> which does +10 to damage with occasional bonus damage of 5d4;

A few recommended wishes are listed below:\n</p>\n<ul><li>blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide cloak of magic resistance and reflection</li>\n<li>blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide water walking boots of speed</li>\n<li>blessed greased fixed +3 yellow dragon scale mail of drain resistance</li>\n<li>blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide gauntlets of dexterity and power</li></ul>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Monster_wishes\">Monster wishes</span></h4>\n<p>GruntHack also allows monsters to wish for items via a smoky potion or a wand of wishing - monsters will never use magic lamps. Monsters will wish for a <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_charging\" title=\"Scroll of charging\">scroll of charging</a> if they have a non-recharged wand of wishing, and will otherwise randomly wish for one of the following items:\n</p>\n<ul><li>blessed greased fixed +3 silver dragon scale mail</li>\n<li>blessed greased fixed +3 gray dragon scale mail</li>\n<li>blessed greased fixed +3 cloak of magic resistance</li>\n<li>blessed greased fixed amulet of reflection</li>\n<li>blessed greased fixed shield of reflection</li>\n<li>blessed greased fixed +3 speed boots</li>\n<li>blessed greased fixed +3 gauntlets of power</li>\n<li>blessed greased fixed amulet of life saving</li>\n<li>blessed greased fixed wand of death</li>\n<li>blessed greased fixed partly eaten chickatrice corpse</li></ul>\n<p>Monsters will not wish for items that grant properties they already have, e.g., a <a href=\"/wiki/Strong\" title=\"Strong\">strong</a> monster will never wish for gauntlets of power, and an <a href=\"/wiki/Angel\" title=\"Angel\">Angel</a> will never wish for a cloak of magic resistance. Additionally, they will never wish for things they cannot use - monsters that are too big for torso armor will not wish for cloaks or armor, and monsters who lack gloves and <a href=\"/wiki/Stoning_resistance\" title=\"Stoning resistance\">stoning resistance</a> will never wish for a chickatrice corpse. If chickatrices are genocided, monsters will wish for a cockatrice corpse; if cockatrices are also genocided, they will try to wish for the corpse anyway and receive a random corpse.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"xNetHack\">xNetHack</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/XNetHack\" title=\"XNetHack\">xNetHack</a>, wands of wishing always explode when recharged and will turn to dust when they reach 0 charges. xNetHack also allows you to wish for magic lamps, but unlike <a href=\"/wiki/UnNetHack\" title=\"UnNetHack\">UnNetHack</a>, wishes from djinn are not restricted to non-magical items. Since you cannot get more than one wish from a magic lamp, the main use of this is for a permanent light source.\n</p><p>The probability of successfully wishing for an artifact is changed to <span class=\"sfrac nowrap\"><span style=\"display:inline-block; vertical-align:-0.5em; font-size:85%; text-align:center;\"><span style=\"display:block; line-height:1em; margin:0 0.1em;\">1</span><span style=\"display:block; line-height:1em; margin:0 0.1em; border-top:1px solid;\"><i>n</i> + 1</span></span></span>, where <i>n</i> is the number of artifacts you have received by wishing. Artifacts generated in any other way are <i>not</i> taken into account. This means the first artifact wish is guaranteed, and subsequent ones have probabilities of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>, etc.\n</p><p>Although xNetHack implements <a href=\"/wiki/Object_materials_(xNetHack)\" title=\"Object materials (xNetHack)\">object materials</a>, the material of a wished-for item cannot be specified outside of <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard_mode\" title=\"Wizard mode\">wizard mode</a>. An item received by wishing always has its base material.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"dNetHack\">dNetHack</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/DNetHack\" title=\"DNetHack\">dNetHack</a>, wands of wishing have been removed and replaced with rings of wishing and <a href=\"/wiki/Candle_of_invocation\" title=\"Candle of invocation\">candles of invocation</a>. A candle of invocation can be used once to summon either a djinn, pet, or demon and then is consumed; summoning a djinn grants one wish.\n</p><p>Rings of wishing can be used several times and must be worn and invoked to make a wish. A ring of wishing replaces the wand of wishing in the chest in the Castle.\n</p><p>Wishing for artifacts have been significantly reworked as well. Rather than counting the number of artifacts that already exist, the player starts with one artifact wish available and gains the ability to wish for another artifact based on two events:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Sitting on the <a href=\"/wiki/Throne\" title=\"Throne\">throne</a> inside the <a href=\"/wiki/Castle\" title=\"Castle\">Castle</a></li>\n<li>Giving an artifact to each of the five <a href=\"/wiki/Priest_of_an_unknown_god\" title=\"Priest of an unknown god\">priests of an unknown god</a></li></ul>\n<p>Each event allows the player to wish for one more artifact. Gifts or named artifacts have no direct effects on your artifact wish abilities. \n</p><p>While there are <a href=\"/wiki/DNetHack_artifacts\" title=\"DNetHack artifacts\">many additional artifacts in dNetHack</a>, many of them are unwishable, including quest artifacts. However, there are several good candidates for wishing that should be considered:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/DNetHack_artifacts#Aegis\" title=\"DNetHack artifacts\">Aegis</a>, which grants reflection and half physical damage and can be invoked downward for an instant triple Gorgoneia ward</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/wiki/DNetHack_artifacts#Lance_of_Longinus\" title=\"DNetHack artifacts\">Lance of Longinus</a>, which when wielded, conveys half physical and spell damage, magic resistance, and reflection (though you could be in extreme peril if you lose the weapon or get disarmed)</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/wiki/DNetHack_artifacts#Premium_Heart\" title=\"DNetHack artifacts\">Premium Heart</a>, gauntlets of power that also improve dexterity, provide double damage, and have increased damage multipliers for various status ailments</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"FIQHack\">FIQHack</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/FIQHack\" title=\"FIQHack\">FIQHack</a> you can wish for a magic lamp (and receive it).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"EvilHack\">EvilHack</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/EvilHack\" title=\"EvilHack\">EvilHack</a> also allows wishes for objects with specific <a href=\"/wiki/EvilHack#Object_materials\" title=\"EvilHack\">materials</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/EvilHack#Object_properties\" title=\"EvilHack\">properties</a> similar to GruntHack, with several changes and refinements to wishing in general.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Object_materials_and_properties\">Object materials and properties</span></h4>\n<p>Wishes for objects that are inherently magical will not apply additional object properties, though magical items can very rarely generate with them; wishing for a \"magical &lt;magical armor&gt;\" (e.g. \"magical dragonhide speed boots\") has a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> chance of giving the resulting armor a random (possibly negative) object property. Wished items also cannot have more than one object property - however, there is a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100,000</sub> chance of an eligible item randomly generating with two properties. Artifacts have fixed object materials, and cannot be wished for with other materials or object properties.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wish_sources\">Wish sources</span></h4>\n<p>Wishes from thrones are much more rare: there is close to a <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>200</sub> chance (1.5%) of getting a wish from sitting on a throne, and the throne is guaranteed to disappear if the player is granted a wish.\n</p><p>Wands of wishing are much rarer to find via random generation, and will always generated as charged once (1:x). The Castle's guaranteed wand is always created as having never been charged (0:x).\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Artifact_wishes\">Artifact wishes</span></h4>\n<p>Special rules are applied when wishing for artifacts: the odds of an artifact wish succeeding are <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>X + 1</sub>, where <i>X</i> is the number of previous artifact wishes made. However, if you would successfully receive the artifact, there is a chance that the artifact will instead be generated in the possession of its hostile 'owner', who is placed next to you. The odds that a wished artifact will not come with its owner is also <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>X + 1</sub>, where <i>X</i> is the number of previous artifact wishes made.\n</p><p>The owner of an artifact depends on the specific artifact that was wished for:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Quest_artifact\" title=\"Quest artifact\">Quest artifacts</a> will almost always generate the quest leader associated with it - the sole exception is a <a href=\"/wiki/Tourist\" title=\"Tourist\">Tourist</a> wishing for the Master Key of Thievery: as the <a href=\"/wiki/Master_of_Thieves\" title=\"Master of Thieves\">Master of Thieves</a> is their nemesis, this wish will generate a <a href=\"/wiki/Rogue_(player_monster)\" title=\"Rogue (player monster)\">rogue</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Player_monster\" title=\"Player monster\">player monster</a> instead.</li>\n<li>For other artifacts, those that have a specific role associated with them will generate a player monster of that role with the artifact. Artifacts that do not have a specific role associated with them will still generate a player monster of a specific role, with that role depending on your own alignment in certain cases.</li></ul>\n<p>In addition, the following artifacts cannot be generated by wishing, with the reason given for each:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Lifestealer\" title=\"Lifestealer\">Lifestealer</a>, always generated in the possession of <a href=\"/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler\" title=\"Vlad the Impaler\">Vlad the Impaler</a></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_8-Ball\" title=\"Magic 8-Ball\">Magic 8-Ball</a>, always generated in the possession of <a href=\"/wiki/Oracle_(monster)\" title=\"Oracle (monster)\">the Oracle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/The_Sword_of_Kas\" title=\"The Sword of Kas\">The Sword of Kas</a>, always generated in the possession of <a href=\"/wiki/Kas\" title=\"Kas\">Kas</a></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/wiki/Bag_of_the_Hesperides\" title=\"Bag of the Hesperides\">Bag of the Hesperides</a>, always generated in the <a href=\"/wiki/Ice_Queen%27s_Realm\" title=\"Ice Queen&#39;s Realm\">Ice Queen's Realm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Butcher\" title=\"Butcher\">Butcher</a>, always generated in the possession of <a href=\"/wiki/Yeenoghu\" title=\"Yeenoghu\">Yeenoghu</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/The_Eye_of_Vecna\" title=\"The Eye of Vecna\">The Eye of Vecna</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/The_Hand_of_Vecna_(EvilHack)\" title=\"The Hand of Vecna (EvilHack)\">the Hand of Vecna</a>, either of which is generated upon defeating <a href=\"/wiki/Vecna\" title=\"Vecna\">Vecna</a> without disintegrating him, digesting him or stoning him</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/The_Wand_of_Orcus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Wand of Orcus\">The Wand of Orcus</a>, always generated in the possession of <a href=\"/wiki/Orcus\" title=\"Orcus\">Orcus</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/The_One_Ring\" title=\"The One Ring\">The One Ring</a>, always generated in <a href=\"/wiki/Gollum\" title=\"Gollum\">Gollum</a>'s cave within <a href=\"/wiki/Goblin_Town\" title=\"Goblin Town\">Goblin Town</a></li>\n<li>All <a href=\"/wiki/Forge_(dungeon_feature)#Artifacts\" title=\"Forge (dungeon feature)\">forge-made</a> artifacts</li></ul>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wish_strategy\">Wish strategy</span></h4>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Hardfought\" title=\"Hardfought\">Hardfought</a> has <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.hardfought.org/xlogfiles/evilhack/wishtracker\">a wish tracker</a> for EvilHack that keeps a list of wishes made by players on the server. The recommendations listed below are based on some of the recorded wishes.\n</p><p>Worthwhile wishes for EvilHack characters include:\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide Hawaiian shirt/T-shirt of decay</b> - The shirt slot's armor is great for providing additional AC and properties to non-giant characters, and drain resistance is among the most valuable properties.</li>\n<li>blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide speed boots</li>\n<li><b>blessed greased fixed +3 bone gauntlets of power</b> - This wish is common for illithid characters, who have incredibly low caps to <a href=\"/wiki/Strength\" title=\"Strength\">strength</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Constitution\" title=\"Constitution\">constitution</a>, and bone is among the lightest possible materials for the gauntlets. Depending on personal preferences, stone may be a preferable material: it is much heavier compared to the base material of iron, but provides more base AC.</li>\n<li><b>uncursed magic marker</b> - Magic markers are as valuable as ever, and are made more so by the fact that they do not generate randomly, with a scant few levels where a marker may generate.</li>\n<li><b>Magic lamps</b> - magic lamps are a common choice of light source, and cursed magic lamps instead emit an aura of darkness in the same radius that overrides any light source. Magic lamps will keep working while the character is underwater or engulfed.</li></ul>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Monster_wishes_2\">Monster wishes</span></h4>\n<p>EvilHack allows monsters to wish for items via a smoky potion or a wand of wishing. Additionally, if a player generates a hostile djinni from a lamp or potion, the djinni may choose to keep the wish for themselves. Monsters will not wish for items that grant properties they already have, and will never wish for things they cannot use. Monsters that have an empty wand of wishing and come across a scroll of charging will use that scroll on the wand.\n</p><p>Monsters will randomly wish for one of the following items, with alternate wishes depending on whether or not the monster can use the original item rolled:\n</p>\n<ul><li>1-3 blessed potions of gain level</li>\n<li>A figurine of an Archon, balrog, vorpal jabberwock, or woodchuck, with an equal probability of each</li>\n<li>blessed erodeproofed amulet of life saving</li>\n<li>blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 cloak of displacement, or a wand of digging otherwise</li>\n<li>blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 gauntlets of dexterity, or a blessed potion of full healing otherwise</li>\n<li>blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 cloak of magic resistance, or a blessed erodeproofed wand of create monster otherwise</li>\n<li>blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 crystal plate mail, or a blessed erodeproofed bag of holding otherwise</li>\n<li>blessed erodeproofed amulet of flying, or a blessed potion of full healing otherwise</li>\n<li>blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 water walking boots, or a blessed erodeproofed ring of slow digestion otherwise</li>\n<li>blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 shield of reflection if humanoid, blessed erodeproofed amulet of reflection if non-humanoid, or a blessed potion of extra healing otherwise</li>\n<li>blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 gauntlets of power, or a cursed potion of gain level otherwise</li>\n<li>blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 speed boots, or a blessed potion of full healing otherwise</li>\n<li>blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 helm of telepathy, or a blessed potion of extra healing otherwise</li>\n<li>blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 helm of brilliance, or a blessed blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 unicorn horn otherwise</li>\n<li>blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 cloak of protection, or a blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 ring of protection otherwise</li>\n<li>a blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 random artifact that matches the monster's alignment - this wish can fail if it selects an artifact that is already generated</li>\n<li>one of a wand of cancellation, a wand of polymorph or a wand of death, blessed and erodeproofed with an equal probability of each</li>\n<li>1-3 cockatrice eggs</li>\n<li>cursed potion of gain level</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>The <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://nh.gmuf.com/wish.html\">NetHack Wishing Spoiler</a> by Peter Snelling, Stanislav Traykov, and others provides a detailed analysis of how to wish effectively, including a list of specific wishes ordered by priority.</li>\n<li>In the <a href=\"/wiki/Dudley%27s_dungeon\" title=\"Dudley&#39;s dungeon\">Dudley's dungeon</a> of <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.nicolaas.net/dudley/index.php?f=20050819\">19 August 2005</a>, Dudley wishes for a \"blessed greased fixed erodeproof disenchanterproof demonpossessionproof vacuumofdeepspaceproof proofremovalproof fully insured 100% all-natural materials completely and utterly intact, undamaged and structurally sound freshly washed and free of the stench of congealed human blood totally bereft of ancient unbreakable curses and absolutely NOT stolen from any nearby easily-angered shopkeepers +3 armor enhancement GRAY DRAGON SCALE MAIL\".

A more accurate metric would be the average number of scrolls it takes to raise the item to +5 (for most armor) or +7 (for elven armor and weapons). Wishing for +2 as opposed to +3 does save ~0.030 and ~0.019 scrolls in the +5 and +7 cases, respectively, but this data may be a bit too in-depth for the article.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-14\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-14\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.4.3/objnam.c#line2605\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Source:NetHack 3.4.3/objnam.c\">objnam.c<span></span> in NetHack 3.4.3, line 2605</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-15\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-15\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.4.3/objnam.c#line2458\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Source:NetHack 3.4.3/objnam.c\">objnam.c<span></span> in NetHack 3.4.3, line 2458</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-16\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-16\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.4.3/objnam.c#line2625\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Source:NetHack 3.4.3/objnam.c\">objnam.c<span></span> in NetHack 3.4.3, line 2625</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-17\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-17\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.4.3/objnam.c#line1845\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Source:NetHack 3.4.3/objnam.c\">objnam.c<span></span> in NetHack 3.4.3, line 1845</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-18\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-18\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.4.3/objnam.c#line2641\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Source:NetHack 3.4.3/objnam.c\">objnam.c<span></span> in NetHack 3.4.3, line 2641</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-19\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-19\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.4.3/objnam.c#line2547\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Source:NetHack 3.4.3/objnam.c\">objnam.c<span></span> in NetHack 3.4.3, line 2547</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-20\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-20\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.4.3/objnam.c#line2548\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Source:NetHack 3.4.3/objnam.c\">objnam.c<span></span> in NetHack 3.4.3, line 2548</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-21\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-21\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.4.3/objnam.c#line2238\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Source:NetHack 3.4.3/objnam.c\">objnam.c<span></span> in NetHack 3.4.3, line 2238</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-22\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-22\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.4.3/objnam.c#line2554\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Source:NetHack 3.4.3/objnam.c\">objnam.c<span></span> in NetHack 3.4.3, line 2554</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-23\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-23\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.4.3/objnam.c#line2567\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Source:NetHack 3.4.3/objnam.c\">objnam.c<span></span> in NetHack 3.4.3, line 2567</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-24\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-24\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.4.3/objnam.c#line2576\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Source:NetHack 3.4.3/objnam.c\">objnam.c<span></span> in NetHack 3.4.3, line 2576</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-25\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-25\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.4.3/trap.c#line439\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Source:NetHack 3.4.3/trap.c\">trap.c<span></span> in NetHack 3.4.3, line 439</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-26\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-26\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.4.3/objnam.c#line1912\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Source:NetHack 3.4.3/objnam.c\">objnam.c<span></span> in NetHack 3.4.3, line 1912</a><span>:</span> <i>This is supposed to skip the charge count and go to the <tt>)</tt> for further processing.

''[[NetHack]]'', a '''wish''' is an opportunity to be granted an [[item]] of the player's choice.\n\nWishes are highly sought after and extremely powerful, especially in the [[early game]] where high-grade equipment is otherwise unavailable. A significant amount of [[strategy]] exists around getting as many wishes as possible and choosing the best items to wish for. Two [[conduct]]s involve restrictions on wishing: the [[wishless]] conduct for making no wishes, and the artifact-wishless conduct for playing without wishing for [[artifact]]s.\n\n==Sources==\nThere are several ways to obtain a wish in ''NetHack'', including:\n\n* [[Engraving]] with a [[wand of wishing]] or zapping it. A wand is the only guaranteed way, provided your [[Luck]] is 0 or greater. With negative Luck, the probability of a wish is {{sfrac|5 + Luck|5}}, down to zero if Luck&nbsp;≤&nbsp;&minus;5. Cursed wands can explode when zapped (1% chance), but not when engraved with. A newly generated [[wand of wishing]] has 1&ndash;3 charges before recharge, 3 more charges after recharge with a [[blessed]] [[scroll of charging]], and then you can [[wrest]] one last wish. Therefore, it grants a total of 5&ndash;7 wishes.\n* Rubbing a [[magic lamp]], preferably [[blessed]], until a [[djinni]] appears. For a blessed magic lamp, you have an 80% chance of obtaining a wish (20% for an uncursed lamp, 5% for a cursed lamp). The worst outcome is a djinni which attacks you instead of granting a wish (5% chance for a blessed magic lamp). After a djinni appears, the magic lamp becomes an oil lamp. Therefore, a blessed magic lamp grants 0.8 wishes on average. In theory you can have more than 120 djinn from lamps,{{refsrc|apply.c|1186}} but not from smoky potions.\n* Quaffing a [[smoky potion]], preferably blessed. There is a chance of {{sfrac|13 + 2''d''}} that a djinni appears (where ''d'' is the number of djinn created this game) and, for a blessed smoky potion, a {{frac|4|5}} further chance that he grants you a wish. The worst outcome is a djinni which attacks you (chance {{frac|20}} for each djinni from a blessed smoky potion). When a djinni appears from a smoky potion, you never get the effect of the potion itself. Therefore, a blessed smoky potion grants, on average, {{sfrac|4|65 + 10''d''}} wishes. After 120 djinn appear in the game, they become extinct and never appear anymore.\n* Quaffing from (or dipping in) a [[fountain]] above dungeon level 20, unless you have the Amulet. There is a chance of {{frac|30}} that a [[water demon]] appears and a further {{sfrac|20 &minus; ''DL''|100}} chance that he grants a wish (where ''DL'' is the dungeon level); otherwise, he attacks you. The fountain has a {{frac|3}} chance of drying up. Therefore, each fountain grants on average about {{sfrac|20 &minus; ''DL''|1000}} wishes. Possible side effects are dangerous, including [[water moccasin|moccasins]] appearing around you ({{frac|30}} chance), creating a [[water nymph]] ({{frac|30}} chance), or a hostile water demon appearing ({{sfrac|80 + ''DL''|3000}} chance).\n* Sitting on a [[throne]], chance {{frac|39}}. The throne has {{frac|3}} chance of vanishing \"in a puff of logic\", unless you are teleported away. Therefore, each throne grants about {{frac|13}} wishes.<ref>The exact number is {{frac|3|38}}. Chance of wish in one #sit: p1&nbsp;= {{sfrac|3}}&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;{{sfrac|13}}; chance not destroyed in one #sit: p2&nbsp;= 1&nbsp;&minus; chance destroyed = 1&nbsp;&minus; {{sfrac|3}}&nbsp;&times; (1&nbsp;&minus; {{sfrac|3}}&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;{{sfrac|13}}) = {{sfrac|79|117}}; wishes granted by each throne: p&nbsp;= p1&nbsp;+ p2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;p, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|3|38}}</ref> This may cause unpleasant alternate outcomes.\n* Pressing ^W in [[wizard mode]]. This is intended to be used for debugging.\n\nThe [[Castle]] always has a wand of wishing in a chest in one of the four corner rooms. Unless you are trying for wishless [[conduct]], you should be able to do some wishing before you enter [[Gehennom]].\n\nA successful wish will increase your prayer timeout by 50 to 149 turns.{{refsrc|zap.c|4140}}\n\n==Restrictions==\n=== Forbidden items ===\nThese items can never be granted by a wish outside [[wizard mode]].\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n!Forbidden item\n!Replacement\n|-\n|[[Amulet of Yendor]]\n|[[cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor]]\n|-\n|[[Candelabrum of Invocation]]\n|\n* [[tallow candle]] ''(80% chance)''\n* [[wax candle]] ''(20% chance)''\n|-\n|[[Bell of Opening]]\n|[[bell]]\n|-\n|[[Book of the Dead]]\n|[[blank spellbook]]\n|-\n|your role's [[quest artifact]]\n|nothing\n|-\n|[[magic lamp]]\n|[[oil lamp]]\n|-\n|[[venom]]\n|the item isn't recognized by the parser{{refsrc|objects.c|960|comment=Here, the nwsh bit is set to 1}}\n|-\n|[[wand of wishing]]\n|\n* wand of wishing (1:-1) ''(90% chance)''\n* wand of wishing (1:0) ''(10% chance)''\n|}\n\n=== Artifact wishing ===\n\nIf you wish for an artifact, your chance of receiving it depends on the number of artifacts (but not [[unique item]]s) that have already been generated:{{refsrc|objnam.c|2695}}\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n!Generated artifacts !! 0 !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! ''n''\n|-\n!Chance 1 wish\n| (always) || (always) || 0.666 || 0.5 || 0.4 || 0.333 || 0.285 || {{sfrac|2|''n'' + 1}}\n|-\n!Chance 2 wishes\n| (always) || (always) || 0.888 || 0.75 || 0.64 || 0.555 || 0.488 || 1 &minus; (1 &minus; {{sfrac|2|''n'' + 1}})<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n!Chance m wishes\n|(always) || (always) || || || || || || 1 &minus; (1 &minus; {{sfrac|2|''n'' + 1}})<sup>''m''</sup>\n|}\n\nOtherwise, you receive nothing and the wish is wasted (\"For a moment, you feel something in your hands, but it disappears!\"). Similarly, wishing for your own [[quest artifact]] will never succeed (same message). If you wish for an artifact which has already been generated in the game, you will receive its base item instead.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2694}}\n\nIf you wish for a [[quest artifact]], you might receive it, but find yourself unable to use it. (See [[intelligent artifact]]s for more details.)\n\nWishing for an artifact will break the artifact-wishless conduct, regardless of whether you actually receive it.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2688}}\n\nDestroying artifacts will ''not'' increase the chance of successfully wishing for another, since the number ''generated'' is never decremented. Failed artifact wishes don't further decrease the chance of success, however.\n\n== Customization ==\n\n=== Quantity ===\n\nYou may wish for only one unstackable item. If you wish for more, you still get only one.\n\nWhen wishing for a [[stackable]] item, you may wish for more than one. If the amount you wish for is less than the roll of a ''d6'', you get the desired amount; otherwise you get only one.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2472}}\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n! Quantity\n! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6+\n|-\n! Success rate\n| 1 || {{frac|2|3}}  || {{frac|2}} || {{frac|3}} || {{frac|6}} || 0\n|-\n! Average\n| 1.00 || 1.67 || 2.00 || 2.00 || 1.67 || 1.00\n|}\n\nExceptions to this rule are:{{refsrc|objnam.c|2091}}{{refsrc|objnam.c|2477}}\n* [[Candle]]s – you may wish for up to 7\n* [[Arrow]]s (all kinds), [[dart]]s, [[crossbow bolt]]s, [[shuriken]], [[boomerang]]s, and [[rock]]s – you may wish for up to 20\n* [[Gold piece]]s – you may wish for up to 5000\n\nFor gold pieces, any quantity above 5000 is treated as 5000. For the other exceptions, any quantity above the one listed will not be honored at all, and you will receive only 1.\n\nRanged weapons aside from the ones listed, including [[javelin]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[spear]]s, [[knife|knives]], [[gray stone]]s, and [[gem]]s, follow the same rules as any ordinary [[stackable]] item.\n\nIf you wish for a plural of a stackable item, but don't specify a quantity (e.g. \"blessed scrolls of charging\"), the game treats it as if you wished for two, subject to the probability above. If you specify a quantity of a singular item (\"2 blessed scroll of charging\"), the parser ignores the singular and uses the quantity specified. Quantities of zero or less are ignored, and the singular or plural status will be used.\n\nMost players wish for 2 or 3 items. Wishing for 3 gives more items when averaged over many wishes, but wishing for 2 is more likely to increase the effectiveness of the current wish.\n\n=== Enchantment ===\n\nWhen wishing for an item that can be [[enchantment|enchanted]], you may specify the enchantment. If the enchantment you wish for is less than or equal to the roll of a ''d5'', you get the desired enchantment; otherwise you get +0.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2491}}\n\nYou ''can'' wish for negatively-enchanted equipment, with the same chance of success as the equivalent positive enchantment. It's not clear why anyone would want to do this, however.\n\nIf your [[Luck]] is negative, any enchantment higher than +2 will automatically become negative.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2495}} This check takes place ''after'' the game decides whether it will grant you your specified enchantment, and it only applies for armor, weapons, and weapon tools. If you want to wish for a +6 wand of striking (a bad idea most likely) while your Luck is negative&mdash;assuming you get the wand at all&mdash;you will get a wand of striking with between 4 and 6 charges, just as if your Luck were positive.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n! Enchantment\n! +0 !! ±1 !! ±2 !! ±3 !! ±4 !! ±5 !! ±(6+)\n|-\n! Success rate\n| 1 || 1 || {{frac|4|5}} || {{frac|3|5}} || {{frac|2|5}} || {{frac|5}} || 0\n|-\n! Average\n| 0.0 || 1.0 || 1.6 || 1.8 || 1.6 || 1.0 || 0.0\n|}\n\nAs with quantities, most players wish for +2 or +3 equipment. +3 gives the best average enchantment, but +2's slightly lower average is less chancy. (If you're intending to immediately enchant the item further, however, +2 is strictly better because a blessed scroll is more efficient on a +2 item than on a +3; after using a single blessed scroll on the newly created item, the average enchantment is 3.6 for the +2 case versus only 3.5 for +3.)<ref>Strictly speaking, this is a somewhat self-defeating argument: we say that +2 is better despite a lower average enchantment, and then we \"prove\" it with another average enchantment figure. A more accurate metric would be the average number of scrolls it takes to raise the item to +5 (for most armor) or +7 (for elven armor and weapons). Wishing for +2 as opposed to +3 does save ~0.030 and ~0.019 scrolls in the +5 and +7 cases, respectively, but this data may be a bit too in-depth for the article.</ref> +4 and +5 have lower averages than +3 ''and'' are more risky as well, so those are usually not used. +1 is certain to work, but its average enchantment is much lower than that of +2 or +3, so it's usually not a good choice unless you are [[illiterate]] and unable to enchant items yourself. The other possible enchantments are obviously not ever very useful, unless you actually want nonpositive enchantment for some bizarre reason.\n\nWhen wishing for wands or chargeable tools, an enchantment written as \"+x\" will be interpreted as a wish for x charges. Conversely, a wish for a \"dagger (y:x)\" is a wish for a +x dagger (the first number has no effect). This occurs because charge and enchantment are the same variable in the structure for objects in ''NetHack'', hence there are no simultaneously enchantable and chargeable objects.\n\n=== Beatitude ===\n\nYou can specify whether the item should be blessed, uncursed, or cursed. If your [[Luck]] is zero or greater, your preference will be respected.\n\nIf your Luck is negative, explicitly wishing for a \"blessed\" or \"uncursed\" item will yield a cursed one instead.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2605}} (Wishing for a \"cursed\" item still works.)\n\nIf you do not specify a beatitude, the item will have a random beatitude as if the item had been randomly generated (regardless of Luck).{{refsrc|objnam.c|2458}} Specifying a negative enchantment as part of the wish (even \"-0\") will implicitly specify \"cursed\" unless you specify a beatitude explicitly.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2625}}\n\nYou should almost always wish for blessed items, unless you have negative Luck, or specifically want a cursed [[potion]] or [[scroll]]. [[Magic marker]]s should be uncursed, so that cursed paper will produce cursed scrolls. If you desire both cursed and blessed copies of an item (such as [[scroll of genocide|scrolls of genocide]] or [[potion of gain level|potions of gain level]]), consider wishing for cursed ones, since it is easier to bless items than it is to curse them.\n\n=== Erosion-proofing ===\n\nYou can ask for an item to be \"rustproof\", \"erodeproof\", \"corrodeproof\", \"[[fixed]]\", \"fireproof\", or \"rotproof\". If your Luck is non-negative, and the item is subject to [[erosion]] (or is a [[crysknife]]), your preference will be respected.\n\n''NetHack'' does not discriminate between the different types of erosion-proofing, so you may wish for \"corrodeproof [[speed boots]]\" or a \"fireproof crysknife\", and the game will substitute the appropriate type of protection.{{refsrc|objnam.c|1845}} Thus, some players recommend making it a habit to add \"fixed\" to ''every'' wish, to reduce the chance of forgetting to erosion-proof something.\n\nYou can also explicitly request an eroded item. If you wish for an item to be both eroded and erosion-proof, the item will ''not'' be erosion-proof.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2641}}\n\n=== Monster type ===\n\nWhen wishing for a [[tin]], [[corpse]], [[figurine]], [[egg]], or [[statue]], you can specify what type of monster it should be.\n\nIf you wish for a tin containing a monster that has been [[genocide]]d, you get an empty tin.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2547}} Wishing for a tin containing a unique monster, a monster that cannot leave a corpse, or a monster giving zero [[nutrition]] (such as a [[wraith]]) will instead produce a random tin.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2548}} You can also wish for tins of [[spinach]].{{refsrc|objnam.c|2238}}\n\nYou may not wish for the corpse of a unique monster, or a monster that cannot leave a corpse; doing so will produce a random corpse. Wishing for the corpse of a [[quest guardian]] will instead produce a corpse of the corresponding [[player monster]].{{refsrc|objnam.c|2554}} A partly eaten corpse is lighter than a non-eaten one, so many players prefer those when wishing.\n\nIf you wish for a figurine of a unique monster, any kind of human, or a [[mail daemon]], you will instead receive a random figurine.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2567}}\n\nIf you wish for an egg from a non-[[oviparous]] monster, you will get a random kind of egg. Wishing for a \"[[Scorpius]] egg\" will give you a [[scorpion]] egg. You ''can'' wish for an egg from a genocided species, but the egg will never hatch.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2576}}\n\nYou can wish for a statue of any monster, including unique and genocided ones. Bear in mind, however, that casting {{spell of|stone to flesh}} on a statue will not always produce that monster&mdash;for example, animating a statue of a unique monster or quest guardian will instead produce a [[doppelganger]] disguised as that monster.{{refsrc|trap.c|439}}\n\n=== Charges ===\nAlthough you can wish for a specific number of charges (e.g. \"wand of death (0:7)\"), in a normal game you will always receive the lesser of the number of charges you wish for or the number of charges you would otherwise receive, making this an undesirable option. The capability was designed for [[wizard mode]], where you always receive the number of charges you wish for.\n\nYou can also wish for charges by specifying an enchantment (so a wish for a \"+7 wand of death\" is equivalent to the above). Wishing for a \"+10 magic marker\" is a bad idea, because it will have at most 10 charges.\n\nYou cannot normally wish for negative charges.{{refsrc|objnam.c|1912|comment=This is supposed to skip the charge count and go to the <tt>)</tt> for further processing. As <tt>-</tt> is not a digit, the charge count is not actually skipped.}}{{refsrc|objnam.c|1914|comment=This does not find the expected <tt>)</tt> and thus sets <tt>spe = 0</tt>.}} However, it is possible to wish for a negative enchantment instead, which means the same internally. Outside [[wizard mode]], wishing for negative charges on a wand will give you a canceled wand (with -1 charges);{{refsrc|objnam.c|2498}} wishing for negative charges on a tool will give you 0 charges.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2500}}\n\n=== Other item properties ===\n\nYou can also specify the following properties:{{refsrc|objnam.c|1833}}\n\n* \"holy\", \"unholy\" (sets BUC, even if not [[potion of water]])\n* \"lit\", \"burning\", \"unlit\", \"extinguished\" (for [[lamp]]s, [[candle]]s, and [[potion of oil|potions of oil]])\n* \"unlabeled\", \"unlabelled\", \"blank\" (for [[blank scroll|scrolls]] and [[blank spellbook|spellbooks]])\n* \"[[poison]]ed\" (for poisonable weapons and comestibles, and for containers which can be trapped)\n* \"[[grease]]d\" (any item)\n* \"partly eaten\" (for [[comestible]]s)\n* \"historic\" (for [[statue]]s)\n* \"diluted\" (for potions other than water)\n* \"empty\" (for [[tin]]s)\n* A general item category, e.g. \"scroll\" or \"spellbook\"; this will produce a random item in the chosen category. Pressing enter on a blank line, or escaping out of the wish, will produce a random item. This is still subject to the restrictions on wishing, so wishing for a \"lamp\" will always produce an oil lamp.\n\nMost of these are useless or worse, but \"greased\" can be a life-saver for [[armor]], [[weapon]]s, [[spellbook]]s, [[scroll]]s, [[potion]]s, and [[container]]s, \"poisoned\" can increase the effectiveness of weapons, and \"partly eaten\" can make wielded [[chickatrice]] corpses lighter. Some players recommend applying \"greased fixed\" to every wish, as \"fixed\" is harmless, and \"greased\" is only harmful for [[projectile]]s you intend to [[throw]].\n\nYou should especially grease all [[armor]], even pieces that can't be [[erosion|eroded]], as [[greased]] [[helm]]s, [[shirt]]s, [[cloak]]s, and [[body armor]] can protect you from [[grabbing]], [[drowning]], and [[mind flayer]]s.\n\n=== Nothing ===\n\nSometimes, a player gets a wish prompt (for example from a throne or a smoky potion), but wants to keep the wishless conduct. In this case, the player can wish for \"nothing\", \"none\", or \"nil\" to avoid breaking the conduct.{{refsrc|objnam.c|1808}}\n\n== Strategy ==\n=== Common wishes ===\n\nThe best use of a wish depends heavily on your situation in the game. Here we give some general advice for early and late game situations. This advice is only a guideline and does not apply to all situations. In some cases, if you already have everything you need, the best thing to do with a wand of wishing or magic lamp is to save it for later. Experienced players are able to weigh the value of an unused available wish and compare it to the benefit that would be provided by the most valuable item in the game in that situation. For inexperienced players, there is no substitute for experience&mdash;play and learn!\n\nThe following general principles apply in almost all situations:\n\n* If you encounter a wand of wishing, and you can't [[identify]] how many charges it has, then your first wish should be either 2 (or 3) \"blessed [[scroll of charging|scrolls of charging]]\", or an \"uncursed [[magic marker]]\", so you can write your own blessed(!) scrolls to recharge the wand.\n** Writing your own scrolls will only work reliably if you have already identified scrolls of charging, you have found and named (or identified) all four kinds of 300zm scrolls, or you are a [[wizard]]; however, if you are willing to save some of your wishes for later, i.e. until after you have identified scrolls of charging, a magic marker is an overall more useful item (it can yield three scrolls of charging and still have enough ink to write several scrolls).\n** Wands of wishing from bones levels might already have been recharged once.\n\nThe rest of this discussion assumes that you have a way to recharge your wand, if the wish is from a wand of wishing.\n\n==== Early single wishes ====\n\nThe most common source of early wishes is a [[magic lamp]] (if you disregard slightly suicidal early level fountain quaffers). As a rule, the best item to wish for early in the game is either gray or silver [[dragon scale mail]], unless you are playing a [[Monk]]:\n\n* \"blessed greased +2 [[gray dragon scale mail]]\" (or +3) provides [[magic resistance]], and\n* \"blessed greased +2 [[silver dragon scale mail]]\" (or +3) provides [[reflection]].\n\nWhich one you should wish for is somewhat situational; if you already have one extrinsic, you should wish for the DSM which provides the other. For example, a [[Wizard]] starts with a [[cloak of magic resistance]], and would prefer SDSM. A character who gets the [[amulet of reflection]] from [[Sokoban]], on the other hand, would be better served by GDSM. If you have neither magic resistance nor reflection, the choice is somewhat more difficult; see [[GDSM versus SDSM]] for a more detailed discussion of the merits of each.\n\nFor a [[Monk]], the choice is drastically different, due to the large penalty for wearing body armor, which is especially problematic early in the game. Another class's quest artifact is a good choice for a [[lawful]] or [[neutral]] Monk (see {{sa|Quest artifacts|sectionsign=1}} below). However, due to the absence of [[chaotic]] quest artifacts that provide magic resistance, a chaotic Monk needing magic resistance should wish for a \"blessed greased fireproof +2 [[cloak of magic resistance]]\" (or +3). Alternatively, when magic resistance is not the highest priority, common and useful single wishes include [[speed boots]] or [[gauntlets of power]]. [[The Master Key of Thievery]] is another option for a chaotic Monk due to the extremely useful [[half physical damage]] property, but be wary of its [[artifact blast]].\n\n==== Early wands of wishing ====\n\nA somewhat rarer source of wishes early in the game is a [[wand of wishing]]. With a wand of wishing, you will usually want to wish for some or all of the following items, depending on what you already have: [[dragon scale mail]] (gray or silver), [[amulet of life saving]], some [[artifact weapon]] (unless you're planning to sacrifice for one), a [[bag of holding]] (if [[Sokoban]] doesn't provide one), and [[speed boots]]. All of the above should be blessed, and weapon and speed boots should be also fireproof. Some players wish for 2 blessed scrolls of charging, or a blessed magic marker, in order to access all the wishes immediately. You may also consider wishing for a quest artifact (see {{sa|Quest artifacts|sectionsign=1}}), but its [[artifact blast]] might kill you.\n\nIf you encounter a [[wand of wishing]] in a shop, it is easy to [[price identification|price identify]] because its base cost is 500, shared only with the [[wand of death]]. If you have a pet with you, [[Stealing from shops|stealing]] the wand is easy enough. Those who were already planning to use a powerful pet (e.g. [[pacifist]]s) might wish for a blessed [[figurine]] of an [[Archon]]; this carries a 10% chance of backfiring, and a 10% chance of being wasted. Do not wish for a pet unless you are prepared to [[Pet#Protect_your_pet|take care of it]]. Failing this, it is best to simply find 500zm worth of junk to sell to the shopkeeper and then buy the wand. If you're really not sure of your character's ability to survive long enough to do that, it's also possible to simply wish for 5000 [[zorkmid]]s, use some of them to pay the shopkeeper for the wand, and leave with a healthy monetary profit (and more to the point, a wand of wishing with only one charge spent). This is probably the lowest-risk strategy, but the potential rewards are lower too as gold is typically a waste of a wish. A more ostensibly \"profitable\" method is to wish for a [[wand of death]] and use it to kill the shopkeeper, though that entails the penalty for [[murder]].\n\n==== Late game wishes ====\n\nIn the later stages of the game, wishes typically serve the role of completing an [[ascension kit]].\n\nIf you need lots of items to complete your ascension kit, consider wishing for a [[wand of polymorph]]. This wand is a very powerful item for players who are not averse to [[polypiling]]. In most cases, it is far more efficient to polypile for ascension kit items and then wish for the few remaining missing pieces, rather than wishing directly for all the items from the start.\n\nAn uncursed [[magic marker]] can be used to write cursed [[scroll of genocide|scrolls of genocide]], which when read will summon a monster of your choice. This technique is often more efficient than wishing directly for monster-derived items, since a single uncursed magic marker (which takes one wish) can usually write at least four scrolls of genocide with recharging. For example, if your character is reasonably strong, you can obtain dragon scale mail by [[reverse genocide|reverse genociding]] dragons instead of wishing directly for dragon scale mail. As another example, if you need a [[cockatrice]] corpse, it may be more efficient to reverse genocide cockatrices than to wish for a corpse directly. \n\n==== Quest artifacts ====\n\n:''See {{sa|Artifact wishing|sectionsign=1}} for general information about artifact wishing.''\n\nGenerally speaking you should ''not'' wish for cross-aligned quest artifacts. They will “evade your grasp” and fall to the floor, and you will be unable to pick them up. Early-game characters should also avoid wishing even for coaligned quest artifacts, unless they have enough current [[HP]] to survive the inevitable [[artifact blast]]. It is technically possible to carry multiple artifacts of different alignments through careful use of alignment conversion or a [[helm of opposite alignment]], but this tactic is rarely employed. A helm of opposite alignment also cannot cause chaotic or lawful characters to become neutral, so the only way for such characters to use wished-for neutral artifacts is to permanently convert themselves at an [[altar]].\n\nAs detailed above, you cannot get your own [[quest artifact]] from wishes.\n\n===== Lawful =====\n\nFor lawful characters, the main contenders are [[the Sceptre of Might]], [[the Orb of Detection]] and [[the Magic Mirror of Merlin]], which all offer magic resistance. The Sceptre offers ring-less [[conflict]] and deals double damage against cross-aligned (non-lawful) monsters. The Mirror and the Orb both offer extrinsic telepathy; the Orb also offers [[half spell damage]] and functions as a [[crystal ball]], but is much heavier than the Sceptre or Mirror. If you already have magic resistance, [[the Mitre of Holiness]] is worth considering for a spellcaster due to the energy boost it provides when invoked.\n\n===== Neutral =====\nIf you are a [[neutral]] character and want a quest artifact, there are at least four good choices:\n* \"blessed rustproof [[Eye of the Aethiopica]]\" (if you are ''not'' a [[Wizard]]) to obtain [[magic resistance]], fast [[power]] regeneration, [[telepathy]], and to #invoke for [[branchport]]ing\n* \"blessed fireproof [[Platinum Yendorian Express Card]]\" (if you are ''not'' a [[Tourist]]) to obtain [[magic resistance]], [[telepathy]], and to #invoke for non-blessed [[charging]]\n* \"blessed [[Eyes of the Overworld]]\" (if you are ''not'' a [[Monk]]) to obtain [[astral vision]] and [[magic resistance]], and to #invoke for [[enlightenment]]\n* \"blessed [[Orb of Fate]]\" (if you are ''not'' a [[Valkyrie]]) to obtain [[half physical damage]] and [[half spell damage]], and to #invoke to [[level teleport]] (but you will need to obtain [[teleport control]] separately)\n\n[[The Eye of the Aethiopica]] is an especially valuable item for neutral [[Monk]]s; due to armor [[to-hit]] penalty and weaponless [[martial arts]], they will most likely spend a wish on [[magic resistance]]. Comparing the [[cloak of magic resistance|cloak]] and the MR-granting quest artifacts, energy regeneration stands out as extremely useful, since Monks are decent [[spellcaster]]s and their starting spell (whatever it is) becomes vastly more powerful with energy regeneration. [[Branchport]] and [[telepathy]] are also big bonuses that are difficult or impossible for vegetarian Monks to get in any other way.\n\n[[The Eyes of the Overworld]] might be considered a lower priority than some of the others listed, but the [[astral vision]] they provide is useful for making the exploration of [[Gehennom]] less tedious without having to stockpile scrolls of magic mapping. However, if you can cast the divination spells of {{spell of|magic mapping}}, {{spell of|detect treasure}}, and {{spell of|detect monsters}} at a Skilled level, then these combined also provide the key benefits of the Eyes, even revealing information about the entire map at once&mdash;though this of course requires obtaining the appropriate spellbooks and being able to cast them somewhat reliably.\n\n===== Chaotic =====\n\nFor chaotic characters, [[the Master Key of Thievery]] is usually considered better than [[the Longbow of Diana]]. No chaotic artifact grants magic resistance, making them somewhat less desirable than artifacts of other alignments. However, the Key still grants the very useful [[half physical damage]] and [[teleport control]] properties, in addition to warning and its [[invoke]] effect.\n\n==== Asking on IRC ====\n\nIf you want, you can just join #nethack on [[Libera]] and ask them to suggest what to wish for. It helps if you know what items and perhaps spells, discoveries you already have.\n\n=== What not to wish for ===\nThe [http://nh.gmuf.com/wish.html NetHack Wishing Spoiler] has a list of good items to obtain without wishing. Here are a few more:\n\n* [[unicorn horn]] &ndash; This is a very common item after you start finding unicorns, and you won't need one very often before then. Early in the game, if you have no unicorn horn but find a wish, you probably want dragon scale mail.\n* [[food ration]] &ndash; You are fainting, cannot #[[pray]], and there is no food around? Prefer wishing for a [[horn of plenty]]. If you're not fainting yet but out of food regardless, wishing for a [[ring of slow digestion]] may be better&mdash;NetHack is usually plentiful enough on food that you can find a monster or food item soon enough with the decreased hunger.\n* [[potion of holy water]] &ndash; If playing an [[atheist]], wish for two blessed [[scroll of remove curse|scrolls of remove curse]]. Obtain lots of uncursed water, name each one differently so they don't stack, and have nothing but the water and one of the scrolls in your inventory. Read the scroll while confused, un-name all the water, and #[[adjust]] them so they merge into three stacks. Figure out which is which by dipping a known-uncursed useless object (such as a rock) into them, checking for the cursed one with a pet, or [[price identification]] to find the uncursed one. If you only have two stacks, figure out those two and repeat with the other scroll.\n** For illiterate atheist players, this is a reasonable wish. See also the [[Potion of holy water#Conduct considerations|complete list of conduct-proof methods]].\n* [[dragon scale mail]] (in the ''mid to late game only'') &ndash; Once you have known-cursed paper and you know the [[scroll of genocide]] (or are a [[Wizard]] with high Luck), an uncursed [[magic marker]] is likely a better wish. If you cannot confidently write cursed scrolls of genocide, you may wish for them instead. [[Reverse genocide]] dragons, kill them, and write {{of|scroll|enchant armor}} to make mail from their scales. See the note on [[Dragon scale mail#Acquiring dragon scales|acquiring dragon scales]] for how to do this safely.\n\n== Misspelled wish, non-existent item, and canceling at the prompt ==\n\nIf what you enter at the \"For what do you wish?\" prompt cannot be parsed as a ''NetHack'' item, you will be notified (\"Nothing fitting that description exists in the game.\") and asked again.{{refsrc|zap.c|4112}} \"Cannot be parsed\" is a quite loose definition, though; for example, \"figuring\" will successfully be (mis-)parsed as \"ring\". However, you have at most five tries; after failing five times you will be given a random object (\"That's enough tries!\").{{refsrc|zap.c|4115}}\n\nPressing {{kbd|Esc}} at the prompt will result in a random object being given to you. This breaks the [[wishless]] conduct.{{refsrc|zap.c|4103}} Pressing any of the arrow keys will have the same result as their representation contains an escape character.\n\n[[NAO]]'s patched ''NetHack'' version only clears the input if you press escape; if the input line is already empty, pressing escape will have the same effect as in vanilla ''NetHack'', however.\n\nBe careful if wishing for [[GDSM|gray dragon scale mail]]. If you omit \"scale\" and wish for \"blessed greased +2 gray dragon mail\", you will receive a [[scroll of mail]]!\n\n== Messages ==\n\n{{message|You may wish for an object.|You have been granted a wish.}}\n{{message|Unfortunately, nothing happens.|You zapped or engraved with a wand of wishing which had no effect due to negative luck, wasting a charge.}}\n{{message|Nothing happens.|Among other causes, this message appears when you zap a wand that has no charges, and may appear when rubbing any type of lamp.}}\n{{message|Nothing fitting that description exists in the game.|You made a wish that couldn't be parsed or for an invalid object.}}\n{{message|For a moment, you feel something in your hands, but it disappears!|You wished for an artifact that was not granted, wasting the wish.}}\n{{message|Oops! The [object] drops to the floor!|You could not carry the object you wished for, probably because you have no free inventory slots or it is too heavy.}}\n\n== Variants ==\n=== SLASH'EM ===\nIn [[SLASH'EM]], there are not only several new ways to obtain wishes, there are many new targets for wishes and many other chances and ways to get ascension kit items that would be good wish targets in vanilla. The following are some key points to bear in mind.\n\n==== SLASH'EM wish sources ====\nSLASH'EM has two additional wish sources: [[pill]]s and [[gypsy|gypsies]], of which the latter is the more important. A common mid- to late-game technique for a character who has a significant number of identified gemstones is to [[reverse genocide]] gypsies, which guarantees several wishes if the player has enough gems. Because this can be done repeatedly, it makes wishes less of a rarity than vanilla. By the time a SLASH'EM player reaches the castle, they rarely need the wand.\n\n==== Common SLASH'EM wishes ====\nSLASH'EM has many new artifacts and items which are well worth a wish. The following are some common wish targets:\n\n'''Artifacts'''\n*'''Lawful'''\n**[[The Crown of Saint Edward]], the [[Yeoman]] quest artifact, is a [[helm of telepathy]] which also provides [[magic resistance]] and [[half spell damage]].\n**[[Firewall]] is a lawful [[athame]] that provides fire resistance and does extra fire damage, both of which can be extremely helpful in the early game.\n**[[Grayswandir]], the best artifact weapon in vanilla, is still arguably the best lawful artifact weapon in SLASH'EM; it's also harder to get via sacrifice, since there are so many other artifacts to compete with.\n**[[Holy Spear of Light]] is a [[silver spear]] which can be invoked for to fry all undead around the player for significant damage.\n**[[Reaper]] is a [[halberd]] which does +20 to damage, a great choice for [[riding]] characters such as [[Knight]]s; as it is the second guaranteed sacrifice gift for [[Yeoman|Yeomen]], it is probably not worth a wish for them.\n**[[The Stake of Van Helsing]], the [[Undead Slayer]] quest artifact, is a [[wooden stake]] (dagger skill) that does a flat +12 to damage and provides magic resistance.\n*'''Neutral'''\n**[[Disrupter]] is a mace which deals +30 to damage to [[undead]].\n**[[Mjollnir]] is not new in SLASH'EM, but does vastly more damage (flat +24 to non-shock resistant monsters) and is the preferred neutral weapon for most fighting roles.\n*'''Chaotic'''\n**[[Bat from Hell]] is the most coveted weapon in SLASH'EM, a [[baseball bat]] (club skill) doing a flat +20 damage to all foes.\n**[[Deep Freeze]] is an [[athame]] that provides cold resistance and does extra cold damage.\n**[[Doomblade]] is a [[short sword]] which does +10 to damage with occasional bonus damage of 5d4; it is the second most powerful chaotic weapon after the [[Bat from Hell]], and may be a good choice for roles that can get Skilled in short swords but are restricted in clubs.\n**[[The Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa]] is the [[Necromancer]] quest artifact; while less powerful as a weapon that many other chaotic artifacts, it provides magic resistance and can be #invoked to recharge energy (although non-Necromancers will be [[artifact blast|blasted]] for significant damage).\n**[[Serpent's Tongue]] is not as powerful as the [[Bat from Hell]] or [[Doomblade]] at +0, but many roles that can't use either effectively can advance dagger to Expert.\n*'''Unaligned'''\n**[[Wallet of Perseus]] is a [[bag of holding]] which reduces the weight of its contents to {{frac|3}} when uncursed or {{frac|6}} when blessed.\n\n'''Non-artifacts'''\n*[[amulet of drain resistance]] &ndash; Provides [[drain resistance]], which is important against [[wand of draining|wands of draining]] and [[deep dragon]]s. It is most useful for players with no access to [[Excalibur]] or [[Stormbringer]].\n*[[amulet of flying]] &ndash; Allows a character to fly, meaning they can avoid water, trapdoors, lava, etc. and still pick up items, go down stairs, etc.\n*[[amulet versus stone]] &ndash; Like an [[amulet of life saving]] against [[stoning]] attacks, only is re-usable if re-blessed, similar to a [[scroll of scare monster]].\n*[[boots of water walking]] &ndash; Only moderately useful in vanilla, some consider these more important than [[speed boots]] or [[jumping boots]] in SLASH'EM due to the new [[create pool]] spell that monsters will use against you.\n*[[deep dragon scale mail]] &ndash; Provides [[drain resistance]], which is important against [[wand of draining|wands of draining]] and [[deep dragon]]s. It is most useful for players with no access to [[Excalibur]] or [[Stormbringer]].\n*[[figurine]] of a [[solar]] &ndash; A powerful pet, much stronger than an [[Archon]].\n*[[potion of gain level]] &ndash; Wishing for 2 or 3 potions of gain level (in the early game) will allow you to [[upgrading objects|upgrade]] mundane objects and obtain multiple [[ascension kit]] items with a single wish (such as a [[helm of brilliance]], [[helm of telepathy]], [[cloak of magic resistance]], [[magic whistle]], or [[bag of holding]], among others)\n*[[ring of polymorph control]] &ndash; Already a wish target in vanilla, this becomes even more important in SLASH'EM and can be used to transform into a very powerful [[crystal golem]] or the nigh-invincible [[giant shoggoth]] in conjunction with a [[wand of polymorph]], [[ring of polymorph]], [[polymorph trap]], [[sink]], [[chameleon]] corpse, or [[genetic engineer]].\n*[[robe of power]] &ndash; Provides the spellcasting bonus of a [[robe]] in vanilla. It is most useful for [[Monk]]s.\n*[[scroll of genocide]] &ndash; If you haven't found a scroll of genocide yet and have some identified gems, it's well worth a wish for a cursed scroll of genocide to reverse-genocide [[gypsy|gypsies]] for multiple wishes (though to do this safely, [[magic resistance]] is required). After you've identified the scroll, you're better off going for a [[magic marker]] to write it yourself.\n\nIn general, SLASH'EM has an abundance of items compared to vanilla, given all the extra dungeon branches, not to mention the [[Black market (SLASH'EM)|black market]]. If you happen to find an early [[wand of wishing]] or a mid-game [[magic lamp]], you may want to hold off on using the last wish or two until you have cleared out some of these areas. Additionally, some items which would be wish targets in vanilla can be created by the process of [[Upgrading objects|upgrading]] common items in SLASH'EM, including:\n\n*[[bag of holding]] (from [[oilskin sack]], 100% chance, or [[sack]], 20% chance)\n*[[cloak of magic resistance]] (from an [[elven cloak]] or [[oilskin cloak]], 25% chance)\n*[[gauntlets of dexterity]] (from [[leather gloves]], 50% chance)\n*[[helm of brilliance]] (from a [[dwarvish iron helm]], 50% chance)\n*[[helm of telepathy]] (from a [[dwarvish iron helm]], 50% chance)\n*[[magic whistle]] (from a [[tin whistle]], 100% chance)\n*[[saddle]] (from [[leash]], 100% chance)\n*[[tinning kit]] (from [[tin opener]], 100% chance)\n\nOther upgradable objects whose base items are rare enough that they may still be worth wishing for include:\n*[[fire horn]] (from a [[tooled horn]], 33% chance)\n*[[frost horn]] (from a [[tooled horn]], 33% chance)\n*[[magic flute]] (from a [[wooden flute]], 100% chance)\n*[[magic marker]] (from a [[crystal ball]], 100% chance)\n*[[magic harp]] (from a [[wooden harp]], 100% chance)\n*[[horn of plenty]] (from a [[tooled horn]], 33% chance)\n\nSome artifacts which are common wish targets in vanilla may be less useful in SLASH'EM:\n*[[The Master Key of Thievery]]'s [[half physical damage]] is superseded by [[The Hand of Vecna (SLASH'EM)|the Hand of Vecna]], which is available to all players; a better chaotic artifact wish may be [[the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa]]. Even better yet is the [[bat from hell]].\n*[[The Orb of Fate]]'s [[half physical damage]] is also superseded by the Hand of Vecna; it is still useful for [[half spell damage]] and [[warning]] to a lesser extent.\n*[[The Sceptre of Might]] does +5 damage instead of double damage, though [[magic resistance]] and toggle-able [[conflict]] are still valuable.\n\nAdditionally, you cannot obtain any of the six [[alignment quest]] artifacts via wishing: The Hand of Vecna, [[The Eye of the Beholder]], [[Nighthorn]], and the three [[alignment key]]s.\n\nFinally, [[polypiling]] is tougher in SLASH'EM because you need to dip an item in a [[potion of restore ability]] to make the change permanent; while this may not matter for items that can be used immediately such as potions, scrolls, and spellbooks, it has implications when polypiling for equipment like [[ring]]s or [[amulet]]s.\n\n=== UnNetHack ===\nIn [[UnNetHack]], wands of wishing are [[Wand of wishing#UnNetHack|generated recharged once]] and therefore cannot be recharged. Thus, you may not want to use your first wish on [[Scroll of charging|scrolls of charging]] like in ''NetHack''.\n\nOnly wishes from a wand can grant wishes for [[magical item]]s or [[artifact]]s. All other sources can only wish for non-magical items (with the message \"I'm sorry but I'm not able to provide you with magical items\" occurring if you try); shields of reflection are now non-magical), and thrones do not give wishes at all. Any wish is allowed to specify modifiers like \"blessed\" and \"+2\".\n\n[[Magic lamp]]s can now be wished for, since wishes from them can only grant non-magical items. Projectiles can be wished for in quantities up to 100. (Daggers are ''not'' considered projectiles.)\n\nSince UnNetHack 5.1, wishing no longer increments prayer timeout. Since UnNetHack 6, the chance of receiving an artifact is not  depending on the number of artifacts that have already been generated.\n\n[[Dragon scale mail#UnNetHack|Chromatic dragon scales and scale mail]] and [[Thiefbane]] cannot be wished for; unidentified [[dragon scale mail]] is replaced by a random one. Since UnNetHack 5.1, wishing for chromatic dragon eggs is no longer possible. Wishing for statues or figurines of chromatic dragons no longer work since UnNetHack 5.2.0. See [[Chromatic dragon (UnNetHack)]] for details.\n\nWishing for \"reflecting/magic dragon scales (not mail)\" is allowed only if you have identified it; alternatively, wishing for \"guivre scales\" or \"leviathan scales\" is fine, but you will need to observe these dragons in combat to know which property is held by which race. If you find a wand of wishing before meeting a dragon, and would like dragon scale mail, wish for glowing dragon scale mail, as at the very least you end up with a permanent light source and could end up with (one in five chance of) reflection or [[magic resistance]]. See [[Dragon#UnNetHack|Dragon § UnNetHack]] for changes to dragons in particular.\n\nGood non-magical items include:\n* [[shield of reflection]]\n* [[stethoscope]]\n* [[athame]]\n* [[can of grease]]\n* [[tinning kit]]\n* [[oilskin sack]]\n* 5000 [[gold piece]]s\n* [[chickatrice]] corpse\n* [[leather drum]]\n* [[tin of spinach|tins of spinach]]\n* [[silver saber]]\n* [[silver spear]]\n* 100 [[silver arrow]]s\n* [[t-shirt]]\n* [[oilskin cloak]]\n* 3 [[dragon]] eggs\n* [[crystal pick]]\n\n=== GruntHack ===\n[[GruntHack]] allows wishes for objects with compatible [[Object materials (GruntHack)|materials]] and [[Object properties|properties]], including magical items, making wishes in general much more powerful. A few recommended wishes are listed below:\n\n* blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide cloak of magic resistance and reflection\n* blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide water walking boots of speed \n* blessed greased fixed +3 yellow dragon scale mail of drain resistance\n* blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide gauntlets of dexterity and power\n\n====Monster wishes====\nGruntHack also allows monsters to wish for items via a smoky potion or a wand of wishing - monsters will never use magic lamps. Monsters will wish for a [[scroll of charging]] if they have a non-recharged wand of wishing, and will otherwise randomly wish for one of the following items:\n\n* blessed greased fixed +3 silver dragon scale mail\n* blessed greased fixed +3 gray dragon scale mail\n* blessed greased fixed +3 cloak of magic resistance\n* blessed greased fixed amulet of reflection\n* blessed greased fixed shield of reflection\n* blessed greased fixed +3 speed boots\n* blessed greased fixed +3 gauntlets of power\n* blessed greased fixed amulet of life saving\n* blessed greased fixed wand of death\n* blessed greased fixed partly eaten chickatrice corpse\n\nMonsters will not wish for items that grant properties they already have, e.g., a [[strong]] monster will never wish for gauntlets of power, and an [[Angel]] will never wish for a cloak of magic resistance. Additionally, they will never wish for things they cannot use - monsters that are too big for torso armor will not wish for cloaks or armor, and monsters who lack gloves and [[stoning resistance]] will never wish for a chickatrice corpse. If chickatrices are genocided, monsters will wish for a cockatrice corpse; if cockatrices are also genocided, they will try to wish for the corpse anyway and receive a random corpse.\n\n=== xNetHack ===\nIn [[xNetHack]], wands of wishing always explode when recharged and will turn to dust when they reach 0 charges. xNetHack also allows you to wish for magic lamps, but unlike [[UnNetHack]], wishes from djinn are not restricted to non-magical items. Since you cannot get more than one wish from a magic lamp, the main use of this is for a permanent light source.\n\nThe probability of successfully wishing for an artifact is changed to {{sfrac|''n'' + 1}}, where ''n'' is the number of artifacts you have received by wishing. Artifacts generated in any other way are ''not'' taken into account. This means the first artifact wish is guaranteed, and subsequent ones have probabilities of {{frac|2}}, {{frac|3}}, {{frac|4}}, etc.\n\nAlthough xNetHack implements [[object materials (xNetHack)|object materials]], the material of a wished-for item cannot be specified outside of [[wizard mode]]. An item received by wishing always has its base material.\n\n=== dNetHack ===\n\nIn [[dNetHack]], wands of wishing have been removed and replaced with rings of wishing and [[Candle_of_invocation|candles of invocation]]. A candle of invocation can be used once to summon either a djinn, pet, or demon and then is consumed; summoning a djinn grants one wish.\n\nRings of wishing can be used several times and must be worn and invoked to make a wish. A ring of wishing replaces the wand of wishing in the chest in the Castle.\n\nWishing for artifacts have been significantly reworked as well. Rather than counting the number of artifacts that already exist, the player starts with one artifact wish available and gains the ability to wish for another artifact based on two events:\n\n*Sitting on the [[throne]] inside the [[Castle]]\n*Giving an artifact to each of the five [[priest of an unknown god|priests of an unknown god]]\n\nEach event allows the player to wish for one more artifact. Gifts or named artifacts have no direct effects on your artifact wish abilities. \n\nWhile there are [[dNetHack artifacts|many additional artifacts in dNetHack]], many of them are unwishable, including quest artifacts. However, there are several good candidates for wishing that should be considered:\n\n*[[DNetHack_artifacts#Aegis|Aegis]], which grants reflection and half physical damage and can be invoked downward for an instant triple Gorgoneia ward\n*The [[DNetHack_artifacts#Lance_of_Longinus|Lance of Longinus]], which when wielded, conveys half physical and spell damage, magic resistance, and reflection (though you could be in extreme peril if you lose the weapon or get disarmed)\n*The [[DNetHack_artifacts#Premium_Heart|Premium Heart]], gauntlets of power that also improve dexterity, provide double damage, and have increased damage multipliers for various status ailments\n\n===FIQHack===\n\nIn [[FIQHack]] you can wish for a magic lamp (and receive it).\n\n===EvilHack===\n[[EvilHack]] also allows wishes for objects with specific [[EvilHack#Object materials|materials]] and [[EvilHack#Object properties|properties]] similar to GruntHack, with several changes and refinements to wishing in general.\n\n====Object materials and properties====\nWishes for objects that are inherently magical will not apply additional object properties, though magical items can very rarely generate with them; wishing for a \"magical <magical armor>\" (e.g. \"magical dragonhide speed boots\") has a {{frac|10}} chance of giving the resulting armor a random (possibly negative) object property. Wished items also cannot have more than one object property - however, there is a {{frac|100,000}} chance of an eligible item randomly generating with two properties. Artifacts have fixed object materials, and cannot be wished for with other materials or object properties.\n\n====Wish sources====\nWishes from thrones are much more rare: there is close to a {{frac|3|200}} chance (1.5%) of getting a wish from sitting on a throne, and the throne is guaranteed to disappear if the player is granted a wish.\n \nWands of wishing are much rarer to find via random generation, and will always generated as charged once (1:x). The Castle's guaranteed wand is always created as having never been charged (0:x).\n\n====Artifact wishes====\nSpecial rules are applied when wishing for artifacts: the odds of an artifact wish succeeding are {{frac|1|X + 1}}, where ''X'' is the number of previous artifact wishes made. However, if you would successfully receive the artifact, there is a chance that the artifact will instead be generated in the possession of its hostile 'owner', who is placed next to you. The odds that a wished artifact will not come with its owner is also {{frac|1|X + 1}}, where ''X'' is the number of previous artifact wishes made.\n\nThe owner of an artifact depends on the specific artifact that was wished for:\n\n* [[Quest artifact]]s will almost always generate the quest leader associated with it - the sole exception is a [[Tourist]] wishing for the Master Key of Thievery: as the [[Master of Thieves]] is their nemesis, this wish will generate a [[Rogue (player monster)|rogue]] [[player monster]] instead.\n* For other artifacts, those that have a specific role associated with them will generate a player monster of that role with the artifact. Artifacts that do not have a specific role associated with them will still generate a player monster of a specific role, with that role depending on your own alignment in certain cases.\n\nIn addition, the following artifacts cannot be generated by wishing, with the reason given for each:\n\n* [[Lifestealer]], always generated in the possession of [[Vlad the Impaler]]\n* The [[Magic 8-Ball]], always generated in the possession of [[Oracle (monster)|the Oracle]]\n* [[The Sword of Kas]], always generated in the possession of [[Kas]]\n* The [[Bag of the Hesperides]], always generated in the [[Ice Queen's Realm]]\n* [[Butcher]], always generated in the possession of [[Yeenoghu]]\n* [[The Eye of Vecna]] and [[The Hand of Vecna (EvilHack)|the Hand of Vecna]], either of which is generated upon defeating [[Vecna]] without disintegrating him, digesting him or stoning him\n* [[The Wand of Orcus]], always generated in the possession of [[Orcus]]\n* [[The One Ring]], always generated in [[Gollum]]'s cave within [[Goblin Town]]\n* All [[Forge (dungeon feature)#Artifacts|forge-made]] artifacts\n\n====Wish strategy====\n[[Hardfought]] has [https://www.hardfought.org/xlogfiles/evilhack/wishtracker a wish tracker] for EvilHack that keeps a list of wishes made by players on the server. The recommendations listed below are based on some of the recorded wishes.\n\nWorthwhile wishes for EvilHack characters include:\n\n* '''blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide Hawaiian shirt/T-shirt of decay''' - The shirt slot's armor is great for providing additional AC and properties to non-giant characters, and drain resistance is among the most valuable properties.\n* blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide speed boots\n* '''blessed greased fixed +3 bone gauntlets of power''' - This wish is common for illithid characters, who have incredibly low caps to [[strength]] and [[constitution]], and bone is among the lightest possible materials for the gauntlets. Depending on personal preferences, stone may be a preferable material: it is much heavier compared to the base material of iron, but provides more base AC.\n* '''uncursed magic marker''' - Magic markers are as valuable as ever, and are made more so by the fact that they do not generate randomly, with a scant few levels where a marker may generate.\n* '''Magic lamps''' - magic lamps are a common choice of light source, and cursed magic lamps instead emit an aura of darkness in the same radius that overrides any light source. Magic lamps will keep working while the character is underwater or engulfed.\n\n====Monster wishes====\nEvilHack allows monsters to wish for items via a smoky potion or a wand of wishing. Additionally, if a player generates a hostile djinni from a lamp or potion, the djinni may choose to keep the wish for themselves. Monsters will not wish for items that grant properties they already have, and will never wish for things they cannot use. Monsters that have an empty wand of wishing and come across a scroll of charging will use that scroll on the wand.\n\nMonsters will randomly wish for one of the following items, with alternate wishes depending on whether or not the monster can use the original item rolled:\n\n* 1-3 blessed potions of gain level\n* A figurine of an Archon, balrog, vorpal jabberwock, or woodchuck, with an equal probability of each\n* blessed erodeproofed amulet of life saving\n* blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 cloak of displacement, or a wand of digging otherwise\n* blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 gauntlets of dexterity, or a blessed potion of full healing otherwise\n* blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 cloak of magic resistance, or a blessed erodeproofed wand of create monster otherwise\n* blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 crystal plate mail, or a blessed erodeproofed bag of holding otherwise\n* blessed erodeproofed amulet of flying, or a blessed potion of full healing otherwise\n* blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 water walking boots, or a blessed erodeproofed ring of slow digestion otherwise\n* blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 shield of reflection if humanoid, blessed erodeproofed amulet of reflection if non-humanoid, or a blessed potion of extra healing otherwise\n* blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 gauntlets of power, or a cursed potion of gain level otherwise\n* blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 speed boots, or a blessed potion of full healing otherwise\n* blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 helm of telepathy, or a blessed potion of extra healing otherwise\n* blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 helm of brilliance, or a blessed blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 unicorn horn otherwise\n* blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 cloak of protection, or a blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 ring of protection otherwise\n* a blessed erodeproofed +1 to +4 random artifact that matches the monster's alignment - this wish can fail if it selects an artifact that is already generated\n* one of a wand of cancellation, a wand of polymorph or a wand of death, blessed and erodeproofed with an equal probability of each\n* 1-3 cockatrice eggs\n* cursed potion of gain level\n\n== External links ==\n* The [http://nh.gmuf.com/wish.html NetHack Wishing Spoiler] by Peter Snelling, Stanislav Traykov, and others provides a detailed analysis of how to wish effectively, including a list of specific wishes ordered by priority.\n* In the [[Dudley's dungeon]] of [http://www.nicolaas.net/dudley/index.php?f=20050819 19 August 2005], Dudley wishes for a \"blessed greased fixed erodeproof disenchanterproof demonpossessionproof vacuumofdeepspaceproof proofremovalproof fully insured 100% all-natural materials completely and utterly intact, undamaged and structurally sound freshly washed and free of the stench of congealed human blood totally bereft of ancient unbreakable curses and absolutely NOT stolen from any nearby easily-angered shopkeepers +3 armor enhancement GRAY DRAGON SCALE MAIL\".

Click here for more information.](/images/5/5d/Nh343var-icon.png)](/wiki/NetHackWiki:Next_version \"This article describes a 3.4.3-based variant of NetHack. Click here for more information.\")\n\nA NetHack variant based on [NetHack4](/wiki/NetHack4 \"NetHack4\") that focuses on AI, balance, and interface improvements.\n\nSource code is hosted [here](https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack)\n\n[Tips on how to play!](/wiki/FIQHack/Pointers \"FIQHack/Pointers\")\n\nYou can play it online at\n\n- US: <https://www.hardfought.org/> (in-browser or ssh nethack\\@hardfought.org)\n- EU: <https://eu.hardfought.org/> (in-browser or ssh nethack\\@eu.hardfought.org)\n- AU: <https://au.hardfought.org/> (in-browser or ssh nethack\\@au.hardfought.org)\n\nOr download 4.3.0 at [GitHub](https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/releases)\n\nSince NetHack4 is based off NetHack 3.4.3 (via NitroHack + AceHack), consider 3.4.3 as the \"baseline\" rather than 3.6.0.\n\nMost of the changes and updates below have been added to the relevant individual pages in this wiki.\n\n## Version 4.3.0\n\n### Changes applicable to junethack 2016\n\n- Wands have been [rebalanced](/wiki/Wands_Balance_Patch \"Wands Balance Patch\")\n\n- Floating eyes now have passive slow and a slowness gaze effect instead of the NH4 \"feature\" where you can't attack them\n\n- [Energy regeneration](/wiki/Energy_regeneration \"Energy regeneration\") greatly boosted for the early game. EoTA users, however, should expect generally slightly less energy. Energy is now based on wisdom and experience level only, with Wizards getting a boost, and people with energy regeneration (EoTA) getting a bigger one.\n\n  - +1pw/turn for eregen\n  - +0.33pw/turn for wizards\n  - +0.03\\*wisdom pw/turn for wisdom if your wisdom is higher than 3\n  - +0.03\\*level pw/turn\n  - Changed past 4.3.0 (applicable to Junethack 2018) to 0.02\\*Wis instead of 0.03\\*Wis and 0.04\\*level instead of 0.03\\*level\n\n- Added 4 spells, all of which are level 7\n\n  - spellbook of charging (equivalent to an uncursed [scroll of charging](/wiki/Scroll_of_charging \"Scroll of charging\")), enchantment spell\n  - spellbook of phase (21-60 turns of [phasing](/wiki/Phasing \"Phasing\"), stacks), escape spell\n  - spellbook of astral eyesight (11-30 turns of xray, stacks. Note that the xray range in FIQHack is 8, not 3), divination spell\n  - spellbook of [summon nasty](/wiki/Summon_nasties \"Summon nasties\") (equivalent to vanilla monster spell, summons tame monsters if you target it at a hostile monster), clerical spell\n\n- Added spell maintenance\n  - Some spells can now be \"maintained\", slowly draining Pw but applying a continuous effect. [More info](/wiki/Spell_maintenance \"Spell maintenance\")\n\n- Improvements to the monster AI\n\n  - Monsters now [cast player spells](/wiki/FIQHack/Monster_spellcasting \"FIQHack/Monster spellcasting\") instead of monster spells, and can learn new spells from spellbooks\n  - Monsters now use items significantly more intelligently\n  - They now use almost every useful amulet, wand, scroll, potion and spell\n  - They now wear rings\n  - They use containers now, both bags in their inventory and looting containers from the floor (The Castle chest is special cased to prevent them from looting the castle wand and exhaust it a la Grunt)\n\n- Players can now be slowed and/or [canceled](/wiki/Canceled \"Canceled\")\n\n  - Slowness can be given from being in the view of a floating eye, being hit by the slow monster [wand](/wiki/Wand_of_slow_monster \"Wand of slow monster\") or [spell](/wiki/Spellbook_of_slow_monster \"Spellbook of slow monster\").\n  - Makes you half as fast as without it.\n  - Can only be \"cured\" by waiting it out.\n  - Being canceled is **permanent until cured**.\n  - Cancellation prevents you from making any use of your Pw/energy.\n  - Also prevents a majority of special attacks similar to monsters (only relevant for polyself).\n  - Considered a [major trouble](/wiki/Major_trouble \"Major trouble\").\n  - Can also be cured by quaffing a noncursed [potion of gain energy](/wiki/Potion_of_gain_energy \"Potion of gain energy\"), reading a [scroll of charging](/wiki/Scroll_of_charging \"Scroll of charging\") while confused or stepping onto a [magic trap](/wiki/Magic_trap \"Magic trap\") and getting the \"You are caught in a magical explosion!\" effect (which is far more common than usual if canceled).\n\n- Monster intrinsic/extrinsic system now works like players (in fact, players now use the new monster intrinsic system too). This means that monster has a lot of new intrinsics/extrinsics to play around with. This also means that illness, sliming, strangulation and petrification are gradual processes for monsters now. Eating corpses/jewelry confer new intrinsics (but only pets eat corpses at present).\n\n- The \"curse items\" harassment and unlucky throne effect now curses 3x as many items, and [Magicbane](/wiki/Magicbane \"Magicbane\") only reduces its effect by 2/3 rather than making it not apply 95% of the time, to compensate for the removal of the \"curse items\" monster spell\n\n- Bones can be scarier -- the ghost now gets the same intrinsics as the late player, and each bones has a 33% of replacing the ghost with an alive [player monster](/wiki/Player_monster \"Player monster\") with the same inventory as the late player, the same spells and the same intrinsics/etc\n\n- Improved player monster ascension kit on Astral\n\n- Buffed #turn\n\n  - The helpless duration scales with level, from 5 turns at XL1 down to 1 whole turn at level 24 to merely a single action at XL30\n  - [Mitre of Holiness](/wiki/Mitre_of_Holiness \"Mitre of Holiness\") now allows you to pray inside Gehennom while worn -- this includes normal praying as well as usage of #turn\n\n- You can wish for [magic lamps](/wiki/Magic_lamp \"Magic lamp\")\n\n### Changes applicable to junethack 2017\n\n- Poison instadeath has been replaced with permanent (not possible to restore with potion or unihorn) attribute damage\n\n- Nerfed conflict back to vanilla levels -- no longer works on ranged combat\n\n- Buffed martial arts -- glove enchantment now matters, and it no longer does only 1 damage 25% of the time\n\n- Zombies will now cure corpses in an area around them and cause zombification disease when attacking. Undead now grudge living and vice versa\n\n  - When zombies cure corpses in an area, the revived monsters are either converted to zombies (if there is a corresponding zombie variant of said monster), or enslaved under the command of the reviver (the zombie), thus having the same grudges/attackings/etc. These are denoted with \"enslaved\" in messages (The enslaved kitten hits! etc)\n  - Zombification disease is a delayed instadeath timer somewhat similar to illness that start at 100 and decreases by 10 each successive hit\n  - It can be cured by the same means as regular illness or food poisoning (including being considered a major trouble for prayer)\n  - As long as you have more than 40 turns (50 as of 2020) to live, the disease wears off naturally over time if there is no zombies nearby\n  - When the timer decreases below 40 turns (50 as of 2020) (where it will never wear off by itself), the game makes this very clear, so don't worry about missing it\n  - Minor zombification disease (41+ turns left, 51+ turns as of 2020) never kills\n\n- Added [object properties](/wiki/Object_properties \"Object properties\").\n\n- Greatly improved [searching](/wiki/Search#FIQhack \"Search\")\n\n- Lenses now provide automatic searching\n\n- The mines brightness is now consistent. Upper mines are always bright, lower mines are always dark.\n\n- The Oracle can now provide enlightenment, for a cost\n\n- Rings dropped in sinks to identify them can now be retrieved by destroying the sink and digging a pit on the square (they're buried)\n\n- Changed identification\n\n  - They now all ID 1/2/3/4/all objects at random\n  - Cursed scroll/unskilled spell now only identifies object type, appearance and artifacts\n  - Uncursed scroll/basic spell also IDs enchantment, object properties, charge count, tin content and egg type\n  - Skilled spell also IDs BUC\n  - Blessed scroll/expert spell also identifies fooproof state (Blessed scroll also IDs BUC as per above)\n\n- Changed spell levels\n\n  - Dig is level 2\n  - Identify is level 2\n  - Cancellation is level 5\n  - Teleport away is level 5\n  - Polymorph is level 7\n  - Create familiar is level 2\n\n- Magic missile now does less damage at lower skills than Expert. However, they can now disrupt reflection at Skilled and semi-bypass MR (so MR only halves damage) at Expert. The Magic Mirror of Merlin's double damage will not apply to other Knights (including yourself), to compensate. Watch out for lategame magic missile users!\n\n- Tweaked starting inventory, mostly making the random optional stuff guaranteed. Tourist and Wizards get more significant changes (Tourists get *all* of their formerly optional tools, Wizards no longer get scrolls, potions, rings, and can only start with wands of striking, but start with 4 spells instead (force bolt, magic missile, 2 random)). Only tourists can start with markers, and they always get it\n\n- Quarterstaves enhance spellcasting like robes, and now allows spellcasting even if cursed welded to you\n\n- Magicbane is now a quarterstaff\n\n- Level gain changes\n\n  - A new EXP formula was created, it's now generally much easier to gain new levels after level 10\n  - Level draining melee is no longer MC-protected, and will now drain a full level\n  - While level drained, you now gain significantly boosted EXP, and blessed full healing can now regains all lost levels, not just half of them (with the other half permanently lost)\n\n- Lowlevel casters (kobold shamans, orc shamans and gnomish wizards) no longer approach you in melee, since they have no melee capabilities whatsoever but instead try to find a line up to you and stay there. This makes them significantly more dangerous as a result and are no longer trivial pushovers\n\n- Make dragons much faster (same speed as horses: speed 9 -> 20)\n\n  - Their breath has a chance (per breath) to semi-bypass reflection (as skilled ray-type wands). Disintegration will never bypass reflection\n  - Also improve their AI significantly, making them move around much more tactically\n\n- Armor weight changes\n\n  - Wearing armor now weight half as much\n  - Armor weight was increased in general\n  - The net effect is generally that armor weights slightly less if worn\n  - Dragon armor now weight 300 instead of 40 (150 if worn)\n    - For comparision, mithril coats weight 200 (100 if worn)\n  - Cloak of magic resistance is now MC2. Cloak of displacement is MC3\n    - Magic resistance is generally more useful, CoD was hardly ever used\n  - Crystal plate mail now gives AC:0/Def:10\n  - Dwarvish roundshields give AC:7/Def:3\n\n- Oilskin cloaks and white dragon scales/mail now protects against inventory water damage\n\n- [Shimmering dragons](/wiki/Shimmering_dragon \"Shimmering dragon\") exist, as do their scales, which grant displacement.\n\n- [Wizard of Yendor](/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor \"Wizard of Yendor\") will no longer steal your quest artifact\n\n- Sokoban monsters are never generated peaceful\n\n- Potions/scrolls/books/wands are no longer destroyed if you have the applicable extrinsic. Only having it extrinsically protects against it, not intrinsically.\n\n- You can throw items (any item except for ammo from an appropriate launcher) to intelligent non-paralyzed pets to force them to pick it up (by catching it).\n\n- Wands of create monster was decreased from 11-15 charges to 4-8. In addition, instead of summoning 1/2/3/4/5+d7 (with a 1/23 chance of summoning +d7 on lower levels too), it now summons 1/d2/d4/d8/d16 with no additional monsters.\n\n- Buffed [Tsurugi of Muramasa](/wiki/Tsurugi_of_Muramasa \"Tsurugi of Muramasa\") -- now does double damage (instead of +1d8) and can be invoked to uncurse itself.\n\n- Added classic\\_status from DynaHack which gives the bottom status bar a look similar to NetHack 3\n\n- Sparkle is now a numeric option, allowing you to select how long it animates\n\n- Gave colored DSM and scales (not silver/gray) new benefits:\n\n  - Red: [Infravision](/wiki/Infravision \"Infravision\") (2017), [Warning](/wiki/Warning \"Warning\"). and [See invisible](/wiki/See_invisible \"See invisible\") (2018) (in addition to the normal fire resistance)\n  - White: Protects against water damage to your inventory items (2017), [automatic searching](/wiki/Automatic_searching \"Automatic searching\") with enchantment contributing to search bonus, as the ring (2018), gives swimming and magical breathing (2020) (in addition to the normal cold resistance)\n  - Orange: [Free action](/wiki/Free_action \"Free action\") (in addition to the normal sleep resistance)\n  - Black: [Drain resistance](/wiki/Drain_resistance \"Drain resistance\") (in addition to the normal disintegration resistance)\n  - Blue: [Speed](/wiki/Speed \"Speed\"), slow monster immunity (in addition to the normal shock resistance)\n  - Green: [Sickness](/wiki/Sickness \"Sickness\") resistance (in addition to the normal poison resistance)\n  - Yellow: [Stoning](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\") resistance (in addition to the normal acid resistance)\n  - Shimmering: Stun resistance (2018) (in addition to the normal displacement)\n\n### Changes applicable to junethack 2018\n\n- Further buffs to DSM (see above)\n\n- New feature, \"find\", available through Ctrl+F. Allows you to search for objects you remember seeing. [Example](http://home.fiq.se/obj_search.png)\n\n- Fixed a bug where maintaining the protection spell would give you more Def than supposed to\n\n- Wands of create monster now spawn 1/3 times as often as previously in monster inventories\n\n- Extrinsic fire resistance now prevents items from burning, waterproofness prevents rusting and acid res prevents corroding\n\n- Changed scroll writing for unknown scrolls and spells: Instead of being Luck dependant, you now have a XL/50 chance of success. Priests get a +20 bonus to effective XL when calculating their chance, so at XL30 they can always write unknown scrolls.\n\n- Autoswap: when you attempt to fire a projectile, an appropriate launcher in your alternate weapon slot will be automatically equipped to fire the projectile. This does not cost a turn. Similarly, if you are currently wielding a launcher, attempting to move into a hostile monster will automatically attack with a melee weapon in the alternate weapon slot, or with unarmed if no weapon is available there. (note: swapping between your primary weapon and alternate weapon already did not cost a turn, which is a feature inherited from [Nethack4](/wiki/Nethack4 \"Nethack4\").)\n\n- The inventory sidebar show total weight and carrying capacity as well as slot count\n\n- Changed artigifting/artiwishing\n\n  - Only gifted artifacts affects the rate of future artifact gifts\n  - Only wished-for artifacts affect the rate of future artifact wishes\n  - Artiwishing rate was nerfed to compensate (Old: 100%, 100%, 66%, 50%, 40%, ..., New: 100%, 50%, 33%, 25%, 20%, ...)\n\n- You can now alias spells\n\n  - 'quiver' (and 'fire' if nothing is quivered) will now prompt if you want to quiver a spell. This way you can use 'f' to fire spells\n  - A new command, 'castalias' was added, allowing you to alias keys to spells by mapping keys to it (Options -> interface -> keymap) and invoking it. This allows you to alias more than a single spell to keys.\n\n- HP regeneration rate was changed\n\n  - +1hp/turn for regen\n  - +0.33hp/turn for healers\n  - +0.03\\*level hp/turn\n  - +0.03\\*(constitution - 5) hp/turn\n  - min cap is +0.01 hp/turn\n  - Hunger from [ring of regeneration](/wiki/Ring_of_regeneration \"Ring of regeneration\") only applies when you aren't at maximum HP.\n\n- You can now get into the Quest at XL10 instead of XL14.\n\n- Buffed crowning slightly.\n\n  - It now gives intrinsic [acid resistance](/wiki/Acid_resistance \"Acid resistance\")\n  - In addition to this, it also gives you permanent knowledge of your role's \"special spell\".\n  - Since this would make the crowning gift a [monk](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\") gets redundant, they now get a magic marker.\n\n- New object, [potion of wonder](/wiki/Potion_of_wonder \"Potion of wonder\")\n  - Generation: 10/1000 of all potions. Some of the 42/1000 potions was changed to 40/1000 to compensate (confusion, gain ability, booze, sickness, fruit juice)\n\n- New item properties, nasty (+3d6 damage but does +1d6 to the user on each hit or miss) and carrying (+10% carrycap, stacks with other items of carrying)\n\n- Objects now merge regardless of object knowledge, combining the knowledge. Previously, this was only the case for BUC knowledge\n\n- Archeologists gets a bonus to base searching rate (+10)\n\n- You can now ID/appraise enchantment of weapons based on your proficiency with it\n\n  - Unskilled users can't appraise weapons at all (similar to vanilla)\n  - Basic will learn enchantment with a 1% chance per hit\n  - Skilled will learn enchantment with a 10% chance per hit\n  - Expert users can see enchantment immediately without using the weapon (If you reached Expert while wielding it, a hit will reveal it)\n\n- Life saving will not apply if the player is nonliving.\n\n- Remove the prevention of fire and frost on weapons stacking\n\n- Change spellbook mechanics to reduce tedium\n\n  - You now learn a spell for 60k instead of 20k turns\n  - Reading the book successfully and (re)learning something from it will destroy the book\n  - Roles no longer start knowing their starting spells but has to read them. This only really matter for Wizards -- everyone else can read their book(s) on turn 1 due to always being blessed. Wizards get force bolt and magic missile preblessed, the others can be uncursed or blessed\n  - As a result, this means that you can only cast \"confuse self\" from T:60001 and onwards assuming you got the spell at T:1. This was anticipated, but not considered a problem.\n  - Since spellbooks now lack charges, this means you can polypile books indefinitely and relearn/learn spells from them. However, the book will disappear when you successfully (re)learn a spell, as usual.\n\n- Monsters now have proper Pw/energy, meaning they can potentially cast several spells in quick succession and no longer uses a cooldown system. This makes spellcasters, particularly latergame ones, more dangerous\n\n- Perseus is now guaranteed to drop a shield of reflection and levitation boots\n\n- Buffed some artifacts\n\n  - [Cleaver](/wiki/Cleaver \"Cleaver\") now hits in an arc, hitting monsters at left and right of your main target.\n    - Vanilla's Cleaver was inspired by this change, but in vanilla, this can hurt non-hostile monsters. In FIQHack, Cleaver will not hit non-hostile monsters unless you explicitly attack them directly.\n  - [Trollsbane](/wiki/Trollsbane \"Trollsbane\") now give hungerless regeneration\n  - [Dragonbane](/wiki/Dragonbane \"Dragonbane\") is now a lance, gives reflection, and has halved weight (180wt -> 90wt)\n  - [Sunsword](/wiki/Sunsword \"Sunsword\") blocks blindness, like Eyes of the Overworld\n  - [Demonbane](/wiki/Demonbane \"Demonbane\") is now a silver saber and will prevent demon gating\n  - These artifacts now do +1d20 instead of x2 vs their bane: Dragonbane, Demonbane, [Werebane](/wiki/Werebane \"Werebane\"), [Giantslayer](/wiki/Giantslayer \"Giantslayer\"), [Ogresmasher](/wiki/Ogresmasher \"Ogresmasher\"), Trollsbane, Sunsword\n  - Dragonbane is now the 1st sacrifice gift for Knights\n\n- Blessed [scrolls of teleportation](/wiki/Scroll_of_teleportation \"Scroll of teleportation\") will now, instead of prompting for if you want to teleport, allow you to perform a controlled teleporation whether you have [teleport control](/wiki/Teleport_control \"Teleport control\") or not.\n\n- Added monster lookup. Either specify a monster with '/', or use ':' instead of '.' when farlooking with ';' for info.\n\n- New racial choices\n\n  - Dwarven knights\n  - Elven monks\n  - Orcish priests\n  - Gnomish tourists\n\n- You can displace peacefuls. Monsters can, too; tame, hostile or other peacefuls.\n\n- Altars are colored based on alignment. Lawful is white, neutral gray, chaotic black (or blue in !use\\_darkgray). Unaligned altars are red, \"aligned altars\" (Astral) are yellow.\n\n- Being slow will now block all forms of intrinsic and extrinsic speed while going on.\n\n- Item destruction is rarer: 50% if cursed, 25% if uncursed, 6.25% is blessed. Wands lose charges instead of being destroyed, unless it's emptied, or was already empty/cancelled.\n\n- Lamps, candles, whatever, now has their light radius depend on BUC.\n\n- The Wizard of Yendor can only use Double Trouble once per respawn\n\n- Nerfed disintegration. It will now disenchant gear until it no longer provides AC, then disintegrate it\n\n- Slow monster can be resisted 66% with free action, and 100% with blue dragon scale (mail). Quaffing blessed potions of speed will also make it go away.\n\n- The Amulet now gives slotless aggravate monster.\n\n- The [spellbook of haste self](/wiki/Spellbook_of_haste_self \"Spellbook of haste self\") is now the spellbook of speed monster. It works basically the same except that it can now be used on others.\n\n- Added \"true\" female monster names: gnome ladies, Elvenqueens, etc.\n\n- Pressing > or < when not at a stair will prompt for travelling to the corresponding map symbol without the need to invoke \\_ first.\n\n- Make it possible to, if your outermost armor is greased or is an oilskin cloak (or has the oilskin property), squeeze through tight diagonal spaces with twice as much inventory as normal.\n\n- Add autounlock to automatically unlock doors upon walking onto them\n\n- Improve polearm usage\n\n  - Applying a polearm will preselect an appropriate position\n  - Using 'f'ire while wielding a polearm with an empty quiver will, if possible, use the polearm.\n  - As with launchers, using 'f' with polearms this way works with autoswap\n\n- Gremlins are able to steal intrinsics both at day and night\n\n- Give remembered item amount in a container. Similar to 3.6.0, but will not change if container content changes outside your watch.\n\n- You can now see when you last prayed / angered your god / etc, using Ctrl+x a\n\n- Candle radius now increases quadratically rather than with log7 (1 candle gives radius 2, 4 gives 3, 9 gives 4, 16 gives 5...)\n\n- The guaranteed marker for Tourists is now 0:0.\n\n- Shop content is now automatically IDed for Tourists\n\n- Spellbook level now depends on weight: 30 for blank paper, 35 for level 1 books, 40 for level 2, 45 for level 3... in steps of 5.\n\n- Magic whistles will not recall pets on noteleport levels unless it's blessed\n\n- Fire/frost horns deal (XL)d6 damage. Prevents rare unfair deaths to someone finding one early\n\n- Resistances to fire/cold/shock/sleep/poison/acid can now be partial\n\n  - Immunities are granted by extrinsics as well as trinsics you have from the getgo -- not ones you get over the course of the game (leveling up, corpses, crowning, potions of wonder or similar)\n  - Otherwise, the resistance is partial. A partial resistance will generally halve the damage, with the exception of...\n  - Fire immunity will shield you from lava.\n  - Poison deals half damage when it does damage, and reduces attributes (including permanently) only a third of the time. Attribute loss is also reduced to a third.\n  - Sleep resistance will only make you sleep for a third of the time, and taking any damage will wake you up.\n  - Amulets of restful sleep now confer sleep resistance (but not sleep immunity).\n  - Rings of resistance has been renamed to rings of immunity to reflect this change. For example, the ring of fire resistance is now the ring of fire immunity.\n\n- Message history includes turncount\n\n- Add msgfading option and change msgcolor\n\n  - msgfading can be specified as fade (default, darkens colors), blank (blanks the message line completely) or don't change (don't change old messages in any way).\n  - msgcolor can now be either full (default), gray (like previous disabled) and white (makes active messages white and old ones gray)\n  - For those who want to mimic NAO unix tty windowport: set msgfading to blank, msgcolor to gray.\n\n- Quest nemeses no longer respect Elbereth (or scare monster).\n\n## 4.3.1 (in development)\n\n### Changes applicable to junethack 2018\n\n- (Pick)axes of mercy will now heal you if whacked at yourself\n\n- Fire/cold/shock/sleep/poison attacks are no longer protected by MC\n\n- Strength works differently: it now works like an ordinary attribute rather than being special past 18. Elves keep their 18 strength cap, gnomes reach 19, orcs 20, humans and dwarves 21.\n\n- Oilskin sacks no longer generate (because the oilskin object property exists). Saddles are now twice as common.\n\n- Artifact lances (Dragonbane) now comes with a free saddle and riding unrestriction included, entirely free of charge.\n\n- The \"autounlock\" option now works on chests, prompting for unlocking them directly from #loot if locked.\n\n- Monsters are now able to jump.\n\n- Added special watchmode support for dgamelaunch's benefit (might also help potential future NH4-mode FIQHack servers)\n\n- When you receive [alignment](/wiki/Alignment \"Alignment\") penalties, your alignment is first set to zero, then you receive the penalty\n\n- When considering what equipment to wear, pets will prefer items thrown at it over anything else, the more recently thrown the better.\n\n- You can now kill your quest leader to open the portal to the downstairs\n\n- Fort Ludios will now appear on the first level below dlvl10 with a vault\n\n- Level teleporters no longer disappear on use\n  - Catacombs traps was changed to regular teleporters due to this\n\n- Alchemy smocks (aprons) are now MC3 instead of MC1.\n\n- Boomerangs now work like Mjollnir when thrown\n\n- Changed throwing return success: instead of failing 1% of the time, artifacts now never fail (unless you're impaired), and boomerangs fail 1/Dex of the time (and have a further 1/Dex chance of hitting you in the return)\n\n- Death fields from skilled+ wand of death now halve HP and deal 6d6 (in that order), rather than kill you outright, if you lack magic resistance\n\n- Slight damage reduction nerf: now takes the AC rolled between -1 and effective AC when deciding to-hit as \"effective AC\" when determining damage reduction\n\n- Using a blessed stethoscope is a free action\n\n- Minor changes to Plane of Water: all bubbles are now visible at all times, but you can no longer levitate between them\n\n- Energy regen tweaked slightly: 0.02\\*Wis instead of 0.03\\*Wis and 0.04\\*XL instead of 0.03\\*XL.\n\n- Spellbook of protection nerfed:\n  - Now only works if not wearing body armor\n\n- Snickersnee now grants free action\n\n- Player monsters outside Astral has a slightly better inventory (and an astral-like inventory if generated in Gehennom), and now are skipped in random generation with a 90% frequency instead of a 99% one (making them basically not generate ever).\n  - They will now also likely get object properties (also in Astral generation)\n\n- Fix an oversight in the nerf of generation of wands of create monster\n\n  - Now generate 25% of the time for offensive items vs 100% after lack of earlier nerf\n  - Now generate 25% of old rate for defensive items vs 11% after the earlier nerf\n\n- Nurses will now only spawn with healing spells\n\n- Made spell quivering less annoying. It is now done via 'Z' or '+' menus\n\n- The game will now remember what you targeted last polearm-wise\n\n- Losing attribute points from abuse is now \"permanent\" (can't be restored with restore ability anymore). Of course, you can still recover it with future exercise, or gain ability, like usual\n\n- Unihorns were changed\n\n  - No longer messes with attributes at all (reducing if cursed or restoring if blessed)\n  - Blessed unihorns will always restore all troubles but has a 10% of unblessing\n  - Uncursed unihorns will pick one trouble at random out of Ill/FoodPois/Zombie/Vomiting, Stun, Hallu, Blind, Conf, and try to cure it, meaning that, for example, trying to cure Ill with an uncursed unihorn will work 20% of the time\n\n- Spell failure rate has been changed to increasing the spell cost proportional to the failure rate. This was previously used for spell maintenance Pw drain, but is now used for casting in general as well\n\n  - To clarify: spell cost is (base cost) \\* 100 / success%. So force bolt costs 5pw at 0% fail, 10pw at 50% fail, 20pw at 75% fail, 500pw at 99% fail, 1000pw at 100% fail (treated as 99.5%)\n  - The Amulet now always double Pw costs, rather than draining a random amount between 2-3x\n\n- Removed hungerless casting. Wizards are already strong as-is\n\n- Spellcasting no longer exercises wisdom\n\n- Added [rings of carrying](/wiki/Ring_of_carrying \"Ring of carrying\")\n\n- [Revised the HP/Pw growth system](/wiki/FIQHack/New_HP_growth \"FIQHack/New HP growth\")\n  - This significantly buffs Rider HP\n\n- Implement covetous-warping for players, if in a form that allows it\n\n  - Players may now #monster to warp if polymorphed into a covetous monster\n  - Warping doesn't work in the endgame\n  - Warping has a 500-turn cooldown\n  - Warping is a free action\n  - Monsters are bound by the same restrictions as players\n\n- [Ogresmasher](/wiki/Ogresmasher \"Ogresmasher\") now gives 25 Constitution when wielded\n\n- If you're polymorphed into a nymph, you have an infinite carrying capacity\n\n- Ported 2 Elbereth nerfs from 3.6.x\n\n  - Elbereth no longer works just because there's an object there\n  - Attacking things while standing on Elbereth will cause the Elbereth to vanish\n\n- Conflict now disables Elbereth\n\n- Gods will never give nameable artifacts ([Sting](/wiki/Sting \"Sting\"), [Orcrist](/wiki/Orcrist \"Orcrist\"))\n\n- Gave several lategame monsters see invisible\n\n- Pit fiends are now significantly buffed, and are casters\n\n- Demon lords now demand 50d500 zorkmids instead of the demand being based off your current gold\n\n- Swimmers gain double speed (independent of the \"(very) fast\" trinsic) on the Plane of Water\n\n- Water elementals now engulf you and can drown you. This uses a suffocation timer of (2Con+1)/3 turns, so with 18 Con, it takes 12 turns until you drown.\n\n- Wands of teleportation can no longer teleport objects, engravings or monsters on noteleport levels at all\n  - Master wands do however gain a new feature -- you can choose where to teleport monsters\n\n- Rework altar sacrificing\n\n  - New field, piety\n\n  - Piety is a scale on how much your god likes you.\n    - Positive means the god likes you, negative means the god is angry at you\n\n  - A sacrifice gift is given at 10000 \\* 2 ^ gifts given\n    - After getting a gift, piety is reset to 2000\n\n  - You are always crowned when praying if eligible on praying\n\n    - New requirement: 15000 piety\n    - Being crowned resets piety to 5000\n\n  - Sacrifice values:\n\n    - Gold: Amount/4\n    - Permafood: Nutrition / (Probability / 15 + 1)\n    - C/K-rations and huge chunks of meat count as probability 100\n    - Tins and eggs can't be sacrificed\n    - Corpse value is (difficulty + 1) \\* 100\n      - Unicorn is counted as 5 difficulty points higher, assuming a good sacrifice (e.g. no conversion or angering of altar god)\n    - Any prayer with zero timeout, happy god and positive alignment will increase luck by 1 if possible\n\n  - The chance of altar conversion is (Value/20)% (From 2020: (Value/12)%, but failure always gives a minion, and no longer reduces luck upon failure)\n\n  - These mechanics generally work like they used to: offering with nonzero timeout, negative alignment record, Amulet\n\n- Rework create monster\n\n  - Everything summons a single pet unless otherwise noted\n\n  - You are allowed to select the location of the summon\n\n  - No starting inventory or corpse drop\n\n  - No experience for killing summons\n\n  - No alignment penalty (or bonus) for killing summons\n\n  - Summons are allowed to pickup and use items, but may not be lifesaved, and unused items drop upon unsommon\n    - If a summoned monster creates another summoned monster, the result will not outlive the original summoned monster\n\n  - Blessed bag of tricks: 100 turns centered on you\n\n  - Uncursed bag of tricks: 50 turns centered on you\n\n  - Cursed bag of tricks: 500 turns centered on you, hostile, hasted\n\n  - Scroll of create monster -> scroll of summoning\n\n    - Blessed: 20 turns\n    - Uncursed: 10 turns\n    - Cursed: 100 turns centered on you, hostile, hasted\n    - Confused: creates an item with BUC depending on scroll\n\n  - Spell of create monster -> spell of summoning\n\n    - Unskilled: 5 turns\n    - Basic: 10 turns\n    - Skilled: 15 turns\n    - Expert: 20 turns\n\n  - Wand of create monster -> wand of summoning\n\n    - Unskilled: 5 turns\n    - Basic: 10 turns\n    - Skilled: 15 turns\n    - Expert: 20 turns\n    - Master: 25 turns\n\n  - Summon nasties works like it used to but summons last for 20 turns\n\n- Added magic chests. They are objects, but generally behave like dungeon features -- they can't be picked up, teleported, polymorphed, or similar. They can, however, be wished for, which creates one on your location. There are chests in Minetown, Sokoban, Castle and Orcus, and (as of 2021) the quest home.\n\n- Added rooms to Gehennom, including some new special rooms (From xNetHack)\n  - As part of this change, Fake Wizard's Towers has been removed. They can spawn as ordinary special rooms, however, but will never have a portal. Instead, you enter the Wizard's Tower from the bottom floor.\n\n- Water is nicer to monsters: they can now crawl out of it, and teleport out if they have teleportitis\n\n- Ported 3.6.x Sokoban completion mechanics -- now tells in #overview (^O) if you've solved it or not, and Sokoban special cases stop applying once you solve a puzzle.\n\n- Make teleport prompts preselect the travel destination if one exist\n\n- Added message\\_hints option, which explains various more vague messages printed by the game.\n\n- Similar to moving into water/lava without necessary protection, prevented you from moving into potentially dangerous traps without using the 'm' (moveonly) prefix\n\n- Travel will no longer stop for engravings or items on already explored squares\n\n- You can now use \\`.\\` instead of \\`,\\` in prompts asking for inventory or floor objects/dungeon feature, to allow SLASH'EM players to retain their muscle memory\n\n### Changes applicable to junethack 2019\n\n- Monsters are able to save themselves from drowning similar to players\n- Monsters now notices when others (including you) wield cursed weapons\n- Monsters no longer try to swap weapons when they know that their current one is cursed\n- Knights get a warning before they are about to violate their honor code\n- Always mark Sokoban levels as Solved or Unsolved like vanilla 3.6.x does (it used to do it only if the level was otherwise interesting)\n- Minor balancing for HP/Pw growth. See article above for how it works in current versions\n\n### Changes applicable to junethack 2020\n\n- Monsters get wands of magic missile significantly more rarely\n\n- Skilled+ wand users no longer get caught in their own wand explosions\n\n- Double Trouble now has a delay before it takes effect\n\n- Entering water now sets a drowning timer instead of how it used to work\n\n- Zombies now take 5 hits/50 turns (instead of 6 hits/60 turns), or a combination of the 2, before a zombification disease turns terminal\n\n- Bones player monsters will now meditate, requiring you to approach them in melee range before they start pursuing you\n\n- Converting altars is significantly easier, but you always get hostile minions upon failure, but no luck reduction\n\n- You always ID create monster wands on use, since they ask you where to place the monster\n\n- Pets no longer allow players to be effectively immune to melee attacks\n\n- Buffed some quest artifacts\n\n  - The Longbow of Diana gets +1 multishot, always safely returns arrows, prevents arrows from mulching\n  - The Heart of Ahriman is now a ruby (it still confers luck), confers slotless displacement and flying, makes you completely immune to item cursing and can be invoked for persistent monster detection\n  - Magic Mirror of Merlin confers total reflection (like in vanilla, dragons and skilled+ wands can't bypass it)\n  - Master Key of Thievery makes you completely immune to traps, and its invocation effect was changed to [branchporting](/wiki/Branchport \"Branchport\").\n  - Mitre of Holiness now confers magic resistance, warns against undead and restores all Pw, not just half of it. The upper cap was also changed from +120 to +400. It was already buffed earlier allowing you to pray safely in Gehennom.\n\n- Two-handed weapons now get a x1.6 multiplier to enchantment damage. This stacks with double damage from the Tsurugi of Muramasa\n\n- Monsters may now take minor detours to pickup items when pursuing an otherwise unrelated path.\n\n- Trap doors or holes can cause you to fall between branches beyond just the Castle-VotD special case\n  - Sokoban 1a/1b now have holes that makes you fall out of Sokoban. Upper levels may also (rarely) do this, as per usual with holes\n\n- Pets now deliberately seek out hostile monsters to pursue. Whistling a tin whistle will temporarily disable this behaviour\n\n- Swimming will never cause water turbulence (instead of simply being rarer -- vanilla being 1/12 instead of 1/3)\n\n- On top of existing floor naming support (which worked similar to eating, etc, where you could type-name objects and then press ,), added support for the 3.6-style floor naming where you can name items on the floor\n\n### Changes applicable to junethack 2021\n\n- Implement a new item, the [Scroll of recall](/wiki/Scroll_of_recall \"Scroll of recall\") with a base price of 200zm, ink cost of 10 and appearing as 3% of all scrolls (Scrolls of light went from appearing 9% of the time to 6%).\n\n  - Warps monsters to other monsters, possibly to an entirely different level.\n  - Cursed: Draws hostile monsters to the reader\n  - Uncursed: Draws pets to the reader (like an uncursed magic whistle)\n  - Blessed: Draws pets to the reader, including pets on other levels.\n  - Confused: Take the first match from above (first hostile for cursed, first pet for uncursed, first pet on a different level for blessed -- or like uncursed if there is none) and draws the reader to them -- basically reversing the function.\n\n- Gremlins stealing your (or other monster's) intrinsics will now acquire the intrinsic they stole for themselves\n\n- You no longer start with spellbooks, but instead have your starting spells pre-learned. An earlier change had previously made spellbooks one-use but with a 60k turn memory, and removed the starting spells from the spell learnset to not double up on the memory duration.\n\n- The game now keeps track of the amount of wishes you performed since your last prayer/similar, since they affect the prayer timeout. Just like with other last prayer information, it can be seen in the Ctrl+x window when pressing a.\n\n- Artifact blasting now works like vanilla again (and no longer blast you if you lack a resistance to the damage type it performs)\n\n- Be less stingy with HP growth, generally giving much more HP earlygame\n\n- The helm of opposite alignment effect is now gradual, slowly changing your alignment instead of an instant effect. This is done by gradually decreasing your alignment record, and once it reaches -100, process the effect as usual. The effects are now made to be the same as a normal conversion, so aside from losing divine protection, it now reduces your luck by 3 and increases prayer timeout by 300.\n\n- Zoo gold is now spread out more evenly, biased towards the edges and especially corners\n\n- Quest home now has a magic chest\n\n- Improvements to monster action interruption:\n\n  - Confusion no longer prevents monsters coming into view interrupting you\n  - You are now interrupted when you sense a monster you didn't previously sense within LOS and 8 tiles, or if a monster outside LOS, or a monster outside 8 tiles, comes within those limits. As previously, a monster getting next to you will also interrupt you.\n\n### Changes applicable to junethack 2022\n\n- Zombification now prevents HP regeneration\n\n- The oilskin property now also grants the waterproof property when worn\n\n- Added some new container object properties:\n\n  - Greed: Makes gold inside weightless, but causes 50% of attempts to take things out of it to fail\n  - Discovery: Automatically reveals base type of stashed items\n  - Refrigerating: Prevents stashed corpses from rotting\n\n- Buffed piety gain from sacrificing\n\n  - Gold value was doubled to gold/2 instead of gold/4\n\n  - Permafood always give their nutrition amount with the following exceptions:\n\n    - Food rations give 100\n    - Huge chunks of meat give 666\n    - K-rations give 133\n    - C-rations give 100\n\n  - Corpse piety value was multiplied by x1.5 to 150\\*difficulty\n\n- Objects no longer show \"male/female\" denominators outside wizard mode.\n\n- Incorporate [xNetHack](/wiki/XNetHack \"XNetHack\")'s spellcast success formula for the most part.\n\n1. Compute a percentage as follows:\n\n   1. Start with your role's base spellcasting ability (see below table).\n\n   2. +5% per experience level.\n\n   3. Compute your effective Intelligence:\n\n      1. Your Intelligence score.\n      2. If you are wearing a [robe](/wiki/Robe \"Robe\") or wielding a [quarterstaff](/wiki/Quarterstaff \"Quarterstaff\"), +5.\n      3. If higher than 20, set to the maximum of 20 and your Intelligence attribute.\n\n   4. +5% per point of your effective Intelligence.\n\n   5. −25% per spell level.\n\n   6. −50% for metallic [body armor](/wiki/Body_armor \"Body armor\").\n\n   7. −30% for wearing a bulky (oc\\_large) [shield](/wiki/Shield \"Shield\"), or −15% for non-bulky. Bulky shields are large, Uruk-hai, and dwarvish roundshield.\n\n   8. −15% for wearing a metallic shield, independent of the above penalty.\n\n   9. −20% for a metallic [helm](/wiki/Helm \"Helm\").\n\n   10. −35% for metallic [gloves](/wiki/Gloves \"Gloves\").\n\n   11. −10% for metallic [boots](/wiki/Boots \"Boots\").\n\n   12. Armor penalties don't apply for the helm of brilliance or items that confer the brilliance property. That is, they override the metal penalty and \\*all\\* shield penalties.\n\n   13. If [Expert](/wiki/Skill \"Skill\") in the spell and above 100%, set to 100%. If Skilled and above 80%, set to 80%. If Basic and above 60%, set to 60%. If Unskilled and above 40%, set to 40%.\n\n   14. If below 0%, set to 0%.\n\n2. Pw cost of the spell = (spell level × 5) / percentage. (If percentage is 0, the Pw cost is calculated as if it had a success rate of 0.5%)\n\n| Arc | Bar | Cav | Hea | Kni | Mon | Pri | Ran | Rog | Sam | Tou | Val | Wiz |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 30% | 0%  | 5%  | 40% | 15% | 35% | 40% | 10% | 15% | 10% | 20% | 25% | 50% |\n\n### Changes applicable to junethack 2024\n\n- Disabling message hints now suppress object identification messages\n\n- \"\\[N turns]\" can now be disabled by toggling the \"delay\\_msg\" gameplay option\n\n- Wizard's Tower has magenta walls and floor\n\n- Non-wizards that read spellbooks now get a difficulty warning\n\n- Covetous-warping changed\n  - Instead of being an unrestricted teleport, it now functions more similar to vanilla. It causes the warper to warp (bypassing noteleport) to an object of their choice that they covet. This has a 1-turn cooldown, to avoid abusing the random outcome from warps that end up near, rather than precisely at, the object, by repeatedly warping until you are happy with the outcome. Covetous-warping is a free action\n\n- Downgraded soldiers from being skilled wand users, to only having basic wand skill\n\n- Swapped wand skill levels of Barbarians and Cavemen\n\n  - Barbarians went from restricted to capping out at Basic. They still start Unskilled\n  - Cavemen are now restricted\n\n- Overhauled Conflict\n\n  - It no longer changes how the AI behaves in any way. Instead, at the end of the turn, a \"conflict area\" of radius 8 is created around every monster (or player) causing conflict, excluding the center spot (but they can be affected in case of mutual conflict).\n  - Every monster within the affected area, unless they resist (ring-class willpower check similar to vanilla NetHack), will be forced to attack a random nearby monster in melee\n  - This is a free action for them, so the attack doesn't consume any movement points\n  - This doesn't anger peacefuls in case a player is hitting one while conflicted. It also doesn't break pacifist if the player inadvertly kills a monster under conflict.

This means that monster has a lot of new intrinsics/extrinsics to play around with. This also means that illness, sliming, strangulation and petrification are gradual processes for monsters now. Eating corpses/jewelry confer new intrinsics (but only pets eat corpses at present).</li>\n<li>The \"curse items\" harassment and unlucky throne effect now curses 3x as many items, and <a href=\"/wiki/Magicbane\" title=\"Magicbane\">Magicbane</a> only reduces its effect by 2/3 rather than making it not apply 95% of the time, to compensate for the removal of the \"curse items\" monster spell</li>\n<li>Bones can be scarier -- the ghost now gets the same intrinsics as the late player, and each bones has a 33% of replacing the ghost with an alive <a href=\"/wiki/Player_monster\" title=\"Player monster\">player monster</a> with the same inventory as the late player, the same spells and the same intrinsics/etc</li>\n<li>Improved player monster ascension kit on Astral</li>\n<li>Buffed #turn\n<ul><li>The helpless duration scales with level, from 5 turns at XL1 down to 1 whole turn at level 24 to merely a single action at XL30</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Mitre_of_Holiness\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mitre of Holiness\">Mitre of Holiness</a> now allows you to pray inside Gehennom while worn -- this includes normal praying as well as usage of #turn</li></ul></li>\n<li>You can wish for <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_lamp\" title=\"Magic lamp\">magic lamps</a></li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Changes_applicable_to_junethack_2017\">Changes applicable to junethack 2017</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Poison instadeath has been replaced with permanent (not possible to restore with potion or unihorn) attribute damage</li>\n<li>Nerfed conflict back to vanilla levels -- no longer works on ranged combat</li>\n<li>Buffed martial arts -- glove enchantment now matters, and it no longer does only 1 damage 25% of the time</li>\n<li>Zombies will now cure corpses in an area around them and cause zombification disease when attacking. Undead now grudge living and vice versa\n<ul><li>When zombies cure corpses in an area, the revived monsters are either converted to zombies (if there is a corresponding zombie variant of said monster), or enslaved under the command of the reviver (the zombie), thus having the same grudges/attackings/etc. These are denoted with \"enslaved\" in messages (The enslaved kitten hits! etc)</li>\n<li>Zombification disease is a delayed instadeath timer somewhat similar to illness that start at 100 and decreases by 10 each successive hit</li>\n<li>It can be cured by the same means as regular illness or food poisoning (including being considered a major trouble for prayer)</li>\n<li>As long as you have more than 40 turns (50 as of 2020) to live, the disease wears off naturally over time if there is no zombies nearby</li>\n<li>When the timer decreases below 40 turns (50 as of 2020) (where it will never wear off by itself), the game makes this very clear, so don't worry about missing it</li>\n<li>Minor zombification disease (41+ turns left, 51+ turns as of 2020) never kills</li></ul></li>\n<li>Added <a href=\"/wiki/Object_properties\" title=\"Object properties\">object properties</a>.</li>\n<li>Greatly improved <a href=\"/wiki/Search#FIQhack\" title=\"Search\">searching</a></li>\n<li>Lenses now provide automatic searching</li>\n<li>The mines brightness is now consistent.

However, they can now disrupt reflection at Skilled and semi-bypass MR (so MR only halves damage) at Expert. The Magic Mirror of Merlin's double damage will not apply to other Knights (including yourself), to compensate. Watch out for lategame magic missile users!</li>\n<li>Tweaked starting inventory, mostly making the random optional stuff guaranteed. Tourist and Wizards get more significant changes (Tourists get <i>all</i> of their formerly optional tools, Wizards no longer get scrolls, potions, rings, and can only start with wands of striking, but start with 4 spells instead (force bolt, magic missile, 2 random)). Only tourists can start with markers, and they always get it</li>\n<li>Quarterstaves enhance spellcasting like robes, and now allows spellcasting even if cursed welded to you</li>\n<li>Magicbane is now a quarterstaff</li>\n<li>Level gain changes\n<ul><li>A new EXP formula was created, it's now generally much easier to gain new levels after level 10</li>\n<li>Level draining melee is no longer MC-protected, and will now drain a full level</li>\n<li>While level drained, you now gain significantly boosted EXP, and blessed full healing can now regains all lost levels, not just half of them (with the other half permanently lost)</li></ul></li>\n<li>Lowlevel casters (kobold shamans, orc shamans and gnomish wizards) no longer approach you in melee, since they have no melee capabilities whatsoever but instead try to find a line up to you and stay there. This makes them significantly more dangerous as a result and are no longer trivial pushovers</li>\n<li>Make dragons much faster (same speed as horses: speed 9 -&gt; 20)\n<ul><li>Their breath has a chance (per breath) to semi-bypass reflection (as skilled ray-type wands). Disintegration will never bypass reflection</li>\n<li>Also improve their AI significantly, making them move around much more tactically</li></ul></li>\n<li>Armor weight changes\n<ul><li>Wearing armor now weight half as much</li>\n<li>Armor weight was increased in general</li>\n<li>The net effect is generally that armor weights slightly less if worn</li>\n<li>Dragon armor now weight 300 instead of 40 (150 if worn)\n<ul><li>For comparision, mithril coats weight 200 (100 if worn)</li></ul></li>\n<li>Cloak of magic resistance is now MC2. Cloak of displacement is MC3\n<ul><li>Magic resistance is generally more useful, CoD was hardly ever used</li></ul></li>\n<li>Crystal plate mail now gives AC:0/Def:10</li>\n<li>Dwarvish roundshields give AC:7/Def:3</li></ul></li>\n<li>Oilskin cloaks and white dragon scales/mail now protects against inventory water damage</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Shimmering_dragon\" title=\"Shimmering dragon\">Shimmering dragons</a> exist, as do their scales, which grant displacement.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor\" title=\"Wizard of Yendor\">Wizard of Yendor</a> will no longer steal your quest artifact</li>\n<li>Sokoban monsters are never generated peaceful</li>\n<li>Potions/scrolls/books/wands are no longer destroyed if you have the applicable extrinsic. Only having it extrinsically protects against it, not intrinsically.</li>\n<li>You can throw items (any item except for ammo from an appropriate launcher) to intelligent non-paralyzed pets to force them to pick it up (by catching it).</li>\n<li>Wands of create monster was decreased from 11-15 charges to 4-8. In addition, instead of summoning 1/2/3/4/5+d7 (with a 1/23 chance of summoning +d7 on lower levels too), it now summons 1/d2/d4/d8/d16 with no additional monsters.</li>\n<li>Buffed <a href=\"/wiki/Tsurugi_of_Muramasa\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tsurugi of Muramasa\">Tsurugi of Muramasa</a> -- now does double damage (instead of +1d8) and can be invoked to uncurse itself.</li>\n<li>Added classic_status from DynaHack which gives the bottom status bar a look similar to NetHack 3</li>\n<li>Sparkle is now a numeric option, allowing you to select how long it animates</li>\n<li>Gave colored DSM and scales (not silver/gray) new benefits:\n<ul><li>Red: <a href=\"/wiki/Infravision\" title=\"Infravision\">Infravision</a> (2017), <a href=\"/wiki/Warning\" title=\"Warning\">Warning</a>. and <a href=\"/wiki/See_invisible\" title=\"See invisible\">See invisible</a> (2018) (in addition to the normal fire resistance)</li>\n<li>White: Protects against water damage to your inventory items (2017), <a href=\"/wiki/Automatic_searching\" title=\"Automatic searching\">automatic searching</a> with enchantment contributing to search bonus, as the ring (2018), gives swimming and magical breathing (2020) (in addition to the normal cold resistance)</li>\n<li>Orange: <a href=\"/wiki/Free_action\" title=\"Free action\">Free action</a> (in addition to the normal sleep resistance)</li>\n<li>Black: <a href=\"/wiki/Drain_resistance\" title=\"Drain resistance\">Drain resistance</a> (in addition to the normal disintegration resistance)</li>\n<li>Blue: <a href=\"/wiki/Speed\" title=\"Speed\">Speed</a>, slow monster immunity (in addition to the normal shock resistance)</li>\n<li>Green: <a href=\"/wiki/Sickness\" title=\"Sickness\">Sickness</a> resistance (in addition to the normal poison resistance)</li>\n<li>Yellow: <a href=\"/wiki/Stoning\" title=\"Stoning\">Stoning</a> resistance (in addition to the normal acid resistance)</li>\n<li>Shimmering: Stun resistance (2018) (in addition to the normal displacement)</li></ul></li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Changes_applicable_to_junethack_2018\">Changes applicable to junethack 2018</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Further buffs to DSM (see above)</li>\n<li>New feature, \"find\", available through Ctrl+F.

Priests get a +20 bonus to effective XL when calculating their chance, so at XL30 they can always write unknown scrolls.</li>\n<li>Autoswap: when you attempt to fire a projectile, an appropriate launcher in your alternate weapon slot will be automatically equipped to fire the projectile. This does not cost a turn. Similarly, if you are currently wielding a launcher, attempting to move into a hostile monster will automatically attack with a melee weapon in the alternate weapon slot, or with unarmed if no weapon is available there.

{{Variant-343}}\n\nA NetHack variant based on [[NetHack4]] that focuses on AI, balance, and interface improvements.\n\nSource code is hosted [https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack here]\n\n[[FIQHack/Pointers|Tips on how to play!]]\n\nYou can play it online at\n* US: https://www.hardfought.org/ (in-browser or ssh nethack@hardfought.org)\n* EU: https://eu.hardfought.org/ (in-browser or ssh nethack@eu.hardfought.org)\n* AU: https://au.hardfought.org/ (in-browser or ssh nethack@au.hardfought.org)\n\nOr download 4.3.0 at [https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/releases GitHub]\n\nSince NetHack4 is based off NetHack 3.4.3 (via NitroHack + AceHack), consider 3.4.3 as the \"baseline\" rather than 3.6.0.\n\nMost of the changes and updates below have been added to the relevant individual pages in this wiki.\n\n== Version 4.3.0 ==\n=== Changes applicable to junethack 2016 ===\n* Wands have been [[Wands Balance Patch|rebalanced]]\n* Floating eyes now have passive slow and a slowness gaze effect instead of the NH4 \"feature\" where you can't attack them\n* [[Energy regeneration]] greatly boosted for the early game. EoTA users, however, should expect generally slightly less energy. Energy is now based on wisdom and experience level only, with Wizards getting a boost, and people with energy regeneration (EoTA) getting a bigger one.\n** +1pw/turn for eregen\n** +0.33pw/turn for wizards\n** +0.03*wisdom pw/turn for wisdom if your wisdom is higher than 3\n** +0.03*level pw/turn\n** Changed past 4.3.0 (applicable to Junethack 2018) to 0.02*Wis instead of 0.03*Wis and 0.04*level instead of 0.03*level\n* Added 4 spells, all of which are level 7\n** spellbook of charging (equivalent to an uncursed [[scroll of charging]]), enchantment spell\n** spellbook of phase (21-60 turns of [[phasing]], stacks), escape spell\n** spellbook of astral eyesight (11-30 turns of xray, stacks. Note that the xray range in FIQHack is 8, not 3), divination spell\n** spellbook of [[Summon nasties|summon nasty]] (equivalent to vanilla monster spell, summons tame monsters if you target it at a hostile monster), clerical spell\n* Added spell maintenance\n** Some spells can now be \"maintained\", slowly draining Pw but applying a continuous effect. [[Spell maintenance|More info]]\n* Improvements to the monster AI\n** Monsters now [[FIQHack/Monster spellcasting|cast player spells]] instead of monster spells, and can learn new spells from spellbooks\n** Monsters now use items significantly more intelligently\n** They now use almost every useful amulet, wand, scroll, potion and spell\n** They now wear rings\n** They use containers now, both bags in their inventory and looting containers from the floor (The Castle chest is special cased to prevent them from looting the castle wand and exhaust it a la Grunt)\n* Players can now be slowed and/or [[canceled]]\n** Slowness can be given from being in the view of a floating eye, being hit by the slow monster [[wand of slow monster|wand]] or [[spellbook of slow monster|spell]].\n** Makes you half as fast as without it.\n** Can only be \"cured\" by waiting it out.\n** Being canceled is '''permanent until cured'''.\n** Cancellation prevents you from making any use of your Pw/energy.\n** Also prevents a majority of special attacks similar to monsters (only relevant for polyself).\n** Considered a [[major trouble]].\n** Can also be cured by quaffing a noncursed [[potion of gain energy]], reading a [[scroll of charging]] while confused or stepping onto a [[magic trap]] and getting the \"You are caught in a magical explosion!\" effect (which is far more common than usual if canceled).\n* Monster intrinsic/extrinsic system now works like players (in fact, players now use the new monster intrinsic system too). This means that monster has a lot of new intrinsics/extrinsics to play around with. This also means that illness, sliming, strangulation and petrification are gradual processes for monsters now. Eating corpses/jewelry confer new intrinsics (but only pets eat corpses at present).\n* The \"curse items\" harassment and unlucky throne effect now curses 3x as many items, and [[Magicbane]] only reduces its effect by 2/3 rather than making it not apply 95% of the time, to compensate for the removal of the \"curse items\" monster spell\n* Bones can be scarier -- the ghost now gets the same intrinsics as the late player, and each bones has a 33% of replacing the ghost with an alive [[player monster]] with the same inventory as the late player, the same spells and the same intrinsics/etc\n* Improved player monster ascension kit on Astral\n* Buffed #turn\n** The helpless duration scales with level, from 5 turns at XL1 down to 1 whole turn at level 24 to merely a single action at XL30\n** [[Mitre of Holiness]] now allows you to pray inside Gehennom while worn -- this includes normal praying as well as usage of #turn\n* You can wish for [[magic lamp]]s\n\n=== Changes applicable to junethack 2017 ===\n* Poison instadeath has been replaced with permanent (not possible to restore with potion or unihorn) attribute damage\n* Nerfed conflict back to vanilla levels -- no longer works on ranged combat\n* Buffed martial arts -- glove enchantment now matters, and it no longer does only 1 damage 25% of the time\n* Zombies will now cure corpses in an area around them and cause zombification disease when attacking. Undead now grudge living and vice versa\n** When zombies cure corpses in an area, the revived monsters are either converted to zombies (if there is a corresponding zombie variant of said monster), or enslaved under the command of the reviver (the zombie), thus having the same grudges/attackings/etc. These are denoted with \"enslaved\" in messages (The enslaved kitten hits! etc)\n** Zombification disease is a delayed instadeath timer somewhat similar to illness that start at 100 and decreases by 10 each successive hit\n** It can be cured by the same means as regular illness or food poisoning (including being considered a major trouble for prayer)\n** As long as you have more than 40 turns (50 as of 2020) to live, the disease wears off naturally over time if there is no zombies nearby\n** When the timer decreases below 40 turns (50 as of 2020) (where it will never wear off by itself), the game makes this very clear, so don't worry about missing it\n** Minor zombification disease (41+ turns left, 51+ turns as of 2020) never kills\n* Added [[object properties]].\n* Greatly improved [[Search#FIQhack|searching]]\n* Lenses now provide automatic searching\n* The mines brightness is now consistent. Upper mines are always bright, lower mines are always dark.\n* The Oracle can now provide enlightenment, for a cost\n* Rings dropped in sinks to identify them can now be retrieved by destroying the sink and digging a pit on the square (they're buried)\n* Changed identification\n** They now all ID 1/2/3/4/all objects at random\n** Cursed scroll/unskilled spell now only identifies object type, appearance and artifacts\n** Uncursed scroll/basic spell also IDs enchantment, object properties, charge count, tin content and egg type\n** Skilled spell also IDs BUC\n** Blessed scroll/expert spell also identifies fooproof state (Blessed scroll also IDs BUC as per above)\n* Changed spell levels\n** Dig is level 2\n** Identify is level 2\n** Cancellation is level 5\n** Teleport away is level 5\n** Polymorph is level 7\n** Create familiar is level 2\n* Magic missile now does less damage at lower skills than Expert. However, they can now disrupt reflection at Skilled and semi-bypass MR (so MR only halves damage) at Expert. The Magic Mirror of Merlin's double damage will not apply to other Knights (including yourself), to compensate. Watch out for lategame magic missile users!\n* Tweaked starting inventory, mostly making the random optional stuff guaranteed. Tourist and Wizards get more significant changes (Tourists get ''all'' of their formerly optional tools, Wizards no longer get scrolls, potions, rings, and can only start with wands of striking, but start with 4 spells instead (force bolt, magic missile, 2 random)). Only tourists can start with markers, and they always get it\n* Quarterstaves enhance spellcasting like robes, and now allows spellcasting even if cursed welded to you\n* Magicbane is now a quarterstaff\n* Level gain changes\n** A new EXP formula was created, it's now generally much easier to gain new levels after level 10\n** Level draining melee is no longer MC-protected, and will now drain a full level\n** While level drained, you now gain significantly boosted EXP, and blessed full healing can now regains all lost levels, not just half of them (with the other half permanently lost)\n* Lowlevel casters (kobold shamans, orc shamans and gnomish wizards) no longer approach you in melee, since they have no melee capabilities whatsoever but instead try to find a line up to you and stay there. This makes them significantly more dangerous as a result and are no longer trivial pushovers\n* Make dragons much faster (same speed as horses: speed 9 -> 20)\n** Their breath has a chance (per breath) to semi-bypass reflection (as skilled ray-type wands). Disintegration will never bypass reflection\n** Also improve their AI significantly, making them move around much more tactically\n* Armor weight changes\n** Wearing armor now weight half as much\n** Armor weight was increased in general\n** The net effect is generally that armor weights slightly less if worn\n** Dragon armor now weight 300 instead of 40 (150 if worn)\n*** For comparision, mithril coats weight 200 (100 if worn)\n** Cloak of magic resistance is now MC2. Cloak of displacement is MC3\n*** Magic resistance is generally more useful, CoD was hardly ever used\n** Crystal plate mail now gives AC:0/Def:10\n** Dwarvish roundshields give AC:7/Def:3\n* Oilskin cloaks and white dragon scales/mail now protects against inventory water damage\n* [[Shimmering dragon]]s exist, as do their scales, which grant displacement.\n* [[Wizard of Yendor]] will no longer steal your quest artifact\n* Sokoban monsters are never generated peaceful\n* Potions/scrolls/books/wands are no longer destroyed if you have the applicable extrinsic. Only having it extrinsically protects against it, not intrinsically.\n* You can throw items (any item except for ammo from an appropriate launcher) to intelligent non-paralyzed pets to force them to pick it up (by catching it).\n* Wands of create monster was decreased from 11-15 charges to 4-8. In addition, instead of summoning 1/2/3/4/5+d7 (with a 1/23 chance of summoning +d7 on lower levels too), it now summons 1/d2/d4/d8/d16 with no additional monsters.\n* Buffed [[Tsurugi of Muramasa]] -- now does double damage (instead of +1d8) and can be invoked to uncurse itself.\n* Added classic_status from DynaHack which gives the bottom status bar a look similar to NetHack 3\n* Sparkle is now a numeric option, allowing you to select how long it animates\n* Gave colored DSM and scales (not silver/gray) new benefits:\n** Red: [[Infravision]] (2017), [[Warning]]. and [[See invisible]] (2018) (in addition to the normal fire resistance)\n** White: Protects against water damage to your inventory items (2017), [[automatic searching]] with enchantment contributing to search bonus, as the ring (2018), gives swimming and magical breathing (2020) (in addition to the normal cold resistance)\n** Orange: [[Free action]] (in addition to the normal sleep resistance)\n** Black: [[Drain resistance]] (in addition to the normal disintegration resistance)\n** Blue: [[Speed]], slow monster immunity (in addition to the normal shock resistance)\n** Green: [[Sickness]] resistance (in addition to the normal poison resistance)\n** Yellow: [[Stoning]] resistance (in addition to the normal acid resistance)\n** Shimmering: Stun resistance (2018) (in addition to the normal displacement)\n\n=== Changes applicable to junethack 2018 ===\n* Further buffs to DSM (see above)\n* New feature, \"find\", available through Ctrl+F. Allows you to search for objects you remember seeing. [http://home.fiq.se/obj_search.png Example]\n* Fixed a bug where maintaining the protection spell would give you more Def than supposed to\n* Wands of create monster now spawn 1/3 times as often as previously in monster inventories\n* Extrinsic fire resistance now prevents items from burning, waterproofness prevents rusting and acid res prevents corroding\n* Changed scroll writing for unknown scrolls and spells: Instead of being Luck dependant, you now have a XL/50 chance of success. Priests get a +20 bonus to effective XL when calculating their chance, so at XL30 they can always write unknown scrolls.\n* Autoswap: when you attempt to fire a projectile, an appropriate launcher in your alternate weapon slot will be automatically equipped to fire the projectile. This does not cost a turn. Similarly, if you are currently wielding a launcher, attempting to move into a hostile monster will automatically attack with a melee weapon in the alternate weapon slot, or with unarmed if no weapon is available there. (note: swapping between your primary weapon and alternate weapon already did not cost a turn, which is a feature inherited from [[Nethack4]].)\n* The inventory sidebar show total weight and carrying capacity as well as slot count\n* Changed artigifting/artiwishing\n** Only gifted artifacts affects the rate of future artifact gifts\n** Only wished-for artifacts affect the rate of future artifact wishes\n** Artiwishing rate was nerfed to compensate (Old: 100%, 100%, 66%, 50%, 40%, ..., New: 100%, 50%, 33%, 25%, 20%, ...)\n* You can now alias spells\n** 'quiver' (and 'fire' if nothing is quivered) will now prompt if you want to quiver a spell. This way you can use 'f' to fire spells\n** A new command, 'castalias' was added, allowing you to alias keys to spells by mapping keys to it (Options -> interface -> keymap) and invoking it. This allows you to alias more than a single spell to keys.\n* HP regeneration rate was changed\n** +1hp/turn for regen\n** +0.33hp/turn for healers\n** +0.03*level hp/turn\n** +0.03*(constitution - 5) hp/turn\n** min cap is +0.01 hp/turn\n** Hunger from [[ring of regeneration]] only applies when you aren't at maximum HP.\n* You can now get into the Quest at XL10 instead of XL14.\n* Buffed crowning slightly.\n** It now gives intrinsic [[acid resistance]]\n** In addition to this, it also gives you permanent knowledge of your role's \"special spell\".\n** Since this would make the crowning gift a [[monk]] gets redundant, they now get a magic marker.\n* New object, [[potion of wonder]]\n** Generation: 10/1000 of all potions. Some of the 42/1000 potions was changed to 40/1000 to compensate (confusion, gain ability, booze, sickness, fruit juice)\n* New item properties, nasty (+3d6 damage but does +1d6 to the user on each hit or miss) and carrying (+10% carrycap, stacks with other items of carrying)\n* Objects now merge regardless of object knowledge, combining the knowledge. Previously, this was only the case for BUC knowledge\n* Archeologists gets a bonus to base searching rate (+10)\n* You can now ID/appraise enchantment of weapons based on your proficiency with it\n** Unskilled users can't appraise weapons at all (similar to vanilla)\n** Basic will learn enchantment with a 1% chance per hit\n** Skilled will learn enchantment with a 10% chance per hit\n** Expert users can see enchantment immediately without using the weapon (If you reached Expert while wielding it, a hit will reveal it)\n* Life saving will not apply if the player is nonliving.\n* Remove the prevention of fire and frost on weapons stacking\n* Change spellbook mechanics to reduce tedium\n** You now learn a spell for 60k instead of 20k turns\n** Reading the book successfully and (re)learning something from it will destroy the book\n** Roles no longer start knowing their starting spells but has to read them. This only really matter for Wizards -- everyone else can read their book(s) on turn 1 due to always being blessed. Wizards get force bolt and magic missile preblessed, the others can be uncursed or blessed\n** As a result, this means that you can only cast \"confuse self\" from T:60001 and onwards assuming you got the spell at T:1. This was anticipated, but not considered a problem.\n** Since spellbooks now lack charges, this means you can polypile books indefinitely and relearn/learn spells from them. However, the book will disappear when you successfully (re)learn a spell, as usual.\n* Monsters now have proper Pw/energy, meaning they can potentially cast several spells in quick succession and no longer uses a cooldown system. This makes spellcasters, particularly latergame ones, more dangerous\n* Perseus is now guaranteed to drop a shield of reflection and levitation boots\n* Buffed some artifacts\n** [[Cleaver]] now hits in an arc, hitting monsters at left and right of your main target.\n*** Vanilla's Cleaver was inspired by this change, but in vanilla, this can hurt non-hostile monsters. In FIQHack, Cleaver will not hit non-hostile monsters unless you explicitly attack them directly.\n** [[Trollsbane]] now give hungerless regeneration\n** [[Dragonbane]] is now a lance, gives reflection, and has halved weight (180wt -> 90wt)\n** [[Sunsword]] blocks blindness, like Eyes of the Overworld\n** [[Demonbane]] is now a silver saber and will prevent demon gating\n** These artifacts now do +1d20 instead of x2 vs their bane: Dragonbane, Demonbane, [[Werebane]], [[Giantslayer]], [[Ogresmasher]], Trollsbane, Sunsword\n** Dragonbane is now the 1st sacrifice gift for Knights\n* Blessed [[Scroll of teleportation|scrolls of teleportation]] will now, instead of prompting for if you want to teleport, allow you to perform a controlled teleporation whether you have [[teleport control]] or not.\n* Added monster lookup. Either specify a monster with '/', or use ':' instead of '.' when farlooking with ';' for info.\n* New racial choices\n** Dwarven knights\n** Elven monks\n** Orcish priests\n** Gnomish tourists\n* You can displace peacefuls. Monsters can, too; tame, hostile or other peacefuls.\n* Altars are colored based on alignment. Lawful is white, neutral gray, chaotic black (or blue in !use_darkgray). Unaligned altars are red, \"aligned altars\" (Astral) are yellow.\n* Being slow will now block all forms of intrinsic and extrinsic speed while going on.\n* Item destruction is rarer: 50% if cursed, 25% if uncursed, 6.25% is blessed. Wands lose charges instead of being destroyed, unless it's emptied, or was already empty/cancelled.\n* Lamps, candles, whatever, now has their light radius depend on BUC.\n* The Wizard of Yendor can only use Double Trouble once per respawn\n* Nerfed disintegration. It will now disenchant gear until it no longer provides AC, then disintegrate it\n* Slow monster can be resisted 66% with free action, and 100% with blue dragon scale (mail). Quaffing blessed potions of speed will also make it go away.\n* The Amulet now gives slotless aggravate monster.\n* The [[spellbook of haste self]] is now the spellbook of speed monster. It works basically the same except that it can now be used on others.\n* Added \"true\" female monster names: gnome ladies, Elvenqueens, etc.\n* Pressing > or < when not at a stair will prompt for travelling to the corresponding map symbol without the need to invoke _ first.\n* Make it possible to, if your outermost armor is greased or is an oilskin cloak (or has the oilskin property), squeeze through tight diagonal spaces with twice as much inventory as normal.\n* Add autounlock to automatically unlock doors upon walking onto them\n* Improve polearm usage\n** Applying a polearm will preselect an appropriate position\n** Using 'f'ire while wielding a polearm with an empty quiver will, if possible, use the polearm.\n** As with launchers, using 'f' with polearms this way works with autoswap\n* Gremlins are able to steal intrinsics both at day and night\n* Give remembered item amount in a container. Similar to 3.6.0, but will not change if container content changes outside your watch.\n* You can now see when you last prayed / angered your god / etc, using Ctrl+x a\n* Candle radius now increases quadratically rather than with log7 (1 candle gives radius 2, 4 gives 3, 9 gives 4, 16 gives 5...)\n* The guaranteed marker for Tourists is now 0:0.\n* Shop content is now automatically IDed for Tourists\n* Spellbook level now depends on weight: 30 for blank paper, 35 for level 1 books, 40 for level 2, 45 for level 3... in steps of 5.\n* Magic whistles will not recall pets on noteleport levels unless it's blessed\n* Fire/frost horns deal (XL)d6 damage. Prevents rare unfair deaths to someone finding one early\n* Resistances to fire/cold/shock/sleep/poison/acid can now be partial\n** Immunities are granted by extrinsics as well as trinsics you have from the getgo -- not ones you get over the course of the game (leveling up, corpses, crowning, potions of wonder or similar)\n** Otherwise, the resistance is partial. A partial resistance will generally halve the damage, with the exception of...\n** Fire immunity will shield you from lava.\n** Poison deals half damage when it does damage, and reduces attributes (including permanently) only a third of the time. Attribute loss is also reduced to a third.\n** Sleep resistance will only make you sleep for a third of the time, and taking any damage will wake you up.\n** Amulets of restful sleep now confer sleep resistance (but not sleep immunity).\n** Rings of resistance has been renamed to rings of immunity to reflect this change. For example, the ring of fire resistance is now the ring of fire immunity.\n* Message history includes turncount\n* Add msgfading option and change msgcolor\n** msgfading can be specified as fade (default, darkens colors), blank (blanks the message line completely) or don't change (don't change old messages in any way).\n** msgcolor can now be either full (default), gray (like previous disabled) and white (makes active messages white and old ones gray)\n** For those who want to mimic NAO unix tty windowport: set msgfading to blank, msgcolor to gray.\n* Quest nemeses no longer respect Elbereth (or scare monster).\n\n== 4.3.1 (in development) ==\n=== Changes applicable to junethack 2018 ===\n* (Pick)axes of mercy will now heal you if whacked at yourself\n* Fire/cold/shock/sleep/poison attacks are no longer protected by MC\n* Strength works differently: it now works like an ordinary attribute rather than being special past 18. Elves keep their 18 strength cap, gnomes reach 19, orcs 20, humans and dwarves 21.\n* Oilskin sacks no longer generate (because the oilskin object property exists). Saddles are now twice as common.\n* Artifact lances (Dragonbane) now comes with a free saddle and riding unrestriction included, entirely free of charge.\n* The \"autounlock\" option now works on chests, prompting for unlocking them directly from #loot if locked.\n* Monsters are now able to jump.\n* Added special watchmode support for dgamelaunch's benefit (might also help potential future NH4-mode FIQHack servers)\n* When you receive [[alignment]] penalties, your alignment is first set to zero, then you receive the penalty\n* When considering what equipment to wear, pets will prefer items thrown at it over anything else, the more recently thrown the better.\n* You can now kill your quest leader to open the portal to the downstairs\n* Fort Ludios will now appear on the first level below dlvl10 with a vault\n* Level teleporters no longer disappear on use\n** Catacombs traps was changed to regular teleporters due to this\n* Alchemy smocks (aprons) are now MC3 instead of MC1.\n* Boomerangs now work like Mjollnir when thrown\n* Changed throwing return success: instead of failing 1% of the time, artifacts now never fail (unless you're impaired), and boomerangs fail 1/Dex of the time (and have a further 1/Dex chance of hitting you in the return)\n* Death fields from skilled+ wand of death now halve HP and deal 6d6 (in that order), rather than kill you outright, if you lack magic resistance\n* Slight damage reduction nerf: now takes the AC rolled between -1 and effective AC when deciding to-hit as \"effective AC\" when determining damage reduction\n* Using a blessed stethoscope is a free action\n* Minor changes to Plane of Water: all bubbles are now visible at all times, but you can no longer levitate between them\n* Energy regen tweaked slightly: 0.02*Wis instead of 0.03*Wis and 0.04*XL instead of 0.03*XL.\n* Spellbook of protection nerfed:\n** Now only works if not wearing body armor\n* Snickersnee now grants free action\n* Player monsters outside Astral has a slightly better inventory (and an astral-like inventory if generated in Gehennom), and now are skipped in random generation with a 90% frequency instead of a 99% one (making them basically not generate ever).\n** They will now also likely get object properties (also in Astral generation)\n* Fix an oversight in the nerf of generation of wands of create monster\n** Now generate 25% of the time for offensive items vs 100% after lack of earlier nerf\n** Now generate 25% of old rate for defensive items vs 11% after the earlier nerf\n* Nurses will now only spawn with healing spells\n* Made spell quivering less annoying. It is now done via 'Z' or '+' menus\n* The game will now remember what you targeted last polearm-wise\n* Losing attribute points from abuse is now \"permanent\" (can't be restored with restore ability anymore). Of course, you can still recover it with future exercise, or gain ability, like usual\n* Unihorns were changed\n** No longer messes with attributes at all (reducing if cursed or restoring if blessed)\n** Blessed unihorns will always restore all troubles but has a 10% of unblessing\n** Uncursed unihorns will pick one trouble at random out of Ill/FoodPois/Zombie/Vomiting, Stun, Hallu, Blind, Conf, and try to cure it, meaning that, for example, trying to cure Ill with an uncursed unihorn will work 20% of the time\n* Spell failure rate has been changed to increasing the spell cost proportional to the failure rate. This was previously used for spell maintenance Pw drain, but is now used for casting in general as well\n** To clarify: spell cost is (base cost) * 100 / success%. So force bolt costs 5pw at 0% fail, 10pw at 50% fail, 20pw at 75% fail, 500pw at 99% fail, 1000pw at 100% fail (treated as 99.5%)\n** The Amulet now always double Pw costs, rather than draining a random amount between 2-3x\n* Removed hungerless casting.

This uses a suffocation timer of (2Con+1)/3 turns, so with 18 Con, it takes 12 turns until you drown.\n* Wands of teleportation can no longer teleport objects, engravings or monsters on noteleport levels at all\n** Master wands do however gain a new feature -- you can choose where to teleport monsters\n* Rework altar sacrificing\n** New field, piety\n** Piety is a scale on how much your god likes you.\n*** Positive means the god likes you, negative means the god is angry at you\n** A sacrifice gift is given at 10000 * 2 ^ gifts given\n*** After getting a gift, piety is reset to 2000\n** You are always crowned when praying if eligible on praying\n*** New requirement: 15000 piety\n*** Being crowned resets piety to 5000\n** Sacrifice values:\n*** Gold: Amount/4\n*** Permafood: Nutrition / (Probability / 15 + 1)\n*** C/K-rations and huge chunks of meat count as probability 100\n*** Tins and eggs can't be sacrificed\n*** Corpse value is (difficulty + 1) * 100\n**** Unicorn is counted as 5 difficulty points higher, assuming a good sacrifice (e.g. no conversion or angering of altar god)\n*** Any prayer with zero timeout, happy god and positive alignment will increase luck by 1 if possible\n** The chance of altar conversion is (Value/20)% (From 2020: (Value/12)%, but failure always gives a minion, and no longer reduces luck upon failure)\n** These mechanics generally work like they used to: offering with nonzero timeout, negative alignment record, Amulet\n* Rework create monster\n** Everything summons a single pet unless otherwise noted\n** You are allowed to select the location of the summon\n** No starting inventory or corpse drop\n** No experience for killing summons\n** No alignment penalty (or bonus) for killing summons\n** Summons are allowed to pickup and use items, but may not be lifesaved, and unused items drop upon unsommon\n*** If a summoned monster creates another summoned monster, the result will not outlive the original summoned monster\n** Blessed bag of tricks: 100 turns centered on you\n** Uncursed bag of tricks: 50 turns centered on you\n** Cursed bag of tricks: 500 turns centered on you, hostile, hasted\n** Scroll of create monster -> scroll of summoning\n*** Blessed: 20 turns\n*** Uncursed: 10 turns\n*** Cursed: 100 turns centered on you, hostile, hasted\n*** Confused: creates an item with BUC depending on scroll\n** Spell of create monster -> spell of summoning\n*** Unskilled: 5 turns\n*** Basic: 10 turns\n*** Skilled: 15 turns\n*** Expert: 20 turns\n** Wand of create monster -> wand of summoning\n*** Unskilled: 5 turns\n*** Basic: 10 turns\n*** Skilled: 15 turns\n*** Expert: 20 turns\n*** Master: 25 turns\n** Summon nasties works like it used to but summons last for 20 turns\n* Added magic chests. They are objects, but generally behave like dungeon features -- they can't be picked up, teleported, polymorphed, or similar. They can, however, be wished for, which creates one on your location. There are chests in Minetown, Sokoban, Castle and Orcus, and (as of 2021) the quest home.\n* Added rooms to Gehennom, including some new special rooms (From xNetHack)\n** As part of this change, Fake Wizard's Towers has been removed. They can spawn as ordinary special rooms, however, but will never have a portal. Instead, you enter the Wizard's Tower from the bottom floor.\n* Water is nicer to monsters: they can now crawl out of it, and teleport out if they have teleportitis\n* Ported 3.6.x Sokoban completion mechanics -- now tells in #overview (^O) if you've solved it or not, and Sokoban special cases stop applying once you solve a puzzle.\n* Make teleport prompts preselect the travel destination if one exist\n* Added message_hints option, which explains various more vague messages printed by the game.\n* Similar to moving into water/lava without necessary protection, prevented you from moving into potentially dangerous traps without using the 'm' (moveonly) prefix\n* Travel will no longer stop for engravings or items on already explored squares\n* You can now use `.` instead of `,` in prompts asking for inventory or floor objects/dungeon feature, to allow SLASH'EM players to retain their muscle memory\n\n=== Changes applicable to junethack 2019 ===\n* Monsters are able to save themselves from drowning similar to players\n* Monsters now notices when others (including you) wield cursed weapons\n* Monsters no longer try to swap weapons when they know that their current one is cursed\n* Knights get a warning before they are about to violate their honor code\n* Always mark Sokoban levels as Solved or Unsolved like vanilla 3.6.x does (it used to do it only if the level was otherwise interesting)\n* Minor balancing for HP/Pw growth. See article above for how it works in current versions\n\n=== Changes applicable to junethack 2020 ===\n* Monsters get wands of magic missile significantly more rarely\n* Skilled+ wand users no longer get caught in their own wand explosions\n* Double Trouble now has a delay before it takes effect\n* Entering water now sets a drowning timer instead of how it used to work\n* Zombies now take 5 hits/50 turns (instead of 6 hits/60 turns), or a combination of the 2, before a zombification disease turns terminal\n* Bones player monsters will now meditate, requiring you to approach them in melee range before they start pursuing you\n* Converting altars is significantly easier, but you always get hostile minions upon failure, but no luck reduction\n* You always ID create monster wands on use, since they ask you where to place the monster\n* Pets no longer allow players to be effectively immune to melee attacks\n* Buffed some quest artifacts\n** The Longbow of Diana gets +1 multishot, always safely returns arrows, prevents arrows from mulching\n** The Heart of Ahriman is now a ruby (it still confers luck), confers slotless displacement and flying, makes you completely immune to item cursing and can be invoked for persistent monster detection\n** Magic Mirror of Merlin confers total reflection (like in vanilla, dragons and skilled+ wands can't bypass it)\n** Master Key of Thievery makes you completely immune to traps, and its invocation effect was changed to [[branchport]]ing.\n** Mitre of Holiness now confers magic resistance, warns against undead and restores all Pw, not just half of it. The upper cap was also changed from +120 to +400. It was already buffed earlier allowing you to pray safely in Gehennom.\n* Two-handed weapons now get a x1.6 multiplier to enchantment damage. This stacks with double damage from the Tsurugi of Muramasa\n* Monsters may now take minor detours to pickup items when pursuing an otherwise unrelated path.\n* Trap doors or holes can cause you to fall between branches beyond just the Castle-VotD special case\n** Sokoban 1a/1b now have holes that makes you fall out of Sokoban. Upper levels may also (rarely) do this, as per usual with holes\n* Pets now deliberately seek out hostile monsters to pursue. Whistling a tin whistle will temporarily disable this behaviour\n* Swimming will never cause water turbulence (instead of simply being rarer -- vanilla being 1/12 instead of 1/3)\n* On top of existing floor naming support (which worked similar to eating, etc, where you could type-name objects and then press ,), added support for the 3.6-style floor naming where you can name items on the floor\n\n=== Changes applicable to junethack 2021 ===\n* Implement a new item, the [[Scroll of recall]] with a base price of 200zm, ink cost of 10 and appearing as 3% of all scrolls (Scrolls of light went from appearing 9% of the time to 6%).\n** Warps monsters to other monsters, possibly to an entirely different level.\n** Cursed: Draws hostile monsters to the reader\n** Uncursed: Draws pets to the reader (like an uncursed magic whistle)\n** Blessed: Draws pets to the reader, including pets on other levels.\n** Confused: Take the first match from above (first hostile for cursed, first pet for uncursed, first pet on a different level for blessed -- or like uncursed if there is none) and draws the reader to them -- basically reversing the function.\n* Gremlins stealing your (or other monster's) intrinsics will now acquire the intrinsic they stole for themselves\n* You no longer start with spellbooks, but instead have your starting spells pre-learned. An earlier change had previously made spellbooks one-use but with a 60k turn memory, and removed the starting spells from the spell learnset to not double up on the memory duration.\n* The game now keeps track of the amount of wishes you performed since your last prayer/similar, since they affect the prayer timeout. Just like with other last prayer information, it can be seen in the Ctrl+x window when pressing a.\n* Artifact blasting now works like vanilla again (and no longer blast you if you lack a resistance to the damage type it performs)\n* Be less stingy with HP growth, generally giving much more HP earlygame\n* The helm of opposite alignment effect is now gradual, slowly changing your alignment instead of an instant effect. This is done by gradually decreasing your alignment record, and once it reaches -100, process the effect as usual. The effects are now made to be the same as a normal conversion, so aside from losing divine protection, it now reduces your luck by 3 and increases prayer timeout by 300.\n* Zoo gold is now spread out more evenly, biased towards the edges and especially corners\n* Quest home now has a magic chest\n* Improvements to monster action interruption:\n** Confusion no longer prevents monsters coming into view interrupting you\n** You are now interrupted when you sense a monster you didn't previously sense within LOS and 8 tiles, or if a monster outside LOS, or a monster outside 8 tiles, comes within those limits. As previously, a monster getting next to you will also interrupt you.\n\n=== Changes applicable to junethack 2022 ===\n* Zombification now prevents HP regeneration\n* The oilskin property now also grants the waterproof property when worn\n* Added some new container object properties:\n** Greed: Makes gold inside weightless, but causes 50% of attempts to take things out of it to fail\n** Discovery: Automatically reveals base type of stashed items\n** Refrigerating: Prevents stashed corpses from rotting\n* Buffed piety gain from sacrificing\n** Gold value was doubled to gold/2 instead of gold/4\n** Permafood always give their nutrition amount with the following exceptions:\n*** Food rations give 100\n*** Huge chunks of meat give 666\n*** K-rations give 133\n*** C-rations give 100\n** Corpse piety value was multiplied by x1.5 to 150*difficulty\n* Objects no longer show \"male/female\" denominators outside wizard mode.\n* Incorporate [[xNetHack]]'s spellcast success formula for the most part.\n\n# Compute a percentage as follows:\n## Start with your role's base spellcasting ability (see below table).\n## +5% per experience level.\n## Compute your effective Intelligence:\n### Your Intelligence score.\n### If you are wearing a [[robe]] or wielding a [[quarterstaff]], +5.\n### If higher than 20, set to the maximum of 20 and your Intelligence attribute.\n## +5% per point of your effective Intelligence.\n## &minus;25% per spell level.\n## &minus;50% for metallic [[body armor]].\n## &minus;30% for wearing a bulky (oc_large) [[shield]], or &minus;15% for non-bulky. Bulky shields are large, Uruk-hai, and dwarvish roundshield.\n## &minus;15% for wearing a metallic shield, independent of the above penalty.\n## &minus;20% for a metallic [[helm]].\n## &minus;35% for metallic [[gloves]].\n## &minus;10% for metallic [[boots]].\n## Armor penalties don't apply for the helm of brilliance or items that confer the brilliance property. That is, they override the metal penalty and *all* shield penalties.\n## If [[Skill|Expert]] in the spell and above 100%, set to 100%. If Skilled and above 80%, set to 80%. If Basic and above 60%, set to 60%. If Unskilled and above 40%, set to 40%. \n## If below 0%, set to 0%.\n# Pw cost of the spell = (spell level × 5) / percentage. (If percentage is 0, the Pw cost is calculated as if it had a success rate of 0.5%)\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Arc !! Bar !! Cav !! Hea !! Kni !! Mon !! Pri !! Ran !! Rog !! Sam !! Tou !! Val !!

It causes the warper to warp (bypassing noteleport) to an object of their choice that they covet. This has a 1-turn cooldown, to avoid abusing the random outcome from warps that end up near, rather than precisely at, the object, by repeatedly warping until you are happy with the outcome. Covetous-warping is a free action\n* Downgraded soldiers from being skilled wand users, to only having basic wand skill\n* Swapped wand skill levels of Barbarians and Cavemen\n** Barbarians went from restricted to capping out at Basic. They still start Unskilled\n** Cavemen are now restricted\n* Overhauled Conflict\n** It no longer changes how the AI behaves in any way. Instead, at the end of the turn, a \"conflict area\" of radius 8 is created around every monster (or player) causing conflict, excluding the center spot (but they can be affected in case of mutual conflict).\n** Every monster within the affected area, unless they resist (ring-class willpower check similar to vanilla NetHack), will be forced to attack a random nearby monster in melee\n** This is a free action for them, so the attack doesn't consume any movement points\n** This doesn't anger peacefuls in case a player is hitting one while conflicted. It also doesn't break pacifist if the player inadvertly kills a monster under conflict. However, neither does it grant alignment record points, experience, death drops (beyond a corpse + inventory, as usual), etc.\n** Likewise, monsters killing each other doesn't give them experience for the kill\n\n[[Category:FIQHack]]\n[[Category:Variants]]"}

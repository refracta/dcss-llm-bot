{"title":"Bugs in NetHack 4","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Bugs_in_NetHack_4","type":"markdown","data":"Like other [NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\") [variants](/wiki/Variant \"Variant\"), [NetHack 4](/wiki/NetHack_4 \"NetHack 4\") has bugs. This page used to track the status of the [Bugs in NetHack 3.4.3](/wiki/Bugs_in_NetHack_3.4.3 \"Bugs in NetHack 3.4.3\") in NetHack 4, together with new bugs introduced in NetHack 4.\n\nThe NetHack 4 project now uses a [bug tracker](https://trac.nethack4.org); the bugs listed on this page will be migrated to the new tracker. Please report new bugs there instead of adding to this page; this page's listing is now quite obsolete.\n\nSpecial thanks to everyone who helped to compile this list.\n\nNetHack 4's developers would appreciate feedback on these bugs, especially the ones marked as \"Unclear\" (if anyone knows what these bug reports mean, please let us know!), and the ones marked as \"Unknown\" (where typically nobody knows what to do to reproduce the bug).\n\nKey:\n\n- Fixed: The bug existed in NetHack 4 (or one of its predecessor variants, [AceHack](/wiki/AceHack \"AceHack\") or [NitroHack](/wiki/NitroHack \"NitroHack\")) and was fixed.\n- Incidentally fixed: The bug was fixed due to unrelated changes made in NetHack 4.\n- Fix available: The bug has a fix available for it in some other variant, but that fix has not yet been merged into NetHack 4.\n- Confirmed: The bug has been reproduced in NetHack 4 (typically with a save file recorded for it).\n- Moot: The bug's context no longer exists in NetHack 4.\n- Info available: The cause of the bug has been explained for NetHack 3.4.3 on this wiki, and thus further investigation was not worthwhile.\n- Debatable: There is some doubt as to whether this is a bug, or about whether it would be reasonable to fix it.\n- Unclear: It is not clear what the bug description refers to.\n- Unknown: The bug has not been reproduced in NetHack 4, but may well still exist.\n- Untested: An explanation has been proposed (typically, as a result of looking at the source), but the bug has not actually been reproduced in NetHack 4.\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1

An easy way to trigger it is to eat lizard corpses off the floor with nothing in inventory but worn armor in the presence of several hostile nymphs while your nutrition is between 1500 and 2000. When it asks if you want to stop eating, say no. (You'll stop anyway as soon as a nymph seduces you, but saying no causes nomovemsg to remain set.)

title=\"AceHack\">AceHack</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/NitroHack\" title=\"NitroHack\">NitroHack</a>) and was fixed.</li>\n<li>Incidentally fixed: The bug was fixed due to unrelated changes made in NetHack 4.</li>\n<li>Fix available: The bug has a fix available for it in some other variant, but that fix has not yet been merged into NetHack 4.</li>\n<li>Confirmed: The bug has been reproduced in NetHack 4 (typically with a save file recorded for it).</li>\n<li>Moot: The bug's context no longer exists in NetHack 4.</li>\n<li>Info available: The cause of the bug has been explained for NetHack 3.4.3 on this wiki, and thus further investigation was not worthwhile.</li>\n<li>Debatable: There is some doubt as to whether this is a bug, or about whether it would be reasonable to fix it.</li>\n<li>Unclear: It is not clear what the bug description refers to.</li>\n<li>Unknown: The bug has not been reproduced in NetHack 4, but may well still exist.</li>\n<li>Untested: An explanation has been proposed (typically, as a result of looking at the source), but the bug has not actually been reproduced in NetHack 4.</li></ul>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\"

other [[NetHack]] [[variant]]s, [[NetHack 4]] has bugs. This page used to track the status of the [[Bugs in NetHack 3.4.3]] in NetHack 4, together with new bugs introduced in NetHack 4.\n\nThe NetHack 4 project now uses a [https://trac.nethack4.org bug tracker]; the bugs listed on this page will be migrated to the new tracker. Please report new bugs there instead of adding to this page; this page's listing is now quite obsolete.\n\nSpecial thanks to everyone who helped to compile this list.\n\nNetHack 4's developers would appreciate feedback on these bugs, especially the ones marked as \"Unclear\" (if anyone knows what these bug reports mean, please let us know!), and the ones marked as \"Unknown\" (where typically nobody knows what to do to reproduce the bug).\n\nKey:\n\n* Fixed: The bug existed in NetHack 4 (or one of its predecessor variants, [[AceHack]] or [[NitroHack]]) and was fixed.\n* Incidentally fixed: The bug was fixed due to unrelated changes made in NetHack 4.\n* Fix available: The bug has a fix available for it in some other variant, but that fix has not yet been merged into NetHack 4.\n* Confirmed: The bug has been reproduced in NetHack 4 (typically with a save file recorded for it).\n* Moot: The bug's context no longer exists in NetHack 4.\n* Info available: The cause of the bug has been explained for NetHack 3.4.3 on this wiki, and thus further investigation was not worthwhile.\n* Debatable: There is some doubt as to whether this is a bug, or about whether it would be reasonable to fix it.\n* Unclear: It is not clear what the bug description refers to.\n* Unknown: The bug has not been reproduced in NetHack 4, but may well still exist.\n* Untested: An explanation has been proposed (typically, as a result of looking at the source), but the bug has not actually been reproduced in NetHack 4.\n\n==Inherited from Vanilla releases older than 3.4.3==\n{| class=\"prettytable sortable striped\"\n!

Asparagus (the only one that's widely considered a food in the English-speaking world) and lotus (due to famously being eaten in the Odyssey) are the only such words that are even vaguely likely to turn up (unless someone is being deliberately over-the-top silly, in which case they deserve whatever weird message the game gives them).\n|-\n! {{aa|C341-18}}\n| Fixed\n| {{/trackerstatus|moot}}\n| ki-rins and couatls can wear (and may have) armor.\n| Shields, boots, gloves, and (non-metallic for ki-rin) helmets.

Several places in the code (\"Fortunately, you are wearing a hard helmet\"; \"Your helmet blocks the attack to your head\") always refer to the object in your armor slot as a helmet, even when it can't properly be described as a helmet (such as having a fedora block a mind flayer attack). Fixed by Grunt.\n|-\n! {{aa|C343-29}}\n| Fix available\n| {{/trackerstatus|14}}\n| When taking things out of a bag of holding, messages may say \"lifting\" instead of \"removing.\"\n| This happens when you get the confirmation asking if you want to continue (because your encumbrance level would increase and you are over your threshold).

{"title":"AceHack","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/AceHack","type":"markdown","data":"**AceHack** is a [variant](/wiki/Variant \"Variant\") of *[NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\")* that focuses on very similar gameplay combined with an improved interface. Work on AceHack as a standalone variant stopped in 2012, after it was merged with [NitroHack](/wiki/NitroHack \"NitroHack\") to form [NetHack 4](/wiki/NetHack_4 \"NetHack 4\"). At present, it is still in an unfinished alpha status, but is nonetheless playable.\n\nAceHack's codebase is mostly based on that of [NetHack 3.4.3](/wiki/NetHack_3.4.3 \"NetHack 3.4.3\"), but also contains code from [UnNetHack](/wiki/UnNetHack \"UnNetHack\") (which in turn contains several changes that originally came from AceHack), [SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\"), and [GruntHack](/wiki/GruntHack \"GruntHack\"), as well as versions of several [patches](/wiki/Patch \"Patch\") (often rewritten ones).\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Gameplay changes](#Gameplay_changes)\n- [2 Meta-gameplay changes](#Meta-gameplay_changes)\n- [3 Options changes](#Options_changes)\n- [4 Interface changes](#Interface_changes)\n- [5 Internal changes](#Internal_changes)\n- [6 Descendants](#Descendants)\n- [7 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Gameplay changes\n\nThe few gameplay changes in AceHack (other than straightforward [bug](/wiki/Bug \"Bug\") fixes, which tend to change gameplay when they fix exploits) are mostly designed to compensate for the removal of interface drawbacks, to reduce the chance of unavoidable bad luck, or to permit a simpler equivalent to what would otherwise be degenerate strategies, and err on the side of making the game easier:\n\n- [Spellbooks](/wiki/Spellbook \"Spellbook\") can be read even before [your](/wiki/You \"You\") memory of the spell wears out.\n- The [vibrating square](/wiki/Vibrating_square \"Vibrating square\") is visible from a distance.\n- Several items that can be trivially identified now self-identify, such as [jumping boots](/wiki/Jumping_boots \"Jumping boots\") (when worn), [scrolls of identify](/wiki/Scroll_of_identify \"Scroll of identify\") (when picked up in a shop), and [potions of oil](/wiki/Potion_of_oil \"Potion of oil\") (at the start of the game).\n- [Floating eyes](/wiki/Floating_eye \"Floating eye\"), rather than [paralyzing](/wiki/Paralysis \"Paralysis\") a player who attempts to melee them, instead use a gaze that forces players to miss. (They still have their normal effect on monsters.)\n- [Stormbringer](/wiki/Stormbringer \"Stormbringer\") gives the [aggravate monster](/wiki/Aggravate_monster \"Aggravate monster\") extrinsic, rather than confirming attacks on peaceful and tame monsters.\n- [Amnesia](/wiki/Amnesia \"Amnesia\") no longer causes any information to be forgotten that could be remembered simply via keeping notes, instead giving gameplay effects such as removing [spells](/wiki/Spells \"Spells\") and [skills](/wiki/Skills \"Skills\"), and causing items to become informally rather than formally identified.\n- [Swapping](/wiki/Swap_weapons \"Swap weapons\") your wielded and readied weapons no longer costs a turn. (Readying a weapon directly, something not possible in vanilla NetHack but possible in AceHack, does.)\n- Dropping a [container](/wiki/Container \"Container\") on an [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\") identifies the [beatitude](/wiki/Beatitude \"Beatitude\") of its contents, if it would identify the beatitude of the container itself. (In a related change, un[BCUed](/wiki/BCU \"BCU\") items now stack with BCUed items that they would otherwise stack with, so there is no incentive to deliberately refuse to learn the beatitude of an item.)\n- You cannot destroy a [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\") by placing a [bag of tricks](/wiki/Bag_of_tricks \"Bag of tricks\") or [wand of cancellation](/wiki/Wand_of_cancellation \"Wand of cancellation\") in it; doing so will drain all charges from the latter item instead. You *can* destroy bags of holding by nesting them, but will get a confirmation first.\n- [Candles](/wiki/Candle \"Candle\") are a lot more likely to be generated in the [Gnomish Mines](/wiki/Gnomish_Mines \"Gnomish Mines\"), typically in the inventory of gnomes (who will actually use the candles). This is to make it very unlikely that the game will have insufficient randomly-generated candles to perform the [Invocation](/wiki/Invocation \"Invocation\").\n- The [scroll of charging](/wiki/Scroll_of_charging \"Scroll of charging\") identifies the number of charges remaining on an object (in addition to its usual effects; this is also still an effect of the [scroll of identify](/wiki/Scroll_of_identify \"Scroll of identify\")). The same effects (charging and identification) also reveal the number of remaining turns that a [light source](/wiki/Light_source \"Light source\") will continue to provide light.\n- The [weights](/wiki/Weight \"Weight\") of inventory items are now visible, whenever the player would be able to touch them to check their weight. ([Cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") and [chickatrice](/wiki/Chickatrice \"Chickatrice\") [corpses](/wiki/Corpse \"Corpse\") and the various [gray stones](/wiki/Gray_stone \"Gray stone\") do not have visible weights outside the player's inventory.)\n\nAdditionally, the monster AI has been improved, particularly for [pets](/wiki/Pets \"Pets\"). There were some unintentional balance changes as a side-effect of this, particularly for [pacifists](/wiki/Pacifist \"Pacifist\"); the author intends to fix these before release.\n\nOne highly notable change is that [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") no longer has any special effect; however, its effect is still available in AceHack, as the [heptagram](/wiki/Heptagram \"Heptagram\"), which is identical to an engraved Elbereth, except that it's a symbol rather than a word, and does not [exercise](/wiki/Exercise \"Exercise\") [Wisdom](/wiki/Wisdom \"Wisdom\"). It can most simply be dust-engraved by pressing [.](/wiki/Dot \"Dot\").\n\n## Meta-gameplay changes\n\nAlthough AceHack tries to keep the gameplay much the same, it changes the goals of the game unrelated to winning/losing, such as [scoring](/wiki/Scoring \"Scoring\") and [conducts](/wiki/Conducts \"Conducts\"), to make them more interesting:\n\n- The [illiterate](/wiki/Illiterate \"Illiterate\") conduct has been split into \"no reading or writing of text\" (still called \"illiterate\") and \"no writing of heptagrams\" (\"[heptagramless](/wiki/Heptagramless \"Heptagramless\")\").\n- A new \"solo mode\" prevents [bones files](/wiki/Bones_files \"Bones files\") from being loaded, and makes [startscumming](/wiki/Startscumming \"Startscumming\") visible (normally, AceHack allows players to view and reroll their stats and inventory before starting the game).\n- Game score follows an entirely different algorithm, designed to make scorebearing items like [gems](/wiki/Gem \"Gem\") and [zorkmids](/wiki/Zorkmid \"Zorkmid\") have a significant effect on scoring, as well as several other categories (such as [experience level](/wiki/Experience_level \"Experience level\")), and to penalise spending excessive lengths of time trying to grind up a few more points. It also emphasizes scoring well in every scoring category rather than focusing on just one.\n\nSeveral more game modes are intended to be added to AceHack eventually (such as Adeon's \"Heaven or Hell\" variant); there is also a multiplayer version of AceHack under development (intended to eventually be merged with the main codebase), but it is not yet playable. There is also a plan to track more conducts than at present.\n\n## Options changes\n\nAceHack has a philosophy of eliminating options that players will rarely want to change from the defaults, and making sure that the defaults for options are sane. There are typically fewer than ten options that can be changed from within the game, although the list of which options are available tends to change based on player feedback; options are kept only if there is widespread disagreement about what their default value should be (such as `floorcolor`), if they are needed for compatibility with certain types of terminal (such as `color` or `DECgraphics`), or if their setting may need to be changed within a game (such as the `pickup_types`).\n\n## Interface changes\n\nAceHack's most radical changes are in its interface; most obviously, it makes much greater use of color than vanilla NetHack, to allow the player to determine facts about monsters and squares more easily without having to [farlook](/wiki/Farlook \"Farlook\"). (For instance, background color is used to distinguish [tame](/wiki/Tame \"Tame\"), [peaceful](/wiki/Peaceful \"Peaceful\") and [hostile](/wiki/Hostile \"Hostile\") monsters, and to show which squares have [stairs](/wiki/Stair \"Stair\") under [items](/wiki/Item \"Item\").)\n\nThe game's command system has also been redone (although most vanilla commands, apart from rarely-used ones like [G](/wiki/G \"G\") and [v](/wiki/V \"V\"), still work); the intent is to reduce the number of keystrokes required to type commands, and reduce the risk involved in typing on a laggy connection. The game also tries to detect some inherently dangerous actions (like walking into [lava](/wiki/Lava \"Lava\") or meleeing a peaceful [shopkeeper](/wiki/Shopkeeper \"Shopkeeper\")), and instead of displaying a yes/no prompt (which can easily be triggered by accident when using [y](/wiki/Y \"Y\") to move), requires a prefix; for instance, [m](/wiki/M \"M\")[k](/wiki/K \"K\") (or [m](/wiki/M \"M\")[8](/wiki/8 \"8\")) would be needed to deliberately move north into lava. (AceHack's default keybindings are a hybrid between the [numpad](/wiki/Numpad \"Numpad\") and [vi-keys](/wiki/Vi-keys \"Vi-keys\") control systems, with either working to move, and [#](/wiki/Hash_mark \"Hash mark\") being used for command repeat as well as for [extended commands](/wiki/Extended_command \"Extended command\").) There are also several convenience features such as opening doors merely by walking into them, and [autoexplore](/wiki/Autoexplore \"Autoexplore\").\n\nAceHack also contains a tutorial mode that teaches players the basics of the commands and gameplay. (It has since been copied by UnNetHack.)\n\n## Internal changes\n\nAceHack has several internal changes from NetHack; the main user-visible effects of this are a main menu which allows anyone to enter [explore mode](/wiki/Explore_mode \"Explore mode\") and (except on public servers) [debug mode](/wiki/Debug_mode \"Debug mode\"), and a different (and hopefully easier to use) build system.\n\n## Descendants\n\nThe interface/convenience improvements from Acehack, such as the more detailed [base attributes](/wiki/Base_attributes \"Base attributes\") screen and the [autoexplore](/wiki/Autoexplore \"Autoexplore\") command, have been integrated into more recently-updated variants such as [DynaHack](/wiki/DynaHack \"DynaHack\"), [FIQhack](/wiki/FIQhack \"FIQhack\"), [Fourk](/wiki/Fourk \"Fourk\"), and [NetHack4](/wiki/NetHack4 \"NetHack4\").\n\n## External links\n\n- [Changelog listing differences between NetHack and AceHack](https://github.com/deepy/acehack/blob/master/doc/fixes36.0)\n- [Source code](https://github.com/deepy/acehack)\n\n[![This article describes a 3.4.3-based variant of NetHack.

(For instance, background color is used to distinguish <a href=\"/wiki/Tame\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tame\">tame</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Peaceful\" title=\"Peaceful\">peaceful</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Hostile\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hostile\">hostile</a> monsters, and to show which squares have <a href=\"/wiki/Stair\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stair\">stairs</a> under <a href=\"/wiki/Item\" title=\"Item\">items</a>.) \n</p><p>The game's command system has also been redone (although most vanilla commands, apart from rarely-used ones like <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/G\" title=\"G\">G</a></span></span> and <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/V\" title=\"V\">v</a></span></span>, still work); the intent is to reduce the number of keystrokes required to type commands, and reduce the risk involved in typing on a laggy connection. The game also tries to detect some inherently dangerous actions (like walking into <a href=\"/wiki/Lava\" title=\"Lava\">lava</a> or meleeing a peaceful <a href=\"/wiki/Shopkeeper\" title=\"Shopkeeper\">shopkeeper</a>), and instead of displaying a yes/no prompt (which can easily be triggered by accident when using <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/Y\" title=\"Y\">y</a></span></span> to move), requires a prefix; for instance, <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/M\" title=\"M\">m</a></span></span><span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/K\" title=\"K\">k</a></span></span> (or <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/M\" title=\"M\">m</a></span></span><span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/8\" title=\"8\">8</a></span></span>) would be needed to deliberately move north into lava. (AceHack's default keybindings are a hybrid between the <a href=\"/wiki/Numpad\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Numpad\">numpad</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Vi-keys\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vi-keys\">vi-keys</a> control systems, with either working to move, and <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/Hash_mark\" title=\"Hash mark\">#</a></span></span> being used for command repeat as well as for <a href=\"/wiki/Extended_command\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Extended command\">extended commands</a>.) There are also several convenience features such as opening doors merely by walking into them, and <a href=\"/wiki/Autoexplore\" title=\"Autoexplore\">autoexplore</a>.\n</p><p>AceHack also contains a tutorial mode that teaches players the basics of the commands and gameplay. (It has since been copied by UnNetHack.)\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Internal_changes\">Internal changes</span></h2>\n<p>AceHack has several internal changes from NetHack; the main user-visible effects of this are a main menu which allows anyone to enter <a href=\"/wiki/Explore_mode\" title=\"Explore mode\">explore mode</a> and (except on public servers) <a href=\"/wiki/Debug_mode\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Debug mode\">debug mode</a>, and a different (and hopefully easier to use) build system.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Descendants\">Descendants</span></h2>\n<p>The interface/convenience improvements from Acehack, such as the more detailed <a href=\"/wiki/Base_attributes\" title=\"Base attributes\">base attributes</a> screen and the <a href=\"/wiki/Autoexplore\" title=\"Autoexplore\">autoexplore</a> command, have been integrated into more recently-updated variants such as <a href=\"/wiki/DynaHack\" title=\"DynaHack\">DynaHack</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/FIQhack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"FIQhack\">FIQhack</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Fourk\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fourk\">Fourk</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/NetHack4\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"NetHack4\">NetHack4</a>. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/deepy/acehack/blob/master/doc/fixes36.0\">Changelog listing differences between NetHack and AceHack</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/deepy/acehack\">Source code</a></li></ul>\n<div style=\"display:none; right:44px; padding-bottom: 17px\" class=\"metadata topicon nopopups\"><div style=\"margin-top: -10px\"><a href=\"/wiki/NetHackWiki:Next_version\" title=\"This article describes a 3.4.3-based variant of NetHack.

is a [[variant]] of ''[[NetHack]]'' that focuses on very similar gameplay combined with an improved interface. Work on AceHack as a standalone variant stopped in 2012, after it was merged with [[NitroHack]] to form [[NetHack 4]]. At present, it is still in an unfinished alpha status, but is nonetheless playable.\n\nAceHack's codebase is mostly based on that of [[NetHack 3.4.3]], but also contains code from [[UnNetHack]] (which in turn contains several changes that originally came from AceHack), [[SLASH'EM]], and [[GruntHack]], as well as versions of several [[patch]]es (often rewritten ones).\n\n== Gameplay changes ==\nThe few gameplay changes in AceHack (other than straightforward [[bug]] fixes, which tend to change gameplay when they fix exploits) are mostly designed to compensate for the removal of interface drawbacks, to reduce the chance of unavoidable bad luck, or to permit a simpler equivalent to what would otherwise be degenerate strategies, and err on the side of making the game easier:\n* [[Spellbook]]s can be read even before [[you|your]] memory of the spell wears out.\n* The [[vibrating square]] is visible from a distance.\n* Several items that can be trivially identified now self-identify, such as [[jumping boots]] (when worn), [[scroll of identify|scrolls of identify]] (when picked up in a shop), and [[potion of oil|potions of oil]] (at the start of the game).\n* [[Floating eye]]s, rather than [[paralysis|paralyzing]] a player who attempts to melee them, instead use a gaze that forces players to miss. (They still have their normal effect on monsters.)\n* [[Stormbringer]] gives the [[aggravate monster]] extrinsic, rather than confirming attacks on peaceful and tame monsters.\n* [[Amnesia]] no longer causes any information to be forgotten that could be remembered simply via keeping notes, instead giving gameplay effects such as removing [[spells]] and [[skills]], and causing items to become informally rather than formally identified.\n* [[swap weapons|Swapping]] your wielded and readied weapons no longer costs a turn. (Readying a weapon directly, something not possible in vanilla NetHack but possible in AceHack, does.)\n* Dropping a [[container]] on an [[altar]] identifies the [[beatitude]] of its contents, if it would identify the beatitude of the container itself. (In a related change, un[[BCU]]ed items now stack with BCUed items that they would otherwise stack with, so there is no incentive to deliberately refuse to learn the beatitude of an item.)\n* You cannot destroy a [[bag of holding]] by placing a [[bag of tricks]] or [[wand of cancellation]] in it; doing so will drain all charges from the latter item instead. You ''can'' destroy bags of holding by nesting them, but will get a confirmation first.\n* [[Candle]]s are a lot more likely to be generated in the [[Gnomish Mines]], typically in the inventory of gnomes (who will actually use the candles). This is to make it very unlikely that the game will have insufficient randomly-generated candles to perform the [[Invocation]].\n* The [[scroll of charging]] identifies the number of charges remaining on an object (in addition to its usual effects; this is also still an effect of the [[scroll of identify]]). The same effects (charging and identification) also reveal the number of remaining turns that a [[light source]] will continue to provide light.\n* The [[weight]]s of inventory items are now visible, whenever the player would be able to touch them to check their weight. ([[Cockatrice]] and [[chickatrice]] [[corpse]]s and the various [[gray stone]]s do not have visible weights outside the player's inventory.)\n\nAdditionally, the monster AI has been improved, particularly for [[pets]]. There were some unintentional balance changes as a side-effect of this, particularly for [[pacifist]]s; the author intends to fix these before release.\n\nOne highly notable change is that [[Elbereth]] no longer has any special effect; however, its effect is still available in AceHack, as the [[heptagram]], which is identical to an engraved Elbereth, except that it's a symbol rather than a word, and does not [[exercise]] [[Wisdom]]. It can most simply be dust-engraved by pressing {{kbd|.}}.\n\n== Meta-gameplay changes ==\nAlthough AceHack tries to keep the gameplay much the same, it changes the goals of the game unrelated to winning/losing, such as [[scoring]] and [[conducts]], to make them more interesting:\n* The [[illiterate]] conduct has been split into \"no reading or writing of text\" (still called \"illiterate\") and \"no writing of heptagrams\" (\"[[heptagramless]]\").\n* A new \"solo mode\" prevents [[bones files]] from being loaded, and makes [[startscumming]] visible (normally, AceHack allows players to view and reroll their stats and inventory before starting the game).\n* Game score follows an entirely different algorithm, designed to make scorebearing items like [[gem]]s and [[zorkmid]]s have a significant effect on scoring, as well as several other categories (such as [[experience level]]), and to penalise spending excessive lengths of time trying to grind up a few more points. It also emphasizes scoring well in every scoring category rather than focusing on just one.\n\nSeveral more game modes are intended to be added to AceHack eventually (such as Adeon's \"Heaven or Hell\" variant); there is also a multiplayer version of AceHack under development (intended to eventually be merged with the main codebase), but it is not yet playable. There is also a plan to track more conducts than at present.\n\n== Options changes ==\nAceHack has a philosophy of eliminating options that players will rarely want to change from the defaults, and making sure that the defaults for options are sane. There are typically fewer than ten options that can be changed from within the game, although the list of which options are available tends to change based on player feedback; options are kept only if there is widespread disagreement about what their default value should be (such as <tt>[[floorcolor]]</tt>), if they are needed for compatibility with certain types of terminal (such as <tt>[[color]]</tt> or <tt>[[DECgraphics]]</tt>), or if their setting may need to be changed within a game (such as the <tt>[[pickup_types]]</tt>).\n\n== Interface changes ==\nAceHack's most radical changes are in its interface; most obviously, it makes much greater use of color than vanilla NetHack, to allow the player to determine facts about monsters and squares more easily without having to [[farlook]]. (For instance, background color is used to distinguish [[tame]], [[peaceful]] and [[hostile]] monsters, and to show which squares have [[stair]]s under [[item]]s.) \n\nThe game's command system has also been redone (although most vanilla commands, apart from rarely-used ones like {{kbd|G}} and {{kbd|v}}, still work); the intent is to reduce the number of keystrokes required to type commands, and reduce the risk involved in typing on a laggy connection. The game also tries to detect some inherently dangerous actions (like walking into [[lava]] or meleeing a peaceful [[shopkeeper]]), and instead of displaying a yes/no prompt (which can easily be triggered by accident when using {{kbd|y}} to move), requires a prefix; for instance, {{kbd|m}}{{kbd|k}} (or {{kbd|m}}{{kbd|8}}) would be needed to deliberately move north into lava. (AceHack's default keybindings are a hybrid between the [[numpad]] and [[vi-keys]] control systems, with either working to move, and {{kbd|#}} being used for command repeat as well as for [[extended command]]s.) There are also several convenience features such as opening doors merely by walking into them, and [[autoexplore]].\n\nAceHack also contains a tutorial mode that teaches players the basics of the commands and gameplay. (It has since been copied by UnNetHack.)\n\n== Internal changes ==\nAceHack has several internal changes from NetHack; the main user-visible effects of this are a main menu which allows anyone to enter [[explore mode]] and (except on public servers) [[debug mode]], and a different (and hopefully easier to use) build system.\n\n== Descendants ==\nThe interface/convenience improvements from Acehack, such as the more detailed [[base attributes]] screen and the [[autoexplore]] command, have been integrated into more recently-updated variants such as [[DynaHack]], [[FIQhack]], [[Fourk]], and [[NetHack4]]. \n\n== External links ==\n* [https://github.com/deepy/acehack/blob/master/doc/fixes36.0 Changelog listing differences between NetHack and AceHack]\n* [https://github.com/deepy/acehack Source code]\n{{variant-343|offset=1}}\n{{featured}}\n[[Category:Variants]]"}

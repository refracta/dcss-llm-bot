{"title":"Zen","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Zen","type":"markdown","data":"**Zen** is a particularly challenging [conduct](/wiki/Conduct \"Conduct\") in *[NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\")* that is based around remaining [blind](/wiki/Blind \"Blind\") throughout the whole game.\n\nUnlike most other conducts, you must enable the [blind](/wiki/Options#blind \"Options\") option in your [configuration file](/wiki/Configuration_file \"Configuration file\") with the following line in order for your game to qualify. This makes you permanently blind without requiring other sources of blindness.\n\n```\nOPTIONS=blind\n```\n\nNetHack does not actually use the term \"zen\" anywhere; it refers to the conduct as **blind from birth**.\n\nEven when you are permanently blind, you are able to read (or at least \"turn the pages of\") the [Book of the Dead](/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead \"Book of the Dead\"), since otherwise it would not be possible to win the game, similar to how reading it does not break [illiterate](/wiki/Illiterate \"Illiterate\") conduct.\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Strategy](#Strategy)\n\n  - [1.1 Early game](#Early_game)\n  - [1.2 Pets](#Pets)\n  - [1.3 Object appearances](#Object_appearances)\n  - [1.4 Shopkeepers](#Shopkeepers)\n  - [1.5 Late game](#Late_game)\n\n- [2 Notable ascensions](#Notable_ascensions)\n\n- [3 History](#History)\n  - [3.1 NetHack 3.4.3 specific strategy](#NetHack_3.4.3_specific_strategy)\n\n- [4 Origin](#Origin)\n\n- [5 Variants](#Variants)\n\n  - [5.1 UnNetHack](#UnNetHack)\n  - [5.2 NetHack 4](#NetHack_4)\n  - [5.3 TNNT (the game)](#TNNT_.28the_game.29)\n\n- [6 References](#References)\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe difficulty in zen lies in the fact that you cannot identify the appearance and [beatitude](/wiki/Beatitude \"Beatitude\") of most objects, and they are only shown as their object class - all potions are only shown as \"a potion\", wands as \"a wand\", etc. The exception to this is your starting inventory, which you always start with knowledge of. You cannot read scrolls while blind unless you learn their labels, e.g. buying scrolls from shopkeepers will have them name the labels for you. You also cannot use [altars](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\") to find the [BUC](/wiki/BUC \"BUC\") status of an object, because you cannot see if the objects glow and in what color.\n\n### Early game\n\nExploration will be slow and tedious, especially in the early game. Moving blindly will anger a peaceful creature if you attempt to walk onto their square without seeing them, even when using the safe-move function [m](/wiki/M \"M\"). A lawful or neutral zen player should be especially careful of committing accidental or intentional murder.\n\nPlayers are recommended to use the [search](/wiki/Search \"Search\") command with almost every step at least. This will be the only way to get any sort of warning of an approaching monster, and it will speed up the \"mapping\" of the level as the search command will check each adjacent square for walls, items, or creatures, while just moving will only check the square you're about to step on. If you know (or reasonably suspect) there is a wall, then walk into it; walking into a wall tile will reveal it on the map without using up a turn.\n\nA player's primary goal will be to acquire a source of telepathy as soon as possible - the most commonplace and likely source of telepathy is a [floating eye](/wiki/Floating_eye \"Floating eye\"), which will begin appearing when the average of the player's dungeon level and experience level is roughly 3. Players seeking a floating eye should not proceed much farther beyond the dungeon floors most likely to generate one - a [Wizard](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\") fortunate enough to start with the [detect monsters](/wiki/Detect_monsters \"Detect monsters\") spell will have a much easier time locating an eye, but the rest will be forced to rely (appropriately) on blind luck.\n\nPlayers can also obtain telepathy via prayer with at least 6 [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\"), a [helm of telepathy](/wiki/Helm_of_telepathy \"Helm of telepathy\") or an [amulet of ESP](/wiki/Amulet_of_ESP \"Amulet of ESP\"), but getting enough Luck without a [luckstone](/wiki/Luckstone \"Luckstone\") is challenging in the early game, and the other two items are not particularly common.\n\n### Pets\n\nIt is advisable for a zen player to start without a pet, also set via the options file. A pet is extremely difficult to keep track of and distinguish from hostile monsters in the early game, and the player runs a serious risk of killing them accidentally. An alternative is to quickly ditch a starting pet on DL1 and proceeding into the dungeon, returning to re-tame the pet when telepathy is acquired. In either case, a zen player should eventually acquire a pet to identify the BUC status of items.\n\n### Object appearances\n\nFor information on how you can see objects while blind, see [the article section on object appearances](/wiki/Blindness#Discovering_objects \"Blindness\"), which contains a full list of ways to make an object \"seen\" without breaking the conduct. Most notably, a blessed [potion of object detection](/wiki/Potion_of_object_detection \"Potion of object detection\"), which can be dropped by a nymph, will identify all items in your inventory, containers and the map. If the farlook command [;](/wiki/Semicolon \"Semicolon\") does not tell you the appearance of an object even though you should know it, the object is buried or carried by a monster, or has since been moved away.\n\nBe careful not to eat [zombie](/wiki/Zombie \"Zombie\") corpses, and keep an eye out for critical messages in this regard when fighting monsters: you \"destroy\" zombies, but \"kill\" living enemies. Zombies also cannot be seen via telepathy.\n\n### Shopkeepers\n\nShops are important for identifying the appearance of large numbers of items, especially scrolls and potions. A container to place the items in and a pet to steal the container back will speed up the process of re-acquiring items you've just sold to the shopkeeper for identification.\n\nThe [pay](/wiki/Pay \"Pay\") command only works if you can see the [shopkeeper](/wiki/Shopkeeper \"Shopkeeper\"), either by [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\") or [monster detection](/wiki/Monster_detection \"Monster detection\"), or if he is angry. Alternatively, you may drop enough gold to cover your purchase and then teleport, jump or phase out, even without [teleport control](/wiki/Teleport_control \"Teleport control\"). The practical result of this is that a player will typically have no way to get an item out of a shop until [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\") is acquired. Bumping into a shopkeeper will anger them, even when using the [m](/wiki/M \"M\") command; since this will nearly always result in death, a zen player is best advised to simply avoid shops until they can properly use them.\n\nSelling items works as normal, which might be useful if you get burdened before acquiring telepathy.\n\n### Late game\n\nPrioritize the genocide of [green slimes](/wiki/Green_slime \"Green slime\") before entering [Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\"), because they cannot be seen while blind.\n\nWater or lava tiles cannot be identified while levitating, so be careful on water levels such as [Medusa level](/wiki/Medusa_level \"Medusa level\") and use magic mapping if possible.\n\nDo not step on a [cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") corpse while not wearing gloves.\n\n**Do NOT, under any circumstances, attempt to wear the [Eyes of the Overworld](/wiki/Eyes_of_the_Overworld \"Eyes of the Overworld\") in a zen game.** Putting them on will produce the message *\"For the first time in your life, you can see!\"* and break the conduct. They are the only thing in the game that can do this. Because the Eyes only provide effects when worn, they aren't even worth carrying around.\n\n## Notable ascensions\n\nOnly a handful of people are known to have ascended zen games, and most of them have been zen [samurai](/wiki/Samurai \"Samurai\"). [this post to RGRN](http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/1f508de3da1c4ed3/3f67dccf081db600?lnk=st) announces the first known ascended zen [tourist](/wiki/Tourist \"Tourist\"). [Jo√£o Santos](http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/msg/83ba3b23689d60dc?hl=en) is the only person known to have completed zen ascensions in all four pre-3.6.0 roles able to do zen. A [nudist](/wiki/Unofficial_conduct#Nudist \"Unofficial conduct\") zen ranger [has been ascended](http://un.nethack.nu/user/boxo/dumps/boxo.1341391449.txt.html) in [UnNetHack](/wiki/UnNetHack \"UnNetHack\"), which allows all roles to try zen.\n\nA complete Zen Samurai ascension can be watched [here](http://www.codehappy.net/nethacktheatre/zen.ttyrec.gz) in [ttyrec](/wiki/Ttyrec \"Ttyrec\") format.\n\nA video of a complete Zen [Nudist](/wiki/Nudist \"Nudist\") Valkyrie ascension from 2019 [TNNT](/wiki/TNNT \"TNNT\") can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLZEdecBa4A).\n\n## History\n\nIn [NetHack 3.4.3](/wiki/NetHack_3.4.3 \"NetHack 3.4.3\") and earlier versions, players have to set their own rules for the conduct (which was unofficial during the time that it was the latest version) and use several workarounds, such as wearing [blindfolds](/wiki/Blindfold \"Blindfold\") or permanently polymorphing into blind monsters. Only [Samurai](/wiki/Samurai \"Samurai\"), [Rogues](/wiki/Rogue \"Rogue\"), Wizards, and [Tourists](/wiki/Tourist \"Tourist\") can start with a [blindfold](/wiki/Blindfold \"Blindfold\") or [towel](/wiki/Towel \"Towel\"), which typically required a little [start scumming](/wiki/Start_scumming \"Start scumming\"), and even then you would be momentarily non-blind for a short time at the beginning to blind yourself. Players also had to temporarily remove their source of blindness in order read the Book of the Dead as part of the [invocation ritual](/wiki/Invocation_ritual \"Invocation ritual\").\n\nThe term \"zen\" dates back to the era when this was a purely unofficial conduct. It remains more popular in the community than the conduct's official name of \"blind from birth.\"\n\n### NetHack 3.4.3 specific strategy\n\nGenerally, a Samurai is considered the easiest role for 3.4.3 zen conduct due to their good starting armor and strong melee combat skills, which are important in the early parts of the game. A Wizard can start with several helpful items for the early game as well, such as a [wand of fire](/wiki/Wand_of_fire \"Wand of fire\") or [lightning](/wiki/Wand_of_lightning \"Wand of lightning\") for partially reliable engraving of [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\"), or a [ring of warning](/wiki/Ring_of_warning \"Ring of warning\"). The Rogue and Tourist are going to have a more difficult time, due to weaker melee skills and a lack of strong starting gear.\n\nA zen game is *flawed* if a nymph or monkey steals your blinding item and you immediately put on another one, without looking at your inventory. Should this happen, be careful not to use the [#name](#name) or [i](/wiki/I \"I\") commands, since these will reveal object appearances in your inventory.\n\n## Origin\n\n[![Wikipedia](/images/thumb/f/f8/Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png/50px-Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png)](/wiki/File:Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png \"Wikipedia\")\n\n[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page \"wikipedia:Main Page\") has an article about:\n\n***[Zen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen \"wikipedia:Zen\")***\n\nThe conduct is named for a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty. Zen Buddhism emphasizes rigorous self-restraint, meditation, and a direct understanding of \"natures\", specifically the \"nature of mind\" and the \"nature of things\", and encourages the expression of these insights for the benefit of others in daily life:\n\n```\nThe Dharma is the truth that all natures are pure. By this \ntruth, all appearances are empty... The buddha is your own \nmind... As long as mortals are attached to appearances, \nthey're unaware that their minds are empty. And by mistakenly \nclinging to the appearance of things they lose the Way.\n -Bodhidharma\n```\n\nZen conduct in *NetHack* focuses more on the \"detachment from appearances\" tenet of the above.\n\n## Variants\n\n### UnNetHack\n\n[UnNetHack](/wiki/UnNetHack \"UnNetHack\") adds functionality that allows players to optionally select certain conducts at the start of the game, tracks them, and punishes players for breaking them. If the player selects zen conduct, they begin the game wearing a cursed blindfold: if it is ever removed and the conduct is broken, some monsters are summoned around the player character. To use the Book of the Dead, you can #[invoke](/wiki/Invoke \"Invoke\") it.\n\n### NetHack 4\n\n[NetHack 4](/wiki/NetHack_4 \"NetHack 4\") offers a \"permablind\" option that gives blindness as an [intrinsic](/wiki/Intrinsic \"Intrinsic\"), overriding any attempt to remove it. Like UnNetHack, #invoke also allows use of the Book of the Dead. The conduct cannot be broken by the Eyes of the Overworld, because they no longer grant astral vision.\n\n### TNNT (the game)\n\n[TNNT (the game)](/wiki/TNNT_\\(the_game\\) \"TNNT (the game)\") offers the \"blind\" option, and there is an achievement for receiving the quest with the Zen conduct intact.\n\n## References\n\n[![This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.7.

Bumping into a shopkeeper will anger them, even when using the <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/M\" title=\"M\">m</a></span></span> command; since this will nearly always result in death, a zen player is best advised to simply avoid shops until they can properly use them.\n</p><p>Selling items works as normal, which might be useful if you get burdened before acquiring telepathy.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Late_game\">Late game</span></h3>\n<p>Prioritize the genocide of <a href=\"/wiki/Green_slime\" title=\"Green slime\">green slimes</a> before entering <a href=\"/wiki/Gehennom\" title=\"Gehennom\">Gehennom</a>, because they cannot be seen while blind.\n</p><p>Water or lava tiles cannot be identified while levitating, so be careful on water levels such as <a href=\"/wiki/Medusa_level\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Medusa level\">Medusa level</a> and use magic mapping if possible.\n</p><p>Do not step on a <a href=\"/wiki/Cockatrice\" title=\"Cockatrice\">cockatrice</a> corpse while not wearing gloves.\n</p><p><b>Do NOT, under any circumstances, attempt to wear the <a href=\"/wiki/Eyes_of_the_Overworld\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eyes of the Overworld\">Eyes of the Overworld</a> in a zen game.</b> Putting them on will produce the message <i>\"For the first time in your life, you can see!\"</i> and break the conduct.

Only <a href=\"/wiki/Samurai\" title=\"Samurai\">Samurai</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Rogue\" title=\"Rogue\">Rogues</a>, Wizards, and <a href=\"/wiki/Tourist\" title=\"Tourist\">Tourists</a> can start with a <a href=\"/wiki/Blindfold\" title=\"Blindfold\">blindfold</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Towel\" title=\"Towel\">towel</a>, which typically required a little <a href=\"/wiki/Start_scumming\" title=\"Start scumming\">start scumming</a>, and even then you would be momentarily non-blind for a short time at the beginning to blind yourself. Players also had to temporarily remove their source of blindness in order read the Book of the Dead as part of the <a href=\"/wiki/Invocation_ritual\" title=\"Invocation ritual\">invocation ritual</a>.\n</p><p>The term \"zen\" dates back to the era when this was a purely unofficial conduct.

A Wizard can start with several helpful items for the early game as well, such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_fire\" title=\"Wand of fire\">wand of fire</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_lightning\" title=\"Wand of lightning\">lightning</a> for partially reliable engraving of <a href=\"/wiki/Elbereth\" title=\"Elbereth\">Elbereth</a>, or a <a href=\"/wiki/Ring_of_warning\" title=\"Ring of warning\">ring of warning</a>. The Rogue and Tourist are going to have a more difficult time, due to weaker melee skills and a lack of strong starting gear.\n</p><p>A zen game is <i>flawed</i> if a nymph or monkey steals your blinding item and you immediately put on another one, without looking at your inventory. Should this happen, be careful not to use the <a href=\"#name\">#name</a> or <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/I\" title=\"I\">i</a></span></span> commands, since these will reveal object appearances in your inventory.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origin\">Origin</span></h2>\n<div class=\"noprint sidebox\">\n<div style=\"float: left;\"><div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png\" class=\"image\" title=\"Wikipedia\"><img alt=\"Wikipedia\" src=\"/images/thumb/f/f8/Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png/50px-Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" srcset=\"/images/f/f8/Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png 1.5x\" /></a></div></div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 60px;\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Main Page\">Wikipedia</a> has an article about:\n<div style=\"margin-left: 10px;\"><i><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Zen\">Zen</a></b></i></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The conduct is named for a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty. Zen Buddhism emphasizes rigorous self-restraint, meditation, and a direct understanding of \"natures\", specifically the \"nature of mind\" and the \"nature of things\", and encourages the expression of these insights for the benefit of others in daily life:\n</p>\n<pre>The Dharma is the truth that all natures are pure. By this \ntruth, all appearances are empty... The buddha is your own \nmind... As long as mortals are attached to appearances, \nthey're unaware that their minds are empty.

This makes you permanently blind without requiring other sources of blindness.\n OPTIONS=blind\n\nNetHack does not actually use the term \"zen\" anywhere; it refers to the conduct as '''blind from birth'''.\n\nEven when you are permanently blind, you are able to read (or at least \"turn the pages of\") the [[Book of the Dead]], since otherwise it would not be possible to win the game, similar to how reading it does not break [[illiterate]] conduct.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe difficulty in zen lies in the fact that you cannot identify the appearance and [[beatitude]] of most objects, and they are only shown as their object class - all potions are only shown as \"a potion\", wands as \"a wand\", etc. The exception to this is your starting inventory, which you always start with knowledge of. You cannot read scrolls while blind unless you learn their labels, e.g. buying scrolls from shopkeepers will have them name the labels for you. You also cannot use [[altar]]s to find the [[BUC]] status of an object, because you cannot see if the objects glow and in what color. \n\n===Early game===\nExploration will be slow and tedious, especially in the early game. Moving blindly will anger a peaceful creature if you attempt to walk onto their square without seeing them, even when using the safe-move function {{kbd|m}}. A lawful or neutral zen player should be especially careful of committing accidental or intentional murder.\n\nPlayers are recommended to use the [[search]] command with almost every step at least. This will be the only way to get any sort of warning of an approaching monster, and it will speed up the \"mapping\" of the level as the search command will check each adjacent square for walls, items, or creatures, while just moving will only check the square you're about to step on. If you know (or reasonably suspect) there is a wall, then walk into it; walking into a wall tile will reveal it on the map without using up a turn.\n\nA player's primary goal will be to acquire a source of telepathy as soon as possible - the most commonplace and likely source of telepathy is a [[floating eye]], which will begin appearing when the average of the player's dungeon level and experience level is roughly 3.<!-- integer division cuts off any fractional parts--> Players seeking a floating eye should not proceed much farther beyond the dungeon floors most likely to generate one - a [[Wizard]] fortunate enough to start with the [[detect monsters]] spell will have a much easier time locating an eye, but the rest will be forced to rely (appropriately) on blind luck. \n\nPlayers can also obtain telepathy via prayer with at least 6 [[Luck]], a [[helm of telepathy]] or an [[amulet of ESP]], but getting enough Luck without a [[luckstone]] is challenging in the early game, and the other two items are not particularly common.\n\n===Pets===\nIt is advisable for a zen player to start without a pet, also set via the options file. A pet is extremely difficult to keep track of and distinguish from hostile monsters in the early game, and the player runs a serious risk of killing them accidentally. An alternative is to quickly ditch a starting pet on DL1 and proceeding into the dungeon, returning to re-tame the pet when telepathy is acquired. In either case, a zen player should eventually acquire a pet to identify the BUC status of items. \n\n===Object appearances===\nFor information on how you can see objects while blind, see [[Blindness#Discovering objects|the article section on object appearances]], which contains a full list of ways to make an object \"seen\" without breaking the conduct. Most notably, a blessed [[potion of object detection]], which can be dropped by a nymph, will identify all items in your inventory, containers and the map. If the farlook command {{kbd|;}} does not tell you the appearance of an object even though you should know it, the object is buried or carried by a monster, or has since been moved away.\n\nBe careful not to eat [[zombie]] corpses, and keep an eye out for critical messages in this regard when fighting monsters: you \"destroy\" zombies, but \"kill\" living enemies. Zombies also cannot be seen via telepathy.\n\n===Shopkeepers===\nShops are important for identifying the appearance of large numbers of items, especially scrolls and potions. A container to place the items in and a pet to steal the container back will speed up the process of re-acquiring items you've just sold to the shopkeeper for identification.\n\nThe [[pay]] command only works if you can see the [[shopkeeper]], either by [[telepathy]] or [[monster detection]], or if he is angry. Alternatively, you may drop enough gold to cover your purchase and then teleport, jump or phase out, even without [[teleport control]]. The practical result of this is that a player will typically have no way to get an item out of a shop until [[telepathy]] is acquired. Bumping into a shopkeeper will anger them, even when using the {{kbd|m}} command; since this will nearly always result in death, a zen player is best advised to simply avoid shops until they can properly use them.\n\nSelling items works as normal, which might be useful if you get burdened before acquiring telepathy.\n\n===Late game===\nPrioritize the genocide of [[green slime]]s before entering [[Gehennom]], because they cannot be seen while blind.\n\nWater or lava tiles cannot be identified while levitating, so be careful on water levels such as [[Medusa level]] and use magic mapping if possible.\n\nDo not step on a [[cockatrice]] corpse while not wearing gloves.\n\n'''Do NOT, under any circumstances, attempt to wear the [[Eyes of the Overworld]] in a zen game.''' Putting them on will produce the message ''\"For the first time in your life, you can see!\"'' and break the conduct. They are the only thing in the game that can do this. Because the Eyes only provide effects when worn, they aren't even worth carrying around.\n\n==Notable ascensions==\nOnly a handful of people are known to have ascended zen games, and most of them have been zen [[samurai]]. [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/1f508de3da1c4ed3/3f67dccf081db600?lnk=st this post to RGRN] announces the first known ascended zen [[tourist]]. [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/msg/83ba3b23689d60dc?hl=en Jo&atilde;o Santos] is the only person known to have completed zen ascensions in all four pre-3.6.0 roles able to do zen. A [[Unofficial_conduct#Nudist|nudist]] zen ranger [http://un.nethack.nu/user/boxo/dumps/boxo.1341391449.txt.html has been ascended] in [[UnNetHack]], which allows all roles to try zen.\n\nA complete Zen Samurai ascension can be watched [http://www.codehappy.net/nethacktheatre/zen.ttyrec.gz here] in [[ttyrec]] format.\n\nA video of a complete Zen [[Nudist]] Valkyrie ascension from 2019 [[TNNT]] can be watched [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLZEdecBa4A here].\n\n==History==\nIn [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and earlier versions, players have to set their own rules for the conduct (which was unofficial during the time that it was the latest version) and use several workarounds, such as wearing [[blindfold]]s or permanently polymorphing into blind monsters. Only [[Samurai]], [[Rogue]]s, Wizards, and [[Tourist]]s can start with a [[blindfold]] or [[towel]], which typically required a little [[start scumming]], and even then you would be momentarily non-blind for a short time at the beginning to blind yourself. Players also had to temporarily remove their source of blindness in order read the Book of the Dead as part of the [[invocation ritual]].\n\nThe term \"zen\" dates back to the era when this was a purely unofficial conduct. It remains more popular in the community than the conduct's official name of \"blind from birth.\"\n\n===NetHack 3.4.3 specific strategy===\nGenerally, a Samurai is considered the easiest role for 3.4.3 zen conduct due to their good starting armor and strong melee combat skills, which are important in the early parts of the game. A Wizard can start with several helpful items for the early game as well, such as a [[wand of fire]] or [[wand of lightning|lightning]] for partially reliable engraving of [[Elbereth]], or a [[ring of warning]]. The Rogue and Tourist are going to have a more difficult time, due to weaker melee skills and a lack of strong starting gear.\n\nA zen game is ''flawed'' if a nymph or monkey steals your blinding item and you immediately put on another one, without looking at your inventory. Should this happen, be careful not to use the [[#name]] or {{kbd|i}} commands, since these will reveal object appearances in your inventory.\n\n==Origin==\n{{wikipedia|Zen}}\nThe conduct is named for a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty. Zen Buddhism emphasizes rigorous self-restraint, meditation, and a direct understanding of \"natures\", specifically the \"nature of mind\" and the \"nature of things\", and encourages the expression of these insights for the benefit of others in daily life:\n\n The Dharma is the truth that all natures are pure. By this \n truth, all appearances are empty... The buddha is your own \n mind... As long as mortals are attached to appearances, \n they're unaware that their minds are empty. And by mistakenly \n clinging to the appearance of things they lose the Way.\n  -Bodhidharma\n\nZen conduct in ''NetHack'' focuses more on the \"detachment from appearances\" tenet of the above.\n\n==Variants==\n===UnNetHack===\n[[UnNetHack]] adds functionality that allows players to optionally select certain conducts at the start of the game, tracks them, and punishes players for breaking them. If the player selects zen conduct, they begin the game wearing a cursed blindfold: if it is ever removed and the conduct is broken, some monsters are summoned around the player character. To use the Book of the Dead, you can #[[invoke]] it.\n\n===NetHack 4===\n[[NetHack 4]] offers a \"permablind\" option that gives blindness as an [[intrinsic]], overriding any attempt to remove it. Like UnNetHack, #invoke also allows use of the Book of the Dead. The conduct cannot be broken by the Eyes of the Overworld, because they no longer grant astral vision.\n\n===TNNT (the game)===\n[[TNNT (the game)]] offers the \"blind\" option, and there is an achievement for receiving the quest with the Zen conduct intact.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{nethack-367}}\n[[Category:Conducts]]"}

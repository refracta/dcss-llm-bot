In the original patch they can be [humans](/wiki/Human_\\(starting_race\\) \"Human (starting race)\"), [dwarves](/wiki/Dwarf_\\(starting_race\\) \"Dwarf (starting race)\"), [gnomes](/wiki/Gnome_\\(starting_race\\) \"Gnome (starting race)\"), or [orcs](/wiki/Orc_\\(starting_race\\) \"Orc (starting race)\").

Additionally, convicts can pacify and tame other rats by [#chatting](/wiki/Chatting \"Chatting\") with them.\n\n## Intrinsics\n\nConvicts gain intrinsics at these [experience levels](/wiki/Experience_level \"Experience level\"):\n\n- XL 1: [Sickness resistance](/wiki/Sickness_resistance \"Sickness resistance\")\n- XL 7: [Poison resistance](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\")\n- XL 20: [Automatic searching](/wiki/Automatic_searching \"Automatic searching\")\n\n## Skills\n\nA user has suggested improving this page or section as follows:\n\n*\"What skills do Convicts start with (in each of the variants that include them)?\"*\n\nIn UnNethack, Convicts start with 0 skills at basic level. They will have a difficult time overcoming the required 100 hits to level any weapon to Basic skill, you will have to balance whether to get rid of the iron ball or to keep it as a weapon and advance the Flail skill.\n\n| Convict skills |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Max            | Skills                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Basic          | - *Weapons:* [mace](/wiki/Mace \"Mace\"), [short sword](/wiki/Short_sword \"Short sword\")\n- *Spells:* [attack](/wiki/Attack_spells \"Attack spells\")                                                                                                                 |\n| Skilled        | * *Weapons:* [dagger](/wiki/Dagger \"Dagger\"), [hammer](/wiki/Hammer \"Hammer\"), [dart](/wiki/Dart \"Dart\"), [sling](/wiki/Sling \"Sling\")\n* *Combat:* [bare hands](/wiki/Bare_hands \"Bare hands\"), [two weapon combat](/wiki/Two_weapon_combat \"Two weapon combat\") |\n| Expert         | - *Weapons:* [knife](/wiki/Knife \"Knife\"), [pick-axe](/wiki/Pick-axe \"Pick-axe\"), [club](/wiki/Club \"Club\"), [flail](/wiki/Flail \"Flail\")\n- *Spells:* [escape](/wiki/Escape_spells \"Escape spells\")                                                              |\n\nThe Convict's [special spell](/wiki/Special_spell \"Special spell\") is [teleport away](/wiki/Spellbook_of_teleport_away \"Spellbook of teleport away\"). Spell success is determined by [intelligence](/wiki/Intelligence \"Intelligence\").\n\nIn UnNetHack specifically, Convicts can also reach skilled in [broadsword](/wiki/Broadsword \"Broadsword\").\n\n## Special rules\n\nConvicts burn nutrition at half the normal rate while hungry or worse.\n\nConvicts have a chance of pacifying or taming rats by #chatting to them.\n\nRaces that would normally be friendly to the player based on race will be generated hostile if the player is a convict.\n\nFor convicts only, wielding the heavy iron ball uses the flail skill.\n\nIn dNethack only, convicts can use spoons to make sneak attacks like a rogue. Since spoons aren't randomly generated, this is usually only relevant to their starting spoon and their quest artifact.\n\n## Quest\n\nThe [convict quest](/wiki/Convict_quest \"Convict quest\") sees you fighting [Warden Arianna](/wiki/Warden_Arianna \"Warden Arianna\") for [the Iron Ball of Liberation](/wiki/The_Iron_Ball_of_Liberation \"The Iron Ball of Liberation\"), a heavy iron ball that grants magic resistance, stealth, searching and warning. When invoked, it allows [phasing](/wiki/Phasing \"Phasing\") for a limited time. The downsides are its weight (almost as heavy as a normal iron ball) and the fact that it [chains itself to the player](/wiki/Punishment \"Punishment\") every time its power is invoked.\n\n## Gods\n\n[![Wikipedia](/images/thumb/f/f8/Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png/50px-Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png)](/wiki/File:Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png \"Wikipedia\")\n\n[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page \"wikipedia:Main Page\") has an article about:\n\n***[List of Forgotten Realms deities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Forgotten_Realms_deities \"wikipedia:List of Forgotten Realms deities\")***\n\n- *Main article: [Religion](/wiki/Religion \"Religion\")*\n\n* Lawful: Ilmater\n* Neutral: Grumbar\n* Chaotic: Tymora\n\nThe Convict pantheon is made up of deities worshiped by [human](/wiki/Human_\\(starting_race\\) \"Human (starting race)\") inhabitants of Faerûn in the *Forgotten Realms* campaign setting of *[Dungeons & Dragons](/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons \"Dungeons & Dragons\")*.\n\n**Ilmater** is the god of martyrdom and perseverence. His followers seek to ease the suffering of others, even if it requires enduring suffering themselves. He is described as similar to the god [Issek](/wiki/Issek \"Issek\") in the *Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser* series by [Fritz Leiber](/wiki/Fritz_Leiber \"Fritz Leiber\").\n\n**Grumbar** is the Elemental Lord of Earth, known for constancy and changelessness, but also indifference. He is influenced by the god Grome in the *Elric* series by [Michael Moorcock](/wiki/Michael_Moorcock \"Michael Moorcock\").\n\n**Tymora** is the goddess of good fortune, invoked by risk-takers and adventurers. She is inspired by the Greek goddess [Tyche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyche \"wikipedia:Tyche\").\n\n## Rank titles\n\nThe [status line](/wiki/Status_line \"Status line\") shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\n\n- XL 1-2: Detainee\n- XL 3-5: Inmate\n- XL 6-9: Jail-bird\n- XL 10-13: Prisoner\n- XL 14-17: Outlaw\n- XL 18-21: Crook\n- XL 22-25: Desperado\n- XL 26-29: Felon\n- XL 30: Fugitive\n\n## Strategy\n\nConvicts start the game on the verge of becoming hungry, with no food in their inventory and no ability to [pray](/wiki/Pray \"Pray\") for food. Their ability to descend through the dungeon looking for food is also limited by the [iron ball](/wiki/Heavy_iron_ball \"Heavy iron ball\") chained to them, as they face death from falling down the stairs. It is advisable to always wield the ball before attempting to descend, as that will reduce the damage to 1-9 (average 5) instead of the 1-26 (average 11) you will take if the ball falls on you. You should wield the iron ball most of the time anyway, as it makes a superb weapon, doing d25 damage (average 13), which is higher than any non-artifact, even a [dwarvish mattock](/wiki/Dwarvish_mattock \"Dwarvish mattock\") – if you can hit with it. For a convict (and a convict only), fighting with the iron ball advances flail skill, which can eventually reach expert.\n\nThe [early game](/wiki/Early_game \"Early game\") is dominated by a desperate search for food. It is therefore critical to get the most out of any food they do find. Convicts burn nutrition at half the normal rate while hungry or worse, meaning that you should wait to eat food rations and the like until you are at least weak with hunger. Convicts are also [immune to sickness](/wiki/Immunity_to_sickness \"Immunity to sickness\") from level one, enabling them to eat [tainted](/wiki/Tainted \"Tainted\") corpses. In particular this allows them to eat corpses left by zombies and mummies, and to finish every last bite of their kills without worrying about how long the corpse has been lying there.\n\nRaces that are normally friendly to them (e.g. gnomes and dwarves to themselves and each other) are hostile to the Convict. This may influence the decision whether to do the [Gnomish Mines](/wiki/Gnomish_Mines \"Gnomish Mines\") or [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") first. The [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\") watch will also be hostile to Convicts, making the mines an even less appealing early destination. However, a short foray into the mines can yield good armor and numerous edible corpses.\n\nConvicts' difficulty in obtaining food and equipment is compounded by the fact that shopkeepers who see their [striped shirts](/wiki/Striped_shirt \"Striped shirt\") will not allow entry to their shops (even if later the shirt is removed or covered). An exception to this is the [Black market](/wiki/Black_market \"Black market\"), where convicts will receive a reduction in prices instead.\n\nOnce free of the iron ball, a convict will want a weapon that is less heavy. In some variants, a convict has a guaranteed first sacrifice gift called the [Luck Blade](/wiki/Luck_Blade \"Luck Blade\"), a chaotic short sword (broadsword in [UnNetHack](/wiki/UnNetHack \"UnNetHack\"), [DynaHack](/wiki/DynaHack \"DynaHack\"), and [EvilHack](/wiki/EvilHack \"EvilHack\")) which also acts as a [luckstone](/wiki/Luckstone \"Luckstone\"). Given that they will only be able to reach basic, however, this is likely to only be a viable weapon in the early game.\n\n### Vampiric Convicts\n\nVampires get the advantage of being able to fly, so you will never take damage when going downstairs with the iron ball (wielded or not). The sickness resistance is not very useful for food, but it may be useful late-game. Unless you get incredibly lucky, you will most likely not make it to turn 600 without fainting.\n\nThe monsters in the first few levels don't have much nutrition in their corpses, and since you only get 20% of the base nutrition it's even less. Getting lucky on the extra bite attack will give you a significant amount. Since this is unlikely, you may need to find a place to faint for 50-100 turns to make it to turn 600 in order to pray successfully. This goes a little contrary to the suggestions for vampires to constantly fight and for convicts to do whatever is necessary to find nutrition, but it may be necessary in some games.\n\nThe gnomish mines are a feast for vampire convicts. Once you have your first prayer, slaughtering a bunch of gnomes and dwarves is relatively easy. It's important to make the most out of your regeneration and not get overwhelmed, so make sure you play cautiously. This will level you up quickly and get you to poison resistance (convict specific). Once you have that, it opens up a new set of corpses that can be drained.\n\nMinetown is especially dicey for vampire convicts, since the watch captain usually has a silver saber (50% chance) and is always hostile towards you. Since you are powerful and your iron ball does a lot of damage, it is feasible to kill the watch, but make sure to have an escape plan. You regenerate health faster than they do, so a hit and run strategy works well. Avoiding the watch captain until the rest are dealt with might be a good idea.\n\nOnce you survive, vampires can be a great race. With intrinsic flying and regeneration, combined with the sickness immunity from a convict makes you a very strong late-game character. Your death effect immunity can even supplement MR in some cases. If you can get over the early-game hump, a vampire convict can be very rewarding.\n\n[![This article describes a 3.4.3-based variant of NetHack.

Their ability to descend through the dungeon looking for food is also limited by the <a href=\"/wiki/Heavy_iron_ball\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Heavy iron ball\">iron ball</a> chained to them, as they face death from falling down the stairs. It is advisable to always wield the ball before attempting to descend, as that will reduce the damage to 1-9 (average 5) instead of the 1-26 (average 11) you will take if the ball falls on you. You should wield the iron ball most of the time anyway, as it makes a superb weapon, doing d25 damage (average 13), which is higher than any non-artifact, even a <a href=\"/wiki/Dwarvish_mattock\" title=\"Dwarvish mattock\">dwarvish mattock</a> – if you can hit with it. For a convict (and a convict only), fighting with the iron ball advances flail skill, which can eventually reach expert.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Early_game\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Early game\">early game</a> is dominated by a desperate search for food. It is therefore critical to get the most out of any food they do find. Convicts burn nutrition at half the normal rate while hungry or worse, meaning that you should wait to eat food rations and the like until you are at least weak with hunger. Convicts are also <a href=\"/wiki/Immunity_to_sickness\" title=\"Immunity to sickness\">immune to sickness</a> from level one, enabling them to eat <a href=\"/wiki/Tainted\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tainted\">tainted</a> corpses. In particular this allows them to eat corpses left by zombies and mummies, and to finish every last bite of their kills without worrying about how long the corpse has been lying there.\n</p><p>Races that are normally friendly to them (e.g. gnomes and dwarves to themselves and each other) are hostile to the Convict. This may influence the decision whether to do the <a href=\"/wiki/Gnomish_Mines\" title=\"Gnomish Mines\">Gnomish Mines</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Sokoban\" title=\"Sokoban\">Sokoban</a> first. The <a href=\"/wiki/Minetown\" title=\"Minetown\">Minetown</a> watch will also be hostile to Convicts, making the mines an even less appealing early destination. However, a short foray into the mines can yield good armor and numerous edible corpses.\n</p><p>Convicts' difficulty in obtaining food and equipment is compounded by the fact that shopkeepers who see their <a href=\"/wiki/Striped_shirt\" title=\"Striped shirt\">striped shirts</a> will not allow entry to their shops (even if later the shirt is removed or covered). An exception to this is the <a href=\"/wiki/Black_market\" title=\"Black market\">Black market</a>, where convicts will receive a reduction in prices instead.\n</p><p>Once free of the iron ball, a convict will want a weapon that is less heavy. In some variants, a convict has a guaranteed first sacrifice gift called the <a href=\"/wiki/Luck_Blade\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Luck Blade\">Luck Blade</a>, a chaotic short sword (broadsword in <a href=\"/wiki/UnNetHack\" title=\"UnNetHack\">UnNetHack</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/DynaHack\" title=\"DynaHack\">DynaHack</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/EvilHack\" title=\"EvilHack\">EvilHack</a>) which also acts as a <a href=\"/wiki/Luckstone\" title=\"Luckstone\">luckstone</a>. Given that they will only be able to reach basic, however, this is likely to only be a viable weapon in the early game.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Vampiric_Convicts\">Vampiric Convicts</span></h3>\n<p>Vampires get the advantage of being able to fly, so you will never take damage when going downstairs with the iron ball (wielded or not). The sickness resistance is not very useful for food, but it may be useful late-game. Unless you get incredibly lucky, you will most likely not make it to turn 600 without fainting. \n</p><p>The monsters in the first few levels don't have much nutrition in their corpses, and since you only get 20% of the base nutrition it's even less. Getting lucky on the extra bite attack will give you a significant amount. Since this is unlikely, you may need to find a place to faint for 50-100 turns to make it to turn 600 in order to pray successfully. This goes a little contrary to the suggestions for vampires to constantly fight and for convicts to do whatever is necessary to find nutrition, but it may be necessary in some games.\n</p><p>The gnomish mines are a feast for vampire convicts. Once you have your first prayer, slaughtering a bunch of gnomes and dwarves is relatively easy. It's important to make the most out of your regeneration and not get overwhelmed, so make sure you play cautiously. This will level you up quickly and get you to poison resistance (convict specific). Once you have that, it opens up a new set of corpses that can be drained.\n</p><p>Minetown is especially dicey for vampire convicts, since the watch captain usually has a silver saber (50% chance) and is always hostile towards you. Since you are powerful and your iron ball does a lot of damage, it is feasible to kill the watch, but make sure to have an escape plan. You regenerate health faster than they do, so a hit and run strategy works well.  Avoiding the watch captain until the rest are dealt with might be a good idea.\n</p><p>Once you survive, vampires can be a great race. With intrinsic flying and regeneration, combined with the sickness immunity from a convict makes you a very strong late-game character. Your death effect immunity can even supplement MR in some cases. If you can get over the early-game hump, a vampire convict can be very rewarding.\n</p>\n<div style=\"display:none; right:10px; padding-bottom: 17px\" class=\"metadata topicon nopopups\"><div style=\"margin-top: -10px\"><a href=\"/wiki/NetHackWiki:Next_version\" title=\"This article describes a 3.4.3-based variant of NetHack.

|name=Convict Role\n |author=Karl Garrison\n |download=http://nethack.edeca.net/karl/nethack-convict-0.7.diff\n |bilious=421\n}}\n{{Wikipedia|Convict}}\nThe '''Convict''' is a role added in the Convict Role patch, which is incorporated into [[UnNetHack]], [[dNetHack]], [[DynaHack]], [[SpliceHack]], [[EvilHack]], and [[SlashTHEM]]. It is designed to be more difficult than [[Tourist]], the most [[Role difficulty|statistically]] difficult class in ''[[NetHack]]'' - a goal at which it succeeds handily.\n\nConvicts always start out as [[chaotic]], owing to their criminal past. In the original patch they can be [[Human (starting race)|human]]s, [[Dwarf (starting race)|dwarves]], [[Gnome (starting race)|gnomes]], or [[Orc (starting race)|orcs]]. [[UnNetHack]] adds [[Vampire (starting race in UnNetHack)|Vampires]] as a starting race; [[dNetHack]] adds [[Elf (starting race)|elves]], [[Vampire (starting race in dNetHack)|vampires]], [[Half-dragon (starting race)|half-dragons]], [[incantifier]]s, [[chiropteran]]s, and [[Yuki-onna (starting race)|yuki-onna]] as possible Convict races. EvilHack adds [[Hobbit (starting race)|hobbits]], [[Illithid (starting race)|illithids]] and [[Drow (starting race)|drow]] as compatible races for the Convict.\n\n==Starting inventory==\n*a [[cursed]] [[striped shirt]]\n*some [[rock]]s\n*a +0 [[spoon]], which the convict can use to make sneak attacks (in dNethack)\n\nA Convict also starts [[Punishment|chained to an iron ball]] and with a [[sewer rat]] named Nicodemus (reference to ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Frisby_and_the_Rats_of_NIMH Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH]'') as a pet, which can grow up to be [[Rodent of unusual size|unusually large]]. Additionally, convicts can pacify and tame other rats by [[Chatting|#chatting]] with them.\n\n==Intrinsics==\nConvicts gain intrinsics at these [[experience level]]s:\n\n*XL 1: [[Sickness resistance]]\n*XL 7: [[Poison resistance]]\n*XL 20: [[Automatic searching]]\n\n==Skills==\n\n{{todo|What skills do Convicts start with (in each of the variants that include them)?}}\n\nIn UnNethack, Convicts start with 0 skills at basic level. They will have a difficult time overcoming the required 100 hits to level any weapon to Basic skill, you will have to balance whether to get rid of the iron ball or to keep it as a weapon and advance the Flail skill.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:larger\" | Convict skills\n|-\n! Max !! Skills\n|-\n| Basic\n|\n* ''Weapons:'' [[mace]], [[short sword]]\n* ''Spells:'' [[attack spells|attack]]\n|-\n| Skilled\n|\n* ''Weapons:'' [[dagger]], [[hammer]], [[dart]], [[sling]]\n* ''Combat:'' [[bare hands]], [[two weapon combat]]\n|-\n| Expert\n|\n* ''Weapons:'' [[knife]], [[pick-axe]], [[club]], [[flail]]\n* ''Spells:'' [[escape spells|escape]]\n|}\n\nThe Convict's [[special spell]] is [[spellbook of teleport away|teleport away]]. Spell success is determined by [[intelligence]].\n\nIn UnNetHack specifically, Convicts can also reach skilled in [[broadsword]].\n\n==Special rules==\nConvicts burn nutrition at half the normal rate while hungry or worse.\n\nConvicts have a chance of pacifying or taming rats by #chatting to them.\n\nRaces that would normally be friendly to the player based on race will be generated hostile if the player is a convict.\n\nFor convicts only, wielding the heavy iron ball uses the flail skill.\n\nIn dNethack only, convicts can use spoons to make sneak attacks like a rogue. Since spoons aren't randomly generated, this is usually only relevant to their starting spoon and their quest artifact.\n\n==Quest==\nThe [[convict quest]] sees you fighting [[Warden Arianna]] for [[the Iron Ball of Liberation]], a heavy iron ball that grants magic resistance, stealth, searching and warning. When invoked, it allows [[phasing]] for a limited time. The downsides are its weight (almost as heavy as a normal iron ball) and the fact that it [[punishment|chains itself to the player]] every time its power is invoked.\n\n==Gods==\n{{wikipedia|List of Forgotten Realms deities}}\n{{main|Religion}}\n* Lawful: Ilmater\n* Neutral: Grumbar\n* Chaotic: Tymora\n\nThe Convict pantheon is made up of deities worshiped by [[Human (starting race)|human]] inhabitants of Faerûn in the ''Forgotten Realms'' campaign setting of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.\n\n'''Ilmater''' is the god of martyrdom and perseverence.  His followers seek to ease the suffering of others, even if it requires enduring suffering themselves.  He is described as similar to the god [[Issek]] in the ''Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser'' series by [[Fritz Leiber]].\n\n'''Grumbar''' is the Elemental Lord of Earth, known for constancy and changelessness, but also indifference.  He is influenced by the god Grome in the ''Elric'' series by [[Michael Moorcock]].\n\n'''Tymora''' is the goddess of good fortune, invoked by risk-takers and adventurers. She is inspired by the Greek goddess [[wikipedia:Tyche|Tyche]].\n\n==Rank titles==\nThe [[status line]] shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\n\n*XL 1-2: Detainee\n*XL 3-5: Inmate\n*XL 6-9: Jail-bird\n*XL 10-13: Prisoner\n*XL 14-17: Outlaw\n*XL 18-21: Crook\n*XL 22-25: Desperado\n*XL 26-29: Felon\n*XL 30: Fugitive\n\n==Strategy==\nConvicts start the game on the verge of becoming hungry, with no food in their inventory and no ability to [[pray]] for food. Their ability to descend through the dungeon looking for food is also limited by the [[heavy iron ball|iron ball]] chained to them, as they face death from falling down the stairs. It is advisable to always wield the ball before attempting to descend, as that will reduce the damage to 1-9 (average 5) instead of the 1-26 (average 11) you will take if the ball falls on you. You should wield the iron ball most of the time anyway, as it makes a superb weapon, doing d25 damage (average 13), which is higher than any non-artifact, even a [[dwarvish mattock]] – if you can hit with it. For a convict (and a convict only), fighting with the iron ball advances flail skill, which can eventually reach expert.\n\nThe [[early game]] is dominated by a desperate search for food. It is therefore critical to get the most out of any food they do find. Convicts burn nutrition at half the normal rate while hungry or worse, meaning that you should wait to eat food rations and the like until you are at least weak with hunger. Convicts are also [[Immunity to sickness|immune to sickness]] from level one, enabling them to eat [[tainted]] corpses. In particular this allows them to eat corpses left by zombies and mummies, and to finish every last bite of their kills without worrying about how long the corpse has been lying there.\n\nRaces that are normally friendly to them (e.g. gnomes and dwarves to themselves and each other) are hostile to the Convict. This may influence the decision whether to do the [[Gnomish Mines]] or [[Sokoban]] first. The [[Minetown]] watch will also be hostile to Convicts, making the mines an even less appealing early destination. However, a short foray into the mines can yield good armor and numerous edible corpses.\n\nConvicts' difficulty in obtaining food and equipment is compounded by the fact that shopkeepers who see their [[striped shirt]]s will not allow entry to their shops (even if later the shirt is removed or covered). An exception to this is the [[Black market]], where convicts will receive a reduction in prices instead.\n\nOnce free of the iron ball, a convict will want a weapon that is less heavy. In some variants, a convict has a guaranteed first sacrifice gift called the [[Luck Blade]], a chaotic short sword (broadsword in [[UnNetHack]], [[DynaHack]], and [[EvilHack]]) which also acts as a [[luckstone]]. Given that they will only be able to reach basic, however, this is likely to only be a viable weapon in the early game.\n\n===Vampiric Convicts===\nVampires get the advantage of being able to fly, so you will never take damage when going downstairs with the iron ball (wielded or not). The sickness resistance is not very useful for food, but it may be useful late-game. Unless you get incredibly lucky, you will most likely not make it to turn 600 without fainting. \n\nThe monsters in the first few levels don't have much nutrition in their corpses, and since you only get 20% of the base nutrition it's even less. Getting lucky on the extra bite attack will give you a significant amount. Since this is unlikely, you may need to find a place to faint for 50-100 turns to make it to turn 600 in order to pray successfully. This goes a little contrary to the suggestions for vampires to constantly fight and for convicts to do whatever is necessary to find nutrition, but it may be necessary in some games.\n\nThe gnomish mines are a feast for vampire convicts. Once you have your first prayer, slaughtering a bunch of gnomes and dwarves is relatively easy. It's important to make the most out of your regeneration and not get overwhelmed, so make sure you play cautiously. This will level you up quickly and get you to poison resistance (convict specific). Once you have that, it opens up a new set of corpses that can be drained.\n\nMinetown is especially dicey for vampire convicts, since the watch captain usually has a silver saber (50% chance) and is always hostile towards you. Since you are powerful and your iron ball does a lot of damage, it is feasible to kill the watch, but make sure to have an escape plan. You regenerate health faster than they do, so a hit and run strategy works well.  Avoiding the watch captain until the rest are dealt with might be a good idea.\n\nOnce you survive, vampires can be a great race. With intrinsic flying and regeneration, combined with the sickness immunity from a convict makes you a very strong late-game character. Your death effect immunity can even supplement MR in some cases. If you can get over the early-game hump, a vampire convict can be very rewarding.\n{{variant-343}}\n[[Category:Patches]]\n[[Category:Convict patch]]\n[[Category:UnNetHack roles]]\n[[Category:dNetHack roles]]\n[[Category:DynaHack roles]]\n[[Category:notdNetHack roles]]\n[[Category:EvilHack roles]]\n[[Category:SlashTHEM roles]]\n[[Category:Hack'EM roles]]\n[[Category:notnotdNetHack roles]]"}

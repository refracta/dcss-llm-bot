WGT specifies the\nweight (100 zorkmids weighs 1).\n\nGems comprise 8% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,\n18% in containers, 0% on the Rogue level, and 10% in hell.  PROB\nis the relative probability of each subtype, except for those marked\nwith an asterisk (valuable gems); the figures so marked instead\nrepresent the first level on which the gems can occur (this limitation\nonly applying to the main dungeon, and these restrictions are only\nreviewed when creating a new level).  Permissible valuable gems have\nroughly equal probabilities of being generated among themselves, always\nset such that the total for the category as a whole is 171.\n\nLoadstones are always generated cursed (except potentially in containers),\nall others are uncursed.  Rocks appear in piles of 6 to 11.  Valuable gems,\nworthless gems, touchstones, and flint stones have a 1/6 chance of appearing\nin a pile of 2.\n\nThe ENGR field denotes how the gem appears when you attempt to engrave\nwith it (see below).  COLORS specifies the possible appearance of the\ngem.  If more than one color is possible, then one will be randomly\nchosen for the appearance.\n\n\nIdentifying stones\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThere are five different types of non-gem stones, and four of them\nare indistinguishably gray.\n\nrock\n  Rocks are immediately identified on examination, and pose little\n  difficulty or challenge to the adventurer. They make a cheap and usually\n  plentiful source of ammunition, should you lack or wish to conserve other\n  ranged attacks. (\"Good ol' rock. Nothing beats that.\" -- Bart Simpson)\n\ntouchstone\n  Touchstones are most readily distinguished by their effect when rubbed\n  with something hard, such as an iron weapon; they will make a \"scritch,\n  scritch\" sound. Their primary use is rubbing them with other gems and\n  stones (and, once identified, this is all they _can_ be used for); if\n  blessed (or also if uncursed, for Archeologists and gnomes), the object\n  rubbed with will be identified. The complete table of results that\n  distinguish them is as follows:\n\n  GRAY STONE        GEM       GLASS     HARD     RING\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~  ~~~~\n  good touchstone   ID        ID        scritch  streak\n  bad touchstone    streak    scratch   scritch  streak\n  other gray stone  cscratch  cscratch  scratch  cscratch\n\n  where \"streak\" denotes coloured streaks, \"scratch\" uncoloured scratch\n  marks, \"cscratch\" coloured scratch marks, and \"scritch\" the sound\n  \"scritch scritch\".\n\n  Other types of object may produce coloured streaks or scratches, but\n  will not provide any further useful information.\n\n  Note that being rubbed on a cursed touchstone may shatter gems or rocks\n  (but not other gray stones).\n\n\nluckstone\n  Luckstones can be identified by their effect (see \"Luck\" below) with the\n  help of enlightenment, by their valuation by shopkeepers, or by the\n  presence of the guaranteed luckstone at the top of a gems cache in the\n  Gnome King's Wine Cellar version of the bottom level of the Gnomish Mines.\n  (Or, indeed, by the Heart of Ahriman being one).\n\nloadstone\n  As noted above, loadstones are almost always generated cursed; furthermore,\n  they autocurse on being dropped or otherwise leaving the main inventory,\n  and a cursed loadstone cannot be let go of. It is therefore best to\n  identify them while they lie on the ground; kicking them will usually\n  elicit a \"Thump!\" rather than movement across the floor, but being\n  extremely strong (at least 22 strength; 18/** is not sufficient) while\n  wearing kicking boots or being a Samurai or Monk may allow some movement\n  (watch how far it goes).\n  \nflint stone\n  These exist primarily to make it hard to identify touchstones, loadstones\n  and luckstones, and are best identified by elimination of the other three.\n  They have few special properties, but do inflict somewhat more damage than\n  other stones or gems when used as sling ammunition.\n\n\nIdentifying gems\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Quoted in part from the spoiler \"gems\" by Bryan Butler.)\n\n    \"I shall, with cultured taste,\n     Distinguish gems from paste...\"\n         -- Reginald Bunthorne, in Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Patience\"\n\nThere are now nine methods to identify gems: engraving, throwing at\nunicorns, killing glass golems, spell of stone to flesh, collecting a\nlarge number, scrolls or spells of identify, a touchstone, dipping\nan amethyst in potions of booze, and finding pre-placed gems.\n\n1.  Engraving with gems\n\nIf a gem is listed as \"hard\" above, then you will see the following\nmessage when you attempt to (E)ngrave with the gem:\n    \"You engrave in the <floor> with the <gem>.\"\nwhere <gem> is the appearance of the gem.  All hard gems are valuable,\nalthough some colors may have more than one possible identity.\n\nIf the gem is \"soft,\" you will see this message:\n    \"You write in the dust with the <gem>.\"\nSoft gems may be valuable or worthless, so you will need an additional\nmethod to identify these gems.\n\nIn either case, you can abort the engraving process by pressing Escape.\nIf you choose to write a message, it will take one turn per character\nto engrave.  Not all types of floor can be engraved upon.  You may choose\nto #name a gem once you know its hardness (e.g., \"soft blue\").\n\n2.  Throwing gems at unicorns\n\nThrowing a gem to a non-tame unicorn can change your luck in one of several\nways, depending on whether the gem is worthless or valuable, whether you\nare the same alignment as the unicorn (white = lawful, gray = neutral,\nand black = chaotic), and whether the gem type is already identified or\nnamed.\n\n  VALUE  ALIGN  KNOWN       ADVERB        LUCK CHANGE\n  ~~~~~  ~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~\n  glass  other  unknown     graciously         0\n  glass  other  named       (see below*)       0\n  glass  other  identified  (see below*)       0\n  glass  same   unknown     graciously         0\n  glass  same   named       (see below*)       0\n  glass  same   identified  (see below*)       0\n   gem   other  unknown     hesitatingly   -1 to +1\n   gem   other  named       hesitatingly   -1 to +1\n   gem   other  identified  hesitatingly   -3 to +3\n   gem   same   unknown     gratefully        +1\n   gem   same   named       gratefully        +2\n   gem   same   identified  gratefully        +5\n\nIn most cases, the message sequence is as follows:\n    \"The <unicorn> neighs!  The <unicorn> catches the <gem>.\"\n    \"The <unicorn> <ADVERB> accepts your gift.\"\nwhere the color of the unicorn and the color of the gem are appropriate\nfor the situation. <ADVERB> comes from the table above, except where\nthe column has a *, in which case there is a different message sequence:\n    \"The <unicorn> neighs!\"\n    \"The <unicorn> catches the <glass>.\"\n    \"The <unicorn> is not interested in your junk.\"\nafter which the unicorn will promptly drop the \"gem\".\n\n3. Killing glass golems\n\nWhen a glass golem is destroyed, it leaves behind 2 to 8 worthless\npieces of glass (each of which can be any of the colours), and\nnever gems.\n\n4. Spell of stone to flesh\n\nThe spell of stone to flesh will turn gemstones into meatballs, but\nleave worthless pieces of glass intact; #name a gem 'valuable' or\nsimilar before zapping the spell at it (and rename it afterwards should\nit be proven untrue), since it won't be around to #name after.\n\n5.  Collecting a large number of gems\n\nIf you wait long enough, you'll accumulate a large number of gems.\nSince the probabilities of getting worthless pieces of glass are so\nmuch higher than getting true gems, you'll acquire them much faster\nthan other gems. So, if you just wait long enough, and look at all of\nthe gems of a certain color that you have, more often than not the gem\nof which you have the most is the worthless piece of glass. This is a\nbit risky, and usually takes much more time than other methods.\n\n6. Scrolls and spells of identify\n\nYou can always use a scroll or spell of identify to determine whether a\ngem is valuable.  You will then recognize all gems of that same type,\nalthough you can lose this knowledge from a scroll of amnesia or (master)\nmind flayer attack. Shopkeepers will buy identified gems\nbased on their full price; this is a good way to get money.\n\n7.  Rubbing on a touchstone\n\nBeing rubbed on a blessed touchstone (or also uncursed for Archeologists,\nwho start with one, and gnomes) will immediately identify any gem, as\ndetailed under \"touchstones\" above.\n\n8.  Dipping amethysts into potions of booze\n\nWhen you dip an amethyst into a potion(s) of booze, the potion will turn\ninto fruit juice (\"a-methyst\" means not intoxicated).  You can use this\nvery special case to identify this type of soft violet gems.\n\n9.  Pre-placed gems\n\nCertain levels are guaranteed to be generated with diamonds, rubies,\nemeralds, and amethysts in well-defined positions.  Two versions of\nthe bottom level of the Gnomish Mines (the Wine Cellar version and the\nMimic of the Mines version) contain concealed chambers with these four\ntypes of gems and a guaranteed luckstone, together with assorted other\n* to confuse identification; the third version's are randomly\nscattered across the level.  The four corner rooms of Fort Ludios (if\nit is reachable in your game) each contain one of these four types of\nvaluable gems.  Other levels may also be generated with piles of gems,\nbut their type is not guaranteed, so these levels are not helpful in\ndetermining the identity of gems.\n\n\nLuck\n~~~~\nLuck is included here because of luckstones.\n\nYour luck affects many aspects of the game (too many to mention here),\nand is actually the sum of two components.  Base luck changes with events\nin the game, and may slowly return to a \"baseline\" level.  Bonus luck, on\nthe other hand, is determined by what kind of luckstone (and certain\nartifacts) you are carrying.  Only a rough idea of your luck is given\nin the enlightenment list; the meaning of the messages is as follows:\n  TOTAL LUCK  MESSAGE\n  ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    <= -10    extremely unlucky\n   -9 to -5   very unlucky\n   -4 to -1   unlucky\n       0      luck is zero (debug mode only)\n    1 to 4    lucky\n    5 to 9    very lucky\n    >= 10     extremely lucky\n\nYour bonus luck -- and whether your base luck will return to its baseline\nlevel -- is controlled by luckstones and certain Quest Artifacts.  The\neffect of these \"luckitems\" depends on the number in your main inventory\nthat are blessed, uncursed, and cursed (see table below).  Note that you\ncan't do any better than one blessed luckitem, so you might as well keep\nany others in a bag (where they have no effect) as spares in case your\nmain one is cursed.\n  NUMBER OF LUCKITEMS          BAD LUCK    GOOD LUCK   BONUS LUCK\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~\n  None                         Times out   Times out   0 (no message)\n  More cursed than blessed     No timeout  Times out\n  Equal cursed and blessed     No timeout  No timeout\n  More blessed than cursed     Times out   No timeout\n  More cursed than non-cursed                          -3 \"reduced luck\"\n  Equal cursed and non-cursed                          +3 \"extra luck\"\n  More non-cursed than cursed                          +3 \"extra luck\"\nWhen you are enlightened about your luck, you are also told if you have\nbonus luck and if good/bad luck will not time out.\n\nBase luck is adjusted by each of the events described below.  It cannot\nbe reduced below -10 or increased above +10 beyond the baseline.  In\naddition, every 600 turns (or 300 if you have the Amulet of Yendor or have\nangered your god), your luck will increase by one if it is less than your\nbaseline luck and bad luck times out, and your luck will decrease by one if\nyour luck is greater than your baseline luck and good luck times out.  Your\nbaseline luck is +1 if you started or restored the game during a full moon,\n-1 if started/restored on Friday the 13th, and 0 if neither or both.\n  BASE ADJ  EVENT\n  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~\n     +1     Starting or restoring a game during a full moon.\n      0     Starting or restoring a game during a new moon.\n     -1     Starting or restoring a game on Friday the 13th.\n            NOTE: The above three are reversed before saving.\n     -2     Break a mirror.\n     -n     Breaking n eggs laid by you (at worst -5).\n     +1     Sitting on a throne (sometimes).\n      0     Throwing a worthless gem at a unicorn.\n  -3 to +3  Throwing valuable gem at cross-aligned unicorn.\n     +1     Throwing unknown valuable gem at co-aligned unicorn.\n     +2     Throwing named valuable gem at co-aligned unicorn.\n     +5     Throwing identified valuable gem at co-aligned unicorn.\n     -1     Hitting a blind floating eye (1 in 500 chance).\n     -1     Jumping in Sokoban.\n     -1     Breaking a boulder in Sokoban.\n     -1     Casting stone-to-flesh on a Sokoban boulder.\n     -1     Polymorphing a Sokoban boulder.\n     -1     Reading a scroll of earth in Sokoban.\n     -1     Being pulled by a thrown iron ball in Sokoban.\n     -1     Hurtling through the air in Sokoban due to Newton's 3rd Law.\n     -1     Walking (as a giant) or squeezing past a Sokoban boulder.\n     -1     Killing a tame or peaceful (sometimes) monster.\n     -2     Killing a peaceful human, and you are not chaotic.\n     -5     Killing a co-aligned unicorn.\n  -5 to -2  Cannibalism (eating your own species), unless an orc.\n  Set to 0  Praying with negative base luck (sometimes: \"golden glow\" boon).\n     -3     Praying on wrong altar.\n     -3     Praying before your prayer timeout has expired.\n     -5     A sacrifice (not your own race) on Moloch's altars in Gehennom.\n     -3     Being converted by trying to convert an altar.\n     -1     Otherwise unsuccessful at converting altar.\n     +1     Successfully converting an altar.\n     -1     Desecrating another god's altar.\n     +2     Sacrificing your own race on your own chaotic altar.\n     -2     Sacrificing your own race on Moloch's altar.\n     -5     Sacrificing your own race, you aren't chaotic.\n     -1     Sacrificing an unidentified fake Amulet of Yendor.\n     -3     Sacrificing an identified fake Amulet of Yendor.\n     +1     Sacrificing, slightly mollifying your god, negative luck.\n  Set to 0  Sacrificing, mollifying your god, negative luck.\n     +1     Sacrificing, having a hopeful feeling, negative luck.\n  Set to 0  Sacrificing, reconciling, negative luck.\n   0 to +5  Sacrificing, god happy.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks to Bruce Cox for proofreading the original version of this file.\nFurther corrections and clarifications provided by David Damerell,\nMichael Deutschmann, Rob Ellwood, Yair Friedman, David Grabiner, Adam Kao,\nNick Number, and Donald Welsh.\n```\n\n*This page is based on a spoiler by [Dylan O'Donnell](https://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.spod-central.org/%257Epsmith/).

WGT specifies the\nweight (100 zorkmids weighs 1).\n\nGems comprise 8% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,\n18% in containers, 0% on the Rogue level, and 10% in hell.  PROB\nis the relative probability of each subtype, except for those marked\nwith an asterisk (valuable gems); the figures so marked instead\nrepresent the first level on which the gems can occur (this limitation\nonly applying to the main dungeon, and these restrictions are only\nreviewed when creating a new level).  Permissible valuable gems have\nroughly equal probabilities of being generated among themselves, always\nset such that the total for the category as a whole is 171.\n\nLoadstones are always generated cursed (except potentially in containers),\nall others are uncursed.  Rocks appear in piles of 6 to 11.  Valuable gems,\nworthless gems, touchstones, and flint stones have a 1/6 chance of appearing\nin a pile of 2.\n\nThe ENGR field denotes how the gem appears when you attempt to engrave\nwith it (see below).  COLORS specifies the possible appearance of the\ngem.  If more than one color is possible, then one will be randomly\nchosen for the appearance.\n\n\nIdentifying stones\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThere are five different types of non-gem stones, and four of them\nare indistinguishably gray.\n\nrock\n  Rocks are immediately identified on examination, and pose little\n  difficulty or challenge to the adventurer. They make a cheap and usually\n  plentiful source of ammunition, should you lack or wish to conserve other\n  ranged attacks. (\"Good ol' rock. Nothing beats that.\" -- Bart Simpson)\n\ntouchstone\n  Touchstones are most readily distinguished by their effect when rubbed\n  with something hard, such as an iron weapon; they will make a \"scritch,\n  scritch\" sound. Their primary use is rubbing them with other gems and\n  stones (and, once identified, this is all they _can_ be used for); if\n  blessed (or also if uncursed, for Archeologists and gnomes), the object\n  rubbed with will be identified. The complete table of results that\n  distinguish them is as follows:\n\n  GRAY STONE        GEM       GLASS     HARD     RING\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~  ~~~~\n  good touchstone   ID        ID        scritch  streak\n  bad touchstone    streak    scratch   scritch  streak\n  other gray stone  cscratch  cscratch  scratch  cscratch\n\n  where \"streak\" denotes coloured streaks, \"scratch\" uncoloured scratch\n  marks, \"cscratch\" coloured scratch marks, and \"scritch\" the sound\n  \"scritch scritch\".\n\n  Other types of object may produce coloured streaks or scratches, but\n  will not provide any further useful information.\n\n  Note that being rubbed on a cursed touchstone may shatter gems or rocks\n  (but not other gray stones).\n\n\nluckstone\n  Luckstones can be identified by their effect (see \"Luck\" below) with the\n  help of enlightenment, by their valuation by shopkeepers, or by the\n  presence of the guaranteed luckstone at the top of a gems cache in the\n  Gnome King's Wine Cellar version of the bottom level of the Gnomish Mines.\n  (Or, indeed, by the Heart of Ahriman being one).\n\nloadstone\n  As noted above, loadstones are almost always generated cursed; furthermore,\n  they autocurse on being dropped or otherwise leaving the main inventory,\n  and a cursed loadstone cannot be let go of. It is therefore best to\n  identify them while they lie on the ground; kicking them will usually\n  elicit a \"Thump!\" rather than movement across the floor, but being\n  extremely strong (at least 22 strength; 18/** is not sufficient) while\n  wearing kicking boots or being a Samurai or Monk may allow some movement\n  (watch how far it goes).\n  \nflint stone\n  These exist primarily to make it hard to identify touchstones, loadstones\n  and luckstones, and are best identified by elimination of the other three.\n  They have few special properties, but do inflict somewhat more damage than\n  other stones or gems when used as sling ammunition.\n\n\nIdentifying gems\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Quoted in part from the spoiler \"gems\" by Bryan Butler.)\n\n    \"I shall, with cultured taste,\n     Distinguish gems from paste...\"\n         -- Reginald Bunthorne, in Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Patience\"\n\nThere are now nine methods to identify gems: engraving, throwing at\nunicorns, killing glass golems, spell of stone to flesh, collecting a\nlarge number, scrolls or spells of identify, a touchstone, dipping\nan amethyst in potions of booze, and finding pre-placed gems.\n\n1.  Engraving with gems\n\nIf a gem is listed as \"hard\" above, then you will see the following\nmessage when you attempt to (E)ngrave with the gem:\n    \"You engrave in the &lt;floor&gt; with the &lt;gem&gt;.\"\nwhere &lt;gem&gt; is the appearance of the gem.  All hard gems are valuable,\nalthough some colors may have more than one possible identity.\n\nIf the gem is \"soft,\" you will see this message:\n    \"You write in the dust with the &lt;gem&gt;.\"\nSoft gems may be valuable or worthless, so you will need an additional\nmethod to identify these gems.\n\nIn either case, you can abort the engraving process by pressing Escape.\nIf you choose to write a message, it will take one turn per character\nto engrave.  Not all types of floor can be engraved upon.  You may choose\nto #name a gem once you know its hardness (e.g., \"soft blue\").\n\n2.  Throwing gems at unicorns\n\nThrowing a gem to a non-tame unicorn can change your luck in one of several\nways, depending on whether the gem is worthless or valuable, whether you\nare the same alignment as the unicorn (white = lawful, gray = neutral,\nand black = chaotic), and whether the gem type is already identified or\nnamed.\n\n  VALUE  ALIGN  KNOWN       ADVERB        LUCK CHANGE\n  ~~~~~  ~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~\n  glass  other  unknown     graciously         0\n  glass  other  named       (see below*)       0\n  glass  other  identified  (see below*)       0\n  glass  same   unknown     graciously         0\n  glass  same   named       (see below*)       0\n  glass  same   identified  (see below*)       0\n   gem   other  unknown     hesitatingly   -1 to +1\n   gem   other  named       hesitatingly   -1 to +1\n   gem   other  identified  hesitatingly   -3 to +3\n   gem   same   unknown     gratefully        +1\n   gem   same   named       gratefully        +2\n   gem   same   identified  gratefully        +5\n\nIn most cases, the message sequence is as follows:\n    \"The &lt;unicorn&gt; neighs!  The &lt;unicorn&gt; catches the &lt;gem&gt;.\"\n    \"The &lt;unicorn&gt; &lt;ADVERB&gt; accepts your gift.\"\nwhere the color of the unicorn and the color of the gem are appropriate\nfor the situation. &lt;ADVERB&gt; comes from the table above, except where\nthe column has a *, in which case there is a different message sequence:\n    \"The &lt;unicorn&gt; neighs!\"\n    \"The &lt;unicorn&gt; catches the &lt;glass&gt;.\"\n    \"The &lt;unicorn&gt; is not interested in your junk.\"\nafter which the unicorn will promptly drop the \"gem\".\n\n3. Killing glass golems\n\nWhen a glass golem is destroyed, it leaves behind 2 to 8 worthless\npieces of glass (each of which can be any of the colours), and\nnever gems.\n\n4. Spell of stone to flesh\n\nThe spell of stone to flesh will turn gemstones into meatballs, but\nleave worthless pieces of glass intact; #name a gem 'valuable' or\nsimilar before zapping the spell at it (and rename it afterwards should\nit be proven untrue), since it won't be around to #name after.\n\n5.  Collecting a large number of gems\n\nIf you wait long enough, you'll accumulate a large number of gems.\nSince the probabilities of getting worthless pieces of glass are so\nmuch higher than getting true gems, you'll acquire them much faster\nthan other gems. So, if you just wait long enough, and look at all of\nthe gems of a certain color that you have, more often than not the gem\nof which you have the most is the worthless piece of glass. This is a\nbit risky, and usually takes much more time than other methods.\n\n6. Scrolls and spells of identify\n\nYou can always use a scroll or spell of identify to determine whether a\ngem is valuable.  You will then recognize all gems of that same type,\nalthough you can lose this knowledge from a scroll of amnesia or (master)\nmind flayer attack. Shopkeepers will buy identified gems\nbased on their full price; this is a good way to get money.\n\n7.  Rubbing on a touchstone\n\nBeing rubbed on a blessed touchstone (or also uncursed for Archeologists,\nwho start with one, and gnomes) will immediately identify any gem, as\ndetailed under \"touchstones\" above.\n\n8.  Dipping amethysts into potions of booze\n\nWhen you dip an amethyst into a potion(s) of booze, the potion will turn\ninto fruit juice (\"a-methyst\" means not intoxicated).  You can use this\nvery special case to identify this type of soft violet gems.\n\n9.  Pre-placed gems\n\nCertain levels are guaranteed to be generated with diamonds, rubies,\nemeralds, and amethysts in well-defined positions.  Two versions of\nthe bottom level of the Gnomish Mines (the Wine Cellar version and the\nMimic of the Mines version) contain concealed chambers with these four\ntypes of gems and a guaranteed luckstone, together with assorted other\n* to confuse identification; the third version's are randomly\nscattered across the level.  The four corner rooms of Fort Ludios (if\nit is reachable in your game) each contain one of these four types of\nvaluable gems.  Other levels may also be generated with piles of gems,\nbut their type is not guaranteed, so these levels are not helpful in\ndetermining the identity of gems.\n\n\nLuck\n~~~~\nLuck is included here because of luckstones.\n\nYour luck affects many aspects of the game (too many to mention here),\nand is actually the sum of two components.  Base luck changes with events\nin the game, and may slowly return to a \"baseline\" level.  Bonus luck, on\nthe other hand, is determined by what kind of luckstone (and certain\nartifacts) you are carrying.  Only a rough idea of your luck is given\nin the enlightenment list; the meaning of the messages is as follows:\n  TOTAL LUCK  MESSAGE\n  ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    &lt;= -10    extremely unlucky\n   -9 to -5   very unlucky\n   -4 to -1   unlucky\n       0      luck is zero (debug mode only)\n    1 to 4    lucky\n    5 to 9    very lucky\n    &gt;= 10     extremely lucky\n\nYour bonus luck -- and whether your base luck will return to its baseline\nlevel -- is controlled by luckstones and certain Quest Artifacts.  The\neffect of these \"luckitems\" depends on the number in your main inventory\nthat are blessed, uncursed, and cursed (see table below).  Note that you\ncan't do any better than one blessed luckitem, so you might as well keep\nany others in a bag (where they have no effect) as spares in case your\nmain one is cursed.\n  NUMBER OF LUCKITEMS          BAD LUCK    GOOD LUCK   BONUS LUCK\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~\n  None                         Times out   Times out   0 (no message)\n  More cursed than blessed     No timeout  Times out\n  Equal cursed and blessed     No timeout  No timeout\n  More blessed than cursed     Times out   No timeout\n  More cursed than non-cursed                          -3 \"reduced luck\"\n  Equal cursed and non-cursed                          +3 \"extra luck\"\n  More non-cursed than cursed                          +3 \"extra luck\"\nWhen you are enlightened about your luck, you are also told if you have\nbonus luck and if good/bad luck will not time out.\n\nBase luck is adjusted by each of the events described below.  It cannot\nbe reduced below -10 or increased above +10 beyond the baseline.  In\naddition, every 600 turns (or 300 if you have the Amulet of Yendor or have\nangered your god), your luck will increase by one if it is less than your\nbaseline luck and bad luck times out, and your luck will decrease by one if\nyour luck is greater than your baseline luck and good luck times out.

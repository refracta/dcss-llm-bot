{"title":"Farming","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Farming","type":"markdown","data":"**Farming** is a general gaming term used to define any kind of repetitive behavior designed for a specific benefit, usually in the form of better loot or an increased level and stats. Opinions on the practice vary widely, from being a common and accepted practice to being discouraged as against the spirit of the game.\n\nIn a game like *[NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\")*, some of these opinions are more polarized than usual, due to the age of the game as well as the ways in which some of the more common methods of farming can trivialize much of the gameplay (e.g., by removing most of the challenge from assembling an [ascension kit](/wiki/Ascension_kit \"Ascension kit\")). However, there are still elements of the game that can pose a significant threat to all but the most dedicated farmers, and players electing to farm for a given purpose must weigh the amount of time and resources spent in return for the desired reward(s).\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Changes to farming in NetHack](#Changes_to_farming_in_NetHack)\n\n- [2 List of current farming methods](#List_of_current_farming_methods)\n\n  - [2.1 Altar scumming](#Altar_scumming)\n  - [2.2 Gremlin farming](#Gremlin_farming)\n  - [2.3 Medusa farming](#Medusa_farming)\n  - [2.4 Quest farming](#Quest_farming)\n    - [2.4.1 Giant farming](#Giant_farming)\n  - [2.5 Throne looting](#Throne_looting)\n  - [2.6 Werecreature farming](#Werecreature_farming)\n  - [2.7 Wraith farming](#Wraith_farming)\n  - [2.8 Vault guard farming](#Vault_guard_farming)\n\n- [3 List of deprecated methods](#List_of_deprecated_methods)\n\n  - [3.1 Kraken farming](#Kraken_farming)\n  - [3.2 Pudding farming](#Pudding_farming)\n  - [3.3 Throne farming](#Throne_farming)\n  - [3.4 Death farming](#Death_farming)\n\n- [4 References](#References)\n\n## Changes to farming in NetHack\n\nThe types of farming possible in *NetHack* are many and varied; major changes made by the [DevTeam](/wiki/DevTeam \"DevTeam\") in the transition from [NetHack 3.4.3](/wiki/NetHack_3.4.3 \"NetHack 3.4.3\") to [3.6.0](/wiki/3.6.0 \"3.6.0\") were designed to address certain exploits and other methods that certain kinds of farming were reliant on. These changes limited the benefits that can be derived from most of them - and in a couple of cases, rendering them completely useless. For example, many farming methods rely upon cloned monsters; in 3.6.0, a bitfield labeled `mcloned` is added that tracks how the monster was generated; among other things, this prevents the splitting of monsters if the split monster is rendered extinct (though the splitting itself does not respect extinction).[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1)[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2)\n\n## List of current farming methods\n\nThe methods listed in this section are usable in current versions, though they may undergo significant changes as the game is updated.\n\n### Altar scumming\n\n- *Main article: [Altar farming](/wiki/Altar_farming \"Altar farming\")*\n\nHanging around an [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\") and sacrificing anything that comes along is a natural part of many legitimate games of *NetHack*, but some feel that taking this to extremes is scumming, particularly when combined with any of the other applicable farming methods detailed below.\n\n### Gremlin farming\n\n[![](/images/thumb/b/b6/Gremlin_farming_screenshot.png/300px-Gremlin_farming_screenshot.png)](/wiki/File:Gremlin_farming_screenshot.png)\n\n\n\nThat's a lot of gremlins...\n\nWhile [gremlins](/wiki/Gremlin \"Gremlin\") normally stop dividing once their [hit point](/wiki/Hit_point \"Hit point\") maximum falls to 1, it's possible to induce them to divide indefinitely by using a [ring of conflict](/wiki/Ring_of_conflict \"Ring of conflict\"). This works because whenever a monster kills something, such as another gremlin, its hit point maximum is increased, which allows it to divide again.[\\[3\\]](#cite_note-3) Since on average a gremlin gains more than one maximum hit point when it kills another gremlin, more gremlins can easily be created provided they are given enough time to heal and divide. As indicated previously, gremlin division also does not respect [extinction](/wiki/Extinction \"Extinction\").\n\nGremlins will not [death drop](/wiki/Death_drop \"Death drop\") most items due to their size, but can still drop valuables such as [gems](/wiki/Gems \"Gems\"), [rings](/wiki/Ring \"Ring\"), and even the normally-rare [magic marker](/wiki/Magic_marker \"Magic marker\"). Cloned monsters in 3.6.0 and later versions cannot leave death drops at all and give diminishing [experience](/wiki/Experience \"Experience\") returns;[\\[4\\]](#cite_note-4)[\\[5\\]](#cite_note-5) gremlin farming is thus much less effective for loot, but still viable as they leave corpses that can be used for sacrificing.\n\nTo \"breed\" gremlins effectively, the following steps are advisable:\n\n- Use an open, watery level. You need lots of [pools](/wiki/Pool \"Pool\") for the gremlins to divide in, and an open area for conflict to be most effective.\n- Try to keep the level clear of other monsters and traps. Remember that fully divided gremlins only have one hit point, and therefore die *very* easily.\n- Don't keep the ring of conflict on all the time. Instead, only put it on for one turn, take it off again immediately, and wait several turns for the surviving gremlins to fully heal and divide before putting it on again. This also keeps you less hungry and the gremlins less vulnerable to attacks by other monsters.\n- *Don't* do this at night. Even if you stand on [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") or a [scroll of scare monster](/wiki/Scroll_of_scare_monster \"Scroll of scare monster\"), the gremlins will still sometimes hit you when you wear conflict, risking your [intrinsics](/wiki/Intrinsic \"Intrinsic\") in the process.\n\n### Medusa farming\n\nCharacters with a source of [reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\") or a [mirror](/wiki/Mirror \"Mirror\") and the [stone to flesh](/wiki/Stone_to_flesh \"Stone to flesh\") spell can easily stone and revive [Medusa](/wiki/Medusa \"Medusa\") as many times as they like. No death drops are generated this way, but it does provide an easy source of experience points.\n\nThis trick has also been nerfed in NetHack 3.6.0, as repeatedly killing a revived monster eventually starts yielding diminishing [XP](/wiki/XP \"XP\") rewards.\n\n### Quest farming\n\n#### Giant farming\n\nIf you are playing as a [Valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\"), you can hang out on the home level of your [quest](/wiki/Valkyrie_quest \"Valkyrie quest\") and kill [giants](/wiki/Giant \"Giant\") for strength gain and [death drops](/wiki/Death_drop \"Death drop\"). This can be done easily by waiting in the building with the [Norn](/wiki/Norn \"Norn\") using the [numeric prefix](/wiki/Numeric_prefix \"Numeric prefix\") command and then venturing out to kill and consume a giant when you become [hungry](/wiki/Hungry \"Hungry\").\n\n### Throne looting\n\n[#Looting](/wiki/Loot \"Loot\") a [throne](/wiki/Throne \"Throne\") while [confused](/wiki/Confusion \"Confusion\") will generate a [throne room](/wiki/Throne_room \"Throne room\") monster and give it a fraction of your [gold](/wiki/Gold \"Gold\") if no [chest](/wiki/Chest \"Chest\") is on the level; a forgotten spell is a reliable, unlimited source of confusion. If throne monsters are rendered [extinct](/wiki/Extinct \"Extinct\"), ordinary random monsters are generated instead. In 3.6.0 and later versions, creating a monster now has a 10% chance of marking the throne as \"looted\", which will prevent it from any new monsters; additionally, confused looting now consumes a turn. Throne looting is thus still possible, but is no longer farmable to anywhere near the same extent.\n\n### Werecreature farming\n\nSince [werecreatures](/wiki/Werecreature \"Werecreature\") in their animal form can summon animals when attacking you, they can be used as a inexhaustible monster source. A reasonably safe farm is somewhat tedious to set up, but it can be a viable (and [conduct](/wiki/Conduct \"Conduct\")-proof) alternative to the usual [monster creation](/wiki/Create_monster \"Create monster\") methods, since it has not yet been nerfed as of [3.6.1](/wiki/3.6.1 \"3.6.1\").\n\n.|    .|    \n.|#   .|[d](/wiki/Werecreature \"Werecreature\")   \n.[+](/wiki/Door \"Door\")#   .[+](/wiki/Door \"Door\")[\\`](/wiki/Boulder \"Boulder\")   \n.|    .|  \n\nA farm made out of a [closet](/wiki/Closet \"Closet\")\n\nThe main idea is to trap the werecreature in a locked space connected diagonally to a door. Since monsters cannot move diagonally through a doorway, but can attack, you can easily \"switch\" the monster creation process by moving in and out of the doorway. You can use an existing [closet](/wiki/Closet \"Closet\") as the base -- simply dig a square to the side, trap the monster there, and block the original closet square with a boulder. If you have a [wand of locking](/wiki/Wand_of_locking \"Wand of locking\"), you can construct the farm in pretty much any room (including near an [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\")).\n\nLuring the werecreature into the trap can be troublesome. The easiest way is to temporarily [tame](/wiki/Tame \"Tame\") it, but [illiterates](/wiki/Illiterate \"Illiterate\") may find it difficult. Since werecreatures are not [followers](/wiki/Follower \"Follower\"), moving them between levels without taming is also difficult. (You can get them to fall down [holes](/wiki/Hole \"Hole\"), or kill them and [undead turn](/wiki/Wand_of_undead_turning \"Wand of undead turning\") their corpse.)\n\nOnce in place, you just need to endure its attacks. You will inevitably be infected by [lycanthropy](/wiki/Lycanthropy \"Lycanthropy\"), so you need some way of managing it: either [Werebane](/wiki/Werebane \"Werebane\"), an [amulet of unchanging](/wiki/Amulet_of_unchanging \"Amulet of unchanging\"), or a [ring of polymorph control](/wiki/Ring_of_polymorph_control \"Ring of polymorph control\") (make sure to turn [paranoid\\_confirmation:Were-change](/wiki/Options \"Options\") on if using the ring). It helps to have a means of curing it, as well (like [prayer](/wiki/Prayer \"Prayer\")). Anyway, after a few turns of attacking you the monster will summon help, after which you should step aside and deal with them.\n\nSummoned monsters can be used for most usual purposes (food, death drops, sacrifice, etc.) but note that being infected with lycanthropy makes eating them [cannibalism](/wiki/Cannibalism \"Cannibalism\") and reduces the chance of a [prayer boon](/wiki/Favor \"Favor\"), because your god will prioritize fixing the lycanthropy first. If you have Werebane, however, this is not a concern.\n\nAll three kinds of [werecreatures](/wiki/Werecreature \"Werecreature\") can be used, but wererats summon rats which have poisonous attacks and rarely leave corpses, and werewolves can summon [winter wolves](/wiki/Winter_wolf \"Winter wolf\") whose rays of cold can cause unwanted destruction (like the death of the original werewolf). If you can deal with them, however, they can give [cold resistance](/wiki/Cold_resistance \"Cold resistance\") (but mind the [cannibalism](/wiki/Cannibalism \"Cannibalism\") penalty). Wolves leave corpses very often but are tougher in general, making werejackals an optimal choice for low-level characters.\n\nOverall, it's a tedious and somewhat situational strategy, but if you're sacrificing for a powerful artifact and have gotten Werebane instead, it can be considered.\n\n### Wraith farming\n\nFirst, retrieve the [Book of the Dead](/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead \"Book of the Dead\"). This works best if you refrain from killing the [Wizard of Yendor](/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor \"Wizard of Yendor\"), because then he won't randomly appear until you perform the [Invocation Ritual](/wiki/Invocation_Ritual \"Invocation Ritual\"). Reading the [cursed](/wiki/Cursed \"Cursed\") Book can summon [wraiths](/wiki/Wraith \"Wraith\") (as well as other [undead](/wiki/Undead \"Undead\"), including [liches](/wiki/Lich \"Lich\"), so genocide what you cannot deal with). However, it also marks the current level as a [graveyard](/wiki/Graveyard \"Graveyard\"). This means that you should lead wraiths to another (nongraveyard) level before killing them for their corpses. Recall that eating a [wraith](/wiki/Wraith \"Wraith\") corpse at [experience level](/wiki/Experience_level \"Experience level\") 30 will still increase your maximum [HP](/wiki/HP \"HP\") and [power](/wiki/Power \"Power\").\n\n### Vault guard farming\n\nSince [guards](/wiki/Guard \"Guard\") generate without limit, it is possible to farm guards by entering a [vault](/wiki/Vault \"Vault\") and killing guards. You can summon guards if you are inside a vault by blowing a cursed [tin whistle](/wiki/Tin_whistle \"Tin whistle\") (which you can obtain from the first guard that comes). Killing the guards yourself will subject you to a [murder](/wiki/Murder \"Murder\") penalty (if you are not chaotic) and decrease your [alignment record](/wiki/Alignment_record \"Alignment record\") (for killing a peaceful monster, regardless of your alignment). If have a [helm of opposite alignment](/wiki/Helm_of_opposite_alignment \"Helm of opposite alignment\") and are or can become chaotic, you can avoid the murder penalty and reset your alignment record when you are done farming by putting on or removing the helm.\n\nYou can also have a strong [pet](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\") kill guards for you to avoid penalties, but you will not receive [death drops](/wiki/Death_drop \"Death drop\") this way, limiting spoils to the [offensive items](/wiki/Offensive_item \"Offensive item\"), [defensive items](/wiki/Defensive_item \"Defensive item\"), and [miscellaneous items](/wiki/Miscellaneous_item \"Miscellaneous item\") that guards may generate with. You may want to use the [menu\\_search](/wiki/Menu_search \"Menu search\") key binding (default [:](/wiki/Colon \"Colon\")) to search for items when you are in the [pick up](/wiki/Pick_up \"Pick up\") menu to avoid scrolling through a list of the dead guards' [junk](/wiki/Junk \"Junk\") weapons and armor.\n\n## List of deprecated methods\n\nDue to the major divergence between versions, the following methods detailed below are either mostly inapplicable to current versions, or else severely reduced in effectiveness. They are still applicable to 3.4.3 at latest, as well as many variants based on pre-3.6 versions; changes made from the 3.6 series forward and their effects on the strategy are noted where appropriate.\n\n### Kraken farming\n\nIn 3.4.3, [kraken](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\") can be killed trivially when on dry land, and their corpses can be revived using [undead turning](/wiki/Undead_turning \"Undead turning\"). This means you can continue killing the same monsters near-indefinitely, racking up a very high score with very little effort. To get the most out of such farming, you can trap kraken by digging walls in the following pattern:\n\n[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")  \n[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")  \n[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")  \n[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")  \n[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[;](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")  \n[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")[#](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\")\n\nThis allows a farmer to repeatedly cast [undead turning](/wiki/Undead_turning \"Undead turning\") and [finger of death](/wiki/Finger_of_death \"Finger of death\") along the diagonals with copy-and-paste - kraken are [huge](/wiki/Physical_size \"Physical size\") monsters, and so cannot squeeze diagonally between walls.\n\n3.6.0 and later versions make this strategy vastly more dangerous, if not impossible - kraken will no longer revive while on land, and leaving them in water puts the player at risk of instadeath by [drowning](/wiki/Drowning \"Drowning\") attack.\n\n### Pudding farming\n\n- *Main article: [Pudding farming](/wiki/Pudding_farming \"Pudding farming\")*\n\nIn 3.4.3, a common tactic was to advance your character to the point where they could easily defeat [black puddings](/wiki/Black_pudding \"Black pudding\"), then carefully use weak weapons to divide them without killing them; this allowed players to \"farm\" by killing as many puddings as they wish for [death dropped](/wiki/Death_drop \"Death drop\") items, and their corpses can be [sacrificed](/wiki/Sacrifice \"Sacrifice\") for a variety of benefits. Players can continue this process (and even automate it) until they possess thousands of hit points, maximum [AC](/wiki/AC \"AC\"), and hundreds of [wands of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\")—at a point where a player is considering this and has the means to do so, the primary obstacle is the amount of effort they are willing to dedicate (which ironically proved an effective deterrent).\n\n3.6.0's changes rendered this method of farming completely ineffective by removing the majority of its benefits. One such major change is the `mcloned` bitfield that tracks cloned monsters, used to prevent them from leaving death drops of any kind. Another such change is the addition of [globs](/wiki/Glob \"Glob\"), which replace regular corpses as the remains of black puddings; these are left behind in a special method similar to [golems](/wiki/Golem \"Golem\"), and thus puddings can no longer provide any death drops or sacrifice material.\n\n### Throne farming\n\nThrone farming was once perhaps the fastest way in the game to generate lots of monsters, and the only method available without breaking any conducts; monster generation would also not use up a turn or risk any damage to the throne, allowing indefinite farming for whatever items you desire (from [dragon scales](/wiki/Dragon_scales \"Dragon scales\") to [convert into mail](/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail \"Dragon scale mail\") to various [potions](/wiki/Potion \"Potion\"), [wands](/wiki/Wand \"Wand\") and [scrolls](/wiki/Scroll \"Scroll\"). This is no longer possible as of 3.6.0, since confused looting now uses up a turn and has a 1⁄10 chance of marking the throne as \"looted\", preventing further monster generation from that throne.\n\nFor 3.4.3, earlier versions and some variants based on them, undiggable no-teleport levels work best to prevent monsters from ruining your setup; at most, you will only have to use up one charge from a wand of teleportation to send a troublesome monster off. Each [quest](/wiki/Quest \"Quest\") home level generates the quest leader on a suitable throne - you can make them wander away if you move adjacent on a free turn, and then say no to the \"really attack?\" prompt. You might want to engrave concentric circles of [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") (as done when [farming dragon scales](/wiki/DSM#Acquiring_dragon_scales \"DSM\")) and/or use a boulder fort to protect yourself from ranged attacks. Illiterate conduct players can get a monster to read the [scroll of earth](/wiki/Scroll_of_earth \"Scroll of earth\"), then stand on a scroll of scare monster and confuse themselves, using a cursed [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\") if they did not start with a spell to forget.\n\nAt this point, the only threat left is the potential of [sickness](/wiki/Sickness \"Sickness\"); the chance of dying to terminal illness can be almost completely removed by [polymorphing](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") into a [ghoul](/wiki/Ghoul \"Ghoul\") to gain [sickness resistance](/wiki/Sickness_resistance \"Sickness resistance\") beforehand, or applying a preferably-blessed unicorn horn to cure it. Unattended copy-paste farming is only possible if you confuse yourself with an expired spell or are [permanently a ghoul](/wiki/Amulet_of_unchanging \"Amulet of unchanging\"); setting `menustyle=traditional` in your config file can make the paste script execute the spellcasting faster.\n\n### Death farming\n\nThis is only borderline scumming, as any character capable of doing it is more than capable of ascending. The goal might be to gain large numbers of exotic items to ascend with, to gain billions of points, or (most commonly) to impress onlookers.\n\n1. [Eat](/wiki/Eating_jewelry \"Eating jewelry\") [rings of increase damage](/wiki/Ring_of_increase_damage \"Ring of increase damage\") until you have a high enough intrinsic damage bonus to kill [Death](/wiki/Death_\\(monster\\) \"Death (monster)\") in one hit (+60 should work).\n2. Clear the [Astral plane](/wiki/Astral_plane \"Astral plane\") of all distractions.\n3. Increase your [polearm](/wiki/Polearm \"Polearm\") proficiency to skilled.\n4. Trap [Death](/wiki/Riders \"Riders\") in a corner on the Astral plane, like so:\n\n\\----  \n|[&](/wiki/Death_\\(monster\\) \"Death (monster)\")[j](/wiki/Blue_jelly \"Blue jelly\").  \n|[j](/wiki/Blue_jelly \"Blue jelly\")[\\`](/wiki/Boulder \"Boulder\")[@](/wiki/You \"You\")  \n|[j](/wiki/Blue_jelly \"Blue jelly\")[j](/wiki/Blue_jelly \"Blue jelly\").\n\nIn this example, Death is trapped between [blue jellies](/wiki/Blue_jelly \"Blue jelly\") and a [boulder](/wiki/Boulder \"Boulder\"). He cannot move, but you can hit him with a polearm while he is in line of sight. Once he's dead (in one hit), attempt to push the boulder over his corpse. This will revive him. You can then repeat the procedure. You can work out the exact sequence of key strokes used in a complete cycle of this process (in this case, for example, \"aahy.jyk\"), and copy this line a few thousand times in a text editor, then paste the whole lot into the NetHack interface.\n\nThe result will be many thousand death-dropped items and a very high score. If the number of death-dropped items exceeds 32,767 on the same square, the game will probably crash,[\\[6\\]](#cite_note-6) so periodically checking Death's square and redistributing the items (possibly by teleporting them away, or polymorphing them together) is necessary. This is because the number of items present on a [square](/wiki/Square \"Square\") is stored in a [signed short](/wiki/Signed_variable \"Signed variable\") when the items are listed.\n\nThis method no longer works as of 3.6.0, because Riders can [displace](/wiki/Displace \"Displace\") other monsters; thus, the jelly fort will not work to contain Death. It is still possible to kill Death (or other Riders) arbitrarily many times, but not with this method of automation. Additionally, revived monsters give diminishing experience points and score, down to 1⁄64 of the base value, which means that it will take much longer to achieve billions of points.\n\n## References\n\n1.

Instead, only put it on for one turn, take it off again immediately, and wait several turns for the surviving gremlins to fully heal and divide before putting it on again.

If throne monsters are rendered <a href=\"/wiki/Extinct\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Extinct\">extinct</a>, ordinary random monsters are generated instead. In 3.6.0 and later versions, creating a monster now has a 10% chance of marking the throne as \"looted\", which will prevent it from any new monsters; additionally, confused looting now consumes a turn. Throne looting is thus still possible, but is no longer farmable to anywhere near the same extent.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Werecreature_farming\">Werecreature farming</span></h3>\n<p>Since <a href=\"/wiki/Werecreature\" title=\"Werecreature\">werecreatures</a> in their animal form can summon animals when attacking you, they can be used as a inexhaustible monster source. A reasonably safe farm is somewhat tedious to set up, but it can be a viable (and <a href=\"/wiki/Conduct\" title=\"Conduct\">conduct</a>-proof) alternative to the usual <a href=\"/wiki/Create_monster\" title=\"Create monster\">monster creation</a> methods, since it has not yet been nerfed as of <a href=\"/wiki/3.6.1\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"3.6.1\">3.6.1</a>.\n</p>\n<div class=\"floatright\" style=\"float:right; clear:right;\"><div class=\"caption\"><div class=\"captioninner\"><div class=\"ttyscreen\">\n<p><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">.</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">&#124;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">.</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">&#124;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><br /><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">.</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">&#124;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">#</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">.</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">&#124;</span><a href=\"/wiki/Werecreature\" title=\"Werecreature\"><span class=\"nhsym clr-brown\">d</span></a><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><br /><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">.</span><a href=\"/wiki/Door\" title=\"Door\"><span class=\"nhsym clr-brown\">+</span></a><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">#</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">.</span><a href=\"/wiki/Door\" title=\"Door\"><span class=\"nhsym clr-brown\">+</span></a><a href=\"/wiki/Boulder\" title=\"Boulder\"><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">`</span></a><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><br /><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">.</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">&#124;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">.</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">&#124;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">&#160;</span><br />\n</p>\n</div><div class=\"captiontext\">A farm made out of a <a href=\"/wiki/Closet\" title=\"Closet\">closet</a></div></div></div></div>\n<p>The main idea is to trap the werecreature in a locked space connected diagonally to a door.  Since monsters cannot move diagonally through a doorway, but can attack, you can easily \"switch\" the monster creation process by moving in and out of the doorway.  You can use an existing <a href=\"/wiki/Closet\" title=\"Closet\">closet</a> as the base -- simply dig a square to the side, trap the monster there, and block the original closet square with a boulder.  If you have a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_locking\" title=\"Wand of locking\">wand of locking</a>, you can construct the farm in pretty much any room (including near an <a href=\"/wiki/Altar\" title=\"Altar\">altar</a>).\n</p><p>Luring the werecreature into the trap can be troublesome.  The easiest way is to temporarily <a href=\"/wiki/Tame\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tame\">tame</a> it, but <a href=\"/wiki/Illiterate\" title=\"Illiterate\">illiterates</a> may find it difficult.  Since werecreatures are not <a href=\"/wiki/Follower\" title=\"Follower\">followers</a>, moving them between levels without taming is also difficult. (You can get them to fall down <a href=\"/wiki/Hole\" title=\"Hole\">holes</a>, or kill them and <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_undead_turning\" title=\"Wand of undead turning\">undead turn</a> their corpse.)\n</p><p>Once in place, you just need to endure its attacks.  You will inevitably be infected by <a href=\"/wiki/Lycanthropy\" title=\"Lycanthropy\">lycanthropy</a>, so you need some way of managing it: either <a href=\"/wiki/Werebane\" title=\"Werebane\">Werebane</a>, an <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_unchanging\" title=\"Amulet of unchanging\">amulet of unchanging</a>, or a <a href=\"/wiki/Ring_of_polymorph_control\" title=\"Ring of polymorph control\">ring of polymorph control</a> (make sure to turn <a href=\"/wiki/Options\" title=\"Options\">paranoid_confirmation:Were-change</a> on if using the ring).  It helps to have a means of curing it, as well (like <a href=\"/wiki/Prayer\" title=\"Prayer\">prayer</a>).  Anyway, after a few turns of attacking you the monster will summon help, after which you should step aside and deal with them.\n</p><p>Summoned monsters can be used for most usual purposes (food, death drops, sacrifice, etc.) but note that being infected with lycanthropy makes eating them <a href=\"/wiki/Cannibalism\" title=\"Cannibalism\">cannibalism</a> and reduces the chance of a <a href=\"/wiki/Favor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Favor\">prayer boon</a>, because your god will prioritize fixing the lycanthropy first.  If you have Werebane, however, this is not a concern.\n</p><p>All three kinds of <a href=\"/wiki/Werecreature\" title=\"Werecreature\">werecreatures</a> can be used, but wererats summon rats which have poisonous attacks and rarely leave corpses, and werewolves can summon <a href=\"/wiki/Winter_wolf\" title=\"Winter wolf\">winter wolves</a> whose rays of cold can cause unwanted destruction (like the death of the original werewolf). If you can deal with them, however, they can give <a href=\"/wiki/Cold_resistance\" title=\"Cold resistance\">cold resistance</a> (but mind the <a href=\"/wiki/Cannibalism\" title=\"Cannibalism\">cannibalism</a> penalty). Wolves leave corpses very often but are tougher in general, making werejackals an optimal choice for low-level characters.\n</p><p>Overall, it's a tedious and somewhat situational strategy, but if you're sacrificing for a powerful artifact and have gotten Werebane instead, it can be considered.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wraith_farming\">Wraith farming</span></h3>\n<p>First, retrieve the <a href=\"/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead\" title=\"Book of the Dead\">Book of the Dead</a>. This works best if you refrain from killing the <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor\" title=\"Wizard of Yendor\">Wizard of Yendor</a>, because then he won't randomly appear until you perform the <a href=\"/wiki/Invocation_Ritual\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Invocation Ritual\">Invocation Ritual</a>. Reading the <a href=\"/wiki/Cursed\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cursed\">cursed</a> Book can summon <a href=\"/wiki/Wraith\" title=\"Wraith\">wraiths</a> (as well as other <a href=\"/wiki/Undead\" title=\"Undead\">undead</a>, including <a href=\"/wiki/Lich\" title=\"Lich\">liches</a>, so genocide what you cannot deal with). However, it also marks the current level as a <a href=\"/wiki/Graveyard\" title=\"Graveyard\">graveyard</a>. This means that you should lead wraiths to another (nongraveyard) level before killing them for their corpses. Recall that eating a <a href=\"/wiki/Wraith\" title=\"Wraith\">wraith</a> corpse at <a href=\"/wiki/Experience_level\" title=\"Experience level\">experience level</a> 30 will still increase your maximum <a href=\"/wiki/HP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HP\">HP</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Power\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Power\">power</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Vault_guard_farming\">Vault guard farming</span></h3>\n<p>Since <a href=\"/wiki/Guard\" title=\"Guard\">guards</a> generate without limit, it is possible to farm guards by entering a <a href=\"/wiki/Vault\" title=\"Vault\">vault</a> and killing guards. You can summon guards if you are inside a vault by blowing a cursed <a href=\"/wiki/Tin_whistle\" title=\"Tin whistle\">tin whistle</a> (which you can obtain from the first guard that comes).

mainarticle\"><i>Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Pudding_farming\" title=\"Pudding farming\">Pudding farming</a></i></div></dd></dl>\n<p>In 3.4.3, a common tactic was to advance your character to the point where they could easily defeat <a href=\"/wiki/Black_pudding\" title=\"Black pudding\">black puddings</a>, then carefully use weak weapons to divide them without killing them; this allowed players to \"farm\" by killing as many puddings as they wish for <a href=\"/wiki/Death_drop\" title=\"Death drop\">death dropped</a> items, and their corpses can be <a href=\"/wiki/Sacrifice\" title=\"Sacrifice\">sacrificed</a> for a variety of benefits. Players can continue this process (and even automate it) until they possess thousands of hit points, maximum <a href=\"/wiki/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a>, and hundreds of <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_wishing\" title=\"Wand of wishing\">wands of wishing</a>&#8212;at a point where a player is considering this and has the means to do so, the primary obstacle is the amount of effort they are willing to dedicate (which ironically proved an effective deterrent).\n</p><p>3.6.0's changes rendered this method of farming completely ineffective by removing the majority of its benefits. One such major change is the <code>mcloned</code> bitfield that tracks cloned monsters, used to prevent them from leaving death drops of any kind. Another such change is the addition of <a href=\"/wiki/Glob\" title=\"Glob\">globs</a>, which replace regular corpses as the remains of black puddings; these are left behind in a special method similar to <a href=\"/wiki/Golem\" title=\"Golem\">golems</a>, and thus puddings can no longer provide any death drops or sacrifice material.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Throne_farming\">Throne farming</span></h3>\n<p>Throne farming was once perhaps the fastest way in the game to generate lots of monsters, and the only method available without breaking any conducts; monster generation would also not use up a turn or risk any damage to the throne, allowing indefinite farming for whatever items you desire (from <a href=\"/wiki/Dragon_scales\" title=\"Dragon scales\">dragon scales</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail\" title=\"Dragon scale mail\">convert into mail</a> to various <a href=\"/wiki/Potion\" title=\"Potion\">potions</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Wand\" title=\"Wand\">wands</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll\" title=\"Scroll\">scrolls</a>. This is no longer possible as of 3.6.0, since confused looting now uses up a turn and has a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> chance of marking the throne as \"looted\", preventing further monster generation from that throne.\n</p><p>For 3.4.3, earlier versions and some variants based on them, undiggable no-teleport levels work best to prevent monsters from ruining your setup; at most, you will only have to use up one charge from a wand of teleportation to send a troublesome monster off. Each <a href=\"/wiki/Quest\" title=\"Quest\">quest</a> home level generates the quest leader on a suitable throne - you can make them wander away if you move adjacent on a free turn, and then say no to the \"really attack?\" prompt. You might want to engrave concentric circles of <a href=\"/wiki/Elbereth\" title=\"Elbereth\">Elbereth</a> (as done when <a href=\"/wiki/DSM#Acquiring_dragon_scales\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"DSM\">farming dragon scales</a>) and/or use a boulder fort to protect yourself from ranged attacks. Illiterate conduct players can get a monster to read the <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_earth\" title=\"Scroll of earth\">scroll of earth</a>, then stand on a scroll of scare monster and confuse themselves, using a cursed <a href=\"/wiki/Unicorn_horn\" title=\"Unicorn horn\">unicorn horn</a> if they did not start with a spell to forget.\n</p><p>At this point, the only threat left is the potential of <a href=\"/wiki/Sickness\" title=\"Sickness\">sickness</a>; the chance of dying to terminal illness can be almost completely removed by <a href=\"/wiki/Polymorph\" title=\"Polymorph\">polymorphing</a> into a <a href=\"/wiki/Ghoul\" title=\"Ghoul\">ghoul</a> to gain <a href=\"/wiki/Sickness_resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sickness resistance\">sickness resistance</a> beforehand, or applying a preferably-blessed unicorn horn to cure it. Unattended copy-paste farming is only possible if you confuse yourself with an expired spell or are <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_unchanging\" title=\"Amulet of unchanging\">permanently a ghoul</a>; setting <code><a href=\"/wiki/Option#menustyle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Option\">menustyle=traditional</a></code> in your config file can make the paste script execute the spellcasting faster.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Death_farming\">Death farming</span></h3>\n<p>This is only borderline scumming, as any character capable of doing it is more than capable of ascending.

He cannot move, but you can hit him with a polearm while he is in line of sight. Once he's dead (in one hit), attempt to push the boulder over his corpse. This will revive him. You can then repeat the procedure. You can work out the exact sequence of key strokes used in a complete cycle of this process (in this case, for example, \"aahy.jyk\"), and copy this line a few thousand times in a text editor, then paste the whole lot into the NetHack interface.\n</p><p>The result will be many thousand death-dropped items and a very high score. If the number of death-dropped items exceeds 32,767 on the same square, the game will probably crash,<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> so periodically checking Death's square and redistributing the items (possibly by teleporting them away, or polymorphing them together) is necessary. This is because the number of items present on a <a href=\"/wiki/Square\" title=\"Square\">square</a> is stored in a <a href=\"/wiki/Signed_variable\" title=\"Signed variable\">signed short</a> when the items are listed.\n</p><p>This method no longer works as of 3.6.0, because Riders can <a href=\"/wiki/Displace\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Displace\">displace</a> other monsters; thus, the jelly fort will not work to contain Death. It is still possible to kill Death (or other Riders) arbitrarily many times, but not with this method of automation. Additionally, revived monsters give diminishing experience points and score, down to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>64</sub> of the base value, which means that it will take much longer to achieve billions of points.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/NetHack-3.6.0_Release/src/makemon.c#L766\">src/makemon.c in NetHack 3.6.0, line 766</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/NetHack-3.6.0_Release/src/mhitu.c#L2739\">src/mhitu.c in NetHack 3.6.0, line 2739</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/NetHack-3.6.6_Released/src/makemon.c#L1831\">src/makemon.c in NetHack 3.6.6, line 1831</a><span>:</span> <i>hit points gained after killing another monster</i>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/NetHack-3.6.0_Release/src/mon.c#L2202\">src/mon.c in NetHack 3.6.0, line 2202</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-5\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-5\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/NetHack-3.6.0_Release/src/exper.c#L133\">src/exper.c in NetHack 3.6.0, line 133</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/3f97bcf24f034605/5f51813967ab27a8?q=#5f51813967ab27a8\">RGRN thread: [BUG</a> menucolors patch segfaults]</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<div style=\"display:none; right:10px; padding-bottom: 17px\" class=\"metadata topicon nopopups\"><div style=\"margin-top: -10px\"><a href=\"/wiki/NetHackWiki:Next_version\" title=\"This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.7.

is a general gaming term used to define any kind of repetitive behavior designed for a specific benefit, usually in the form of better loot or an increased level and stats. Opinions on the practice vary widely, from being a common and accepted practice to being discouraged as against the spirit of the game.\n\nIn a game like ''[[NetHack]]'', some of these opinions are more polarized than usual, due to the age of the game as well as the ways in which some of the more common methods of farming can trivialize much of the gameplay (e.g., by removing most of the challenge from assembling an [[ascension kit]]). However, there are still elements of the game that can pose a significant threat to all but the most dedicated farmers, and players electing to farm for a given purpose must weigh the amount of time and resources spent in return for the desired reward(s).\n\n==Changes to farming in NetHack==\nThe types of farming possible in ''NetHack'' are many and varied; major changes made by the [[DevTeam]] in the transition from [[NetHack 3.4.3]] to [[3.6.0]] were designed to address certain exploits and other methods that certain kinds of farming were reliant on. These changes limited the benefits that can be derived from most of them - and in a couple of cases, rendering them completely useless. For example, many farming methods rely upon cloned monsters; in 3.6.0, a bitfield labeled <code>mcloned</code> is added that tracks how the monster was generated; among other things, this prevents the splitting of monsters if the split monster is rendered extinct (though the splitting itself does not respect extinction).{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|766|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|src/mhitu.c|2739|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}\n\n==List of current farming methods==\nThe methods listed in this section are usable in current versions, though they may undergo significant changes as the game is updated.\n\n===Altar scumming===\n{{main|Altar farming}}\n\nHanging around an [[altar]] and sacrificing anything that comes along is a natural part of many legitimate games of ''NetHack'', but some feel that taking this to extremes is scumming, particularly when combined with any of the other applicable farming methods detailed below.\n\n===Gremlin farming===\n[[File:Gremlin farming screenshot.png|thumb|That's a lot of gremlins...]]\nWhile [[gremlin]]s normally stop dividing once their [[hit point]] maximum falls to 1, it's possible to induce them to divide indefinitely by using a [[ring of conflict]]. This works because whenever a monster kills something, such as another gremlin, its hit point maximum is increased, which allows it to divide again.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1831|nethack=3.6.6|comment=hit points gained after killing another monster}} Since on average a gremlin gains more than one maximum hit point when it kills another gremlin, more gremlins can easily be created provided they are given enough time to heal and divide. As indicated previously, gremlin division also does not respect [[extinction]].\n\nGremlins will not [[death drop]] most items due to their size, but can still drop valuables such as [[gems]], [[ring]]s, and even the normally-rare [[magic marker]]. Cloned monsters in 3.6.0 and later versions cannot leave death drops at all and give diminishing [[experience]] returns;{{refsrc|src/mon.c|2202|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|src/exper.c|133|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} gremlin farming is thus much less effective for loot, but still viable as they leave corpses that can be used for sacrificing.\n\nTo \"breed\" gremlins effectively, the following steps are advisable:\n* Use an open, watery level. You need lots of [[pool]]s for the gremlins to divide in, and an open area for conflict to be most effective.\n* Try to keep the level clear of other monsters and traps. Remember that fully divided gremlins only have one hit point, and therefore die ''very'' easily.\n* Don't keep the ring of conflict on all the time. Instead, only put it on for one turn, take it off again immediately, and wait several turns for the surviving gremlins to fully heal and divide before putting it on again. This also keeps you less hungry and the gremlins less vulnerable to attacks by other monsters.\n* ''Don't'' do this at night. Even if you stand on [[Elbereth]] or a [[scroll of scare monster]], the gremlins will still sometimes hit you when you wear conflict, risking your [[intrinsic]]s in the process.\n\n===Medusa farming===\nCharacters with a source of [[reflection]] or a [[mirror]] and the [[stone to flesh]] spell can easily stone and revive [[Medusa]] as many times as they like. No death drops are generated this way, but it does provide an easy source of experience points.\n\nThis trick has also been nerfed in NetHack 3.6.0, as repeatedly killing a revived monster eventually starts yielding diminishing [[XP]] rewards.\n\n===Quest farming===\n====Giant farming====\nIf you are playing as a [[Valkyrie]], you can hang out on the home level of your [[Valkyrie quest|quest]] and kill [[giant]]s for strength gain and [[death drop]]s.  This can be done easily by waiting in the building with the [[Norn]] using the [[numeric prefix]] command and then venturing out to kill and consume a giant when you become [[hungry]].\n\n===Throne looting===\n[[Loot|#Looting]] a [[throne]] while [[confusion|confused]] will generate a [[throne room]] monster and give it a fraction of your [[gold]] if no [[chest]] is on the level; a forgotten spell is a reliable, unlimited source of confusion. If throne monsters are rendered [[extinct]], ordinary random monsters are generated instead. In 3.6.0 and later versions, creating a monster now has a 10% chance of marking the throne as \"looted\", which will prevent it from any new monsters; additionally, confused looting now consumes a turn. Throne looting is thus still possible, but is no longer farmable to anywhere near the same extent.\n\n===Werecreature farming===\nSince [[werecreature]]s in their animal form can summon animals when attacking you, they can be used as a inexhaustible monster source. A reasonably safe farm is somewhat tedious to set up, but it can be a viable (and [[conduct]]-proof) alternative to the usual [[create monster|monster creation]] methods, since it has not yet been nerfed as of [[3.6.1]].\n\n{{float right|{{caption|1=<div class=ttyscreen>\n<replacecharsblock rules=\"ttymap\">\nd=[[werecreature|{{brown|d}}]]\n`=[[boulder|{{lightgray|`}}]]\n\n.|    .|  \n.|#   .|d \n.+#   .+` \n.|    .|  \n</replacecharsblock>\n</div>|2=A farm made out of a [[closet]]}}}}\n\nThe main idea is to trap the werecreature in a locked space connected diagonally to a door.  Since monsters cannot move diagonally through a doorway, but can attack, you can easily \"switch\" the monster creation process by moving in and out of the doorway.  You can use an existing [[closet]] as the base -- simply dig a square to the side, trap the monster there, and block the original closet square with a boulder.  If you have a [[wand of locking]], you can construct the farm in pretty much any room (including near an [[altar]]).\n\nLuring the werecreature into the trap can be troublesome.  The easiest way is to temporarily [[tame]] it, but [[illiterate]]s may find it difficult.  Since werecreatures are not [[follower]]s, moving them between levels without taming is also difficult. (You can get them to fall down [[hole]]s, or kill them and [[wand of undead turning|undead turn]] their corpse.)\n\nOnce in place, you just need to endure its attacks.  You will inevitably be infected by [[lycanthropy]], so you need some way of managing it: either [[Werebane]], an [[amulet of unchanging]], or a [[ring of polymorph control]] (make sure to turn [[options|paranoid_confirmation:Were-change]] on if using the ring).  It helps to have a means of curing it, as well (like [[prayer]]).  Anyway, after a few turns of attacking you the monster will summon help, after which you should step aside and deal with them.\n\nSummoned monsters can be used for most usual purposes (food, death drops, sacrifice, etc.) but note that being infected with lycanthropy makes eating them [[cannibalism]] and reduces the chance of a [[favor|prayer boon]], because your god will prioritize fixing the lycanthropy first.  If you have Werebane, however, this is not a concern.\n\nAll three kinds of [[werecreature]]s can be used, but wererats summon rats which have poisonous attacks and rarely leave corpses, and werewolves can summon [[winter wolf|winter wolves]] whose rays of cold can cause unwanted destruction (like the death of the original werewolf). If you can deal with them, however, they can give [[cold resistance]] (but mind the [[cannibalism]] penalty). Wolves leave corpses very often but are tougher in general, making werejackals an optimal choice for low-level characters.\n\nOverall, it's a tedious and somewhat situational strategy, but if you're sacrificing for a powerful artifact and have gotten Werebane instead, it can be considered.\n\n===Wraith farming===\nFirst, retrieve the [[Book of the Dead]]. This works best if you refrain from killing the [[Wizard of Yendor]], because then he won't randomly appear until you perform the [[Invocation Ritual]]. Reading the [[cursed]] Book can summon [[wraith]]s (as well as other [[undead]], including [[lich]]es, so genocide what you cannot deal with). However, it also marks the current level as a [[graveyard]]. This means that you should lead wraiths to another (nongraveyard) level before killing them for their corpses. Recall that eating a [[wraith]] corpse at [[experience level]] 30 will still increase your maximum [[HP]] and [[power]].\n\n===Vault guard farming===\nSince [[guard]]s generate without limit, it is possible to farm guards by entering a [[vault]] and killing guards. You can summon guards if you are inside a vault by blowing a cursed [[tin whistle]] (which you can obtain from the first guard that comes). Killing the guards yourself will subject you to a [[murder]] penalty (if you are not chaotic) and decrease your [[alignment record]] (for killing a peaceful monster, regardless of your alignment). If have a [[helm of opposite alignment]] and are or can become chaotic, you can avoid the murder penalty and reset your alignment record when you are done farming by putting on or removing the helm.\n\nYou can also have a strong [[pet]] kill guards for you to avoid penalties, but you will not receive [[death drop]]s this way, limiting spoils to the [[offensive item]]s, [[defensive item]]s, and [[miscellaneous item]]s that guards may generate with. You may want to use the [[menu_search]] key binding (default {{kbd|:}}) to search for items when you are in the [[pick up]] menu to avoid scrolling through a list of the dead guards' [[junk]] weapons and armor.\n\n==List of deprecated methods==\nDue to the major divergence between versions, the following methods detailed below are either mostly inapplicable to current versions, or else severely reduced in effectiveness. They are still applicable to 3.4.3 at latest, as well as many variants based on pre-3.6 versions; changes made from the 3.6 series forward and their effects on the strategy are noted where appropriate.\n\n===Kraken farming===\nIn 3.4.3, [[kraken]] can be killed trivially when on dry land, and their corpses can be revived using [[undead turning]]. This means you can continue killing the same monsters near-indefinitely, racking up a very high score with very little effort. To get the most out of such farming, you can trap kraken by digging walls in the following pattern:\n\n<div class=\"ttyscreen\"><replacecharsblock rules=\"ttymap\">\n;={{msl|kraken}}\n#=[[corridor|{{gray|#}}]]\n =[[solid rock|{{gray|&nbsp;}}]]\n\n # # # # # # # #\n# # ; ; ; ; ; ; \n # ; ; ; ; ; ; #\n# ; ; ; ; ; ; # \n ; ; ; ; ; ; # #\n# # # # # # # # \n</replacecharsblock></div>\n\nThis allows a farmer to repeatedly cast [[undead turning]] and [[finger of death]] along the diagonals with copy-and-paste - kraken are [[Physical size|huge]] monsters, and so cannot squeeze diagonally between walls.\n\n3.6.0 and later versions make this strategy vastly more dangerous, if not impossible - kraken will no longer revive while on land, and leaving them in water puts the player at risk of instadeath by [[drowning]] attack.\n\n===Pudding farming===\n{{main|Pudding farming}}\nIn 3.4.3, a common tactic was to advance your character to the point where they could easily defeat [[black pudding]]s, then carefully use weak weapons to divide them without killing them; this allowed players to \"farm\" by killing as many puddings as they wish for [[death drop]]ped items, and their corpses can be [[sacrifice]]d for a variety of benefits. Players can continue this process (and even automate it) until they possess thousands of hit points, maximum [[AC]], and hundreds of [[wand of wishing|wands of wishing]]&mdash;at a point where a player is considering this and has the means to do so, the primary obstacle is the amount of effort they are willing to dedicate (which ironically proved an effective deterrent).\n\n3.6.0's changes rendered this method of farming completely ineffective by removing the majority of its benefits. One such major change is the <code>mcloned</code> bitfield that tracks cloned monsters, used to prevent them from leaving death drops of any kind. Another such change is the addition of [[glob]]s, which replace regular corpses as the remains of black puddings; these are left behind in a special method similar to [[golem]]s, and thus puddings can no longer provide any death drops or sacrifice material.\n\n===Throne farming===\nThrone farming was once perhaps the fastest way in the game to generate lots of monsters, and the only method available without breaking any conducts; monster generation would also not use up a turn or risk any damage to the throne, allowing indefinite farming for whatever items you desire (from [[dragon scales]] to [[dragon scale mail|convert into mail]] to various [[potion]]s, [[wand]]s and [[scroll]]s. This is no longer possible as of 3.6.0, since confused looting now uses up a turn and has a {{frac|10}} chance of marking the throne as \"looted\", preventing further monster generation from that throne.\n\nFor 3.4.3, earlier versions and some variants based on them, undiggable no-teleport levels work best to prevent monsters from ruining your setup; at most, you will only have to use up one charge from a wand of teleportation to send a troublesome monster off. Each [[quest]] home level generates the quest leader on a suitable throne - you can make them wander away if you move adjacent on a free turn, and then say no to the \"really attack?\" prompt. You might want to engrave concentric circles of [[Elbereth]] (as done when [[DSM#Acquiring dragon scales|farming dragon scales]]) and/or use a boulder fort to protect yourself from ranged attacks. Illiterate conduct players can get a monster to read the [[scroll of earth]], then stand on a scroll of scare monster and confuse themselves, using a cursed [[unicorn horn]] if they did not start with a spell to forget.\n\nAt this point, the only threat left is the potential of [[sickness]]; the chance of dying to terminal illness can be almost completely removed by [[polymorph]]ing into a [[ghoul]] to gain [[sickness resistance]] beforehand, or applying a preferably-blessed unicorn horn to cure it. Unattended copy-paste farming is only possible if you confuse yourself with an expired spell or are [[amulet of unchanging|permanently a ghoul]]; setting <code>[[option#menustyle|menustyle=traditional]]</code> in your config file can make the paste script execute the spellcasting faster.\n\n===Death farming===\nThis is only borderline scumming, as any character capable of doing it is more than capable of ascending. The goal might be to gain large numbers of exotic items to ascend with, to gain billions of points, or (most commonly) to impress onlookers.\n\n# [[Eating jewelry|Eat]] [[ring of increase damage|rings of increase damage]] until you have a high enough intrinsic damage bonus to kill [[Death (monster)|Death]] in one hit (+60 should work).\n# Clear the [[Astral plane]] of all distractions.\n# Increase your [[polearm]] proficiency to skilled.\n# Trap [[Riders|Death]] in a corner on the Astral plane, like so:\n\n<div class=\"ttyscreen\"><replacecharsblock rules=\"ttymap\">\n&={{msl|Death}}\nj={{msl|blue jelly}}\n@=[[You|{{white|@}}]]\n`=[[boulder|{{gray|`}}]]\n\n----\n|&j.\n|j`@\n|jj.\n</replacecharsblock></div>\n\nIn this example, Death is trapped between [[blue jelly|blue jellies]] and a [[boulder]]. He cannot move, but you can hit him with a polearm while he is in line of sight. Once he's dead (in one hit), attempt to push the boulder over his corpse. This will revive him. You can then repeat the procedure. You can work out the exact sequence of key strokes used in a complete cycle of this process (in this case, for example, \"aahy.jyk\"), and copy this line a few thousand times in a text editor, then paste the whole lot into the NetHack interface.\n\nThe result will be many thousand death-dropped items and a very high score. If the number of death-dropped items exceeds 32,767 on the same square, the game will probably crash,<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/3f97bcf24f034605/5f51813967ab27a8?q=#5f51813967ab27a8 RGRN thread: [BUG] menucolors patch segfaults]</ref> so periodically checking Death's square and redistributing the items (possibly by teleporting them away, or polymorphing them together) is necessary. This is because the number of items present on a [[square]] is stored in a [[signed variable|signed short]] when the items are listed.\n\nThis method no longer works as of 3.6.0, because Riders can [[displace]] other monsters; thus, the jelly fort will not work to contain Death. It is still possible to kill Death (or other Riders) arbitrarily many times, but not with this method of automation. Additionally, revived monsters give diminishing experience points and score, down to {{frac|64}} of the base value, which means that it will take much longer to achieve billions of points.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{nethack-367}}\n[[Category:Farming|*]]"}

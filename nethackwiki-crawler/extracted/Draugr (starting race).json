[Zombies](/wiki/Zombie_\\(EvilHack\\) \"Zombie (EvilHack)\") are considered to be of the same race for purposes of cannibalism and same-race sacrifice.\n\nDraugr characters have an extra bite attack that occurs 1⁄4 of the time when attacking in melee, and is the same brain-eating attack used by zombie monsters: a monster that is bitten and does not have immunity to sickness will die several turns afterward, with compatible monsters reanimating as the corresponding zombies; draugr also gain a small amount of [nutrition](/wiki/Nutrition \"Nutrition\") from eating brains this way, and will not use the attack against hazardous targets such as [cockatrices](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") and [black dragons](/wiki/Black_dragon \"Black dragon\"). As undead, draugr regenerate [hit points](/wiki/Hit_point \"Hit point\") as normal while in the [Valley of the Dead](/wiki/Valley_of_the_Dead \"Valley of the Dead\"), and also possess a form of reanimation that [revives](/wiki/Revive \"Revive\") them at least once when they are killed - the amount of times this will occur per game is random, with a maximum of three revivals, and this value is not displayed to the player.\n\nHowever, the undead nature of player draugr also has several disadvantages: a draugr's base movement speed is 10, and they cannot obtain intrinsic [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\"), nor can they learn or cast [spells](/wiki/Spell \"Spell\"); reading [spellbooks](/wiki/Spellbook \"Spellbook\") will only result in the draugr becoming confused, though they can still read [scrolls](/wiki/Scroll \"Scroll\"). Draugr characters that are not Infidels always start with -10 [alignment record](/wiki/Alignment_record \"Alignment record\"), and they cannot tame [domestic animals](/wiki/Domestic_animal \"Domestic animal\") with treats (though they are pacified as normal). [Shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper \"Shopkeeper\") will ban draugr from entering their [shops](/wiki/Shop \"Shop\"), and [aligned priests](/wiki/Aligned_priest \"Aligned priest\") that are not co-aligned will become hostile the moment they see a draugr, as will any members of the [watch](/wiki/Watch \"Watch\") - however, draugr characters actually gain alignment record for killing angered watch members.\n\nThe [amulet of life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\") does not work for draugr since they are undead, and their reanimating ability also includes its own limits: they cannot reanimate if they are vaporized by [Sunsword](/wiki/Sunsword \"Sunsword\") or the [Hammer of the Gods](/wiki/Hammer_of_the_Gods \"Hammer of the Gods\"), which are more likely to land critical hits on draugr; [beheading](/wiki/Beheading \"Beheading\"), [disintegration](/wiki/Disintegration \"Disintegration\") or [stoning](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\") will prevent them from reviving as well; and finally, draugr characters will not leave behind a [ghost](/wiki/Ghost \"Ghost\") or a [corpse](/wiki/Corpse \"Corpse\") in [bones](/wiki/Bones \"Bones\") if they die and fail to revive. The undead nature of draugr also prevents them from eating anything other than meaty or fleshy corpses, [eggs](/wiki/Egg \"Egg\") and the brains of living monsters: thankfully, they can remain in a state of hunger much longer than other races, and they also enjoy tainted or rotten meat. This also means that draugr do not have cannibalism penalties, and draugr Monks will also not incur penalties to alignment record for eating meat.\n\nDraugr have a [luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\")-based chance of taming hostile zombies if they #[chat](/wiki/Chat \"Chat\") to them, and undead monsters that are not [unique](/wiki/Unique \"Unique\") have a chance of generating as peaceful; they also cannot be scared by [ghosts](/wiki/Ghost \"Ghost\"), and they cannot be made [brainless](/wiki/Brainless \"Brainless\") by brain-eating attacks. Non-player draugr can appear as [player monsters](/wiki/Player_monster_\\(EvilHack\\) \"Player monster (EvilHack)\") in the same roles as draugr characters, but cannot generate as shopkeepers or aligned priests, and draugr in player monster roles that have spellcasting attacks will instead have the poisonous claw attack and brain-eating bite attack used by zombies. Draugr Infidels that are [crowned](/wiki/Crowned \"Crowned\") will not have the [fire](/wiki/Fire \"Fire\") [object property](/wiki/Object_property \"Object property\") applied to their wielded weapon, and are instead gifted [Angelslayer](/wiki/Angelslayer \"Angelslayer\") if it has not yet been generated.\n\n#### Attribute caps\n\n| Character [Race](/wiki/Race \"Race\") | [Strength](/wiki/Strength \"Strength\") | [Dexterity](/wiki/Dexterity \"Dexterity\") | [Constitution](/wiki/Constitution \"Constitution\") | [Intelligence](/wiki/Intelligence \"Intelligence\") | [Wisdom](/wiki/Wisdom \"Wisdom\") | [Charisma](/wiki/Charisma \"Charisma\") |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| Draugr                              | 20                                    | 18                                       | 20                                                | 6                                                 | 8                               | 6                                     |\n\nDraugr have the second-best strength and constitution caps in EvilHack after [giants](/wiki/Giant_\\(starting_race\\) \"Giant (starting race)\"), with a bonus to [carrying capacity](/wiki/Carrying_capacity \"Carrying capacity\"), and their dexterity is comparable to that of the vanilla *NetHack* races, except for [dwarves](/wiki/Dwarf_\\(starting_race\\) \"Dwarf (starting race)\"). As undead, draugr also have mental stat caps well below that of any playable race.\n\n#### Price adjustments\n\nThe following price adjustments are used for draugr interactions with [racial](/wiki/Racial_monster \"Racial monster\") shopkeepers:\n\n|          | Shopkeeper's race |     |       |     |                                                            |          |         |                                                          |       |\n| -------- | ----------------- | --- | ----- | --- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |\n|          | Human/Other       | Elf | Dwarf | Orc | Gnome                                                      | Illithid | Centaur | Nymph                                                    | Giant |\n| Illithid | ×20               | ×20 | ×20   | ×20 | ×3⁄2 if [INT](/wiki/Int \"Int\") is ≤14 ×4⁄3 if INT is 15-17 | ×20      | ×20     | ×4⁄3 if [CHA](/wiki/Cha \"Cha\") is ≥15 ×5⁄3 if CHA is <15 | ×20   |\n\nShopkeepers will refuse to do business with draugr characters and ban them from their shops, but a draugr that can make their way into a shop can buy and sell items at the above rates.\n\n### Starting equipment\n\nAs draugr can only eat fleshy or meaty food and cannot learn or cast spells, many of their starting food items are replaced with eggs: this only applies to [food rations](/wiki/Food_ration \"Food ration\") and [fortune cookies](/wiki/Fortune_cookie \"Fortune cookie\") in practice, and draugr Knights will still start with [apples](/wiki/Apple \"Apple\") and [carrots](/wiki/Carrot \"Carrot\") since they are intended for their starting steed. Draugr will not have any form of spellcasting skill, and draugr in roles that normally start with [spellbooks](/wiki/Spellbook \"Spellbook\") will not receive them; this also applies to player monster draugr in casting roles.\n\n## Strategy\n\n- *To be written.*\n\n## Origin\n\n[![Wikipedia](/images/thumb/f/f8/Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png/50px-Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png)](/wiki/File:Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png \"Wikipedia\")\n\n[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page \"wikipedia:Main Page\") has an article about:\n\n***[Draugr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draugr \"wikipedia:Draugr\")***\n\nThe draugr (Old Norse, plural \"draugar\"), or draug in modern spellings, is an undead creature from the Scandinavian saga literature and folktales: the term has also been extended by commentators to refer to the undead in medieval literature, even if never explicitly referred to as such in the text; the latter type of undead is designated as a *haugbúi* (\"barrow-dweller\") or an *aptrganga* (Icelandic *afturganga*, literally \"again-walker\"). Draugar are said to live in their graves or royal palaces, often guarding treasures in their burial mound. They are a form of revenant, or animated corpse, and are referred to as \"barrow-wights\" in the 1869 translation of Grettis saga, long before [J. R. R. Tolkien](/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien \"J. R. R. Tolkien\") employed this term in his novels; \"barrow-wight\" is actually a rendering of *haugbúinn* (literally 'howe-dweller'), otherwise translated as \"barrow-dweller\".\n\nDraugar usually possessed superhuman strength and were hideous to look at, with a necrotic black or blue color and a \"reek of decay\" that originated either from them or from the haunts that they inhabited. They were greedy and possessed an immense and nearly insatiable appetite, and would attack shepherds and livestock; draugar were also innately envious of the living due to a longing for the possessions of their former life, which led them to viciously attack would-be grave-robbers. Unlike the draugr of EvilHack, folkloric draugar are also noted to have numerous magical abilities, such as shape-shifting, controlling the weather, and seeing into the future; some could enter the dreams of others, lay curses upon victims or sink into the ground, while others were even immune to weaponry with the exception of iron.\n\nTraditions assert that any mean, nasty or greedy person can become a draugr, as well as any person killed by one - a corpse found standing upright or in a sitting position was likely to return as a draugr; breaking this posture was a necessary step in permanently getting rid of a draugr (though this carried the risk of being inflicted with the evil eye), and decapitation was a recurring method of preventing further hauntings. The draug of more recent Scandinavian folklore is portrayed as a supernatural being that occurs in legends along the fishing-heavy coasts of Norway, and was often the ghost of a dead fisherman who had drifted at sea and had not been buried in Christian soil. This draug wears a leather jacket or oilskin clothes, but has a seaweed vase for a head, and sailed in a half-boat with blocked sails that acted as a death omen for those who saw him.\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\"/>\n<title>Draugr (starting race) - NetHack

Draugar are said to live in their graves or royal palaces, often guarding treasures in their burial mound. They are a form of revenant, or animated corpse, and are referred to as \"barrow-wights\" in the 1869 translation of Grettis saga, long before <a href=\"/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"J. R. R. Tolkien\">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> employed this term in his novels; \"barrow-wight\" is actually a rendering of <i>haugbúinn</i> (literally 'howe-dweller'), otherwise translated as \"barrow-dweller\".\n</p><p>Draugar usually possessed superhuman strength and were hideous to look at, with a necrotic black or blue color and a \"reek of decay\" that originated either from them or from the haunts that they inhabited. They were greedy and possessed an immense and nearly insatiable appetite, and would attack shepherds and livestock; draugar were also innately envious of the living due to a longing for the possessions of their former life, which led them to viciously attack would-be grave-robbers. Unlike the draugr of EvilHack, folkloric draugar are also noted to have numerous magical abilities, such as shape-shifting, controlling the weather, and seeing into the future; some could enter the dreams of others, lay curses upon victims or sink into the ground, while others were even immune to weaponry with the exception of iron.\n</p><p>Traditions assert that any mean, nasty or greedy person can become a draugr, as well as any person killed by one - a corpse found standing upright or in a sitting position was likely to return as a draugr; breaking this posture was a necessary step in permanently getting rid of a draugr (though this carried the risk of being inflicted with the evil eye), and decapitation was a recurring method of preventing further hauntings. The draug of more recent Scandinavian folklore is portrayed as a supernatural being that occurs in legends along the fishing-heavy coasts of Norway, and was often the ghost of a dead fisherman who had drifted at sea and had not been buried in Christian soil. This draug wears a leather jacket or oilskin clothes, but has a seaweed vase for a head, and sailed in a half-boat with blocked sails that acted as a death omen for those who saw him.\n</p>\n<!--

monster in SpliceHack and Hack'EM|Draugr (SpliceHack)}}\nThe '''draugr''' is a playable race of monster that appears in [[EvilHack]].\n\n==Description==\nFirst introduced in version 0.8.4, draugr are a playable form of [[Zombie (monster class)|zombie]]: they are [[undead]] beings with superhuman strength and the ability to reanimate, and while they are not completely mindless, the nature of their undead state limits their mental capabilities and deprives them of the ability to wield magic.\n\nDraugr are a [[chaotic]] race, and can be played as a [[Barbarian]], [[Convict]], [[Infidel]], [[Knight]], [[Monk]], or [[Rogue]].\n\n===Racial benefits and restrictions===\nDraugr characters are [[breathless]] and start with [[infravision]] and [[aggravate monster]], as well as innate [[poison resistance]], [[sleep resistance]], [[cold resistance]], [[death resistance]], [[drain resistance]], and [[immunity to sickness]]. [[Zombie (EvilHack)|Zombies]] are considered to be of the same race for purposes of cannibalism and same-race sacrifice.\n\nDraugr characters have an extra bite attack that occurs {{frac|4}} of the time when attacking in melee, and is the same brain-eating attack used by zombie monsters: a monster that is bitten and does not have immunity to sickness will die several turns afterward, with compatible monsters reanimating as the corresponding zombies; draugr also gain a small amount of [[nutrition]] from eating brains this way, and will not use the attack against hazardous targets such as [[cockatrice]]s and [[black dragon]]s. As undead, draugr regenerate [[hit point]]s as normal while in the [[Valley of the Dead]], and also possess a form of reanimation that [[revive]]s them at least once when they are killed - the amount of times this will occur per game is random, with a maximum of three revivals, and this value is not displayed to the player.\n\nHowever, the undead nature of player draugr also has several disadvantages: a draugr's base movement speed is 10, and they cannot obtain intrinsic [[telepathy]], nor can they learn or cast [[spell]]s; reading [[spellbook]]s will only result in the draugr becoming confused, though they can still read [[scroll]]s. Draugr characters that are not Infidels always start with -10 [[alignment record]], and they cannot tame [[domestic animal]]s with treats (though they are pacified as normal). [[Shopkeeper]]s will ban draugr from entering their [[shop]]s, and [[aligned priest]]s that are not co-aligned will become hostile the moment they see a draugr, as will any members of the [[watch]] - however, draugr characters actually gain alignment record for killing angered watch members.\n\nThe [[amulet of life saving]] does not work for draugr since they are undead, and their reanimating ability also includes its own limits: they cannot reanimate if they are vaporized by [[Sunsword]] or the [[Hammer of the Gods]], which are more likely to land critical hits on draugr; [[beheading]], [[disintegration]] or [[stoning]] will prevent them from reviving as well; and finally, draugr characters will not leave behind a [[ghost]] or a [[corpse]] in [[bones]] if they die and fail to revive. The undead nature of draugr also prevents them from eating anything other than meaty or fleshy corpses, [[egg]]s and the brains of living monsters: thankfully, they can remain in a state of hunger much longer than other races, and they also enjoy tainted or rotten meat. This also means that draugr do not have cannibalism penalties, and draugr Monks will also not incur penalties to alignment record for eating meat.\n\nDraugr have a [[luck]]-based chance of taming hostile zombies if they #[[chat]] to them, and undead monsters that are not [[unique]] have a chance of generating as peaceful; they also cannot be scared by [[ghost]]s, and they cannot be made [[brainless]] by brain-eating attacks. Non-player draugr can appear as [[Player monster (EvilHack)|player monsters]] in the same roles as draugr characters, but cannot generate as shopkeepers or aligned priests, and draugr in player monster roles that have spellcasting attacks will instead have the poisonous claw attack and brain-eating bite attack used by zombies. Draugr Infidels that are [[crowned]] will not have the [[fire]] [[object property]] applied to their wielded weapon, and are instead gifted [[Angelslayer]] if it has not yet been generated.\n\n====Attribute caps====\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n!| Character<br>[[Race]]\n!| [[Strength]]\n!| [[Dexterity]]\n!| [[Constitution]]\n!| [[Intelligence]]\n!| [[Wisdom]]\n!| [[Charisma]]\n|-\n|| Draugr || 20 || 18 || 20 || 6 || 8 || 6\n|}\n\nDraugr have the second-best strength and constitution caps in EvilHack after [[Giant (starting race)|giants]], with a bonus to [[carrying capacity]], and their dexterity is comparable to that of the vanilla ''NetHack'' races, except for [[Dwarf (starting race)|dwarves]]. As undead, draugr also have mental stat caps well below that of any playable race.\n\n====Price adjustments====\nThe following price adjustments are used for draugr interactions with [[Racial monster|racial]] shopkeepers:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\"| !! colspan=\"9\"|Shopkeeper's race\n|-\n!

Draugr will not have any form of spellcasting skill, and draugr in roles that normally start with [[spellbook]]s will not receive them; this also applies to player monster draugr in casting roles.\n\n==Strategy==\n:''To be written.''\n\n==Origin==\n{{wikipedia|Draugr}}\nThe draugr (Old Norse, plural \"draugar\"), or draug in modern spellings, is an undead creature from the Scandinavian saga literature and folktales: the term has also been extended by commentators to refer to the undead in medieval literature, even if never explicitly referred to as such in the text; the latter type of undead is designated as a ''haugbúi'' (\"barrow-dweller\") or an ''aptrganga'' (Icelandic ''afturganga'', literally \"again-walker\"). Draugar are said to live in their graves or royal palaces, often guarding treasures in their burial mound. They are a form of revenant, or animated corpse, and are referred to as \"barrow-wights\" in the 1869 translation of Grettis saga, long before [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] employed this term in his novels; \"barrow-wight\" is actually a rendering of ''haugbúinn'' (literally 'howe-dweller'), otherwise translated as \"barrow-dweller\".\n\nDraugar usually possessed superhuman strength and were hideous to look at, with a necrotic black or blue color and a \"reek of decay\" that originated either from them or from the haunts that they inhabited. They were greedy and possessed an immense and nearly insatiable appetite, and would attack shepherds and livestock; draugar were also innately envious of the living due to a longing for the possessions of their former life, which led them to viciously attack would-be grave-robbers. Unlike the draugr of EvilHack, folkloric draugar are also noted to have numerous magical abilities, such as shape-shifting, controlling the weather, and seeing into the future; some could enter the dreams of others, lay curses upon victims or sink into the ground, while others were even immune to weaponry with the exception of iron.\n\nTraditions assert that any mean, nasty or greedy person can become a draugr, as well as any person killed by one - a corpse found standing upright or in a sitting position was likely to return as a draugr; breaking this posture was a necessary step in permanently getting rid of a draugr (though this carried the risk of being inflicted with the evil eye), and decapitation was a recurring method of preventing further hauntings. The draug of more recent Scandinavian folklore is portrayed as a supernatural being that occurs in legends along the fishing-heavy coasts of Norway, and was often the ghost of a dead fisherman who had drifted at sea and had not been buried in Christian soil. This draug wears a leather jacket or oilskin clothes, but has a seaweed vase for a head, and sailed in a half-boat with blocked sails that acted as a death omen for those who saw him.\n<!--{{variant-36x}}-->\n[[Category:EvilHack races]]"}

It is also a damage type, **`AD_BLND`**, used for the attacks of a few monsters.\n\nThe [zen](/wiki/Zen \"Zen\") [conduct](/wiki/Conduct \"Conduct\") consists of playing the entire game with a permanently blind hero.\n\n## Description\n\nA hero or monster that is blind cannot see for the duration of the property - messages describing actions such as monster-versus-monster-combat that you cannot see are omitted or else significantly altered.\n\nIntrinsic blindness, i.e. blindness that is not the result of a worn or wielded item or a lack of sight or [eyes](/wiki/Eyes \"Eyes\"), is defined as \"blinded\" in [youprop.h](/wiki/Youprop.h \"Youprop.h\").[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1) The game records the number of turns that a hero is blinded. The following attacks have the `AD_BLND` damage type:\n\n- The claw attack of a [raven](/wiki/Raven \"Raven\")\n- The [explosion attack](/wiki/Explosion_attack \"Explosion attack\") of a [yellow light](/wiki/Yellow_light \"Yellow light\")\n- The [gaze attack](/wiki/Gaze_attack \"Gaze attack\") of an [Archon](/wiki/Archon \"Archon\")\n\nIn addition to being hit by any of these attacks, the following circumstances and items can result in a hero being blinded:\n\n- [Quaffing](/wiki/Quaff \"Quaff\") a [potion of blindness](/wiki/Potion_of_blindness \"Potion of blindness\"), being hit by a [thrown](/wiki/Thrown \"Thrown\") potion of blindness or inhaling [vapors](/wiki/Vapors \"Vapors\") from a broken potion of blindness\n- Having a [ray](/wiki/Ray \"Ray\") of [lightning](/wiki/Lightning \"Lightning\") pass through their square\n- [Engraving](/wiki/Engraving \"Engraving\") with a [wand of lightning](/wiki/Wand_of_lightning \"Wand of lightning\")\n- [Applying](/wiki/Apply \"Apply\") a [wand of light](/wiki/Wand_of_light \"Wand of light\")\n- Applying an [expensive camera](/wiki/Expensive_camera \"Expensive camera\") and selecting the hero via [.](/wiki/Dot \"Dot\")\n- Being hit by the [blind](/wiki/Blind_\\(monster_spell\\) \"Blind (monster spell)\") or [lightning](/wiki/Lightning_\\(monster_spell\\) \"Lightning (monster spell)\") [monster spells](/wiki/Monster_spell \"Monster spell\")[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2)[\\[3\\]](#cite_note-3)\n- The monster-summoning effect of a [magic trap](/wiki/Magic_trap \"Magic trap\")\n- The blinding effect of [sitting](/wiki/Sitting \"Sitting\") on a [throne](/wiki/Throne \"Throne\")\n- Applying a cursed [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\")[\\[4\\]](#cite_note-4)\n- The effect of [eating](/wiki/Eating \"Eating\") [rotten food](/wiki/Rotten_food \"Rotten food\"), with a 3⁄16\n- One of the failure effects of reading a difficult [spellbook](/wiki/Spellbook \"Spellbook\")\n- Being inside a [poison cloud](/wiki/Poison_cloud \"Poison cloud\") while not [breathless](/wiki/Breathless \"Breathless\"), [nonliving](/wiki/Nonliving \"Nonliving\") or [invulnerable](/wiki/Invulnerable \"Invulnerable\")[\\[5\\]](#cite_note-5)\n\nA hero that cannot currently see due to their form or a worn item is defined as \"blind\" in youprop.h.[\\[6\\]](#cite_note-6) This form of blindness is considered separate from the above, and is \"permanent\" in that it will persist until the source of the blindness is removed. Blindness of this type occurs from the following sources:\n\n- [Putting on](/wiki/Putting_on \"Putting on\") a [blindfold](/wiki/Blindfold \"Blindfold\") or [towel](/wiki/Towel \"Towel\")\n- [Polymorphing](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") into a monster with no eyes\n\n[Blindness resistance](/wiki/Blindness_resistance \"Blindness resistance\") blocks light-based sources of blindness, and being blinded will prevent blinding from most other sources, with exceptions including the potion of blindness. A blind hero cannot use gaze attacks, and is unaffected by gaze attacks that require the target to see its user.\n\n### Creamed\n\nBeing \"creamed\" is a subset of blindness that results from a substance over the hero's eyes physically restricting their vision.[\\[7\\]](#cite_note-7) The game records the number of turns that a hero is creamed.\n\nSources of creaming increment the number of turns that the hero is creamed and blinded by the same amount, so its duration is always less than or equal to the number of turns that the hero is blinded - this also means that the \"creamed\" status will always time out first, e.g. a hero that is blinded for 100 turns, and 50 turns later becomes creamed for a duration of 20 turns, will be blinded for a total of 70 more turns; during the *first* 20 of those turns, they are considered creamed.\n\nThe following actions can result in a hero being creamed:\n\n- Being hit by a thrown or wielded [cream pie](/wiki/Cream_pie \"Cream pie\"), or applying a cream pie\n- Being hit by [blinding venom](/wiki/Blinding_venom \"Blinding venom\")\n- Applying a cursed [towel](/wiki/Towel \"Towel\")\n\n### Blind from birth\n\n- *Main article: [Zen](/wiki/Zen \"Zen\")*\n\nPlaying a zen hero via the `blind` [option](/wiki/Options#blind \"Options\") makes them \"blind from birth\". This blindness persists across any forms that the hero polymorphs into and cannot be cured, though wearing [The Eyes of the Overworld](/wiki/The_Eyes_of_the_Overworld \"The Eyes of the Overworld\") cures its effects and breaks the conduct - for more details on the effects of [astral vision](/wiki/Astral_vision \"Astral vision\") on blindness, see the section on [Astral vision](#Astral_vision).\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([3.7.0](/wiki/3.7.0 \"3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nWearing The Eyes of the Overworld does not remove zen-blindness - it will still suppress its effects while worn, but taking them off will leave a zen hero blind again.\n\n### Blind monsters\n\nMonster blindness is handled differently from a hero's blindness.\n\nMonsters that have eyes can be blinded by most of the above means if they have eyes. A monster without eyes is intrinsically blind, and cannot be blinded by other means.\n\nA blind monster will move and attack erratically, and suffers a [to-hit](/wiki/To-hit \"To-hit\") penalty. Blinded monsters do not respect [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") if they would have normally, and cannot use any [gaze attacks](/wiki/Gaze_attack \"Gaze attack\") they possess.\n\n### Blind movement\n\nWhen a blind hero is moving normally, or else using [near look](/wiki/Near_look \"Near look\") via [:](/wiki/Colon \"Colon\") or picking up items via [,](/wiki/, \",\"), they will automatically use their [hands](/wiki/Hands \"Hands\") to feel for items on the ground. Touching the [corpse](/wiki/Corpse \"Corpse\") of a [cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") or [chickatrice](/wiki/Chickatrice \"Chickatrice\") this way will [petrify](/wiki/Petrify \"Petrify\") the hero unless they are wearing [gloves](/wiki/Gloves \"Gloves\"). Safe-moving via [m](/wiki/M \"M\") will ignore objects on the ground.\n\nA blind hero moving onto a seemingly empty square with a monster on it will show the monster as I, anger them if they were [peaceful](/wiki/Peaceful \"Peaceful\"), and use up a move without attacking even while safe-moving via [m](/wiki/M \"M\").[\\[8\\]](#cite_note-8) Moving into a square with an I or warning symbol will cause the hero to automatically attack in that square's direction - safe-moving via [m](/wiki/M \"M\") will function as normal if a monster is occupying the square, or move into the square normally if it is empty. A blind hero safe-moving with [m](/wiki/M \"M\") into an unseen footrice without wielding anything or wearing gloves will turn to stone as well, unless the footrice's position is marked by the [warning](/wiki/Warning \"Warning\") property.\n\nIt is still possible for a hero to sense their surroundings through other means while blind:\n\n- [Searching](/wiki/Searching \"Searching\") manually via [s](/wiki/S \"S\") will use a move and attempt to reveal the location of adjacent, unseen monsters if there are any nearby - monsters detected this way have the square they occupied *at the time of searching* marked with a I. If searching this way does not detect a new unseen monster, it will reveal all squares adjacent to the hero, clearing any existing invisible monster markers on squares where none are present.\n- A hero that has intrinsic or extrinsic [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\") can detect all non-[mindless](/wiki/Mindless \"Mindless\") monsters on the level while blind, and interactions with these monsters are handled normally, both for normal movement and safe-moving via [m](/wiki/M \"M\").\n- [Monster detection](/wiki/Monster_detection \"Monster detection\") granted via a blessed [potion of monster detection](/wiki/Potion_of_monster_detection \"Potion of monster detection\"), or from casting the [detect monsters](/wiki/Spellbook_of_detect_monsters \"Spellbook of detect monsters\") spell at Skilled or higher, lets the hero track all monsters on the level for the duration of the effect, and those monsters are handled normally for purposes of movement.\n- Movement involving monsters highlighted via warning functions as normal, since it does not rely on the hero's sight.\n\n### Blindness and items\n\nWhile blind, most unidentified objects are described only by [object class](/wiki/Object_class \"Object class\") (e.g. \"a [potion](/wiki/Potion \"Potion\")\", \"a [ring](/wiki/Ring \"Ring\")\", \"a [long sword](/wiki/Long_sword \"Long sword\")\" etc.), including [artifacts](/wiki/Artifact \"Artifact\") - only [amulets](/wiki/Amulet \"Amulet\") and [comestibles](/wiki/Comestibles \"Comestibles\") are treated as \"seen\" while blind. A blind hero will always know the appearance of [eggs](/wiki/Egg \"Egg\") that they lay, and a hero that starts the game blind (i.e. from birth) will know the appearance of their starting inventory, as well as that of their [pet](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\") (which in practice only applies to zen [Knights](/wiki/Knight \"Knight\")).[\\[9\\]](#cite_note-9)[\\[10\\]](#cite_note-10)[\\[11\\]](#cite_note-11)\n\n[Poisoning](/wiki/Poison \"Poison\") and [erosion](/wiki/Erosion \"Erosion\") status of weapons are still shown if the hero becomes blind, and erode-proofing and charges are only shown if formally identified, even if it was erode-proofed while blind. Any [dilution](/wiki/Dilution \"Dilution\") in potions is only displayed if the hero knows that potion's appearance. A blind hero that [polymorphs](/wiki/Polypile \"Polypile\") any known object, or else fully dilutes known potions or performs [alchemy](/wiki/Alchemy \"Alchemy\") with them, will render them unseen.\n\nA blind hero cannot [name](/wiki/Name \"Name\") the object class of unidentified objects, and any individual names will not be displayed (though they will affect [stacking](/wiki/Stack \"Stack\") and [naming artifacts](/wiki/Naming_artifacts \"Naming artifacts\")). Blind heroes can still hear monsters reading the label of a [scroll](/wiki/Scroll \"Scroll\") or quaffing a [potion](/wiki/Potion \"Potion\"), but will not [auto-identify](/wiki/Auto-identify \"Auto-identify\") them since they cannot see the result.\n\nBuying or selling something directly at a [shop](/wiki/Shop \"Shop\") while blind will have the shopkeeper identify its appearance unless the item is in a container, and this is naturally not applied to merchandise that was [stolen](/wiki/Stealing_from_shops \"Stealing from shops\") or covered by a hero's [credit](/wiki/Credit \"Credit\") if they leave without paying.[\\[12\\]](#cite_note-12)\n\nIf a blind hero attacking with [Vorpal Blade](/wiki/Vorpal_Blade \"Vorpal Blade\") or [The Tsurugi of Muramasa](/wiki/The_Tsurugi_of_Muramasa \"The Tsurugi of Muramasa\") causes the [beheading](/wiki/Beheading \"Beheading\") or [bisection](/wiki/Bisection \"Bisection\") special attack to trigger, the artifact's appearance will be revealed.[\\[13\\]](#cite_note-13)[\\[14\\]](#cite_note-14)[\\[15\\]](#cite_note-15)[\\[16\\]](#cite_note-16) Eating one of a [stack](/wiki/Stack \"Stack\") of [tins](/wiki/Tin \"Tin\") while blind will identify the contents of remaining tins in that stack.\n\n## Curing blindness\n\n\"Creamed\" blindness can be cured by using the #[wipe](/wiki/Wipe \"Wipe\") [extended command](/wiki/Extended_command \"Extended command\"), applying a non-cursed towel or praying successfully.\n\nTemporary blindness that is not from the hero's current form, a worn item, being \"creamed\", or the hero being born blind can be removed with the following actions:\n\n- Apply a non-cursed [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\")[\\[17\\]](#cite_note-17)\n- [Invoke](/wiki/Invoke \"Invoke\") [The Staff of Aesculapius](/wiki/The_Staff_of_Aesculapius \"The Staff of Aesculapius\")\n- Eat a [carrot](/wiki/Carrot \"Carrot\")\n- Cast a spell of [cure blindness](/wiki/Spellbook_of_cure_blindness \"Spellbook of cure blindness\") or [extra healing](/wiki/Spellbook_of_extra_healing \"Spellbook of extra healing\")\n- Drink a non-cursed [potion of healing](/wiki/Potion_of_healing \"Potion of healing\"), any [potion of extra healing](/wiki/Potion_of_extra_healing \"Potion of extra healing\"), or any [potion of full healing](/wiki/Potion_of_full_healing \"Potion of full healing\")\n- [Pray](/wiki/Pray \"Pray\") successfully - this form of blindness is considered a minor trouble\n\nIf the hero is blind due to a worn towel or blindfold and it is not cursed, they can simply remove it - a cursed blindfold or towel will require [uncursing](/wiki/Curse_removal \"Curse removal\") in order to remove, and is considered a major trouble for prayer purposes. A hero that is polymorphed into an eyeless form and not blinded from any other source will regain sight upon changing into a form with eyes (including returning to normal form).\n\n### Astral vision\n\n- *Main article: [Astral vision](/wiki/Astral_vision \"Astral vision\")*\n\nWhile astral vision does **not** cure blindness on its own, but The Eyes of the Overworld both grants the properties and suppresses blinding effects, allowing the hero to see in spite of it - they can view and interact with monsters in the sight radius as normal, and items seen within that radius are treated as though the hero had seen and handled them personally. As temporary blindness is still applied even while suppressed, it will time out as normal with different messages.\n\n## Strategy\n\nBlindness can be fairly debilitating in the early stages of the game, especially if a magic trap blinds the hero and hems them in with several hostiles - while many forms of blindness that obstruct a hero are usually temporary, waiting them out can be dangerous without an alternate means to view the hero's surroundings. This typically makes [floating eyes](/wiki/Floating_eye \"Floating eye\") a priority target for the telepathy their corpses grant - fortunately, a hero that can temporarily blind themselves \"at will\" can also handle floating eyes very easily, and gaining the intrinsic early on and keeping backup sources on-hand make being blinded very manageable\n\nUnicorn horns are among the most accessible cures for blindness for any character: being blinded unexpectedly becomes a short and manageable nuisance at most, as long as the horn is kept non-cursed.\n\n### Navigating while blind\n\nKeeping still to wait out temporary blindness is not always feasible, but moving while blind requires significant care, due to the massive amount of complications introduced:\n\n- Nearby peacefuls and pets may end up hit if you attack blindly, since you cannot see if they stepped into any square previously occupied by a hostile (or worse, killed the hostile themselves in the pet's case) - being blinded in [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\") or a [shop](/wiki/Shop \"Shop\") can result in a swift and unceremonious death at the hands of a [shopkeeper](/wiki/Shopkeeper \"Shopkeeper\") or the [Watch](/wiki/Watch \"Watch\").\n- Allowing hostile monsters to attack the blinded character first is incredibly risky - even if you attack the specific square you were hit from, the monster may have be fast enough to move away after attacking; at best, this results in a wasted turn attacking the I where they previously were.\n- Levels with cockatrices have a long-term threat of [instadeath](/wiki/Instadeath \"Instadeath\"): if one is killed and leaves a corpse, touching it without gloves while feeling around for objects will immediately render the hero a [statue](/wiki/Statue \"Statue\").\n- The [bloodthirsty](/wiki/Bloodthirsty \"Bloodthirsty\") [Stormbringer](/wiki/Stormbringer \"Stormbringer\") is made even more dangerous to wield than usual.\n\nSearching to reveal inhabited squares and then safe-moving into them with [m](/wiki/M \"M\") is generally recommended: the game also prints different messages for safe-moving depending on if you moved into a peaceful/tame monster (\"Pardon me, \\<foo>.\") or a hostile one (\"You move right into \\<foo>.\"), regardless of if the hero is blind. A [stethoscope](/wiki/Stethoscope \"Stethoscope\") can be applied for free once per turn to determine if something is in your path and it is unsafe to move there - in rare cases, [chatting](/wiki/Chatting \"Chatting\") is also useful to test for non-silent monsters, since it does not use a turn if you get no answer.\n\nTelepathy and warning are the best properties to have in case you are blinded, since warning complements telepathy by revealing the positions of most mindless monsters - while even these properties combined will not reveal all possible monsters, the few mindless monsters that are not revealed by warning are generally not a threat at most points where you have access to both. (Further corner cases stem from [hiders](/wiki/Hide \"Hide\"), [mimics](/wiki/Mimic \"Mimic\"), Stormbringer, [F](/wiki/F \"F\"), and deactivating [safe\\_pet](/wiki/Safe_pet \"Safe pet\").)\n\nReading a [scroll of magic mapping](/wiki/Scroll_of_magic_mapping \"Scroll of magic mapping\") whose label or identity is known, or else casting the [magic mapping](/wiki/Spellbook_of_magic_mapping \"Spellbook of magic mapping\") spell, will reveal the layout of the entire level, which can be a time saver and even a life-saver in some circumstances.\n\n### Avoiding blindness\n\n- *For the property that blocks blindness from certain sources, see [blindness resistance](/wiki/Blindness_resistance \"Blindness resistance\").*\n\nOn top of the listed means of [curing blindness](#Blindness_and_items), there are also ways to prevent some or all sources of blindness:\n\n- Wielding [Sunsword](/wiki/Sunsword \"Sunsword\") protects the wielder from light-based sources of blindness, including yellow lights, magic traps, and wands of lightning.[\\[18\\]](#cite_note-18)\n- Wearing a blindfold or towel can protect from blinding gazes and some other sources, such as blinding attacks - it will not prevent blindness from quaffed or thrown potions, however.\n- As explained above, astral vision granted from The Eyes of the Overworld circumvents blindness.\n\n### Discovering objects\n\nIn addition to the listed forms of [identifying items while blind](#Blindness_and_items) above, there are other methods to identify objects while blind which are non-exhaustively listed below:\n\n- Formally [identifying](/wiki/Identify \"Identify\") objects via the [scroll of identify](/wiki/Scroll_of_identify \"Scroll of identify\") or [spell of identify](/wiki/Spell_of_identify \"Spell of identify\") will reveal all relevant information about them.\n- A blessed [potion of object detection](/wiki/Potion_of_object_detection \"Potion of object detection\") reveals the appearance of all objects on the current dungeon level as if the hero had personally handled them, recursively including the contents of [containers](/wiki/Container \"Container\").[\\[19\\]](#cite_note-19)\n- [Zapping](/wiki/Zapping \"Zapping\") a [wand of probing](/wiki/Wand_of_probing \"Wand of probing\") will grant non-recursive knowledge of any objects in the direction it is zapped at, including the contents of containers and the inventory and identity of any monsters in its path at the time, and a hero that zaps it at themselves can see their inventory.[\\[20\\]](#cite_note-20)[\\[21\\]](#cite_note-21)[\\[22\\]](#cite_note-22)\n- [Dipping](/wiki/Dipping \"Dipping\") items in [holy water](/wiki/Holy_water \"Holy water\") and/or [unholy water](/wiki/Unholy_water \"Unholy water\") when blind will reveal their beatitude.\n- Your [quest leader](/wiki/Quest_leader \"Quest leader\") will identify your own [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\") and the real [Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor \"Amulet of Yendor\") for you.[\\[23\\]](#cite_note-23)[\\[24\\]](#cite_note-24)[\\[25\\]](#cite_note-25) Additionally, the [crowning](/wiki/Crowning \"Crowning\") gift you would receive if neutral or chaotic is made \"seen\" if you are already holding it.\n\n### Zen strategy\n\n- *Main article: [Zen](/wiki/Zen \"Zen\")*\n\nPlaying a permanently blind hero requires much of the above considerations and details, as well as special knowledge and considerations that are more specific to the conduct.\n\n## History\n\nBlindness as a status property exists in Hack 1.21 and Hack for PDP-11, which are based on [Jay Fenlason's Hack](/wiki/Jay_Fenlason%27s_Hack \"Jay Fenlason's Hack\"), and also appears in [Hack 1.0](/wiki/Hack_1.0 \"Hack 1.0\").\n\n## Messages\n\n- Wait! There's something there you can't see!\n\n  You moved onto a seemingly empty square. This does not attack whatever was on that square, but does anger them if they were peaceful.\n\n## References\n\n1.

As temporary blindness is still applied even while suppressed, it will time out as normal with different messages.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Strategy\">Strategy</span></h2>\n<p>Blindness can be fairly debilitating in the early stages of the game, especially if a magic trap blinds the hero and hems them in with several hostiles - while many forms of blindness that obstruct a hero are usually temporary, waiting them out can be dangerous without an alternate means to view the hero's surroundings. This typically makes <a href=\"/wiki/Floating_eye\" title=\"Floating eye\">floating eyes</a> a priority target for the telepathy their corpses grant - fortunately, a hero that can temporarily blind themselves \"at will\" can also handle floating eyes very easily, and gaining the intrinsic early on and keeping backup sources on-hand make being blinded very manageable\n</p><p>Unicorn horns are among the most accessible cures for blindness for any character: being blinded unexpectedly becomes a short and manageable nuisance at most, as long as the horn is kept non-cursed.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Navigating_while_blind\">Navigating while blind</span></h3>\n<p>Keeping still to wait out temporary blindness is not always feasible, but moving while blind requires significant care, due to the massive amount of complications introduced:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Nearby peacefuls and pets may end up hit if you attack blindly, since you cannot see if they stepped into any square previously occupied by a hostile (or worse, killed the hostile themselves in the pet's case) - being blinded in <a href=\"/wiki/Minetown\" title=\"Minetown\">Minetown</a> or a <a href=\"/wiki/Shop\" title=\"Shop\">shop</a> can result in a swift and unceremonious death at the hands of a <a href=\"/wiki/Shopkeeper\" title=\"Shopkeeper\">shopkeeper</a> or the <a href=\"/wiki/Watch\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Watch\">Watch</a>.</li>\n<li>Allowing hostile monsters to attack the blinded character first is incredibly risky - even if you attack the specific square you were hit from, the monster may have be fast enough to move away after attacking; at best, this results in a wasted turn attacking the <span class=\"nhsym clr-white\">I</span> where they previously were.</li>\n<li>Levels with cockatrices have a long-term threat of <a href=\"/wiki/Instadeath\" title=\"Instadeath\">instadeath</a>: if one is killed and leaves a corpse, touching it without gloves while feeling around for objects will immediately render the hero a <a href=\"/wiki/Statue\" title=\"Statue\">statue</a>.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/wiki/Bloodthirsty\" title=\"Bloodthirsty\">bloodthirsty</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Stormbringer\" title=\"Stormbringer\">Stormbringer</a> is made even more dangerous to wield than usual.</li></ul>\n<p>Searching to reveal inhabited squares and then safe-moving into them with <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/M\" title=\"M\">m</a></span></span> is generally recommended: the game also prints different messages for safe-moving depending on if you moved into a peaceful/tame monster (\"Pardon me, &lt;foo&gt;.\") or a hostile one (\"You move right into &lt;foo&gt;.\"), regardless of if the hero is blind. A <a href=\"/wiki/Stethoscope\" title=\"Stethoscope\">stethoscope</a> can be applied for free once per turn to determine if something is in your path and it is unsafe to move there - in rare cases, <a href=\"/wiki/Chatting\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chatting\">chatting</a> is also useful to test for non-silent monsters, since it does not use a turn if you get no answer.\n</p><p>Telepathy and warning are the best properties to have in case you are blinded, since warning complements telepathy by revealing the positions of most mindless monsters - while even these properties combined will not reveal all possible monsters, the few mindless monsters that are not revealed by warning are generally not a threat at most points where you have access to both.

is a property that appears in ''[[NetHack]]'', and blocks the sight of a [[hero]] or [[monster]]. It is also a damage type, '''<tt>AD_BLND</tt>''', used for the attacks of a few monsters.\n\nThe [[zen]] [[conduct]] consists of playing the entire game with a permanently blind hero.\n\n==Description==\nA hero or monster that is blind cannot see for the duration of the property - messages describing actions such as monster-versus-monster-combat that you cannot see are omitted or else significantly altered.\n\nIntrinsic blindness, i.e. blindness that is not the result of a worn or wielded item or a lack of sight or [[eyes]], is defined as \"blinded\" in [[youprop.h]].{{refsrc|include/youprop.h|85|version=NetHack 3.6.7}} The game records the number of turns that a hero is blinded. The following attacks have the <tt>AD_BLND</tt> damage type:\n\n* The claw attack of a [[raven]]\n* The [[explosion attack]] of a [[yellow light]]\n* The [[gaze attack]] of an [[Archon]]\n\nIn addition to being hit by any of these attacks, the following circumstances and items can result in a hero being blinded:\n\n* [[Quaff]]ing a [[potion of blindness]], being hit by a [[thrown]] potion of blindness or inhaling [[vapors]] from a broken potion of blindness\n* Having a [[ray]] of [[lightning]] pass through their square\n* [[Engraving]] with a [[wand of lightning]]\n* [[Apply]]ing a [[wand of light]]\n* Applying an [[expensive camera]] and selecting the hero via {{kbd|.}}\n* Being hit by the [[Blind (monster spell)|blind]] or [[Lightning (monster spell)|lightning]] [[monster spell]]s{{refsrc|src/mcastu.c|576|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}{{refsrc|src/mcastu.c|663|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}\n* The monster-summoning effect of a [[magic trap]]\n* The blinding effect of [[sitting]] on a [[throne]]\n* Applying a cursed [[unicorn horn]]{{refsrc|src/apply.c|1929|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}\n* The effect of [[eating]] [[rotten food]], with a {{frac|3|16}}\n* One of the failure effects of reading a difficult [[spellbook]]\n* Being inside a [[poison cloud]] while not [[breathless]], [[nonliving]] or [[invulnerable]]{{refsrc|src/region.c|975|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}\n\nA hero that cannot currently see due to their form or a worn item is defined as \"blind\" in youprop.h.{{refsrc|include/youprop.h|88|version=NetHack 3.6.7}} This form of blindness is considered separate from the above, and is \"permanent\" in that it will persist until the source of the blindness is removed. Blindness of this type occurs from the following sources:\n\n* [[Putting on]] a [[blindfold]] or [[towel]]\n* [[Polymorph]]ing into a monster with no eyes\n\n[[Blindness resistance]] blocks light-based sources of blindness, and being blinded will prevent blinding from most other sources, with exceptions including the potion of blindness. A blind hero cannot use gaze attacks, and is unaffected by gaze attacks that require the target to see its user.\n\n===Creamed===\nBeing \"creamed\" is a subset of blindness that results from a substance over the hero's eyes physically restricting their vision.{{refsrc|include/you.h|331|version=NetHack 3.6.7}} The game records the number of turns that a hero is creamed.\n\nSources of creaming increment the number of turns that the hero is creamed and blinded by the same amount, so its duration is always less than or equal to the number of turns that the hero is blinded - this also means that the \"creamed\" status will always time out first, e.g. a hero that is blinded for 100 turns, and 50 turns later becomes creamed for a duration of 20 turns, will be blinded for a total of 70 more turns; during the ''first'' 20 of those turns, they are considered creamed.\n\nThe following actions can result in a hero being creamed:\n\n* Being hit by a thrown or wielded [[cream pie]], or applying a cream pie\n* Being hit by [[blinding venom]]\n* Applying a cursed [[towel]]\n\n===Blind from birth===\n{{main|Zen}}\nPlaying a zen hero via the <tt>blind</tt> [[Options#blind|option]] makes them \"blind from birth\". This blindness persists across any forms that the hero polymorphs into and cannot be cured, though wearing [[The Eyes of the Overworld]] cures its effects and breaks the conduct - for more details on the effects of [[astral vision]] on blindness, see the section on {{sa|Astral vision}}.\n\n{{upcoming|3.7.0|Wearing The Eyes of the Overworld does not remove zen-blindness - it will still suppress its effects while worn, but taking them off will leave a zen hero blind again.}}\n\n===Blind monsters===\nMonster blindness is handled differently from a hero's blindness.\n\nMonsters that have eyes can be blinded by most of the above means if they have eyes. A monster without eyes is intrinsically blind, and cannot be blinded by other means.\n\nA blind monster will move and attack erratically, and suffers a [[to-hit]] penalty. Blinded monsters do not respect [[Elbereth]] if they would have normally, and cannot use any [[gaze attack]]s they possess.\n\n===Blind movement===\nWhen a blind hero is moving normally, or else using [[near look]] via {{kbd|:}} or picking up items via {{kbd|,}}, they will automatically use their [[hands]] to feel for items on the ground. Touching the [[corpse]] of a [[cockatrice]] or [[chickatrice]] this way will [[petrify]] the hero unless they are wearing [[gloves]]. Safe-moving via {{kbd|m}} will ignore objects on the ground.\n\nA blind hero moving onto a seemingly empty square with a monster on it will show the monster as {{white|I}}, anger them if they were [[peaceful]], and use up a move without attacking even while safe-moving via {{kbd|m}}.{{refsrc|src/uhitm.c|143|version=NetHack 3.6.7}} Moving into a square with an {{white|I}} or warning symbol will cause the hero to automatically attack in that square's direction - safe-moving via {{kbd|m}} will function as normal if a monster is occupying the square, or move into the square normally if it is empty. A blind hero safe-moving with {{kbd|m}} into an unseen footrice without wielding anything or wearing gloves will turn to stone as well, unless the footrice's position is marked by the [[warning]] property.\n\nIt is still possible for a hero to sense their surroundings through other means while blind:\n\n* [[Searching]] manually via {{kbd|s}} will use a move and attempt to reveal the location of adjacent, unseen monsters if there are any nearby - monsters detected this way have the square they occupied ''at the time of searching'' marked with a {{white|I}}. If searching this way does not detect a new unseen monster, it will reveal all squares adjacent to the hero, clearing any existing invisible monster markers on squares where none are present.\n* A hero that has intrinsic or extrinsic [[telepathy]] can detect all non-[[mindless]] monsters on the level while blind, and interactions with these monsters are handled normally, both for normal movement and safe-moving via {{kbd|m}}.\n* [[Monster detection]] granted via a blessed [[potion of monster detection]], or from casting the {{spell of|detect monsters}} spell at Skilled or higher, lets the hero track all monsters on the level for the duration of the effect, and those monsters are handled normally for purposes of movement.\n* Movement involving monsters highlighted via warning functions as normal, since it does not rely on the hero's sight.\n\n===Blindness and items===\nWhile blind, most unidentified objects are described only by [[object class]] (e.g. \"a [[potion]]\", \"a [[ring]]\", \"a [[long sword]]\" etc.), including [[artifact]]s - only [[amulet]]s and [[comestibles]] are treated as \"seen\" while blind. A blind hero will always know the appearance of [[egg]]s that they lay, and a hero that starts the game blind (i.e. from birth) will know the appearance of their starting inventory, as well as that of their [[pet]] (which in practice only applies to zen [[Knight]]s).{{refsrc|src/sit.c|319|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|1082|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}{{refsrc|src/dog.c|192|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}\n\n[[Poison]]ing and [[erosion]] status of weapons are still shown if the hero becomes blind, and erode-proofing and charges are only shown if formally identified, even if it was erode-proofed while blind. Any [[dilution]] in potions is only displayed if the hero knows that potion's appearance. A blind hero that [[Polypile|polymorphs]] any known object, or else fully dilutes known potions or performs [[alchemy]] with them, will render them unseen.\n\nA blind hero cannot [[name]] the object class of unidentified objects, and any individual names will not be displayed (though they will affect [[stack]]ing and [[naming artifacts]]). Blind heroes can still hear monsters reading the label of a [[scroll]] or quaffing a [[potion]], but will not [[auto-identify]] them since they cannot see the result.\n\nBuying or selling something directly at a [[shop]] while blind will have the shopkeeper identify its appearance unless the item is in a container, and this is naturally not applied to merchandise that was [[stealing from shops|stolen]] or covered by a hero's [[credit]] if they leave without paying.{{refsrc|src/shk.c|2562|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}\n\nIf a blind hero attacking with [[Vorpal Blade]] or [[The Tsurugi of Muramasa]] causes the [[beheading]] or [[bisection]] special attack to trigger, the artifact's appearance will be revealed.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1275|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1292|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1322|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1338|version=NetHack 3.6.7}} Eating one of a [[stack]] of [[tin]]s while blind will identify the contents of remaining tins in that stack.\n\n==Curing blindness==\n\"Creamed\" blindness can be cured by using the #[[wipe]] [[extended command]], applying a non-cursed towel or praying successfully.\n\nTemporary blindness that is not from the hero's current form, a worn item, being \"creamed\", or the hero being born blind can be removed with the following actions:\n\n* Apply a non-cursed [[unicorn horn]]{{refsrc|src/apply.c|2043|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}\n* [[Invoke]] [[The Staff of Aesculapius]]\n* Eat a [[carrot]]\n* Cast a spell of {{spell of|cure blindness}} or {{spell of|extra healing}}\n* Drink a non-cursed [[potion of healing]], any [[potion of extra healing]], or any [[potion of full healing]]\n* [[Pray]] successfully - this form of blindness is considered a minor trouble\n\nIf the hero is blind due to a worn towel or blindfold and it is not cursed, they can simply remove it - a cursed blindfold or towel will require [[Curse removal|uncursing]] in order to remove, and is considered a major trouble for prayer purposes. A hero that is polymorphed into an eyeless form and not blinded from any other source will regain sight upon changing into a form with eyes (including returning to normal form).\n\n===Astral vision===\n{{main|Astral vision}}\nWhile astral vision does '''not''' cure blindness on its own, but The Eyes of the Overworld both grants the properties and suppresses blinding effects, allowing the hero to see in spite of it - they can view and interact with monsters in the sight radius as normal, and items seen within that radius are treated as though the hero had seen and handled them personally. As temporary blindness is still applied even while suppressed, it will time out as normal with different messages.\n\n==Strategy==\nBlindness can be fairly debilitating in the early stages of the game, especially if a magic trap blinds the hero and hems them in with several hostiles - while many forms of blindness that obstruct a hero are usually temporary, waiting them out can be dangerous without an alternate means to view the hero's surroundings. This typically makes [[floating eye]]s a priority target for the telepathy their corpses grant - fortunately, a hero that can temporarily blind themselves \"at will\" can also handle floating eyes very easily, and gaining the intrinsic early on and keeping backup sources on-hand make being blinded very manageable\n\nUnicorn horns are among the most accessible cures for blindness for any character: being blinded unexpectedly becomes a short and manageable nuisance at most, as long as the horn is kept non-cursed.\n\n===Navigating while blind===\nKeeping still to wait out temporary blindness is not always feasible, but moving while blind requires significant care, due to the massive amount of complications introduced:\n\n* Nearby peacefuls and pets may end up hit if you attack blindly, since you cannot see if they stepped into any square previously occupied by a hostile (or worse, killed the hostile themselves in the pet's case) - being blinded in [[Minetown]] or a [[shop]] can result in a swift and unceremonious death at the hands of a [[shopkeeper]] or the [[Watch]].\n* Allowing hostile monsters to attack the blinded character first is incredibly risky - even if you attack the specific square you were hit from, the monster may have be fast enough to move away after attacking; at best, this results in a wasted turn attacking the {{white|I}} where they previously were.\n* Levels with cockatrices have a long-term threat of [[instadeath]]: if one is killed and leaves a corpse, touching it without gloves while feeling around for objects will immediately render the hero a [[statue]].\n* The [[bloodthirsty]] [[Stormbringer]] is made even more dangerous to wield than usual. \n\nSearching to reveal inhabited squares and then safe-moving into them with {{kbd|m}} is generally recommended: the game also prints different messages for safe-moving depending on if you moved into a peaceful/tame monster (\"Pardon me, <foo>.\") or a hostile one (\"You move right into <foo>.\"), regardless of if the hero is blind. A [[stethoscope]] can be applied for free once per turn to determine if something is in your path and it is unsafe to move there - in rare cases, [[chatting]] is also useful to test for non-silent monsters, since it does not use a turn if you get no answer.\n\nTelepathy and warning are the best properties to have in case you are blinded, since warning complements telepathy by revealing the positions of most mindless monsters - while even these properties combined will not reveal all possible monsters, the few mindless monsters that are not revealed by warning are generally not a threat at most points where you have access to both. (Further corner cases stem from [[hide]]rs, [[mimic]]s, Stormbringer, {{kbd|F}}, and deactivating [[safe_pet]].)\n\nReading a [[scroll of magic mapping]] whose label or identity is known, or else casting the {{spell of|magic mapping}} spell, will reveal the layout of the entire level, which can be a time saver and even a life-saver in some circumstances.\n\n===Avoiding blindness===\n{{for|the property that blocks blindness from certain sources|blindness resistance}}\nOn top of the listed means of {{sa|Blindness and items|curing blindness}}, there are also ways to prevent some or all sources of blindness:\n\n* Wielding [[Sunsword]] protects the wielder from light-based sources of blindness, including yellow lights, magic traps, and wands of lightning.{{refsrc|src/mondata.c|146|nethack=3.6.7}}\n* Wearing a blindfold or towel can protect from blinding gazes and some other sources, such as blinding attacks - it will not prevent blindness from quaffed or thrown potions, however.\n* As explained above, astral vision granted from The Eyes of the Overworld circumvents blindness.\n\n===Discovering objects===\nIn addition to the listed forms of {{sa|Blindness and items|identifying items while blind}} above, there are other methods to identify objects while blind which are non-exhaustively listed below:\n\n* Formally [[identify]]ing objects via the [[scroll of identify]] or [[spell of identify]] will reveal all relevant information about them.\n* A blessed [[potion of object detection]] reveals the appearance of all objects on the current dungeon level as if the hero had personally handled them, recursively including the contents of [[container]]s.{{refsrc|src/detect.c|582|comment=<tt>object_detect</tt>|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}\n* [[Zapping]] a [[wand of probing]] will grant non-recursive knowledge of any objects in the direction it is zapped at, including the contents of containers and the inventory and identity of any monsters in its path at the time, and a hero that zaps it at themselves can see their inventory.{{refsrc|src/zap.c|496|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}{{refsrc|src/zap.c|1922|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}{{refsrc|src/zap.c|2964|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}\n* [[Dipping]] items in [[holy water]] and/or [[unholy water]] when blind will reveal their beatitude.\n* Your [[quest leader]] will identify your own [[quest artifact]] and the real [[Amulet of Yendor]] for you.{{refsrc|src/quest.c|123|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}{{refsrc|src/quest.c|227|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}{{refsrc|src/quest.c|241|version=NetHack 3.6.7}} Additionally, the [[crowning]] gift you would receive if neutral or chaotic is made \"seen\" if you are already holding it. \n\n===Zen strategy===\n{{main|Zen}}\nPlaying a permanently blind hero requires much of the above considerations and details, as well as special knowledge and considerations that are more specific to the conduct.\n\n==History==\nBlindness as a status property exists in Hack 1.21 and Hack for PDP-11, which are based on [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]], and also appears in [[Hack 1.0]].\n\n==Messages==\n{{message|Wait! There's something there you can't see!|You moved onto a seemingly empty square. This does not attack whatever was on that square, but does anger them if they were peaceful.}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{nethack-367}}\n[[Category:Properties]]\n[[Category:Monster damage types]]"}

{"title":"SlashTHEM roles","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/SlashTHEM_roles","type":"markdown","data":"In [SlashTHEM](/wiki/SlashTHEM \"SlashTHEM\"), [you](/wiki/You \"You\") can play as 42 roles: 13 from [vanilla](/wiki/Vanilla \"Vanilla\"), 5 from [SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\"), 9 from [NetHack--](/wiki/NetHack-- \"NetHack--\"), and 15 others from [SLEX](/wiki/SLEX \"SLEX\") or single [patches](/wiki/Patch \"Patch\").\n\n[Acid Mages](/wiki/Acid_Mage \"Acid Mage\") are the acid-based counterpart of flame/ice/electric mages. They specialize in acid spells, and both they and their starting [acid hound](/wiki/Acid_hound \"Acid hound\") pup are acid resistant. Starting with a [wand of acid](/wiki/Wand_of_acid \"Wand of acid\"), they can blast nasty enemies but unlike flame/electric mages cannot burn permanent [Elbereths](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\"), making them a bit harder to play.\n\n[Archeologists](/wiki/Archeologist \"Archeologist\") now start with a spellbook and two scrolls. They have the advantage of gaining access to [Itlachiayaque](/wiki/Itlachiayaque \"Itlachiayaque\") as their sacrifice gift, a useful defensive artifact.\n\n[Barbarians](/wiki/Barbarian \"Barbarian\") have their usual strong starting physical stats and intrinsic [poison resistance](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\"), making their early game easier than most. However, Barbarians are charged three times as much money in shops, which pairs poorly with their low starting [charisma](/wiki/Charisma \"Charisma\"). Unfortunately, their guaranteed sacrifice gift [Cleaver](/wiki/Cleaver \"Cleaver\") is a bit underwhelming past the early/mid-game, so Barbarians will want to aim for stronger weapons eventually.\n\n[Bards](/wiki/Bard \"Bard\") are a hard role with very weak starting equipment. Their lack of a starting weapon is a problem that should be corrected by finding a suitable weapon ASAP, and their wooden/tin instruments won't be of much use either. When leveling up, bards gain certain [spellbooks](/wiki/Spellbooks \"Spellbooks\") that can come in handy.\n\n[Cavemen/Cavewomen](/wiki/Caveman \"Caveman\") will have a straightforward early game if they can get their hands on [Skullcrusher](/wiki/Skullcrusher \"Skullcrusher\").\n\n[Chefs](/wiki/Chef \"Chef\") have permanent [food appraisal](/wiki/Food_appraisal \"Food appraisal\") and gain fire and poison resistance when they level up. However, their starting knife won't likely take them very far, and they suffer from a lack of decent weapon skills. Their skill scales as the game goes on due to their powerful artifact weapon options from sacrifice and their quest artifact, [The Deluxe Yendorian Knife](/index.php?title=The_Deluxe_Yendorian_Knife\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"The Deluxe Yendorian Knife (page does not exist)\").\n\n[Convicts](/wiki/Convict \"Convict\") are a harder-than-hard role that starts with a [heavy iron ball](/wiki/Heavy_iron_ball \"Heavy iron ball\") [chained](/wiki/Chain \"Chain\") to the player, a [cursed](/wiki/Cursed \"Cursed\") [striped shirt](/wiki/Striped_shirt \"Striped shirt\") and negative [alignment](/wiki/Alignment \"Alignment\") and [luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\"). Races that would usually be peaceful will be hostile to the Convict. Shopkeepers who see their striped shirt will not allow them into their shop, and [watchmen](/wiki/Watchmen \"Watchmen\") as well as [vault guards](/wiki/Vault_guard \"Vault guard\") will attack them on sight.\n\n[Corsairs](/wiki/Korsair \"Korsair\") don't particularly excel at anything but don't suffer from serious drawbacks either; their starting equipment includes an [oilskin sack](/wiki/Oilskin_sack \"Oilskin sack\") as well as a good stack of daggers.\n\n[Divers](/wiki/Diver \"Diver\") don't particularly excel at anything but don't suffer from serious drawbacks either; their starting equipment includes an [oilskin cloak](/wiki/Oilskin_cloak \"Oilskin cloak\") and a [can of grease](/wiki/Can_of_grease \"Can of grease\"), along with some spears and a [trident](/wiki/Trident \"Trident\").\n\n[Drunks](/wiki/Drunk \"Drunk\") benefit from quaffing [booze](/wiki/Booze \"Booze\") and can always make more, but they also start with a large stack of random potions that may be [full healing](/wiki/Full_healing \"Full healing\") or other useful types. Other than that they get nothing special, and their starting weapon is particularly crappy, so they'll need to luck into finding good equipment or they'll have a hard time.\n\n[Electric Mages](/wiki/Electric_Mage \"Electric Mage\") are the lightning-based counterpart of flame/ice/acid mages. They specialize in shock spells, and both they and their starting [shock hound pup](/wiki/Shock_hound_pup \"Shock hound pup\") are shock resistant. Starting with a [wand of lightning](/wiki/Wand_of_lightning \"Wand of lightning\"), they can easily survive the early game by burning a permanent [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") in critical situations.\n\n[Firefighters](/wiki/Firefighter \"Firefighter\") should be relatively safe early on due to their wand of fire which can burn [Elbereths](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\"). Their starting stack of water is just waiting for an altar that allows converting it to [holy water](/wiki/Holy_water \"Holy water\"), so either a dip into [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\") or an early altar conversion are early targets. The Firefighter's starting axe is not the strongest weapon but they can advance a large variety of other weapon skills.\n\n[Flame Mages](/wiki/Flame_Mage \"Flame Mage\") start with a [hell hound pup](/wiki/Hell_hound_pup \"Hell hound pup\") and a [wand of fire](/wiki/Wand_of_fire \"Wand of fire\") but are otherwise weaker than a [Wizard](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\").\n\n[Geeks](/wiki/Graduate \"Graduate\") were renamed from the previous role Graduate. They start with wacky equipment and may have a difficult time getting off the ground. However, their starting [sharpened pencil](/wiki/Sharpened_pencil \"Sharpened pencil\") can be used to engrave without dulling, and the [expensive camera](/wiki/Expensive_camera \"Expensive camera\") can be a useful utility item.\n\n[Gladiators](/wiki/Gladiator \"Gladiator\") starting equipment includes a [shield of reflection](/wiki/Shield_of_reflection \"Shield of reflection\") and a [silver spear](/wiki/Silver_spear \"Silver spear\"), both of which are strong items if they can complement them with items found in the dungeon early on.\n\n[Hackers](/wiki/Geek \"Geek\") were renamed from the previous role [Geek](/wiki/Geek \"Geek\"). They have a unique starting inventory that can be quite powerful if used correctly. Their [electric sword](/wiki/Electric_sword \"Electric sword\") is one of the best one-handed weapons in the game, which can sometimes even apply additional shock damage against monsters. Their [ICs](/wiki/IC \"IC\") can be sold for a solid amount of money, that can either be used for purchasing additional items in shops or buying [protection](/wiki/Protection \"Protection\"). Their [potion of Jolt Cola](/wiki/Potion_of_Jolt_Cola \"Potion of Jolt Cola\"), when blessed, has a small chance of increasing their level and can give a slight boost to their maximum hitpoints. Their [Hacker's Foods](/wiki/Hacker%27s_Food \"Hacker's Food\") also prevent them from starving too easily.\n\n[Healers](/wiki/Healer \"Healer\") now start with a [wand of healing](/wiki/Wand_of_healing \"Wand of healing\") and [medical kit](/wiki/Medical_kit \"Medical kit\") in exchange for giving up the [spellbook of extra healing](/wiki/Spellbook_of_extra_healing \"Spellbook of extra healing\"). Their sacrifice gift, [Mirrorbright](/wiki/Mirrorbright \"Mirrorbright\"), adds to their defensive prowess - but this still leaves Healers with the same dependence on obtaining a powerful artifact weapon that can deal adequate damage to complement this.\n\n[Ice Mages](/wiki/Ice_Mage \"Ice Mage\") start with a [winter wolf](/wiki/Winter_wolf \"Winter wolf\") but are weaker than [Wizards](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\") and likely [Flame Mages](/wiki/Flame_Mage \"Flame Mage\") due to not having the wand of fire that can burn [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\").\n\n[Jedi](/wiki/Jedi \"Jedi\") use [lightsabers](/wiki/Lightsaber \"Lightsaber\") and have techniques to recharge them, move objects from a distance and do [jumps](/wiki/Jump \"Jump\"). They can't get proficient at most other types of weapons though, and they either run out of lightsaber energy often or have to use a turn every time a monster shows up to turn their saber back on.\n\n[Knights](/wiki/Knight \"Knight\") start with -3 AC worth of heavy armor, helping out their early game significantly. They also start with many more apples and carrots, allowing them to keep their pet horse fed much more easily. Praying for minions is an effective strategy for knights, and is a viable consideration at almost every phase of the game.\n\n[Locksmiths](/wiki/Locksmith \"Locksmith\") start the game with no weapon and only a lowly [dagger](/wiki/Dagger \"Dagger\"), and their (un)locking tools and wands won't help much in an actual combat situation, so they need to turn up useful equipment quickly or they won't stand a chance. They're likely to have to rely on their starting pet for quite some time and engrave [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") often.\n\n[Lunatics](/wiki/Lunatic \"Lunatic\") are a role-specific version of the [Lycanthrope](/wiki/Lycanthrope \"Lycanthrope\") race. The player either has to find a way to control their random transformations or accept not always being able to wear/wield armor and weapons.\n\n[Monks](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\") have a strong early game assisted by their sacrifice gift, the [Gauntlets of Defense](/wiki/Gauntlets_of_Defense \"Gauntlets of Defense\"). Coupled with tactical usage of their assorted techniques - such as the [chained blitz](/wiki/Chained_blitz \"Chained blitz\") that deals massive damage when used correctly - monks are one of the strongest roles.\n\n[Musicians](/wiki/Musician \"Musician\") can use their [magic harp](/wiki/Magic_harp \"Magic harp\") to turn dangerous monsters into powerful allies, and their other instruments (including a [drum of earthquake](/wiki/Drum_of_earthquake \"Drum of earthquake\")) may also be useful at times. They don't start with an actual weapon though, so they should try to find one quickly. If they manage to get surrounded by several strong monsters and tame them all at once with their harp they may be quite able to survive the early game.\n\n[Necromancers](/wiki/Necromancer \"Necromancer\") are glass cannons, having a similar starting inventory and stats to a wizard, with the added benefit of detecting the beatitude of items like a [Priest](/wiki/Priest \"Priest\"). Their power scales as the game progresses, with their sacrifice gift [Serpent's Tongue](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Tongue \"Serpent's Tongue\") being an endgame-caliber weapon. Their quest artifact, [The Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa](/wiki/The_Great_Dagger_of_Glaurgnaa \"The Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa\"), is a nice boon, providing rare slotless [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\") and the ability to [invoke](/wiki/Invoke \"Invoke\") for an energy boost. Moreover, their starting [sickness resistance](/wiki/Sickness_resistance \"Sickness resistance\") and [drain resistance](/wiki/Drain_resistance \"Drain resistance\") pay increasing dividends as the game progresses.\n\n[Ninja/Kunoichi](/wiki/Ninja_\\(role\\) \"Ninja (role)\") are similar to [Rogues](/wiki/Rogue \"Rogue\") but with considerably worse starting items, so their early game won't exactly be easy. They get some various useful intrinsics from leveling up though.\n\n[Noblemen/Noblewomen](/wiki/Noble \"Noble\") are a melee role that mainly uses one-handed weapons. They start with a saddled [pony](/wiki/Pony \"Pony\"), but their hit points and mana aren't great, making them hard to play.\n\n[Officers](/wiki/Officer \"Officer\") start with a [pistol](/wiki/Pistol \"Pistol\") and some useful wands, doubled by their starting pet that starts with the same items and immediately drops them on their first turn. This allows the Officer to dual-wield pistols from the start and gun down any dangerous enemies with the downside of doing poor melee damage. Still, it's probably better than whacking enemies with a club that doesn't do any meaningful damage either, and may allow the Officer to survive long enough to find another useful weapon. Dual-wielding with a pistol in main hand and a strong melee weapon (e.g. silver saber) in the other hand enables the player to do well in both melee and ranged combat without having to switch weapons.\n\n[Paladins](/wiki/Paladin_\\(role\\) \"Paladin (role)\") are basically enhanced knights who also get undead warning and demon warning, but their code of conduct is much harsher, giving larger penalties than the knight conduct. However, the paladin's starting equipment is also better than the knight's, and they have a higher chance of successfully casting difficult spells.\n\n[Pirates](/wiki/Pirate \"Pirate\") specialize in one-handed weapons and [firearms](/wiki/Firearms \"Firearms\") and have the ability to [swim](/wiki/Swim \"Swim\"). However, their hit point and mana totals are usually underwhelming, making them hard to play.\n\n[Priests/Priestesses](/wiki/Priest \"Priest\") have not changed significantly, and their early game suffers slightly due to the variety of early-game threats added. Their sacrifice gift [Disrupter](/wiki/Disrupter \"Disrupter\") has solid situational use, but is of limited use against said early-game monsters. However, it is a great boon against the many strong undead spellcasters both new and returning, and as such is worth keeping and enchanting in order to overcome enchantment resistances.\n\n[Rangers](/wiki/Ranger \"Ranger\") are largely unchanged, with their sacrifice gift being a decent improvement on their starting dagger and bow. However, SlashTHEM encourages rangers to use ranged weapons as their primary offense, with higher bonuses to multishot. As a result, retaining the starting stack of arrows is more important, and obtaining holy water and the [Mine's End](/wiki/Mine%27s_End \"Mine's End\") luckstone are early priorities.\n\n[Rogues](/wiki/Rogue \"Rogue\")' first priority is almost certainly sacrificing for the uber-strong [Bat from Hell](/wiki/Bat_from_Hell \"Bat from Hell\"). Once obtained, pretty much the only thing that can take out a Rogue in the early/middle game is hubris. Rogues are even better equipped to steal money, now with scrolls of gold detection and teleportation suited for plundering [vaults](/wiki/Vault \"Vault\") in addition to their oilskin sack to steal items and money from shops.\n\n[Samurai](/wiki/Samurai \"Samurai\") have the option to go either for [Kiku-ichimonji](/wiki/Kiku-ichimonji \"Kiku-ichimonji\") or [Excalibur](/wiki/Excalibur \"Excalibur\") if lawful. Both of these weapons have a strong additional damage bonus making them strong choices, on top of Excalibur's important [drain resistance](/wiki/Drain_resistance \"Drain resistance\").\n\n[Tourists](/wiki/Tourist \"Tourist\") have access to [Whisperfeet](/wiki/Whisperfeet \"Whisperfeet\"), but are still quite fragile. Like in vanilla, their power does not scale as much until later in the game once they can obtain the [Platinum Yendorian Express Card](/wiki/Platinum_Yendorian_Express_Card \"Platinum Yendorian Express Card\") and the [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\"). [Doppelgangers](/wiki/Doppelgangers \"Doppelgangers\") can make up for the weak starting stats and equipment with careful use of polyforms.\n\n[Undead Slayers](/wiki/Undead_Slayer \"Undead Slayer\") are slow, weak fighters whose main advantages ([drain resistance](/wiki/Drain_resistance \"Drain resistance\") and [sickness resistance](/wiki/Sickness_resistance \"Sickness resistance\")) are less important in the early game than the late game.\n\n[Undertakers](/wiki/Undertaker \"Undertaker\") begin the game with a pitiful [scalpel](/wiki/Scalpel \"Scalpel\") that should be ditched for a real melee weapon, and they can [turn undead](/wiki/Turn_undead \"Turn undead\") both by using the technique and zapping the [wand of undead turning](/wiki/Wand_of_undead_turning \"Wand of undead turning\"), so they may be able to resurrect a fallen pet. Unless they luck into good equipment, they'll probably need to use pets in order to survive the early game.\n\n[Valkyries](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\") are strong fighters as always, exchanging their long sword for a [spear](/wiki/Spear \"Spear\"), and their +3 small shield is still one of the most powerful starting pieces of armor for any role. Their sacrifice gift, [Mjollnir](/wiki/Mjollnir \"Mjollnir\"), remains extremely powerful and deals almost twice as much electric damage on average. While the Valkyrie quest artifact, the [Orb of Fate](/wiki/Orb_of_Fate \"Orb of Fate\"), is somewhat overshadowed by the lighter [Hand of Vecna](/wiki/The_Hand_of_Vecna_\\(SLASH%27EM\\) \"The Hand of Vecna (SLASH'EM)\"), it still has useful properties such as [half spell damage](/wiki/Half_spell_damage \"Half spell damage\") and [levelporting](/wiki/Levelport \"Levelport\") capability.\n\n[Warriors](/wiki/Warrior \"Warrior\") are great at using melee weapons and good at ranged combat too, but they can't learn any spellcasting skills. The warrior starts with a nice set of armor and weapons, giving them a straightforward early game. Their main difficulty is beating the [Quest](/wiki/Quest \"Quest\"), thanks to their [nemesis](/wiki/Nemesis \"Nemesis\") basically being a buffed Master Kaen.\n\n[Wizards](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\") now start with four spellbooks, but have a much harder time than in vanilla. Even after obtaining [Magicbane](/wiki/Magicbane \"Magicbane\"), they are fragile especially with the addition of difficult early threats. What's more, wizards will likely find themselves strapped for item slots for extrinsics.\n\n[Yeomen](/wiki/Yeomen \"Yeomen\") are intrinsically slow, but have access to two extremely powerful guaranteed sacrifice gifts: [Sword of Justice](/wiki/Sword_of_Justice \"Sword of Justice\") and [Reaper](/wiki/Reaper \"Reaper\").\n\n[Zookeepers](/wiki/Zookeeper \"Zookeeper\") start with three blessed scrolls of taming, allowing them to turn dangerous monsters into pets. They also get tripe rations and leashes which further aids them in gaining and maintaining pets, but their taming scrolls will only last so long. The player should make the most out of them. Confusion may allow the scrolls to tame a much bigger amount of monsters, turning them against the ones that resist. Zookeepers will want to find better armor and weapons if they want to survive early on.\n\n[![This article describes a 3.4.3-based variant of NetHack.

Other than that they get nothing special, and their starting weapon is particularly crappy, so they'll need to luck into finding good equipment or they'll have a hard time.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Electric_Mage\" title=\"Electric Mage\">Electric Mages</a> are the lightning-based counterpart of flame/ice/acid mages. They specialize in shock spells, and both they and their starting <a href=\"/wiki/Shock_hound_pup\" title=\"Shock hound pup\">shock hound pup</a> are shock resistant. Starting with a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_lightning\" title=\"Wand of lightning\">wand of lightning</a>, they can easily survive the early game by burning a permanent <a href=\"/wiki/Elbereth\" title=\"Elbereth\">Elbereth</a> in critical situations.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Firefighter\" title=\"Firefighter\">Firefighters</a> should be relatively safe early on due to their wand of fire which can burn <a href=\"/wiki/Elbereth\" title=\"Elbereth\">Elbereths</a>. Their starting stack of water is just waiting for an altar that allows converting it to <a href=\"/wiki/Holy_water\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Holy water\">holy water</a>, so either a dip into <a href=\"/wiki/Minetown\" title=\"Minetown\">Minetown</a> or an early altar conversion are early targets. The Firefighter's starting axe is not the strongest weapon but they can advance a large variety of other weapon skills.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Flame_Mage\" title=\"Flame Mage\">Flame Mages</a> start with a <a href=\"/wiki/Hell_hound_pup\" title=\"Hell hound pup\">hell hound pup</a> and a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_fire\" title=\"Wand of fire\">wand of fire</a> but are otherwise weaker than a <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard\" title=\"Wizard\">Wizard</a>.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Graduate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Graduate\">Geeks</a> were renamed from the previous role Graduate. They start with wacky equipment and may have a difficult time getting off the ground. However, their starting <a href=\"/wiki/Sharpened_pencil\" title=\"Sharpened pencil\">sharpened pencil</a> can be used to engrave without dulling, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Expensive_camera\" title=\"Expensive camera\">expensive camera</a> can be a useful utility item.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Gladiator\" title=\"Gladiator\">Gladiators</a> starting equipment includes a <a href=\"/wiki/Shield_of_reflection\" title=\"Shield of reflection\">shield of reflection</a> and a <a href=\"/wiki/Silver_spear\" title=\"Silver spear\">silver spear</a>, both of which are strong items if they can complement them with items found in the dungeon early on.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Geek\" title=\"Geek\">Hackers</a> were renamed from the previous role <a href=\"/wiki/Geek\" title=\"Geek\">Geek</a>. They have a unique starting inventory that can be quite powerful if used correctly. Their <a href=\"/wiki/Electric_sword\" title=\"Electric sword\">electric sword</a> is one of the best one-handed weapons in the game, which can sometimes even apply additional shock damage against monsters. Their <a href=\"/wiki/IC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"IC\">ICs</a> can be sold for a solid amount of money, that can either be used for purchasing additional items in shops or buying <a href=\"/wiki/Protection\" title=\"Protection\">protection</a>. Their <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_Jolt_Cola\" title=\"Potion of Jolt Cola\">potion of Jolt Cola</a>, when blessed, has a small chance of increasing their level and can give a slight boost to their maximum hitpoints. Their <a href=\"/wiki/Hacker%27s_Food\" title=\"Hacker&#39;s Food\">Hacker's Foods</a> also prevent them from starving too easily.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Healer\" title=\"Healer\">Healers</a> now start with a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_healing\" title=\"Wand of healing\">wand of healing</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_kit\" title=\"Medical kit\">medical kit</a> in exchange for giving up the <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_extra_healing\" title=\"Spellbook of extra healing\">spellbook of extra healing</a>. Their sacrifice gift, <a href=\"/wiki/Mirrorbright\" title=\"Mirrorbright\">Mirrorbright</a>, adds to their defensive prowess - but this still leaves Healers with the same dependence on obtaining a powerful artifact weapon that can deal adequate damage to complement this.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Ice_Mage\" title=\"Ice Mage\">Ice Mages</a> start with a <a href=\"/wiki/Winter_wolf\" title=\"Winter wolf\">winter wolf</a> but are weaker than <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard\" title=\"Wizard\">Wizards</a> and likely <a href=\"/wiki/Flame_Mage\" title=\"Flame Mage\">Flame Mages</a> due to not having the wand of fire that can burn <a href=\"/wiki/Elbereth\" title=\"Elbereth\">Elbereth</a>.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Jedi\" title=\"Jedi\">Jedi</a> use <a href=\"/wiki/Lightsaber\" title=\"Lightsaber\">lightsabers</a> and have techniques to recharge them, move objects from a distance and do <a href=\"/wiki/Jump\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jump\">jumps</a>. They can't get proficient at most other types of weapons though, and they either run out of lightsaber energy often or have to use a turn every time a monster shows up to turn their saber back on.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Knight\" title=\"Knight\">Knights</a> start with -3 AC worth of heavy armor, helping out their early game significantly. They also start with many more apples and carrots, allowing them to keep their pet horse fed much more easily. Praying for minions is an effective strategy for knights, and is a viable consideration at almost every phase of the game.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Locksmith\" title=\"Locksmith\">Locksmiths</a> start the game with no weapon and only a lowly <a href=\"/wiki/Dagger\" title=\"Dagger\">dagger</a>, and their (un)locking tools and wands won't help much in an actual combat situation, so they need to turn up useful equipment quickly or they won't stand a chance. They're likely to have to rely on their starting pet for quite some time and engrave <a href=\"/wiki/Elbereth\" title=\"Elbereth\">Elbereth</a> often.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Lunatic\" title=\"Lunatic\">Lunatics</a> are a role-specific version of the <a href=\"/wiki/Lycanthrope\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lycanthrope\">Lycanthrope</a> race. The player either has to find a way to control their random transformations or accept not always being able to wear/wield armor and weapons.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Monk\" title=\"Monk\">Monks</a> have a strong early game assisted by their sacrifice gift, the <a href=\"/wiki/Gauntlets_of_Defense\" title=\"Gauntlets of Defense\">Gauntlets of Defense</a>. Coupled with tactical usage of their assorted techniques - such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Chained_blitz\" title=\"Chained blitz\">chained blitz</a> that deals massive damage when used correctly - monks are one of the strongest roles. \n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Musician\" title=\"Musician\">Musicians</a> can use their <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_harp\" title=\"Magic harp\">magic harp</a> to turn dangerous monsters into powerful allies, and their other instruments (including a <a href=\"/wiki/Drum_of_earthquake\" title=\"Drum of earthquake\">drum of earthquake</a>) may also be useful at times. They don't start with an actual weapon though, so they should try to find one quickly. If they manage to get surrounded by several strong monsters and tame them all at once with their harp they may be quite able to survive the early game.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Necromancer\" title=\"Necromancer\">Necromancers</a> are glass cannons, having a similar starting inventory and stats to a wizard, with the added benefit of detecting the beatitude of items like a <a href=\"/wiki/Priest\" title=\"Priest\">Priest</a>. Their power scales as the game progresses, with their sacrifice gift <a href=\"/wiki/Serpent%27s_Tongue\" title=\"Serpent&#39;s Tongue\">Serpent's Tongue</a> being an endgame-caliber weapon. Their quest artifact, <a href=\"/wiki/The_Great_Dagger_of_Glaurgnaa\" title=\"The Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa\">The Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa</a>, is a nice boon, providing rare slotless <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a> and the ability to <a href=\"/wiki/Invoke\" title=\"Invoke\">invoke</a> for an energy boost. Moreover, their starting <a href=\"/wiki/Sickness_resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sickness resistance\">sickness resistance</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Drain_resistance\" title=\"Drain resistance\">drain resistance</a> pay increasing dividends as the game progresses.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Ninja_(role)\" title=\"Ninja (role)\">Ninja/Kunoichi</a> are similar to <a href=\"/wiki/Rogue\" title=\"Rogue\">Rogues</a> but with considerably worse starting items, so their early game won't exactly be easy. They get some various useful intrinsics from leveling up though.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Noble\" title=\"Noble\">Noblemen/Noblewomen</a> are a melee role that mainly uses one-handed weapons. They start with a saddled <a href=\"/wiki/Pony\" title=\"Pony\">pony</a>, but their hit points and mana aren't great, making them hard to play.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Officer\" title=\"Officer\">Officers</a> start with a <a href=\"/wiki/Pistol\" title=\"Pistol\">pistol</a> and some useful wands, doubled by their starting pet that starts with the same items and immediately drops them on their first turn. This allows the Officer to dual-wield pistols from the start and gun down any dangerous enemies with the downside of doing poor melee damage. Still, it's probably better than whacking enemies with a club that doesn't do any meaningful damage either, and may allow the Officer to survive long enough to find another useful weapon. Dual-wielding with a pistol in main hand and a strong melee weapon (e.g. silver saber) in the other hand enables the player to do well in both melee and ranged combat without having to switch weapons.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Paladin_(role)\" title=\"Paladin (role)\">Paladins</a> are basically enhanced knights who also get undead warning and demon warning, but their code of conduct is much harsher, giving larger penalties than the knight conduct. However, the paladin's starting equipment is also better than the knight's, and they have a higher chance of successfully casting difficult spells.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Pirate\" title=\"Pirate\">Pirates</a> specialize in one-handed weapons and <a href=\"/wiki/Firearms\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Firearms\">firearms</a> and have the ability to <a href=\"/wiki/Swim\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Swim\">swim</a>. However, their hit point and mana totals are usually underwhelming, making them hard to play.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Priest\" title=\"Priest\">Priests/Priestesses</a> have not changed significantly, and their early game suffers slightly due to the variety of early-game threats added. Their sacrifice gift <a href=\"/wiki/Disrupter\" title=\"Disrupter\">Disrupter</a> has solid situational use, but is of limited use against said early-game monsters. However, it is a great boon against the many strong undead spellcasters both new and returning, and as such is worth keeping and enchanting in order to overcome enchantment resistances.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Ranger\" title=\"Ranger\">Rangers</a> are largely unchanged, with their sacrifice gift being a decent improvement on their starting dagger and bow. However, SlashTHEM encourages rangers to use ranged weapons as their primary offense, with higher bonuses to multishot. As a result, retaining the starting stack of arrows is more important, and obtaining holy water and the <a href=\"/wiki/Mine%27s_End\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mine&#39;s End\">Mine's End</a> luckstone are early priorities.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Rogue\" title=\"Rogue\">Rogues</a>' first priority is almost certainly sacrificing for the uber-strong <a href=\"/wiki/Bat_from_Hell\" title=\"Bat from Hell\">Bat from Hell</a>. Once obtained, pretty much the only thing that can take out a Rogue in the early/middle game is hubris. Rogues are even better equipped to steal money, now with scrolls of gold detection and teleportation suited for plundering <a href=\"/wiki/Vault\" title=\"Vault\">vaults</a> in addition to their oilskin sack to steal items and money from shops.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Samurai\" title=\"Samurai\">Samurai</a> have the option to go either for <a href=\"/wiki/Kiku-ichimonji\" title=\"Kiku-ichimonji\">Kiku-ichimonji</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Excalibur\" title=\"Excalibur\">Excalibur</a> if lawful. Both of these weapons have a strong additional damage bonus making them strong choices, on top of Excalibur's important <a href=\"/wiki/Drain_resistance\" title=\"Drain resistance\">drain resistance</a>.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Tourist\" title=\"Tourist\">Tourists</a> have access to <a href=\"/wiki/Whisperfeet\" title=\"Whisperfeet\">Whisperfeet</a>, but are still quite fragile. Like in vanilla, their power does not scale as much until later in the game once they can obtain the <a href=\"/wiki/Platinum_Yendorian_Express_Card\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Platinum Yendorian Express Card\">Platinum Yendorian Express Card</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_wishing\" title=\"Wand of wishing\">wand of wishing</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/Doppelgangers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Doppelgangers\">Doppelgangers</a> can make up for the weak starting stats and equipment with careful use of polyforms.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Undead_Slayer\" title=\"Undead Slayer\">Undead Slayers</a> are slow, weak fighters whose main advantages (<a href=\"/wiki/Drain_resistance\" title=\"Drain resistance\">drain resistance</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Sickness_resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sickness resistance\">sickness resistance</a>) are less important in the early game than the late game.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Undertaker\" title=\"Undertaker\">Undertakers</a> begin the game with a pitiful <a href=\"/wiki/Scalpel\" title=\"Scalpel\">scalpel</a> that should be ditched for a real melee weapon, and they can <a href=\"/wiki/Turn_undead\" title=\"Turn undead\">turn undead</a> both by using the technique and zapping the <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_undead_turning\" title=\"Wand of undead turning\">wand of undead turning</a>, so they may be able to resurrect a fallen pet. Unless they luck into good equipment, they'll probably need to use pets in order to survive the early game.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Valkyrie\" title=\"Valkyrie\">Valkyries</a> are strong fighters as always, exchanging their long sword for a <a href=\"/wiki/Spear\" title=\"Spear\">spear</a>, and their +3 small shield is still one of the most powerful starting pieces of armor for any role. Their sacrifice gift, <a href=\"/wiki/Mjollnir\" title=\"Mjollnir\">Mjollnir</a>, remains extremely powerful and deals almost twice as much electric damage on average. While the Valkyrie quest artifact, the <a href=\"/wiki/Orb_of_Fate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Orb of Fate\">Orb of Fate</a>, is somewhat overshadowed by the lighter <a href=\"/wiki/The_Hand_of_Vecna_(SLASH%27EM)\" title=\"The Hand of Vecna (SLASH&#39;EM)\">Hand of Vecna</a>, it still has useful properties such as <a href=\"/wiki/Half_spell_damage\" title=\"Half spell damage\">half spell damage</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Levelport\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Levelport\">levelporting</a> capability.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Warrior\" title=\"Warrior\">Warriors</a> are great at using melee weapons and good at ranged combat too, but they can't learn any spellcasting skills. The warrior starts with a nice set of armor and weapons, giving them a straightforward early game. Their main difficulty is beating the <a href=\"/wiki/Quest\" title=\"Quest\">Quest</a>, thanks to their <a href=\"/wiki/Nemesis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nemesis\">nemesis</a> basically being a buffed Master Kaen.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Wizard\" title=\"Wizard\">Wizards</a> now start with four spellbooks, but have a much harder time than in vanilla. Even after obtaining <a href=\"/wiki/Magicbane\" title=\"Magicbane\">Magicbane</a>, they are fragile especially with the addition of difficult early threats. What's more, wizards will likely find themselves strapped for item slots for extrinsics.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Yeomen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yeomen\">Yeomen</a> are intrinsically slow, but have access to two extremely powerful guaranteed sacrifice gifts: <a href=\"/wiki/Sword_of_Justice\" title=\"Sword of Justice\">Sword of Justice</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Reaper\" title=\"Reaper\">Reaper</a>.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Zookeeper\" title=\"Zookeeper\">Zookeepers</a> start with three blessed scrolls of taming, allowing them to turn dangerous monsters into pets. They also get tripe rations and leashes which further aids them in gaining and maintaining pets, but their taming scrolls will only last so long. The player should make the most out of them. Confusion may allow the scrolls to tame a much bigger amount of monsters, turning them against the ones that resist. Zookeepers will want to find better armor and weapons if they want to survive early on.\n</p>\n<div style=\"display:none; right:10px; padding-bottom: 17px\" class=\"metadata topicon nopopups\"><div style=\"margin-top: -10px\"><a href=\"/wiki/NetHackWiki:Next_version\" title=\"This article describes a 3.4.3-based variant of NetHack.

[[SlashTHEM]], [[you]] can play as 42 roles: 13 from [[vanilla]], 5 from [[SLASH'EM]], 9 from [[NetHack--]], and 15 others from [[SLEX]] or single [[patch]]es.\n\n[[Acid Mage]]s are the acid-based counterpart of flame/ice/electric mages. They specialize in acid spells, and both they and their starting [[acid hound]] pup are acid resistant. Starting with a [[wand of acid]], they can blast nasty enemies but unlike flame/electric mages cannot burn permanent [[Elbereth]]s, making them a bit harder to play.\n\n[[Archeologist]]s now start with a spellbook and two scrolls. They have the advantage of gaining access to [[Itlachiayaque]] as their sacrifice gift, a useful defensive artifact.\n\n[[Barbarian]]s have their usual strong starting physical stats and intrinsic [[poison resistance]], making their early game easier than most. However, Barbarians are charged three times as much money in shops, which pairs poorly with their low starting [[charisma]]. Unfortunately, their guaranteed sacrifice gift [[Cleaver]] is a bit underwhelming past the early/mid-game, so Barbarians will want to aim for stronger weapons eventually.\n\n[[Bard]]s are a hard role with very weak starting equipment. Their lack of a starting weapon is a problem that should be corrected by finding a suitable weapon ASAP, and their wooden/tin instruments won't be of much use either. When leveling up, bards gain certain [[spellbooks]] that can come in handy.\n\n[[Caveman|Cavemen/Cavewomen]] will have a straightforward early game if they can get their hands on [[Skullcrusher]]. \n\n[[Chef]]s have permanent [[food appraisal]] and gain fire and poison resistance when they level up. However, their starting knife won't likely take them very far, and they suffer from a lack of decent weapon skills. Their skill scales as the game goes on due to their powerful artifact weapon options from sacrifice and their quest artifact, [[The Deluxe Yendorian Knife]].\n\n[[Convict]]s are a harder-than-hard role that starts with a [[heavy iron ball]] [[chain]]ed to the player, a [[cursed]] [[striped shirt]] and negative [[alignment]] and [[luck]]. Races that would usually be peaceful will be hostile to the Convict. Shopkeepers who see their striped shirt will not allow them into their shop, and [[watchmen]] as well as [[vault guard]]s will attack them on sight.\n\n[[Korsair|Corsair]]s don't particularly excel at anything but don't suffer from serious drawbacks either; their starting equipment includes an [[oilskin sack]] as well as a good stack of daggers.\n\n[[Diver]]s don't particularly excel at anything but don't suffer from serious drawbacks either; their starting equipment includes an [[oilskin cloak]] and a [[can of grease]], along with some spears and a [[trident]].\n\n[[Drunk]]s benefit from quaffing [[booze]] and can always make more, but they also start with a large stack of random potions that may be [[full healing]] or other useful types. Other than that they get nothing special, and their starting weapon is particularly crappy, so they'll need to luck into finding good equipment or they'll have a hard time.\n\n[[Electric Mage]]s are the lightning-based counterpart of flame/ice/acid mages. They specialize in shock spells, and both they and their starting [[shock hound pup]] are shock resistant. Starting with a [[wand of lightning]], they can easily survive the early game by burning a permanent [[Elbereth]] in critical situations.\n\n[[Firefighter]]s should be relatively safe early on due to their wand of fire which can burn [[Elbereth]]s. Their starting stack of water is just waiting for an altar that allows converting it to [[holy water]], so either a dip into [[Minetown]] or an early altar conversion are early targets. The Firefighter's starting axe is not the strongest weapon but they can advance a large variety of other weapon skills.\n\n[[Flame Mage]]s start with a [[hell hound pup]] and a [[wand of fire]] but are otherwise weaker than a [[Wizard]].\n\n[[Graduate|Geek]]s were renamed from the previous role Graduate. They start with wacky equipment and may have a difficult time getting off the ground. However, their starting [[sharpened pencil]] can be used to engrave without dulling, and the [[expensive camera]] can be a useful utility item.\n\n[[Gladiator]]s starting equipment includes a [[shield of reflection]] and a [[silver spear]], both of which are strong items if they can complement them with items found in the dungeon early on.\n\n[[Geek|Hacker]]s were renamed from the previous role [[Geek]]. They have a unique starting inventory that can be quite powerful if used correctly. Their [[electric sword]] is one of the best one-handed weapons in the game, which can sometimes even apply additional shock damage against monsters. Their [[IC]]s can be sold for a solid amount of money, that can either be used for purchasing additional items in shops or buying [[protection]]. Their [[potion of Jolt Cola]], when blessed, has a small chance of increasing their level and can give a slight boost to their maximum hitpoints. Their [[Hacker's Food]]s also prevent them from starving too easily.\n\n[[Healer]]s now start with a [[wand of healing]] and [[medical kit]] in exchange for giving up the [[spellbook of extra healing]]. Their sacrifice gift, [[Mirrorbright]], adds to their defensive prowess - but this still leaves Healers with the same dependence on obtaining a powerful artifact weapon that can deal adequate damage to complement this.\n\n[[Ice Mage]]s start with a [[winter wolf]] but are weaker than [[Wizard]]s and likely [[Flame Mage]]s due to not having the wand of fire that can burn [[Elbereth]].\n\n[[Jedi]] use [[lightsaber]]s and have techniques to recharge them, move objects from a distance and do [[jump]]s. They can't get proficient at most other types of weapons though, and they either run out of lightsaber energy often or have to use a turn every time a monster shows up to turn their saber back on.\n\n[[Knight]]s start with -3 AC worth of heavy armor, helping out their early game significantly. They also start with many more apples and carrots, allowing them to keep their pet horse fed much more easily. Praying for minions is an effective strategy for knights, and is a viable consideration at almost every phase of the game.\n\n[[Locksmith]]s start the game with no weapon and only a lowly [[dagger]], and their (un)locking tools and wands won't help much in an actual combat situation, so they need to turn up useful equipment quickly or they won't stand a chance. They're likely to have to rely on their starting pet for quite some time and engrave [[Elbereth]] often.\n\n[[Lunatic]]s are a role-specific version of the [[Lycanthrope]] race. The player either has to find a way to control their random transformations or accept not always being able to wear/wield armor and weapons.\n\n[[Monk]]s have a strong early game assisted by their sacrifice gift, the [[Gauntlets of Defense]]. Coupled with tactical usage of their assorted techniques - such as the [[chained blitz]] that deals massive damage when used correctly - monks are one of the strongest roles. \n\n[[Musician]]s can use their [[magic harp]] to turn dangerous monsters into powerful allies, and their other instruments (including a [[drum of earthquake]]) may also be useful at times. They don't start with an actual weapon though, so they should try to find one quickly. If they manage to get surrounded by several strong monsters and tame them all at once with their harp they may be quite able to survive the early game.\n\n[[Necromancer]]s are glass cannons, having a similar starting inventory and stats to a wizard, with the added benefit of detecting the beatitude of items like a [[Priest]]. Their power scales as the game progresses, with their sacrifice gift [[Serpent's Tongue]] being an endgame-caliber weapon. Their quest artifact, [[The Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa]], is a nice boon, providing rare slotless [[magic resistance]] and the ability to [[invoke]] for an energy boost. Moreover, their starting [[sickness resistance]] and [[drain resistance]] pay increasing dividends as the game progresses.\n\n[[Ninja (role)|Ninja/Kunoichi]] are similar to [[Rogue]]s but with considerably worse starting items, so their early game won't exactly be easy. They get some various useful intrinsics from leveling up though.\n\n[[Noble|Noblemen/Noblewomen]] are a melee role that mainly uses one-handed weapons. They start with a saddled [[pony]], but their hit points and mana aren't great, making them hard to play.\n\n[[Officer]]s start with a [[pistol]] and some useful wands, doubled by their starting pet that starts with the same items and immediately drops them on their first turn. This allows the Officer to dual-wield pistols from the start and gun down any dangerous enemies with the downside of doing poor melee damage. Still, it's probably better than whacking enemies with a club that doesn't do any meaningful damage either, and may allow the Officer to survive long enough to find another useful weapon. Dual-wielding with a pistol in main hand and a strong melee weapon (e.g. silver saber) in the other hand enables the player to do well in both melee and ranged combat without having to switch weapons.\n\n[[Paladin (role)|Paladin]]s are basically enhanced knights who also get undead warning and demon warning, but their code of conduct is much harsher, giving larger penalties than the knight conduct. However, the paladin's starting equipment is also better than the knight's, and they have a higher chance of successfully casting difficult spells.\n\n[[Pirate]]s specialize in one-handed weapons and [[firearms]] and have the ability to [[swim]]. However, their hit point and mana totals are usually underwhelming, making them hard to play.\n\n[[Priest|Priests/Priestesses]] have not changed significantly, and their early game suffers slightly due to the variety of early-game threats added. Their sacrifice gift [[Disrupter]] has solid situational use, but is of limited use against said early-game monsters. However, it is a great boon against the many strong undead spellcasters both new and returning, and as such is worth keeping and enchanting in order to overcome enchantment resistances.\n\n[[Ranger]]s are largely unchanged, with their sacrifice gift being a decent improvement on their starting dagger and bow. However, SlashTHEM encourages rangers to use ranged weapons as their primary offense, with higher bonuses to multishot. As a result, retaining the starting stack of arrows is more important, and obtaining holy water and the [[Mine's End]] luckstone are early priorities.\n\n[[Rogue]]s' first priority is almost certainly sacrificing for the uber-strong [[Bat from Hell]]. Once obtained, pretty much the only thing that can take out a Rogue in the early/middle game is hubris. Rogues are even better equipped to steal money, now with scrolls of gold detection and teleportation suited for plundering [[vault]]s in addition to their oilskin sack to steal items and money from shops.\n\n[[Samurai]] have the option to go either for [[Kiku-ichimonji]] or [[Excalibur]] if lawful. Both of these weapons have a strong additional damage bonus making them strong choices, on top of Excalibur's important [[drain resistance]].\n\n[[Tourist]]s have access to [[Whisperfeet]], but are still quite fragile. Like in vanilla, their power does not scale as much until later in the game once they can obtain the [[Platinum Yendorian Express Card]] and the [[wand of wishing]]. [[Doppelgangers]] can make up for the weak starting stats and equipment with careful use of polyforms.\n\n[[Undead Slayer]]s are slow, weak fighters whose main advantages ([[drain resistance]] and [[sickness resistance]]) are less important in the early game than the late game.\n\n[[Undertaker]]s begin the game with a pitiful [[scalpel]] that should be ditched for a real melee weapon, and they can [[turn undead]] both by using the technique and zapping the [[wand of undead turning]], so they may be able to resurrect a fallen pet. Unless they luck into good equipment, they'll probably need to use pets in order to survive the early game.\n\n[[Valkyrie]]s are strong fighters as always, exchanging their long sword for a [[spear]], and their +3 small shield is still one of the most powerful starting pieces of armor for any role. Their sacrifice gift, [[Mjollnir]], remains extremely powerful and deals almost twice as much electric damage on average. While the Valkyrie quest artifact, the [[Orb of Fate]], is somewhat overshadowed by the lighter [[The Hand of Vecna (SLASH'EM)|Hand of Vecna]], it still has useful properties such as [[half spell damage]] and [[levelport]]ing capability.\n\n[[Warrior]]s are great at using melee weapons and good at ranged combat too, but they can't learn any spellcasting skills. The warrior starts with a nice set of armor and weapons, giving them a straightforward early game. Their main difficulty is beating the [[Quest]], thanks to their [[nemesis]] basically being a buffed Master Kaen.\n\n[[Wizard]]s now start with four spellbooks, but have a much harder time than in vanilla. Even after obtaining [[Magicbane]], they are fragile especially with the addition of difficult early threats. What's more, wizards will likely find themselves strapped for item slots for extrinsics.\n\n[[Yeomen]] are intrinsically slow, but have access to two extremely powerful guaranteed sacrifice gifts: [[Sword of Justice]] and [[Reaper]].\n\n[[Zookeeper]]s start with three blessed scrolls of taming, allowing them to turn dangerous monsters into pets. They also get tripe rations and leashes which further aids them in gaining and maintaining pets, but their taming scrolls will only last so long. The player should make the most out of them. Confusion may allow the scrolls to tame a much bigger amount of monsters, turning them against the ones that resist. Zookeepers will want to find better armor and weapons if they want to survive early on.\n{{variant-343}}\n[[Category:SlashTHEM roles| ]]"}

[monster](/wiki/Monster \"Monster\") that appears in *[NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\")*. They are generally seen tending to their [shops](/wiki/Shop \"Shop\"), and handle all relevant transactions - any goods you [pay](/wiki/Pay \"Pay\") for will transfer [gold](/wiki/Gold \"Gold\") directly into their inventory. In addition to managing sales and purchases, they also seek to prevent [shoplifting](/wiki/Stealing_from_shops \"Stealing from shops\"), and are quite tough for low-level characters who commit the misfortune of angering them. Killing a shopkeeper counts as [murder](/wiki/Murder \"Murder\") for non-chaotic characters.\n\nShould a character [die](/wiki/Die \"Die\") while inside a shop, the shopkeeper \"inherits all of their possesions\" - this simply makes the items in question property of the shop if a [bones](/wiki/Bones \"Bones\") file is created. If a character dies on the same level as an angry shopkeeper, any possible bones will be generated with the player's [grave](/wiki/Grave \"Grave\") empty—the possessions are all transported to the store and inherited by the shopkeeper, who must be pacified to safely search the loot.\n\nA user has suggested improving this page or section as follows:\n\n*\"More about the ESHK extended monster structure, which demonstrates the unique behavior of shopkeepers?\"*\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Generation](#Generation)\n  - [1.1 Shopkeeper names](#Shopkeeper_names)\n\n- [2 Abilities and movement](#Abilities_and_movement)\n\n  - [2.1 Angering the shopkeeper](#Angering_the_shopkeeper)\n  - [2.2 Pacifying shopkeepers](#Pacifying_shopkeepers)\n\n- [3 Strategy](#Strategy)\n\n  - [3.1 Identification](#Identification)\n  - [3.2 Combat](#Combat)\n\n- [4 History](#History)\n\n- [5 Messages](#Messages)\n\n  - [5.1 Greetings](#Greetings)\n  - [5.2 Shopping](#Shopping)\n  - [5.3 Izchak's lines](#Izchak.27s_lines)\n  - [5.4 Angry shopkeepers](#Angry_shopkeepers)\n  - [5.5 Post-mortem](#Post-mortem)\n  - [5.6 Miscellaneous](#Miscellaneous)\n\n- [6 Variants](#Variants)\n\n  - [6.1 SLASH'EM](#SLASH.27EM)\n  - [6.2 GruntHack](#GruntHack)\n  - [6.3 SporkHack](#SporkHack)\n  - [6.4 UnNetHack](#UnNetHack)\n  - [6.5 SporkHack](#SporkHack_2)\n  - [6.6 SpliceHack](#SpliceHack)\n  - [6.7 EvilHack](#EvilHack)\n\n- [7 Encyclopedia entry](#Encyclopedia_entry)\n\n- [8 References](#References)\n\n## Generation\n\nShopkeepers are always peaceful, and will be placed within a created shop on level creation - bones files are an exception in both cases. There is also the exception of the shops in [Orcus Town](/wiki/Orcus_Town \"Orcus Town\"), which are always abandoned.\n\nShopkeepers [are generated with](/wiki/Monster_starting_inventory \"Monster starting inventory\") (30 × 1d100 + 1000) zorkmids and a [skeleton key](/wiki/Skeleton_key \"Skeleton key\").[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1)[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2) They may also receive one each of the following items, which are given in the listed order with the number determined by a d4 roll:[\\[3\\]](#cite_note-3)\n\n1. a [wand of striking](/wiki/Wand_of_striking \"Wand of striking\")\n2. a [potion of healing](/wiki/Potion_of_healing \"Potion of healing\")\n3. a [potion of extra healing](/wiki/Potion_of_extra_healing \"Potion of extra healing\")\n4. a [wand of magic missile](/wiki/Wand_of_magic_missile \"Wand of magic missile\")\n\nJewelers (shopkeepers of ring stores) will additionally receive a [touchstone](/wiki/Touchstone \"Touchstone\").[\\[4\\]](#cite_note-4)\n\n### Shopkeeper names\n\nShopkeepers can have various names that are tied to the types of stores they run - e.g., the names of hardware store shopkeepers in particular are anagrams of the names of the developers. If a shopkeeper name derives from a developer who only worked on certain platforms, that name will only appear on those platforms; some names available only on exotic platforms are excluded from the tools shopkeeper list below. If you have [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\"), you can usually tell what type of items a shop sells by the name of its keeper - the only exceptions are Lucrezia and Dirk, which are \"catch-all\" names not tied to any specific shop type.[\\[5\\]](#cite_note-5)\n\nThe light shop in [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\") is always run by [Izchak](/wiki/Izchak \"Izchak\"), a shopkeeper with unique messages who is named for late DevTeam member [Izchak Miller](/wiki/Izchak_Miller \"Izchak Miller\").\n\n| Shop type                         | Possible shopkeeper

the entrance square (the square inside the shop that is directly in front of the door) and prevent you from entering if you are [invisible](/wiki/Invisible \"Invisible\"), have a [pick-axe](/wiki/Pick-axe \"Pick-axe\") or [dwarvish mattock](/wiki/Dwarvish_mattock \"Dwarvish mattock\") in open inventory, and/or are currently [riding](/wiki/Riding \"Riding\") on a steed. If you dismount, become visible, and/or remove the digging tool(s) from your open [inventory](/wiki/Inventory \"Inventory\") (including placing it in a [container](/wiki/Container \"Container\")), you will be allowed entry. Note that the door of the shop is not considered suitable for dropping your digging tools - this is to prevent characters with extra speed from entering on a free turn. Shopkeepers will also catch any tools you attempt to throw in.\n\nWhile in a shop, the shopkeeper will also move to prevent you from leaving if you are mounted and/or invisible. If you bring in a pick-axe or mattock inside a container and take it out, the shopkeeper will demand you put it away - this does not anger them and you can continue shopping as normal, provided you do not dig through the walls or door.\n\nShopkeepers are capable of magically repairing any damage done to the shop door or walls. They will additionally remove most traps that are set within the shop, with the exception of [pits](/wiki/Pit \"Pit\") and [webs](/wiki/Web \"Web\") - in practice, the latter typically does not occur unless you or a monster creates a trap within the shop (e.g. a [hole](/wiki/Hole \"Hole\") from a [wand of digging](/wiki/Wand_of_digging \"Wand of digging\")).\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nShopkeepers will now remove pits and webs as well.\n\n### Angering the shopkeeper\n\nYou will anger the shopkeeper and turn them hostile with any of the following actions:\n\n- Attacking them directly, including damage from a [gas spore](/wiki/Gas_spore \"Gas spore\") explosion that you caused, or zapping them with certain [wands](/wiki/Wand \"Wand\") (including the [wand of teleportation](/wiki/Wand_of_teleportation \"Wand of teleportation\") and [wand of speed monster](/wiki/Wand_of_speed_monster \"Wand of speed monster\"))\n- Damaging the shop's door or walls while near them and refusing to pay for them, or else digging through them from a distance (e.g. with a wand of digging).\n- Attempting to leave with unpaid items or debts while they are watching - this includes making a [hole](/wiki/Hole \"Hole\") in the shop floor if any items on that square or adjacent squares fall through\n\nThe actions listed above only anger the shopkeeper when done by you - other monsters are not subjected to the same treatment.\n\nStealing items will cause the shopkeeper to call the [Keystone Kops](/wiki/Keystone_Kop_\\(monster_class\\) \"Keystone Kop (monster class)\"); in [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\"), this will also immediately anger the [watch](/wiki/Watch \"Watch\"). If you try to leave through a hole within the shop while you have unpaid items or debts, the shopkeeper will try to [grab your pack](/wiki/Stealing_from_shops#Shopkeeper_prevention \"Stealing from shops\") as you fall if they can get adjacent, claiming any items inside.\n\n### Pacifying shopkeepers\n\nPaying for stolen items will always pacify an angry shopkeeper, though there will be an additional price hike; in all other cases, you can use [p](/wiki/P \"P\") to pay them 1000zm, which has a 2⁄3 chance of pacifying them.[\\[7\\]](#cite_note-7) In any case, you will need to be adjacent to the shopkeeper to pay them if you are both outside their shop; you can also throw the required gold at the shopkeeper. Stealing an item while the shopkeeper is already angry due to another offense, then paying for it, will make the shopkeeper \"forget\" about your previous offenses, and they will become calm and return to their shop as usual.\n\nPacifying a shopkeeper by paying for stolen goods will also pacify any watchmen on that floor and cause any Keystone Kops present to disappear.\n\n## Strategy\n\n- *Main article: [Stealing from shops](/wiki/Stealing_from_shops \"Stealing from shops\")*\n\nShopkeepers have a base [AC](/wiki/AC \"AC\") of 0, two decently-powerful weapon attacks, and may carry healing potions and dangerous offensive wands. Therefore it is usually best to avoid angering shopkeepers lest you swiftly end up [dead](/wiki/YASD \"YASD\"). With this in mind, there are various methods by which even low-level characters can kill or steal from them somewhat easily.\n\nIncentives to kill a shopkeeper include the large amount of gold they are generated with - for [chaotic](/wiki/Chaotic \"Chaotic\") [human](/wiki/Human_\\(starting_race\\) \"Human (starting race)\") players, shopkeepers are also one of the few sources of [human](/wiki/Human_\\(monster_attribute\\) \"Human (monster attribute)\") [corpses](/wiki/Corpse \"Corpse\") in the early levels, which can automatically convert an [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\") when sacrificed. However, shopkeepers also provide other important utilities that usually warrant leaving them alive *and* make it prudent not to anger them.\n\n### Identification\n\n- *Main article: [Price identification](/wiki/Price_identification \"Price identification\")*\n\nShopkeepers tell you the prices of their wares in a shop, which can be used to informally [identify](/wiki/Identify \"Identify\") items; they will also tell you the appearance of an object you have bought or sold if you are [blind](/wiki/Blind \"Blind\"). For [zen](/wiki/Zen \"Zen\") players, this means that shopkeepers are one of the few means of identifying object appearances - a zen player should ideally have [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\") before shopping to avoid an untimely death.\n\n### Combat\n\nIf you have a source of [invisibility](/wiki/Invisibility \"Invisibility\") and either [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\") or [reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\"), the shopkeeper will remain in front of the door as long as they sense your presence. This leaves you free to use any choice of ranged attacks. Be aware that you might run out of projectiles or charges doing this; if you are using spells, make sure to have sufficient food, particularly if you are low-level or using [force bolt](/wiki/Spellbook_of_force_bolt \"Spellbook of force bolt\").\n\nIf you lack invisibility for a ranged attack, you can also dig [pits](/wiki/Pits \"Pits\") all around the shopkeeper, who won't move into them. This requires a container to smuggle a pick-axe inside the shop, and may additionally necessitate rebounding [rays](/wiki/Ray \"Ray\") off walls from outside the shop, since the shopkeeper will try to keep out of direct zapping range.\n\nA non-cursed [scroll of stinking cloud](/wiki/Scroll_of_stinking_cloud \"Scroll of stinking cloud\") can be very effective if you can have the cloud cover most or all of the store, and can also close the door beforehand to prevent retaliation. Cursed scrolls may not do enough damage to kill the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper will stand still as long as they can't see you, and will be forced to use up their healing potions before suffocating.\n\nA [wand of polymorph](/wiki/Wand_of_polymorph \"Wand of polymorph\") can be used to potentially [polymorph](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") a shopkeeper into a creature that is much weaker, and might also be unable to use wands and/or potions - of course, not only do shopkeepers have a [monster MR](/wiki/Magic_resistance_\\(monster\\) \"Magic resistance (monster)\") of 50, but the wand may also transform them into something even stronger. Additionally, shopkeepers cannot be tamed and will not respect [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\"), even when polymorphed into something that normally would. Polymorphed shopkeepers do not count as humans for murder penalties, making this a preferable method for lawful characters.\n\nIf you find a wand in a shop with a base price of 500 zorkmids, it is either a [wand of death](/wiki/Wand_of_death \"Wand of death\") or a [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\") - both can be used to kill the shopkeeper if you so desire, but remember that a ray can miss and/or rebound. While a wand of wishing can be used to [wish](/wiki/Wish \"Wish\") for a wand of death, ideally you should first wish for [scrolls of charging](/wiki/Scroll_of_charging \"Scroll of charging\"), or a [magic marker](/wiki/Magic_marker \"Magic marker\") if you have identified that scroll. [Pacifists](/wiki/Pacifist \"Pacifist\") may opt for a blessed figurine of an [Archon](/wiki/Archon \"Archon\") or other powerful [pet](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\") instead, which can then dispose of the shopkeeper.\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nShopkeepers now have the ability to remove pits, rendering them impractical as a method to keep them pinned.\n\n## History\n\nShopkeepers have existed since Hack 1.21, a variant of [Jay Fenlason's Hack](/wiki/Jay_Fenlason%27s_Hack \"Jay Fenlason's Hack\").\n\nThe standard shopkeeper behavior was developed early on when a student of [David S. H. Rosenthal](/wiki/David_S._H._Rosenthal \"David S. H. Rosenthal\") (co-worker of [Andries Brouwer](/wiki/Andries_Brouwer \"Andries Brouwer\")) demonstrated the need for shopkeepers to have a limited wallet and high strength - in an early version of [Hack 1.0](/wiki/Hack_1.0 \"Hack 1.0\"), they exploited a [wand of digging](/wiki/Wand_of_digging \"Wand of digging\") to steal items from shopkeepers and sell them back as many times as they liked. In [Hack 1.0.3](/wiki/Hack_1.0.3 \"Hack 1.0.3\"), shopkeepers would begin taking exception to digging through the floors of their shop.\n\nIzchak and his lighting shop in Minetown were introduced in [NetHack 3.2.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.2.0 \"NetHack 3.2.0\").\n\n## Messages\n\nThe shopkeeper will always greet you if they are present upon your entering their shop.\n\n### Greetings\n\n*\\<Hello>* is either *Hello* or *Greetings* - [Knights](/wiki/Knight \"Knight\") are greeted instead with *Salutations*, [Samurai](/wiki/Samurai \"Samurai\") with *Irasshaimase*, [Tourists](/wiki/Tourist \"Tourist\") with *Aloha*, and [Valkyries](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\") with *Velkommen*.[\\[8\\]](#cite_note-8)\n\n- \"\\<Hello>, \\<playername>! Welcome to \\<shkname>'s \\<shoptype>!\"\n\n  You entered the shop for the first time.\n\n- \"\\<Hello>, \\<playername>! Welcome again to \\<shkname>'s \\<shoptype>!\"\n\n  You entered a shop that you have been in before.\n\n- \"\\<Hello> \\<playername>! I was looking for \\<otherplayer>!\"\n\n  This is a [bones](/wiki/Bones \"Bones\") level, and the shopkeeper was upset with the player who died there.\n\n- \\<shkname> detects your presence. \"Invisible customers are not welcome!\"\n\n  You are invisible, and the shopkeeper blocks the doorway.\n\n- \"Will you please leave your pick-axe(s)/mattock(s)/digging tools outside?\"\n\n  You are carrying a pick-axe or dwarvish mattock, and the shopkeeper blocks the doorway. This also identifies broad picks as dwarvish mattocks.[\\[9\\]](#cite_note-9)\n\n- \"Will you please leave \\<your steed> outside?\"\n\n  You are [riding](/wiki/Riding \"Riding\"), and the shopkeeper blocks the doorway.\n\n- \\<shkname> asks whether you've seen any untended shops recently.\n\n  You spoke to a shopkeeper that does not own any shop. One way to produce this message is to wish for a shopkeeper [statue](/wiki/Statue \"Statue\") and then cast [stone to flesh](/wiki/Spellbook_of_stone_to_flesh \"Spellbook of stone to flesh\") on it.[\\[10\\]](#cite_note-10)\n\n### Shopping\n\n- \"For you, \\<honorific> [lady/sir](/wiki/Gender \"Gender\")/[creature](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\"); only \\<price> for this \\<object>.\"\n\n  You picked up an item and were told its price. *\\<honorific>* is either *good*, *honored*, *most gracious* or *esteemed*; if you have [killed the Wizard of Yendor or performed the Invocation](/wiki/Demigod \"Demigod\"), the shopkeeper may also refer to you as *most renowned and sacred*.[\\[11\\]](#cite_note-11)\n\n- \"Thank you for shopping in \\<shkname>'s \\<shoptype>!\"\n\n  You just bought one or more items.\n\n- \"\\<objectname>, price \\<price>, an excellent choice/a real bargain/finest quality!\"\n\n  You #[chatted](/wiki/Chat \"Chat\") above a single object.\n\n- \"Fine goods for sale: \"\n\n  You #[chatted](/wiki/Chat \"Chat\") over multiple objects. The objects will be displayed in a list, with their individual price at the right.\n\n- \\<shkname> complains about the problem of shoplifting.\n\n  You chatted to the shopkeeper, and they had nothing else to talk about. [Izchak](/wiki/Izchak \"Izchak\") has some [unique dialogue](#Izchak.27s_lines) instead.\n\n- \\<shkname> complains that business is bad.\n\n  As above, but the shopkeeper has less than 50 gold.\n\n- \\<shkname> says that business is good.\n\n  As above, but the shopkeeper has more than 4000 gold.\n\n- \"You sneaky cad/minx! Get out of here with that pick!\n\n  You hid a pick-axe or mattock in a [container](/wiki/Container \"Container\") and carried it into the shop, then took it out.\n\n- \\<shkname> says \"You be careful with my \\<object>\"\n\n  You wielded an unpaid object.\n\n- \"Thank you for your contribution to restock this recently plundered shop.\"\n\n  You drop gold in a shop robbed by a previous player on a bones level, allowing you to exit the store.\n\n### Izchak's lines\n\n- - Izchak says: 'These shopping malls give me a headache.'\n  - Izchak says: 'Slow down. Think clearly.'\n  - Izchak says: 'You need to take things one at a time.'\n  - Izchak says: 'I don't like poofy coffee... give me Columbian Supremo.'\n  - Izchak says that getting the devteam's agreement on anything is difficult.\n  - Izchak says that he has noticed those who serve their deity will prosper.\n  - Izchak says: 'Don't try to steal from me - I have friends in high places!'\n  - Izchak says: 'You may well need something from this shop in the future.'\n  - Izchak comments about the Valley of the Dead as being a gateway.\n\n  You chatted to Izchak, and he had nothing else to talk about.\n\n### Angry shopkeepers\n\n- \\<shkname> mentions how much \\<he/she> dislikes non-paying customers.\n\n  You left a shop without paying. You can make payment by using [p](/wiki/P \"P\") while adjacent to the shopkeeper, or throw the money to them.\n\n- \\<shkname> mentions how much \\<he/she> dislikes rude customers.\n\n  You attacked the shopkeeper or damaged the shop walls or doors. You can pay 1000 zorkmids for a 2⁄3 chance of pacifying the shopkeeper.\n\n- \"For you, scum; only \\<price> for this \\<object>.\"\n\n  You picked up an item for sale while the shopkeeper is still angry, and they charged you extra.\n\n- \\<shkname> is after your hide, not your money! You try to appease the angry \\<shkname> by giving \\<him/her> 1000 gold pieces.\n\n  You are attempting to pay off an angry shopkeeper that you did not steal from - this has a 2⁄3 chance of succeeding.[\\[12\\]](#cite_note-12)[\\[13\\]](#cite_note-13)\n\n- Morever, you \\<seem to> have no money.\n\n  As above, but you do not have any gold; the words \"seem to\" occur if any gold is stashed away in a container within your inventory.[\\[14\\]](#cite_note-14)\n\n- But \\<shkname> is as angry as ever.\n\n  Your payment failed to appease the shopkeeper, and they are still hostile.[\\[15\\]](#cite_note-15)\n\n- \\<shkname> calms down.\n\n  The shopkeeper is peaceful again.\n\n- Satisfied, \\<shkname> suddenly disappears!\n\n  As above while outside the shop; the shopkeeper instantly teleports back to their shop, wherever it was.\n\n### Post-mortem\n\n- \\<shkname> gratefully inherits all your possessions.\n\n  You died in a shop while the shopkeeper is peaceful - nothing was stolen, and nothing was owed.[\\[16\\]](#cite_note-16)\n\n- \\<shkname> (wakes up and) (comes and) takes the \\<number> zorkmid(s) you owed him/her.\n\n  You owed the shopkeeper money but you were outside of the shop (you robbed the shopkeeper), but your [purse](/wiki/Purse \"Purse\") contained enough [gold pieces](/wiki/Gold_piece \"Gold piece\") to compensate the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper takes the amount of the payment, but not anything else.\n\n- \\<shkname> (wakes up and) (comes and) takes all your possessions.\n\n  Either the shopkeeper was angry at you, or you owed the shopkeeper more money than you had in your purse, or you owed the shopkeeper money and ended your game inside of that shopkeeper's shop.\n\n- \\<shkname> (wakes up,) looks at your corpse, (shakes his/her head,) and disappears/sighs.\n\n  You die within sight of the shopkeeper but outside their shop, but they either had no reason to take your possessions (none of the above cases apply), or possibly another shopkeeper got there first. There is a 50% chance that the shopkeeper shakes their head. A shopkeeper \"disappears\" back to their shop, or \"sighs\" if they are already inside their own shop.\n\nA shopkeeper \"wakes up\" if they were [paralyzed](/wiki/Paralysis \"Paralysis\") or [sleeping](/wiki/Sleep \"Sleep\"), and only comes over if they were more than two [squares](/wiki/Square \"Square\") away from you.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- - \\<shkname> whispers an incantation.\n  - \\<shkname> whispers something.\n  - You hear someone muttering an incantation.\n  - The dungeon acoustics noticeably change.\n\n  A shopkeeper repairs damage to their shop - the exact message depends on how close you are and if you can see the shopkeeper.\n\n## Variants\n\nVariants often tend to upgrade shopkeepers by granting them additional abilities or improving their stats and/or starting inventory.\n\nA user has suggested improving this page or section as follows:\n\n*\"Cover the rest of the variants eventually.\"*\n\n### SLASH'EM\n\nIn [SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\"), shopkeepers also provide very useful [services](/wiki/Shopkeeper_services \"Shopkeeper services\"), although they come at a hefty cost and vary with the type of shop.\n\nShopkeepers are also far more formidable fighters - their base level has been raised to 24, their AC is lowered to −6, and they are always generated with a [shotgun](/wiki/Shotgun \"Shotgun\"), shotgun shells, a [wand of teleportation](/wiki/Wand_of_teleportation \"Wand of teleportation\"), and a knife. This makes it quite difficult for pets to attack them - no domestic animal can be easily raised to a high enough level, which also makes it much less likely that they will get themselves killed trying to attack one.\n\nSLASH'EM also adds light and pet stores with the following potential shopkeeper names: Zarnesti, Slanic, Nehoiasu, Ludus, Sighisoara, Nisipitu, Razboieni, Bicaz, Dorohoi, Vaslui, Fetesti, Tirgu Neamt, Babadag, Zimnicea, Zlatna, Jiu, Eforie, Mamaia, Silistra, Tulovo, Panagyuritshte, Smolyan, Kirklareli, Pernik, Lom, Haskovo, Dobrinishte, Varvara, Oryahovo, Troyan, Lovech, Sliven.\n\nSLASH'EM additionally includes a special shopkeeper known as the black marketeer - the only one present in the game is the incredibly powerful [One-eyed Sam](/wiki/One-eyed_Sam_\\(SLASH%27EM\\) \"One-eyed Sam (SLASH'EM)\"), who tends to the floor-wide [black market](/wiki/Black_market_\\(SLASH%27EM\\) \"Black market (SLASH'EM)\") hidden behind a [magic portal](/wiki/Magic_portal \"Magic portal\").\n\n### GruntHack\n\nIn [GruntHack](/wiki/GruntHack \"GruntHack\"), shopkeepers can be various [racial monsters](/wiki/Racial_monster \"Racial monster\") as opposed to solely humans, and will additionally adjust their prices depending on the player's race. Shopkeepers that dislike the player's race will charge much more for their wares and give much less gold for sold items, and their responses when interacting with the shop's inventory are the same as for a player that angered them.\n\n### SporkHack\n\nIn [SporkHack](/wiki/SporkHack \"SporkHack\"), shopkeepers can be various monster types outright, e.g. an [orc-captain](/wiki/Orc-captain \"Orc-captain\") or an [ogre](/wiki/Ogre \"Ogre\"), as opposed to a shopkeeper monster of a certain race like in [GruntHack](/wiki/GruntHack \"GruntHack\").\n\n### UnNetHack\n\nIn [UnNetHack](/wiki/UnNetHack \"UnNetHack\"), the shopkeepers found in the [Town](/wiki/Town \"Town\") branch are generated with much less gold than normal - a comment in the code indicates the town is rather poor.\n\nUnNetHack also has its own version of [the black market](/wiki/Black_market_\\(UnNetHack\\) \"Black market (UnNetHack)\") with the same layout as the one in SLASH'EM - UnNetHack's [One-eyed Sam](/wiki/One-eyed_Sam_\\(UnNetHack\\) \"One-eyed Sam (UnNetHack)\") is a woman, and remains the sole shopkeeper there. UnNetHack also adds a second possible map that instead splits the market into several independent shops, with black marketeers acting as shopkeepers - here, One-eyed Sam is \"simply\" a peacekeeping NPC.\n\n### SporkHack\n\n[SporkHack](/wiki/SporkHack \"SporkHack\") also implements racial monster shopkeepers and racial price adjustments.\n\n### SpliceHack\n\nShopkeepers in [SpliceHack](/wiki/SpliceHack \"SpliceHack\") and [SpliceHack-Rewrite](/wiki/SpliceHack-Rewrite \"SpliceHack-Rewrite\") are generated with a similar kit to SLASH'EM shopkeepers, including a shotgun and two stacks of shotgun shells.[\\[17\\]](#cite_note-17)[\\[18\\]](#cite_note-18)\n\nSpliceHack also has the [black market](/wiki/Black_market_\\(SpliceHack\\) \"Black market (SpliceHack)\"), run by One-Eyed Sam as in other variants. Additionally, there is a [City of Brass](/wiki/City_of_Brass \"City of Brass\") with shops run by extraplanar merchants.\n\n### EvilHack\n\n[EvilHack](/wiki/EvilHack \"EvilHack\") derives its implementation of racial monster shopkeepers from SporkHack, and their messages will also change depending on whether or not there is typically enmity between their race and that of the hero, with somewhat more detailed responses; otherwise, they retain their usual behavior.\n\nThe shopkeeper's base stats in EvilHack are mostly identical to those of vanilla *NetHack*, though they are one monster level higher; each individual shopkeeper also has various abilities intrinsic to members of their race. They have a chance of generating with a [quarterstaff](/wiki/Quarterstaff \"Quarterstaff\") or a [broadsword](/wiki/Broadsword \"Broadsword\") as their weapon, as well as either an [elven helm](/wiki/Elven_helm \"Elven helm\") or regular [helmet](/wiki/Helmet \"Helmet\"), and the [wand of sleep](/wiki/Wand_of_sleep \"Wand of sleep\") replaces the wand of striking in the list of additional items rolled by d4. The wand of sleep in particular makes them all the more dangerous to anger: sleep resistance is much harder to build up, and being put to sleep will usually give them the time they need to kill the hero.\n\n## Encyclopedia entry\n\n- *See the [encyclopedia entry for human](/wiki/Human_\\(monster\\)#Encyclopedia_entry \"Human (monster)\").*\n\n## References\n\n1.

Note that the door of the shop is not considered suitable for dropping your digging tools - this is to prevent characters with extra speed from entering on a free turn.

Stealing an item while the shopkeeper is already angry due to another offense, then paying for it, will make the shopkeeper \"forget\" about your previous offenses, and they will become calm and return to their shop as usual.\n</p><p>Pacifying a shopkeeper by paying for stolen goods will also pacify any watchmen on that floor and cause any Keystone Kops present to disappear.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Strategy\">Strategy</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><div class=\"noprint relarticle mainarticle\"><i>Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Stealing_from_shops\" title=\"Stealing from shops\">Stealing from shops</a></i></div></dd></dl>\n<p>Shopkeepers have a base <a href=\"/wiki/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a> of 0, two decently-powerful weapon attacks, and may carry healing potions and dangerous offensive wands. Therefore it is usually best to avoid angering shopkeepers lest you swiftly end up <a href=\"/wiki/YASD\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"YASD\">dead</a>. With this in mind, there are various methods by which even low-level characters can kill or steal from them somewhat easily.\n</p><p>Incentives to kill a shopkeeper include the large amount of gold they are generated with - for <a href=\"/wiki/Chaotic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chaotic\">chaotic</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Human_(starting_race)\" title=\"Human (starting race)\">human</a> players, shopkeepers are also one of the few sources of <a href=\"/wiki/Human_(monster_attribute)\" title=\"Human (monster attribute)\">human</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Corpse\" title=\"Corpse\">corpses</a> in the early levels, which can automatically convert an <a href=\"/wiki/Altar\" title=\"Altar\">altar</a> when sacrificed.

For <a href=\"/wiki/Zen\" title=\"Zen\">zen</a> players, this means that shopkeepers are one of the few means of identifying object appearances - a zen player should ideally have <a href=\"/wiki/Telepathy\" title=\"Telepathy\">telepathy</a> before shopping to avoid an untimely death.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Combat\">Combat</span></h3>\n<p>If you have a source of <a href=\"/wiki/Invisibility\" title=\"Invisibility\">invisibility</a> and either <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Reflection\" title=\"Reflection\">reflection</a>, the shopkeeper will remain in front of the door as long as they sense your presence. This leaves you free to use any choice of ranged attacks. Be aware that you might run out of projectiles or charges doing this; if you are using spells, make sure to have sufficient food, particularly if you are low-level or using <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_force_bolt\" title=\"Spellbook of force bolt\">force bolt</a>.\n</p><p>If you lack invisibility for a ranged attack, you can also dig <a href=\"/wiki/Pits\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pits\">pits</a> all around the shopkeeper, who won't move into them. This requires a container to smuggle a pick-axe inside the shop, and may additionally necessitate rebounding <a href=\"/wiki/Ray\" title=\"Ray\">rays</a> off walls from outside the shop, since the shopkeeper will try to keep out of direct zapping range.\n</p><p>A non-cursed <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_stinking_cloud\" title=\"Scroll of stinking cloud\">scroll of stinking cloud</a> can be very effective if you can have the cloud cover most or all of the store, and can also close the door beforehand to prevent retaliation. Cursed scrolls may not do enough damage to kill the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper will stand still as long as they can't see you, and will be forced to use up their healing potions before suffocating.\n</p><p>A <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_polymorph\" title=\"Wand of polymorph\">wand of polymorph</a> can be used to potentially <a href=\"/wiki/Polymorph\" title=\"Polymorph\">polymorph</a> a shopkeeper into a creature that is much weaker, and might also be unable to use wands and/or potions - of course, not only do shopkeepers have a <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance_(monster)\" title=\"Magic resistance (monster)\">monster MR</a> of 50, but the wand may also transform them into something even stronger. Additionally, shopkeepers cannot be tamed and will not respect <a href=\"/wiki/Elbereth\" title=\"Elbereth\">Elbereth</a>, even when polymorphed into something that normally would. Polymorphed shopkeepers do not count as humans for murder penalties, making this a preferable method for lawful characters.\n</p><p>If you find a wand in a shop with a base price of 500 zorkmids, it is either a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_death\" title=\"Wand of death\">wand of death</a> or a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_wishing\" title=\"Wand of wishing\">wand of wishing</a> - both can be used to kill the shopkeeper if you so desire, but remember that a ray can miss and/or rebound.

This makes it quite difficult for pets to attack them - no domestic animal can be easily raised to a high enough level, which also makes it much less likely that they will get themselves killed trying to attack one.\n</p><p>SLASH'EM also adds light and pet stores with the following potential shopkeeper names: Zarnesti, Slanic, Nehoiasu, Ludus, Sighisoara, Nisipitu, Razboieni, Bicaz, Dorohoi, Vaslui, Fetesti, Tirgu Neamt, Babadag, Zimnicea, Zlatna, Jiu, Eforie, Mamaia, Silistra, Tulovo, Panagyuritshte, Smolyan, Kirklareli, Pernik, Lom, Haskovo, Dobrinishte, Varvara, Oryahovo, Troyan, Lovech, Sliven.\n</p><p>SLASH'EM additionally includes a special shopkeeper known as the black marketeer - the only one present in the game is the incredibly powerful <a href=\"/wiki/One-eyed_Sam_(SLASH%27EM)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"One-eyed Sam (SLASH&#39;EM)\">One-eyed Sam</a>, who tends to the floor-wide <a href=\"/wiki/Black_market_(SLASH%27EM)\" title=\"Black market (SLASH&#39;EM)\">black market</a> hidden behind a <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_portal\" title=\"Magic portal\">magic portal</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"GruntHack\">GruntHack</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/GruntHack\" title=\"GruntHack\">GruntHack</a>, shopkeepers can be various <a href=\"/wiki/Racial_monster\" title=\"Racial monster\">racial monsters</a> as opposed to solely humans, and will additionally adjust their prices depending on the player's race. Shopkeepers that dislike the player's race will charge much more for their wares and give much less gold for sold items, and their responses when interacting with the shop's inventory are the same as for a player that angered them.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"SporkHack\">SporkHack</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/SporkHack\" title=\"SporkHack\">SporkHack</a>, shopkeepers can be various monster types outright, e.g. an <a href=\"/wiki/Orc-captain\" title=\"Orc-captain\">orc-captain</a> or an <a href=\"/wiki/Ogre\" title=\"Ogre\">ogre</a>, as opposed to a shopkeeper monster of a certain race like in <a href=\"/wiki/GruntHack\" title=\"GruntHack\">GruntHack</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"UnNetHack\">UnNetHack</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/UnNetHack\" title=\"UnNetHack\">UnNetHack</a>, the shopkeepers found in the <a href=\"/wiki/Town\" title=\"Town\">Town</a> branch are generated with much less gold than normal - a comment in the code indicates the town is rather poor.\n</p><p>UnNetHack also has its own version of <a href=\"/wiki/Black_market_(UnNetHack)\" title=\"Black market (UnNetHack)\">the black market</a> with the same layout as the one in SLASH'EM - UnNetHack's <a href=\"/wiki/One-eyed_Sam_(UnNetHack)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"One-eyed Sam (UnNetHack)\">One-eyed Sam</a> is a woman, and remains the sole shopkeeper there. UnNetHack also adds a second possible map that instead splits the market into several independent shops, with black marketeers acting as shopkeepers - here, One-eyed Sam is \"simply\" a peacekeeping NPC.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"SporkHack_2\">SporkHack</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/SporkHack\" title=\"SporkHack\">SporkHack</a> also implements racial monster shopkeepers and racial price adjustments.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"SpliceHack\">SpliceHack</span></h3>\n<p>Shopkeepers in <a href=\"/wiki/SpliceHack\" title=\"SpliceHack\">SpliceHack</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/SpliceHack-Rewrite\" title=\"SpliceHack-Rewrite\">SpliceHack-Rewrite</a> are generated with a similar kit to SLASH'EM shopkeepers, including a shotgun and two stacks of shotgun shells.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>SpliceHack also has the <a href=\"/wiki/Black_market_(SpliceHack)\" title=\"Black market (SpliceHack)\">black market</a>, run by One-Eyed Sam as in other variants. Additionally, there is a <a href=\"/wiki/City_of_Brass\" title=\"City of Brass\">City of Brass</a> with shops run by extraplanar merchants.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"EvilHack\">EvilHack</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/EvilHack\" title=\"EvilHack\">EvilHack</a> derives its implementation of racial monster shopkeepers from SporkHack, and their messages will also change depending on whether or not there is typically enmity between their race and that of the hero, with somewhat more detailed responses; otherwise, they retain their usual behavior.\n</p><p>The shopkeeper's base stats in EvilHack are mostly identical to those of vanilla <i>NetHack</i>, though they are one monster level higher; each individual shopkeeper also has various abilities intrinsic to members of their race. They have a chance of generating with a <a href=\"/wiki/Quarterstaff\" title=\"Quarterstaff\">quarterstaff</a> or a <a href=\"/wiki/Broadsword\" title=\"Broadsword\">broadsword</a> as their weapon, as well as either an <a href=\"/wiki/Elven_helm\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Elven helm\">elven helm</a> or regular <a href=\"/wiki/Helmet\" title=\"Helmet\">helmet</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_sleep\" title=\"Wand of sleep\">wand of sleep</a> replaces the wand of striking in the list of additional items rolled by d4. The wand of sleep in particular makes them all the more dangerous to anger: sleep resistance is much harder to build up, and being put to sleep will usually give them the time they need to kill the hero.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Encyclopedia_entry\">Encyclopedia entry</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>See the <a href=\"/wiki/Human_(monster)#Encyclopedia_entry\" title=\"Human

|reference=[[monst.c#line2369]]\n}}\n\nA '''shopkeeper''' is a type of [[human]] [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. They are generally seen tending to their [[shop]]s, and handle all relevant transactions - any goods you [[pay]] for will transfer [[gold]] directly into their inventory. In addition to managing sales and purchases, they also seek to prevent [[stealing from shops|shoplifting]], and are quite tough for low-level characters who commit the misfortune of angering them. Killing a shopkeeper counts as [[murder]] for non-chaotic characters.\n\nShould a character [[die]] while inside a shop, the shopkeeper \"inherits all of their possesions\" - this simply makes the items in question property of the shop if a [[bones]] file is created. If a character dies on the same level as an angry shopkeeper, any possible bones will be generated with the player's [[grave]] empty&mdash;the possessions are all transported to the store and inherited by the shopkeeper, who must be pacified to safely search the loot.\n\n{{todo|More about the ESHK extended monster structure, which demonstrates the unique behavior of shopkeepers?}}\n\n==Generation==\nShopkeepers are always peaceful, and will be placed within a created shop on level creation - bones files are an exception in both cases. There is also the exception of the shops in [[Orcus Town]], which are always abandoned.\n\nShopkeepers [[Monster starting inventory|are generated with]] (30&nbsp;&times; 1d100&nbsp;+ 1000) zorkmids and a [[skeleton key]].{{refsrc|src/shknam.c|674|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|674|version=NetHack 3.6.7}} They may also receive one each of the following items, which are given in the listed order with the number determined by a d4 roll:{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|673|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}\n\n#a [[wand of striking]]\n#a [[potion of healing]]\n#a [[potion of extra healing]]\n#a [[wand of magic missile]]\n\nJewelers (shopkeepers of ring stores) will additionally receive a [[touchstone]].{{refsrc|src/shknam.c|676|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}\n\n===Shopkeeper names===\nShopkeepers can have various names that are tied to the types of stores they run - e.g., the names of hardware store shopkeepers in particular are anagrams of the names of the developers. If a shopkeeper name derives from a developer who only worked on certain platforms, that name will only appear on those platforms; some names available only on exotic platforms are excluded from the tools shopkeeper list below. If you have [[telepathy]], you can usually tell what type of items a shop sells by the name of its keeper - the only exceptions are Lucrezia and Dirk, which are \"catch-all\" names not tied to any specific shop type.{{refsrc|src/shknam.c|541|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}\n\nThe light shop in [[Minetown]] is always run by [[Izchak]], a shopkeeper with unique messages who is named for late DevTeam member [[Izchak Miller]].\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n!

If you dismount, become visible, and/or remove the digging tool(s) from your open [[inventory]] (including placing it in a [[container]]), you will be allowed entry. Note that the door of the shop is not considered suitable for dropping your digging tools - this is to prevent characters with extra speed from entering on a free turn. Shopkeepers will also catch any tools you attempt to throw in.\n\nWhile in a shop, the shopkeeper will also move to prevent you from leaving if you are mounted and/or invisible. If you bring in a pick-axe or mattock inside a container and take it out, the shopkeeper will demand you put it away - this does not anger them and you can continue shopping as normal, provided you do not dig through the walls or door.\n\nShopkeepers are capable of magically repairing any damage done to the shop door or walls. They will additionally remove most traps that are set within the shop, with the exception of [[pit]]s and [[web]]s - in practice, the latter typically does not occur unless you or a monster creates a trap within the shop (e.g. a [[hole]] from a [[wand of digging]]).\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Shopkeepers will now remove pits and webs as well.}}\n\n===Angering the shopkeeper===\nYou will anger the shopkeeper and turn them hostile with any of the following actions:\n\n* Attacking them directly, including damage from a [[gas spore]] explosion that you caused, or zapping them with certain [[wand]]s (including the [[wand of teleportation]] and [[wand of speed monster]])\n* Damaging the shop's door or walls while near them and refusing to pay for them, or else digging through them from a distance (e.g. with a wand of digging).\n* Attempting to leave with unpaid items or debts while they are watching - this includes making a [[hole]] in the shop floor if any items on that square or adjacent squares fall through\n\nThe actions listed above only anger the shopkeeper when done by you - other monsters are not subjected to the same treatment.\n\nStealing items will cause the shopkeeper to call the [[Keystone Kop (monster class)|Keystone Kops]]; in [[Minetown]], this will also immediately anger the [[watch]]. If you try to leave through a hole within the shop while you have unpaid items or debts, the shopkeeper will try to [[Stealing from shops#Shopkeeper prevention|grab your pack]] as you fall if they can get adjacent, claiming any items inside.\n\n===Pacifying shopkeepers===\nPaying for stolen items will always pacify an angry shopkeeper, though there will be an additional price hike; in all other cases, you can use {{kbd|p}} to pay them 1000zm, which has a {{frac|2|3}} chance of pacifying them.{{refsrc|src/shk.c|1414|version=NetHack 3.6.7}} In any case, you will need to be adjacent to the shopkeeper to pay them if you are both outside their shop; you can also throw the required gold at the shopkeeper. Stealing an item while the shopkeeper is already angry due to another offense, then paying for it, will make the shopkeeper \"forget\" about your previous offenses, and they will become calm and return to their shop as usual.\n\nPacifying a shopkeeper by paying for stolen goods will also pacify any watchmen on that floor and cause any Keystone Kops present to disappear.\n\n==Strategy==\n{{main|Stealing from shops}}\nShopkeepers have a base [[AC]] of 0, two decently-powerful weapon attacks, and may carry healing potions and dangerous offensive wands. Therefore it is usually best to avoid angering shopkeepers lest you swiftly end up [[YASD|dead]]. With this in mind, there are various methods by which even low-level characters can kill or steal from them somewhat easily.\n\nIncentives to kill a shopkeeper include the large amount of gold they are generated with - for [[chaotic]] [[Human (starting race)|human]] players, shopkeepers are also one of the few sources of [[Human (monster attribute)|human]] [[corpse]]s in the early levels, which can automatically convert an [[altar]] when sacrificed. However, shopkeepers also provide other important utilities that usually warrant leaving them alive ''and'' make it prudent not to anger them.\n\n===Identification===\n{{main|Price identification}}\nShopkeepers tell you the prices of their wares in a shop, which can be used to informally [[identify]] items; they will also tell you the appearance of an object you have bought or sold if you are [[blind]]. For [[zen]] players, this means that shopkeepers are one of the few means of identifying object appearances - a zen player should ideally have [[telepathy]] before shopping to avoid an untimely death.\n\n===Combat===\nIf you have a source of [[invisibility]] and either [[magic resistance]] or [[reflection]], the shopkeeper will remain in front of the door as long as they sense your presence. This leaves you free to use any choice of ranged attacks. Be aware that you might run out of projectiles or charges doing this; if you are using spells, make sure to have sufficient food, particularly if you are low-level or using {{spell of|force bolt}}.\n\nIf you lack invisibility for a ranged attack, you can also dig [[pits]] all around the shopkeeper, who won't move into them. This requires a container to smuggle a pick-axe inside the shop, and may additionally necessitate rebounding [[ray]]s off walls from outside the shop, since the shopkeeper will try to keep out of direct zapping range.\n\nA non-cursed [[scroll of stinking cloud]] can be very effective if you can have the cloud cover most or all of the store, and can also close the door beforehand to prevent retaliation. Cursed scrolls may not do enough damage to kill the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper will stand still as long as they can't see you, and will be forced to use up their healing potions before suffocating.\n\nA [[wand of polymorph]] can be used to potentially [[polymorph]] a shopkeeper into a creature that is much weaker, and might also be unable to use wands and/or potions - of course, not only do shopkeepers have a [[Magic resistance (monster)|monster MR]] of 50, but the wand may also transform them into something even stronger. Additionally, shopkeepers cannot be tamed and will not respect [[Elbereth]], even when polymorphed into something that normally would. Polymorphed shopkeepers do not count as humans for murder penalties, making this a preferable method for lawful characters.\n\nIf you find a wand in a shop with a base price of 500 zorkmids, it is either a [[wand of death]] or a [[wand of wishing]] - both can be used to kill the shopkeeper if you so desire, but remember that a ray can miss and/or rebound. While a wand of wishing can be used to [[wish]] for a wand of death, ideally you should first wish for [[Scroll of charging|scrolls of charging]], or a [[magic marker]] if you have identified that scroll. [[Pacifist]]s may opt for a blessed figurine of an [[Archon]] or other powerful [[pet]] instead, which can then dispose of the shopkeeper.\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Shopkeepers now have the ability to remove pits, rendering them impractical as a method to keep them pinned.}}\n\n==History==\nShopkeepers have existed since Hack 1.21, a variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]].\n\nThe standard shopkeeper behavior was developed early on when a student of [[David S. H. Rosenthal]] (co-worker of [[Andries Brouwer]]) demonstrated the need for shopkeepers to have a limited wallet and high strength - in an early version of [[Hack 1.0]], they exploited a [[wand of digging]] to steal items from shopkeepers and sell them back as many times as they liked. In [[Hack 1.0.3]], shopkeepers would begin taking exception to digging through the floors of their shop.\n\nIzchak and his lighting shop in Minetown were introduced in [[NetHack 3.2.0]].\n\n==Messages==\nThe shopkeeper will always greet you if they are present upon your entering their shop.\n\n===Greetings===\n''<Hello>'' is either ''Hello'' or ''Greetings'' - [[Knight]]s are greeted instead with ''Salutations'', [[Samurai]] with ''Irasshaimase'', [[Tourist]]s with ''Aloha'', and [[Valkyrie]]s with ''Velkommen''.{{refsrc|src/role.c|2140|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}\n\n{{message|\"<Hello>, <playername>!

This makes it quite difficult for pets to attack them - no domestic animal can be easily raised to a high enough level, which also makes it much less likely that they will get themselves killed trying to attack one.\n\nSLASH'EM also adds light and pet stores with the following potential shopkeeper names: Zarnesti, Slanic, Nehoiasu, Ludus, Sighisoara, Nisipitu, Razboieni, Bicaz, Dorohoi, Vaslui, Fetesti, Tirgu Neamt, Babadag, Zimnicea, Zlatna, Jiu, Eforie, Mamaia, Silistra, Tulovo, Panagyuritshte, Smolyan, Kirklareli, Pernik, Lom, Haskovo, Dobrinishte, Varvara, Oryahovo, Troyan, Lovech, Sliven.<!--Possibly sort these for store type and name?- Umbire-->\n\nSLASH'EM additionally includes a special shopkeeper known as the black marketeer - the only one present in the game is the incredibly powerful [[One-eyed Sam (SLASH'EM)|One-eyed Sam]], who tends to the floor-wide [[Black market (SLASH'EM)|black market]] hidden behind a [[magic portal]].\n\n===GruntHack===\nIn [[GruntHack]], shopkeepers can be various [[racial monster]]s as opposed to solely humans, and will additionally adjust their prices depending on the player's race. Shopkeepers that dislike the player's race will charge much more for their wares and give much less gold for sold items, and their responses when interacting with the shop's inventory are the same as for a player that angered them.\n\n===SporkHack===\nIn [[SporkHack]], shopkeepers can be various monster types outright, e.g. an [[orc-captain]] or an [[ogre]], as opposed to a shopkeeper monster of a certain race like in [[GruntHack]].\n\n===UnNetHack===\nIn [[UnNetHack]], the shopkeepers found in the [[Town]] branch are generated with much less gold than normal - a comment in the code indicates the town is rather poor.\n\nUnNetHack also has its own version of [[Black market (UnNetHack)|the black market]] with the same layout as the one in SLASH'EM - UnNetHack's [[One-eyed Sam (UnNetHack)|One-eyed Sam]] is a woman, and remains the sole shopkeeper there. UnNetHack also adds a second possible map that instead splits the market into several independent shops, with black marketeers acting as shopkeepers - here, One-eyed Sam is \"simply\" a peacekeeping NPC.\n\n===SporkHack===\n[[SporkHack]] also implements racial monster shopkeepers and racial price adjustments.\n\n===SpliceHack===\nShopkeepers in [[SpliceHack]] and [[SpliceHack-Rewrite]] are generated with a similar kit to SLASH'EM shopkeepers, including a shotgun and two stacks of shotgun shells.<ref>[https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.1.0/src/makemon.c#L255 SpliceHack-Rewrite 1.1.0 makemon.c, line 255]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.1.0/src/makemon.c#L1036 SpliceHack-Rewrite 1.1.0 makemon.c, line 1036]</ref>\n\nSpliceHack also has the [[Black market (SpliceHack)|black market]], run by One-Eyed Sam as in other variants. Additionally, there is a [[City of Brass]] with shops run by extraplanar merchants.\n\n===EvilHack===\n[[EvilHack]] derives its implementation of racial monster shopkeepers from SporkHack, and their messages will also change depending on whether or not there is typically enmity between their race and that of the hero, with somewhat more detailed responses; otherwise, they retain their usual behavior.\n\nThe shopkeeper's base stats in EvilHack are mostly identical to those of vanilla ''NetHack'', though they are one monster level higher; each individual shopkeeper also has various abilities intrinsic to members of their race. They have a chance of generating with a [[quarterstaff]] or a [[broadsword]] as their weapon, as well as either an [[elven helm]] or regular [[helmet]], and the [[wand of sleep]] replaces the wand of striking in the list of additional items rolled by d4. The wand of sleep in particular makes them all the more dangerous to anger: sleep resistance is much harder to build up, and being put to sleep will usually give them the time they need to kill the hero.\n\n==Encyclopedia entry==\n{{encyclopedia-redirect|human (monster)|human}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{nethack-367}}\n[[Category:Monsters]]"}

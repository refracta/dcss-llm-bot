Each one has a different effect when you read it, some effects highly desirable, some not. Most of them are useful in some way, and this page isn't comprehensive by any means. Be creative! See the individual pages for each scroll for more detailed information on their effects.\n\nNote that just about any scroll can become useless (and therefore a candidate for [blanking](/wiki/Blanking \"Blanking\")) in certain situations: a character with a fully-enchanted [ascension kit](/wiki/Ascension_kit \"Ascension kit\") may find themselves blanking scrolls of enchant armor, a [genocideless](/wiki/Genocideless \"Genocideless\") character who already has dragon scale mail may blank scrolls of genocide, scrolls of teleportation become useless once you enter the no-teleport [Elemental Planes](/wiki/Elemental_Planes \"Elemental Planes\"), etc.\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Always useful scrolls](#Always_useful_scrolls)\n- [2 Useful early- and mid-game scrolls](#Useful_early-_and_mid-game_scrolls)\n- [3 Scrolls with specialized uses](#Scrolls_with_specialized_uses)\n- [4 Nearly-useless to useless scrolls](#Nearly-useless_to_useless_scrolls)\n\n## Always useful scrolls\n\n[Scrolls of enchant weapon](/wiki/Scroll_of_enchant_weapon \"Scroll of enchant weapon\") are common, useful, and easy to [price ID](/wiki/Price_ID \"Price ID\"), with their unique base price of 60. Like most scrolls, they're better used when blessed, but the player's immediate survival is often much more important than hoarding resources for a future that might not come. Don't be afraid of \"wasting\" these before getting an [artifact weapon](/wiki/Artifact_weapon \"Artifact weapon\") or [holy water](/wiki/Holy_water \"Holy water\"). Weapons enchanted above +5 have a substantial chance of evaporating if you attempt to enchant them further.\n\nThe [scroll of enchant armor](/wiki/Scroll_of_enchant_armor \"Scroll of enchant armor\") is one of the most valuable scrolls in the game. Better AC greatly reduces damage to the player and is one of the primary factors that influence player progression. Even without a powerful weapon, a player with a very good AC can last for quite a while. Early in the game, they're best used on items that you'll likely keep, such as any gloves or helm, or any magical armor such as a [cloak of magic resistance](/wiki/Cloak_of_magic_resistance \"Cloak of magic resistance\") or [speed boots](/wiki/Speed_boots \"Speed boots\"). If the player lacks [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\") or [polymorph control](/wiki/Polymorph_control \"Polymorph control\"), it is not advised to enchant items in the shirt, body armor, or cloak slot, as these can be destroyed if the player is unfortunate enough to step on a [polymorph trap](/wiki/Polymorph_trap \"Polymorph trap\"). Fortunately, like enchant weapon, enchant armor is very easy to price identify, only sharing its base cost of 80 with remove curse, a scroll that is also safe to read identify. Be sure to [curse-test](/wiki/Curse-test \"Curse-test\") both this and the enchant weapon scroll before reading, though.\n\nA [scroll of charging](/wiki/Scroll_of_charging \"Scroll of charging\") is especially handy to have around. Maybe you want to recharge your [magic marker](/wiki/Magic_marker \"Magic marker\") or [wand of death](/wiki/Wand_of_death \"Wand of death\"), unless the scroll is cursed, you can recharge it. Some objects explode after experiencing the [charging](/wiki/Charging \"Charging\") process too many times, so be careful. These scrolls are rare, so save the ones you have. They are relatively cheap to write for their utility, however, so consider using magic marker charges on them.\n\nThe [scroll of teleportation](/wiki/Scroll_of_teleportation \"Scroll of teleportation\") is a good [escape item](/wiki/Escape_item \"Escape item\"), particularly in the early game where most levels do not prohibit teleporting. Cursed scrolls can be convenient if the player doesn't have another means of [level teleportation](/wiki/Level_teleportation \"Level teleportation\") or [branchporting](/wiki/Branchport \"Branchport\"). They're extremely common as a [defensive item](/wiki/Defensive_item \"Defensive item\") that monsters are eligible to carry, so most of them can be blanked. Monsters are likely to identify this scroll for you early on.\n\nThe [scroll of genocide](/wiki/Scroll_of_genocide \"Scroll of genocide\") is very powerful, and how you choose to use it depends on its BUC status. See [genocide](/wiki/Genocide \"Genocide\"). It has potential utility at any point in the game, and can be used as an escape item, to produce dragons for their [dragon scale mail](/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail \"Dragon scale mail\"), or to wipe out entire classes of powerful monsters such as [liches](/wiki/Lich \"Lich\") and [mind flayers](/wiki/Mind_flayer \"Mind flayer\"). Although its base scroll class of 300 can be very dangerous, all of them can be safely read identified if they are blessed.\n\nA [scroll of scare monster](/wiki/Scroll_of_scare_monster \"Scroll of scare monster\") is a powerful item indeed. Unlike most scrolls, its most powerful effect occurs when it is dropped, scaring almost all monsters. After the [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") nerf that occurred in [3.6.0](/wiki/3.6.0 \"3.6.0\"), these can save your life against anything from killer bees to [Demogorgon](/wiki/Demogorgon \"Demogorgon\"). It's a good idea to have one in a container that you can [#tip](#tip) in an emergency. There is a guaranteed scroll under the [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") prize - although it is cursed, and will crumble when you pick it up, it allows you to identify them easily.\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nThe scroll of scare monster on the ground no longer scares any @ monster or any [unique](/wiki/Unique \"Unique\") monster. The strategy advice should be updated as appropriate. ([commit dc9fe0d8](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/dc9fe0d8bc96e006c119fa183c9c9a7c4cde2f53))\n\nThe [scroll of remove curse](/wiki/Scroll_of_remove_curse \"Scroll of remove curse\") can be used to remove curses on wielded and worn items if it is uncursed, uncursing the player's entire inventory when blessed. Early on, a blessed or uncursed scroll can be used to rid onself of a highly undesirable cursed weapon or piece of armor; later on, the player will encounter many [item-cursing spellcasters](/wiki/Curse_items \"Curse items\"), and blessed scrolls are more efficient than [holy water](/wiki/Holy_water \"Holy water\") at undoing their handiwork, although they cannot re-bless items such as [luckstones](/wiki/Luckstone \"Luckstone\") and [unicorn horns](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\"). Read while confused, a blessed scroll is also useful for [atheist](/wiki/Atheist \"Atheist\") characters looking to make holy or [unholy water](/wiki/Unholy_water \"Unholy water\").\n\n## Useful early- and mid-game scrolls\n\nScrolls of identify should be kept and used. Even if they are cursed, they still allow you to identify one item, and identifying items can show you the enchantment, identity, and [BUC](/wiki/BUC \"BUC\") status of the item. They are the cheapest scroll, and are usually easily discernible due to their frequency in generation. Use them to identify items that are difficult to identify safely or discern from others in their price ranges, such as rings and amulets.\n\nAlthough it can be difficult to identify due to its common base price of 100, the [scroll of confuse monster](/wiki/Scroll_of_confuse_monster \"Scroll of confuse monster\") can be used in a pinch to attempt to confuse an attacker. It becomes far less useful later, serving only as a source of confusion for the player [should they need it](/wiki/Portal_detection_methods \"Portal detection methods\").\n\nWhile also difficult to identify due to its base price of 100, the [scroll of food detection](/wiki/Scroll_of_food_detection \"Scroll of food detection\") can be very handy for roles (such as [wizards](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\")) that start with a poor food supply. The [food appraisal](/wiki/Food_appraisal \"Food appraisal\") intrinsic gained from blessed scrolls can theoretically be useful later on, but because it is lost after a single use, it is not usually worth trying to keep around.\n\nA [scroll of taming](/wiki/Scroll_of_taming \"Scroll of taming\") is rare and difficult to identify as well, but many early-game monsters lack good monster MR, making them vulnerable to taming's charm monster effect. This can be used to get moderately powerful pets or just to escape a sticky situation.\n\n## Scrolls with specialized uses\n\nMany players rely on the [scroll of magic mapping](/wiki/Scroll_of_magic_mapping \"Scroll of magic mapping\") in [Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\"). Manually exploring Gehennom is a chore that most players choose to streamline, although this is strictly a luxury and shouldn't be prioritized. Earlier in the game, their main usage is to navigate dark levels in the [Gnomish Mines](/wiki/Gnomish_Mines \"Gnomish Mines\") or to locate vaults more easily.\n\nWhile near useless in the early game, the [scroll of gold detection](/wiki/Scroll_of_gold_detection \"Scroll of gold detection\") is valuable on the Elemental Planes to locate portals.\n\nChaotic characters can make use of [scrolls of stinking cloud](/wiki/Scroll_of_stinking_cloud \"Scroll of stinking cloud\") to assassinate shopkeepers early on, but to most characters the scroll is too fiddly and too easily resisted to be all that useful.\n\nA [scroll of create monster](/wiki/Scroll_of_create_monster \"Scroll of create monster\") can be used to generate fodder for [sacrifice](/wiki/Sacrifice \"Sacrifice\"). A cursed scroll creates more fodder, but is also more dangerous: make sure you have some escape option handy. Players trying to permanently eliminate the [Riders](/wiki/Riders \"Riders\") will often read many of these scrolls while confused, in order to fill the entire level with harmless [acid blobs](/wiki/Acid_blob \"Acid blob\").\n\nThe [scroll of destroy armor](/wiki/Scroll_of_destroy_armor \"Scroll of destroy armor\") has some uses. If you are wearing cursed armor without a scroll of remove curse, you could drop all your other armor and read the scroll (this will not work if the scroll is cursed, it will lower the enchantment of the armor instead), destroying the armor. Later in the game, cursed scrolls of destroy armor can be used to [fooproof](/wiki/Fooproof \"Fooproof\") armor if read when confused.\n\nThe [scroll of earth](/wiki/Scroll_of_earth \"Scroll of earth\") is most useful for fixing mistakes in [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\"), where two are guaranteed to be found; note that doing so will incur a -1 [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") penalty if the level is not already solved. It can also be useful for bridging [moats](/wiki/Moat \"Moat\"), most notably at the [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\"), but overall a source of [levitation](/wiki/Levitation \"Levitation\") or [flying](/wiki/Flying \"Flying\") is preferable. Finally, scrolls of earth can be used to create [boulder forts](/wiki/Boulder_fort \"Boulder fort\"), which have some specialized uses but are not very useful tactically, since they are unlikely to stop adjacent monsters.\n\n## Nearly-useless to useless scrolls\n\nThe [scroll of amnesia](/wiki/Scroll_of_amnesia \"Scroll of amnesia\") should be blanked. Its effect ([amnesia](/wiki/Amnesia \"Amnesia\")) offers zero benefit to the player.\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nThe scroll of amnesia causes the player to forget [skills](/wiki/Skill \"Skill\"). This can actually be useful to players who wish to free up skill slots for a different skill.\n\nThe [scroll of light](/wiki/Scroll_of_light \"Scroll of light\") may see marginal use at the very beginning of the game, but is otherwise worthless. Its effect is easily superseded by any source of light, such as oil lamps, the wand of light, or candles. It is easy to identify and type name due to its unique base price of 50.\n\nUnless you are pursuing some esoteric stupid ascension trick, the [scroll of punishment](/wiki/Scroll_of_punishment \"Scroll of punishment\") is also a prime candidate for blanking.\n\nUnless blessed, the [scroll of fire](/wiki/Scroll_of_fire \"Scroll of fire\") can damage inventory items, and is typically too weak to be of any long-term use in combat. It can still be used situationally to damage and awaken distant targets, and can cure [sliming](/wiki/Sliming \"Sliming\") in a pinch until you have better means available (e.g. the [spell of cure sickness](/wiki/Spell_of_cure_sickness \"Spell of cure sickness\"), an [amulet of unchanging](/wiki/Amulet_of_unchanging \"Amulet of unchanging\"), or a [wand of fire](/wiki/Wand_of_fire \"Wand of fire\")).\n\n[![This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.1.

Use them to identify items that are difficult to identify safely or discern from others in their price ranges, such as rings and amulets.\n</p><p>Although it can be difficult to identify due to its common base price of 100, the <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_confuse_monster\" title=\"Scroll of confuse monster\">scroll of confuse monster</a> can be used in a pinch to attempt to confuse an attacker. It becomes far less useful later, serving only as a source of confusion for the player <a href=\"/wiki/Portal_detection_methods\" title=\"Portal detection methods\">should they need it</a>.\n</p><p>While also difficult to identify due to its base price of 100, the <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_food_detection\" title=\"Scroll of food detection\">scroll of food detection</a> can be very handy for roles (such as <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard\" title=\"Wizard\">wizards</a>) that start with a poor food supply.  The <a href=\"/wiki/Food_appraisal\" title=\"Food appraisal\">food appraisal</a> intrinsic gained from blessed scrolls can theoretically be useful later on, but because it is lost after a single use, it is not usually worth trying to keep around.\n</p><p>A <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_taming\" title=\"Scroll of taming\">scroll of taming</a> is rare and difficult to identify as well, but many early-game monsters lack good monster MR, making them vulnerable to taming's charm monster effect. This can be used to get moderately powerful pets or just to escape a sticky situation.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Scrolls_with_specialized_uses\">Scrolls with specialized uses</span></h2>\n<p>Many players rely on the <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_magic_mapping\" title=\"Scroll of magic mapping\">scroll of magic mapping</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Gehennom\" title=\"Gehennom\">Gehennom</a>. Manually exploring Gehennom is a chore that most players choose to streamline, although this is strictly a luxury and shouldn't be prioritized. Earlier in the game, their main usage is to navigate dark levels in the <a href=\"/wiki/Gnomish_Mines\" title=\"Gnomish Mines\">Gnomish Mines</a> or to locate vaults more easily.\n</p><p>While near useless in the early game, the <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_gold_detection\" title=\"Scroll of gold detection\">scroll of gold detection</a> is valuable on the Elemental Planes to locate portals.\n</p><p>Chaotic characters can make use of <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_stinking_cloud\" title=\"Scroll of stinking cloud\">scrolls of stinking cloud</a> to assassinate shopkeepers early on, but to most characters the scroll is too fiddly and too easily resisted to be all that useful.\n</p><p>A <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_create_monster\" title=\"Scroll of create monster\">scroll of create monster</a> can be used to generate fodder for <a href=\"/wiki/Sacrifice\" title=\"Sacrifice\">sacrifice</a>. A cursed scroll creates more fodder, but is also more dangerous: make sure you have some escape option handy. Players trying to permanently eliminate the <a href=\"/wiki/Riders\" title=\"Riders\">Riders</a> will often read many of these scrolls while confused, in order to fill the entire level with harmless <a href=\"/wiki/Acid_blob\" title=\"Acid blob\">acid blobs</a>.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_destroy_armor\" title=\"Scroll of destroy armor\">scroll of destroy armor</a> has some uses. If you are wearing cursed armor without a scroll of remove curse, you could drop all your other armor and read the scroll (this will not work if the scroll is cursed, it will lower the enchantment of the armor instead), destroying the armor. Later in the game, cursed scrolls of destroy armor can be used to <a href=\"/wiki/Fooproof\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fooproof\">fooproof</a> armor if read when confused.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_earth\" title=\"Scroll of earth\">scroll of earth</a> is most useful for fixing mistakes in <a href=\"/wiki/Sokoban\" title=\"Sokoban\">Sokoban</a>, where two are guaranteed to be found; note that doing so will incur a -1 <a href=\"/wiki/Luck\" title=\"Luck\">Luck</a> penalty if the level is not already solved.  It can also be useful for bridging <a href=\"/wiki/Moat\" title=\"Moat\">moats</a>, most notably at the <a href=\"/wiki/Castle\" title=\"Castle\">Castle</a>, but overall a source of <a href=\"/wiki/Levitation\" title=\"Levitation\">levitation</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Flying\" title=\"Flying\">flying</a> is preferable.  Finally, scrolls of earth can be used to create <a href=\"/wiki/Boulder_fort\" title=\"Boulder fort\">boulder forts</a>, which have some specialized uses but are not very useful tactically, since they are unlikely to stop adjacent monsters.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nearly-useless_to_useless_scrolls\">Nearly-useless to useless scrolls</span></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_amnesia\" title=\"Scroll of amnesia\">scroll of amnesia</a> should be blanked. Its effect (<a href=\"/wiki/Amnesia\" title=\"Amnesia\">amnesia</a>) offers zero benefit to the player.\n</p>\n<div class=\"upcoming\">\n<p><i>The following information pertains to an upcoming version (<a href=\"/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0\" title=\"NetHack 3.7.0\">NetHack 3.7.0</a>).

are represented by {{white|?}} and have a weight of 5. Each one has a different effect when you read it,\nsome effects highly desirable, some not. Most of them are useful in some way, and this page isn't comprehensive by any means. Be creative!  See the individual pages for each scroll for more detailed information on their effects.\n\nNote that just about any scroll can become useless (and therefore a candidate for [[blanking]]) in certain situations: a character with a fully-enchanted [[ascension kit]] may find themselves blanking scrolls of enchant armor, a [[genocideless]] character who already has dragon scale mail may blank scrolls of genocide, scrolls of teleportation become useless once you enter the no-teleport [[Elemental Planes]], etc.\n\n== Always useful scrolls ==\n\n[[Scroll of enchant weapon|Scrolls of enchant weapon]] are common, useful, and easy to [[price ID]], with their unique base price of 60. Like most scrolls, they're better used when blessed, but the player's immediate survival is often much more important than hoarding resources for a future that might not come. Don't be afraid of \"wasting\" these before getting an [[artifact weapon]] or [[holy water]]. Weapons enchanted above +5 have a substantial chance of evaporating if you attempt to enchant them further.\n\nThe [[scroll of enchant armor]] is one of the most valuable scrolls in the game. Better AC greatly reduces damage to the player and is one of the primary factors that influence player progression. Even without a powerful weapon, a player with a very good AC can last for quite a while. Early in the game, they're best used on items that you'll likely keep, such as any gloves or helm, or any magical armor such as a [[cloak of magic resistance]] or [[speed boots]]. If the player lacks [[magic resistance]] or [[polymorph control]], it is not advised to enchant items in the shirt, body armor, or cloak slot, as these can be destroyed if the player is unfortunate enough to step on a [[polymorph trap]]. Fortunately, like enchant weapon, enchant armor is very easy to price identify, only sharing its base cost of 80 with remove curse, a scroll that is also safe to read identify. Be sure to [[curse-test]] both this and the enchant weapon scroll before reading, though.\n\nA [[scroll of charging]] is especially handy to have around. Maybe you want to recharge your [[magic marker]] or [[wand of death]], unless the scroll is cursed, you can recharge it. Some objects explode after experiencing the [[charging]] process too many times, so be careful. These scrolls are rare, so save the ones you have. They are relatively cheap to write for their utility, however, so consider using magic marker charges on them.\n\nThe [[scroll of teleportation]] is a good [[escape item]], particularly in the early game where most levels do not prohibit teleporting. Cursed scrolls can be convenient if the player doesn't have another means of [[level teleportation]] or [[branchport]]ing. They're extremely common as a [[defensive item]] that monsters are eligible to carry, so most of them can be blanked. Monsters are likely to identify this scroll for you early on.\n\nThe [[scroll of genocide]] is very powerful, and how you choose to use it depends on its BUC status. See [[genocide]]. It has potential utility at any point in the game, and can be used as an escape item, to produce dragons for their [[dragon scale mail]], or to wipe out entire classes of powerful monsters such as [[lich]]es and [[mind flayer]]s. Although its base scroll class of 300 can be very dangerous, all of them can be safely read identified if they are blessed.\n\nA [[scroll of scare monster]] is a powerful item indeed. Unlike most scrolls, its most powerful effect occurs when it is dropped, scaring almost all monsters. After the [[Elbereth]] nerf that occurred in [[3.6.0]], these can save your life against anything from killer bees to [[Demogorgon]]. It's a good idea to have one in a container that you can [[#tip]] in an emergency. There is a guaranteed scroll under the [[Sokoban]] prize - although it is cursed, and will crumble when you pick it up, it allows you to identify them easily.\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The scroll of scare monster on the ground no longer scares any @ monster or any [[unique]] monster. The strategy advice should be updated as appropriate. ({{commit|dc9fe0d8bc96e006c119fa183c9c9a7c4cde2f53}})}}\n\nThe [[scroll of remove curse]] can be used to remove curses on wielded and worn items if it is uncursed, uncursing the player's entire inventory when blessed.  Early on, a blessed or uncursed scroll can be used to rid onself of a highly undesirable cursed weapon or piece of armor; later on, the player will encounter many [[curse items|item-cursing spellcasters]], and blessed scrolls are more efficient than [[holy water]] at undoing their handiwork, although they cannot re-bless items such as [[luckstone]]s and [[unicorn horn]]s.  Read while confused, a blessed scroll is also useful for [[atheist]] characters looking to make holy or [[unholy water]].\n\n==Useful early- and mid-game scrolls==\nScrolls of identify should be kept and used. Even if they are cursed, they still allow you to identify one item, and identifying items can show you the enchantment, identity, and [[BUC]] status of the item. They are the cheapest scroll, and are usually easily discernible due to their frequency in generation. Use them to identify items that are difficult to identify safely or discern from others in their price ranges, such as rings and amulets.\n\nAlthough it can be difficult to identify due to its common base price of 100, the [[scroll of confuse monster]] can be used in a pinch to attempt to confuse an attacker. It becomes far less useful later, serving only as a source of confusion for the player [[portal detection methods|should they need it]].\n\nWhile also difficult to identify due to its base price of 100, the [[scroll of food detection]] can be very handy for roles (such as [[wizard]]s) that start with a poor food supply.  The [[food appraisal]] intrinsic gained from blessed scrolls can theoretically be useful later on, but because it is lost after a single use, it is not usually worth trying to keep around.\n\nA [[scroll of taming]] is rare and difficult to identify as well, but many early-game monsters lack good monster MR, making them vulnerable to taming's charm monster effect. This can be used to get moderately powerful pets or just to escape a sticky situation.\n\n==Scrolls with specialized uses==\nMany players rely on the [[scroll of magic mapping]] in [[Gehennom]]. Manually exploring Gehennom is a chore that most players choose to streamline, although this is strictly a luxury and shouldn't be prioritized. Earlier in the game, their main usage is to navigate dark levels in the [[Gnomish Mines]] or to locate vaults more easily.\n\nWhile near useless in the early game, the [[scroll of gold detection]] is valuable on the Elemental Planes to locate portals.\n\nChaotic characters can make use of [[scroll of stinking cloud|scrolls of stinking cloud]] to assassinate shopkeepers early on, but to most characters the scroll is too fiddly and too easily resisted to be all that useful.\n\nA [[scroll of create monster]] can be used to generate fodder for [[sacrifice]]. A cursed scroll creates more fodder, but is also more dangerous: make sure you have some escape option handy. Players trying to permanently eliminate the [[Riders]] will often read many of these scrolls while confused, in order to fill the entire level with harmless [[acid blob]]s.\n\nThe [[scroll of destroy armor]] has some uses. If you are wearing cursed armor without a scroll of remove curse, you could drop all your other armor and read the scroll (this will not work if the scroll is cursed, it will lower the enchantment of the armor instead), destroying the armor. Later in the game, cursed scrolls of destroy armor can be used to [[fooproof]] armor if read when confused.\n\nThe [[scroll of earth]] is most useful for fixing mistakes in [[Sokoban]], where two are guaranteed to be found; note that doing so will incur a -1 [[Luck]] penalty if the level is not already solved.  It can also be useful for bridging [[moat]]s, most notably at the [[Castle]], but overall a source of [[levitation]] or [[flying]] is preferable.  Finally, scrolls of earth can be used to create [[boulder fort]]s, which have some specialized uses but are not very useful tactically, since they are unlikely to stop adjacent monsters.\n\n==Nearly-useless to useless scrolls==\nThe [[scroll of amnesia]] should be blanked. Its effect ([[amnesia]]) offers zero benefit to the player.\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The scroll of amnesia causes the player to forget [[skill]]s.  This can actually be useful to players who wish to free up skill slots for a different skill.}}\n\nThe [[scroll of light]] may see marginal use at the very beginning of the game, but is otherwise worthless. Its effect is easily superseded by any source of light, such as oil lamps, the wand of light, or candles. It is easy to identify and type name due to its unique base price of 50.\n\nUnless you are pursuing some esoteric stupid ascension trick, the [[scroll of punishment]] is also a prime candidate for blanking.\n\nUnless blessed, the [[scroll of fire]] can damage inventory items, and is typically too weak to be of any long-term use in combat. It can still be used situationally to damage and awaken distant targets, and can cure [[sliming]] in a pinch until you have better means available (e.g. the [[spell of cure sickness]], an [[amulet of unchanging]], or a [[wand of fire]]).\n{{nethack-361}}\n[[Category:Strategy]]"}

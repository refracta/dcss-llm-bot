{"title":"GDSM versus SDSM","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/GDSM_versus_SDSM","type":"markdown","data":"[Gray dragon scale mail](/wiki/Gray_dragon_scale_mail \"Gray dragon scale mail\") (GDSM) and [silver dragon scale mail](/wiki/Silver_dragon_scale_mail \"Silver dragon scale mail\") (SDSM) are considered the two best suits of [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\") in the game. GDSM provides [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\") and SDSM provides [reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\"), but it is not always clear which is better in any particular situation. If you intend to [wish](/wiki/Wish \"Wish\") or [reverse-genocide](/wiki/Genocide#Reverse_genocide \"Genocide\") for dragon scale mail, you will need to decide which one is more appropriate.\n\nWhich armor is better largely depends on both playing style and one's current situation. A player who has one extrinsic should almost always wish for the armor which provides the other, but when one has neither, it is dependent upon things such as current HP, conducts, pets, and general style. For example, if you get an early wish and are not adhering to any conducts or time-consuming strategies, SDSM is often better. This is because reflection provides immediate protection against the commonly encountered attack wands and breath weapons, while a player with only GDSM is not protected against rays of fire, lightning, cold, sleep, and disintegration unless they have already attained the proper resistances.\n\nSometimes the armor that would be most useful immediately is not the one that you intend to include in your [ascension kit](/wiki/Ascension_kit \"Ascension kit\"). In this case, you must choose between maximizing immediate utility, and conserving wishes in the long run.\n\nA user has suggested improving this page or section as follows:\n\n*\"Update article in general, make sure it and any added citations are up-to-date, account for {{upcoming}} [3.7.0](/wiki/3.7.0 \"3.7.0\") stuff, add more variants and mention dtsund-patch.\"*\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Gray dragon scale mail](#Gray_dragon_scale_mail)\n\n- [2 Silver dragon scale mail](#Silver_dragon_scale_mail)\n\n- [3 Strategy](#Strategy)\n\n- [4 General](#General)\n\n  - [4.1 SLASH'EM](#SLASH.27EM)\n  - [4.2 GruntHack](#GruntHack)\n\n## Gray dragon scale mail\n\n- Magic resistance protects against many [monster spells](/wiki/Monster_spell \"Monster spell\"), including particularly nasty ones such as destroy armor and touch of death.\n\n  - *Monsters capable of casting the more dangerous spells (such as [golden nagas](/wiki/Golden_naga \"Golden naga\") and [liches](/wiki/Lich \"Lich\")) usually only appear relatively close to the [castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\"). There, you will have more opportunity to wish for magic resistance.*\n  - *Bear in mind that attack spells generally require the monster to be in melee range, so careful use of missile attacks and/or [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") can mitigate this danger to some extent.*\n\n- Magic resistance protects you from [wands of striking](/wiki/Wand_of_striking \"Wand of striking\"), which cannot be reflected.\n  - *Wands of striking do much less damage than the elemental wands, and will not damage your equipment.*\n\n- Magic resistance provides protection from teleport and level-teleport traps, which can place unwary characters in dangerous situations.\n  - *Level teleporters are more likely to take you up. Fully exploring levels top-down makes those destinations safe.*\n\n- Magic resistance provides full protection from [polymorph traps](/wiki/Polymorph_trap \"Polymorph trap\"), and allows you to safely displace your [pets](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\") onto them.\n\n  - *SDSM provides partial protection against polytraps: you will turn into a [silver dragon](/wiki/Silver_dragon \"Silver dragon\"), trashing your shirt and cloak but keeping your armor. This will not protect you or your armor against subsequent polymorphs while in silver dragon form. Polymorphing in this way will revert your scale mail back to scales, negating much of its AC bonus, but not the extrinsic. Also, neither suit protects against polymorphs caused by [lycanthropy](/wiki/Lycanthropy \"Lycanthropy\").*\n\n    - *Low-level players will rehumanize quickly, and a silver dragon is a good fighting form until then.*\n    - *[Lycanthropy](/wiki/Lycanthropy \"Lycanthropy\") can be almost completely prevented by [magic cancellation](/wiki/Magic_cancellation \"Magic cancellation\"), and cured e.g. by prayer.*\n\n- Reflection is usually easier to obtain without wishing than magic resistance, particularly because of the possible [amulet of reflection](/wiki/Amulet_of_reflection \"Amulet of reflection\") in [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") and the possible [shield of reflection](/wiki/Shield_of_reflection \"Shield of reflection\") on [Medusa's Island](/wiki/Medusa%27s_Island \"Medusa's Island\"). Spending a wish or genocide scroll on GDSM makes it easier to obtain both properties, since magic resistance would usually be obtained by wishing for a [cloak of magic resistance](/wiki/Cloak_of_magic_resistance \"Cloak of magic resistance\") or [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\") anyway.**\n  - *Medusa's shield only comes rather late in the game, and close to the Castle wand of wishing.*\n\n- Obtaining magic resistance from your suit frees up your [cloak](/wiki/Cloak \"Cloak\") slot. This allows you to wear something more useful, such as a [robe](/wiki/Robe \"Robe\") or [oilskin cloak](/wiki/Oilskin_cloak \"Oilskin cloak\").\n  - *On the other hand, you will need to employ an [amulet](/wiki/Amulet_of_reflection \"Amulet of reflection\"), [shield](/wiki/Shield_of_reflection \"Shield of reflection\"), or the [Longbow of Diana](/wiki/Longbow_of_Diana \"Longbow of Diana\") for reflection.*\n\n- [Crowning](/wiki/Crowning \"Crowning\"), should the player have access to it, will protect against the wands that magic resistance gives no defense against.\n  - *The player still needs to protect their items in open inventory from damage. It is difficult to crown without obtaining a [luckstone](/wiki/Luckstone \"Luckstone\"). Crowning does not grant [disintegration resistance](/wiki/Disintegration_resistance \"Disintegration resistance\").*\n\n- [Chaotic](/wiki/Chaotic \"Chaotic\") players cannot get magic resistance by wishing for another role's [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\").\n  - *Chaotic [monks](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\") and [wizards](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\") are still guaranteed a magic resistance artifact in their own Quest.*\n\n## Silver dragon scale mail\n\n- Reflection protects you and your equipment from wands and breath attacks of fire, cold, and lightning, which are rather common and can deal tremendous amounts of damage.\n  - *You can protect scrolls and potions against only fire and cold by placing them in a container. Rings and wands kept at the ready will still be vulnerable to lightning. In particular, only SDSM protects your [escape items](/wiki/Escape_items \"Escape items\").*\n\n- Reflection protects you from a [black dragon](/wiki/Black_dragon \"Black dragon\")'s disintegration breath.\n\n  - *A shield will be disintegrated first, which usually gives you enough time to [escape](/wiki/Escape_item \"Escape item\") or leave the line of fire.*\n  - *[Disintegration resistance](/wiki/Disintegration_resistance \"Disintegration resistance\") can also protect you and your armor, but is difficult to obtain without defeating a black dragon.*\n\n- Reflection protects you from wands and breath attacks of sleep.\n  - *[Sleep resistance](/wiki/Sleep_resistance \"Sleep resistance\") will also protect you from these.*\n\n- Accidentally attacking a [floating eye](/wiki/Floating_eye \"Floating eye\") will not paralyze you.\n  - *Careful play will usually prevent floating eye accidents, as will a [ring of free action](/wiki/Ring_of_free_action \"Ring of free action\").*\n\n- While both suits protect against a [wand of death](/wiki/Wand_of_death \"Wand of death\"), reflection gives a chance of killing the zapper on a [rebound](/wiki/Rebound \"Rebound\"), preventing him from wasting valuable charges.\n  - *This does not apply to [Orcus](/wiki/Orcus \"Orcus\"), who is a demon and therefore immune to his own wand of death.*\n\n- Obtaining reflection from your suit frees up your [amulet](/wiki/Amulet \"Amulet\") and off-hand slots. This allows you to wear another amulet (such as [life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\")), and potentially allows [two weapon combat](/wiki/Two_weapon_combat \"Two weapon combat\") and combat spellcasting.\n  - *On the other hand, you will need to employ a [cloak](/wiki/Cloak_of_magic_resistance \"Cloak of magic resistance\"), a (possibly wished-for) [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\") or [Magicbane](/wiki/Magicbane \"Magicbane\") for magic resistance.*\n\n## Strategy\n\nIn the early game, the player has few, if any, elemental resistances and low max HP. This makes silver dragon scale mail almost invariably the better choice at this point in the game. Players who reach the [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\") and obtain the [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\") have a wealth of resources at their disposal, and can be more flexible with their [ascension kit](/wiki/Ascension_kit \"Ascension kit\").\n\nIn the end game as well, SDSM is usually the better choice. The table below attempts to clarify the decision by prioritizing the need for [Magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\") (MR), [Reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\") (R), [Magic cancellation](/wiki/Magic_cancellation \"Magic cancellation\") (MC), [Two-weaponing](/wiki/Two-weaponing \"Two-weaponing\") (2w), and [spellcasting](/wiki/Spellcasting \"Spellcasting\") in the endgame. It attempts to make the amulet slot available for an [amulet of life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\"), the shield hand free for two-weaponing, and the cloak slot open for a [robe](/wiki/Robe \"Robe\") or [cloak of protection](/wiki/Cloak_of_protection \"Cloak of protection\"). For those labelled \"medium\" under the spellcasting column, a [robe](/wiki/Robe \"Robe\") is prioritized. A [shield of reflection](/wiki/Shield_of_reflection \"Shield of reflection\") is avoided due to [encumbrance](/wiki/Encumbrance \"Encumbrance\"); moreover, it is avoided for two-weaponers and spellcasters. While ascending from the Sanctum with the Amulet of Yendor, your [quest artifacts](/wiki/Quest_artifacts \"Quest artifacts\") cannot be relied upon for protection as long as the [Wizard of Yendor](/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor \"Wizard of Yendor\") may steal them; that is also taken into account here.\n\n| Role                                              | [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\") | (2w) | Spellcasting | GDSM vs SDSM in the endgame                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|                                                   |                                                         |      |              | Ascending from the Sanctum                                                                                       | Astral Plane (no [Rodney](/wiki/Rodney \"Rodney\"))                                                                                                          |\n| [Archeologist](/wiki/Archeologist \"Archeologist\") | MR (carried)                                            | y    | medium       | SDSM (R) Cloak of magic resistance (MR)(MC1)\\* Amulet of life saving Two-weaponing                               | SDSM (R) Quest artifact (MR) Robe (MC2) Amulet of life saving Two-weaponing                                                                                |\n| [Barbarian](/wiki/Barbarian \"Barbarian\")          |                                                         | y    | low          | SDSM (R) Cloak of magic resistance (MR)(MC1)\\* Amulet of life saving Two-weaponing or two-handed artifact weapon |                                                                                                                                                            |\n| [Caveman](/wiki/Caveman \"Caveman\")                | MR (mace, wielded)                                      |      | low          | GDSM (MR) Shield of reflection (R) Cloak of protection (MC3) or robe (MC2) Amulet of life saving                 |                                                                                                                                                            |\n| [Healer](/wiki/Healer \"Healer\")                   |                                                         |      | high         | same as Barbarian (Two-handed artifact weapon)                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                            |\n| [Knight](/wiki/Knight \"Knight\")                   | MR (carried)                                            | y    | medium       | SDSM (R) Cloak of magic resistance (MR)(MC1) Amulet of life saving Two-weaponing                                 | SDSM (R) Quest Artifact (MR) Robe (MC2) Amulet of life saving Two-weaponing                                                                                |\n| [Monk](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\")                         | MR (lenses, worn)                                       |      | medium       | same as Knight (Beware of Monk to-hit penalties for wearing body armor)                                          | same as Knight (Beware of Monk to-hit penalties for wearing body armor.

Artifacts received through [wishing](/wiki/Wishing \"Wishing\")--which may provide [reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\") or [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\")--are not taken into account in any case.\n\nConclusion: GDSM is a solid choice for cavemen, priests, and rangers. For all other roles SDSM seems to be the more versatile choice--especially once wishing for additional MR artifacts is taken into account.\n\n## General\n\n### SLASH'EM\n\nIn general, one will still want to wish for GDSM or SDSM as a first wish in SLASH'EM, and all the above arguments apply much the same. However, lawful characters will prefer GDSM since they have access to minions including [movanic devas](/wiki/Movanic_deva \"Movanic deva\") beginning at level 7 and [monadic devas](/wiki/Monadic_deva \"Monadic deva\") beginning at level 10, both of whom have a 25% chance of being generated with a [shield of reflection](/wiki/Shield_of_reflection \"Shield of reflection\"), which can be obtained by allowing the minion to be killed (easily accomplished by bringing them near [the Oracle](/wiki/Oracle_\\(monster\\) \"Oracle (monster)\")) or by stealing it while polymorphed into a [nymph](/wiki/Nymph \"Nymph\"), [pixie](/wiki/Pixie \"Pixie\"), [quickling](/wiki/Quickling \"Quickling\"), or [brownie](/wiki/Brownie \"Brownie\"). Conversely, non-lawfuls will prefer SDSM as any [elven cloak](/wiki/Elven_cloak \"Elven cloak\") has a 1/4 chance of being upgraded to a [cloak of magic resistance](/wiki/Cloak_of_magic_resistance \"Cloak of magic resistance\") if #dipped in a [potion of gain level](/wiki/Potion_of_gain_level \"Potion of gain level\"), or upgraded with the gnome's [tinker](/wiki/Tinker \"Tinker\") technique.\n\nAdditionally, three types of dragon scale mail become useful in the later game, if one has other sources of magic resistance and reflection. These are [deep dragon scale mail](/wiki/Deep_dragon_scale_mail \"Deep dragon scale mail\") which provides [drain resistance](/wiki/Drain_resistance \"Drain resistance\"), [yellow dragon scale mail](/wiki/Yellow_dragon_scale_mail \"Yellow dragon scale mail\") which provides [acid resistance](/wiki/Acid_resistance \"Acid resistance\"), and [shimmering dragon scale mail](/wiki/Shimmering_dragon_scale_mail \"Shimmering dragon scale mail\") which provides [displacement](/wiki/Displacement \"Displacement\"). Drain resistance is a somewhat vital property in SLASH'EM, with [wands of draining](/wiki/Wand_of_draining \"Wand of draining\") being a prominent factor in the late game. However, SLASH'EM provides numerous other ways to get it, in addition to wielding [Excalibur](/wiki/Excalibur \"Excalibur\") or [Stormbringer](/wiki/Stormbringer \"Stormbringer\"). These include an [amulet of drain resistance](/wiki/Amulet_of_drain_resistance \"Amulet of drain resistance\"), some new artifact weapons, being a lycanthrope, necromancer, or undead slayer, or wielding [the Hand of Vecna](/wiki/The_Hand_of_Vecna_\\(SLASH%27EM\\) \"The Hand of Vecna (SLASH'EM)\") (which is an item all adventurers will want to get anyway). Acid resistance is more desirable in SLASH'EM because of monsters with very powerful acid attacks, including the feared [giant shoggoth](/wiki/Giant_shoggoth \"Giant shoggoth\"), and the [lab coat](/wiki/Lab_coat \"Lab coat\") (SLASH'EM's version of the [alchemy smock](/wiki/Alchemy_smock \"Alchemy smock\")) doesn't provide [MC](/wiki/MC \"MC\") 3. Finally, shimmering dragon scale mail makes it possible to get displacement without the [cloak](/wiki/Cloak_of_displacement \"Cloak of displacement\"), which also doesn't provide MC 3.\n\n### GruntHack\n\nIn [GruntHack](/wiki/GruntHack \"GruntHack\"), thanks to [object properties](/wiki/Object_properties \"Object properties\"), the discussion of GDSM vs. SDSM is superfluous. As you can wish for a dragonhide cloak of magic resistance of reflection which gives you an [AC](/wiki/AC \"AC\") 9 cloak with both properties, yellow dragon scale mail is usually a better choice, especially given that spellcasters may cast [acid blast](/wiki/Spellbook_of_acid_blast \"Spellbook of acid blast\") at you.\n\n[![This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.0.

GDSM provides <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a> and SDSM provides <a href=\"/wiki/Reflection\" title=\"Reflection\">reflection</a>, but it is not always clear which is better in any particular situation. If you intend to <a href=\"/wiki/Wish\" title=\"Wish\">wish</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Genocide#Reverse_genocide\" title=\"Genocide\">reverse-genocide</a> for dragon scale mail, you will need to decide which one is more appropriate.\n</p><p>Which armor is better largely depends on both playing style and one's current situation.  A player who has one extrinsic should almost always wish for the armor which provides the other, but when one has neither, it is dependent upon things such as current HP, conducts, pets, and general style. For example, if you get an early wish and are not adhering to any conducts or time-consuming strategies, SDSM is often better. This is because reflection provides immediate protection against the commonly encountered attack wands and breath weapons, while a player with only GDSM is not protected against rays of fire, lightning, cold, sleep, and disintegration unless they have already attained the proper resistances. \n</p><p>Sometimes the armor that would be most useful immediately is not the one that you intend to include in your <a href=\"/wiki/Ascension_kit\" title=\"Ascension kit\">ascension kit</a>.

However, lawful characters will prefer GDSM since they have access to minions including <a href=\"/wiki/Movanic_deva\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Movanic deva\">movanic devas</a> beginning at level 7 and <a href=\"/wiki/Monadic_deva\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Monadic deva\">monadic devas</a> beginning at level 10, both of whom have a 25% chance of being generated with a <a href=\"/wiki/Shield_of_reflection\" title=\"Shield of reflection\">shield of reflection</a>, which can be obtained by allowing the minion to be killed (easily accomplished by bringing them near <a href=\"/wiki/Oracle_(monster)\" title=\"Oracle (monster)\">the Oracle</a>) or by stealing it while polymorphed into a <a href=\"/wiki/Nymph\" title=\"Nymph\">nymph</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Pixie\" title=\"Pixie\">pixie</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Quickling\" title=\"Quickling\">quickling</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Brownie\" title=\"Brownie\">brownie</a>. Conversely, non-lawfuls will prefer SDSM as any <a href=\"/wiki/Elven_cloak\" title=\"Elven cloak\">elven cloak</a> has a 1/4 chance of being upgraded to a <a href=\"/wiki/Cloak_of_magic_resistance\" title=\"Cloak of magic resistance\">cloak of magic resistance</a> if #dipped in a <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_gain_level\" title=\"Potion of gain level\">potion of gain level</a>, or upgraded with the gnome's <a href=\"/wiki/Tinker\" title=\"Tinker\">tinker</a> technique.\n</p><p>Additionally, three types of dragon scale mail become useful in the later game, if one has other sources of magic resistance and reflection.  These are <a href=\"/wiki/Deep_dragon_scale_mail\" title=\"Deep dragon scale mail\">deep dragon scale mail</a> which provides <a href=\"/wiki/Drain_resistance\" title=\"Drain resistance\">drain resistance</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Yellow_dragon_scale_mail\" title=\"Yellow dragon scale mail\">yellow dragon scale mail</a> which provides <a href=\"/wiki/Acid_resistance\" title=\"Acid resistance\">acid resistance</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Shimmering_dragon_scale_mail\" title=\"Shimmering dragon scale mail\">shimmering dragon scale mail</a> which provides <a href=\"/wiki/Displacement\" title=\"Displacement\">displacement</a>. Drain resistance is a somewhat vital property in SLASH'EM, with <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_draining\" title=\"Wand of draining\">wands of draining</a> being a prominent factor in the late game.  However, SLASH'EM provides numerous other ways to get it, in addition to wielding <a href=\"/wiki/Excalibur\" title=\"Excalibur\">Excalibur</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Stormbringer\" title=\"Stormbringer\">Stormbringer</a>.  These include an <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_drain_resistance\" title=\"Amulet of drain resistance\">amulet of drain resistance</a>, some new artifact weapons, being a lycanthrope, necromancer, or undead slayer, or wielding <a href=\"/wiki/The_Hand_of_Vecna_(SLASH%27EM)\" title=\"The Hand of Vecna (SLASH&#39;EM)\">the Hand of Vecna</a> (which is an item all adventurers will want to get anyway). Acid resistance is more desirable in SLASH'EM because of monsters with very powerful acid attacks, including the feared <a href=\"/wiki/Giant_shoggoth\" title=\"Giant shoggoth\">giant shoggoth</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Lab_coat\" title=\"Lab coat\">lab coat</a> (SLASH'EM's version of the <a href=\"/wiki/Alchemy_smock\" title=\"Alchemy smock\">alchemy smock</a>) doesn't provide <a href=\"/wiki/MC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"MC\">MC</a> 3. Finally, shimmering dragon scale mail makes it possible to get displacement without the <a href=\"/wiki/Cloak_of_displacement\" title=\"Cloak of displacement\">cloak</a>, which also doesn't provide MC 3.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"GruntHack\">GruntHack</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/GruntHack\" title=\"GruntHack\">GruntHack</a>, thanks to <a href=\"/wiki/Object_properties\" title=\"Object properties\">object properties</a>, the discussion of GDSM vs. SDSM is superfluous. As you can wish for a dragonhide cloak of magic resistance of reflection which gives you an <a href=\"/wiki/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a> 9 cloak with both properties, yellow dragon scale mail is usually a better choice, especially given that spellcasters may cast <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_acid_blast\" title=\"Spellbook of acid blast\">acid blast</a> at you.\n</p>\n<div style=\"display:none; right:10px; padding-bottom: 17px\" class=\"metadata topicon nopopups\"><div style=\"margin-top: -10px\"><a href=\"/wiki/NetHackWiki:Next_version\" title=\"This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.0.

dragon scale mail]] (GDSM) and [[silver dragon scale mail]] (SDSM) are considered the two best suits of [[armor]] in the game. GDSM provides [[magic resistance]] and SDSM provides [[reflection]], but it is not always clear which is better in any particular situation. If you intend to [[wish]] or [[genocide#Reverse genocide|reverse-genocide]] for dragon scale mail, you will need to decide which one is more appropriate.\n\nWhich armor is better largely depends on both playing style and one's current situation.  A player who has one extrinsic should almost always wish for the armor which provides the other, but when one has neither, it is dependent upon things such as current HP, conducts, pets, and general style. For example, if you get an early wish and are not adhering to any conducts or time-consuming strategies, SDSM is often better. This is because reflection provides immediate protection against the commonly encountered attack wands and breath weapons, while a player with only GDSM is not protected against rays of fire, lightning, cold, sleep, and disintegration unless they have already attained the proper resistances. \n\nSometimes the armor that would be most useful immediately is not the one that you intend to include in your [[ascension kit]]. In this case, you must choose between maximizing immediate utility, and conserving wishes in the long run.\n\n{{todo|Update article in general, make sure it and any added citations are up-to-date, account for <nowiki>{{upcoming}}</nowiki> [[3.7.0]] stuff, add more variants and mention dtsund-patch.}}\n\n==Gray dragon scale mail==\n* Magic resistance protects against many [[monster spell]]s, including particularly nasty ones such as destroy armor and touch of death.\n** ''Monsters capable of casting the more dangerous spells (such as [[golden naga]]s and [[lich]]es) usually only appear relatively close to the [[castle]]. There, you will have more opportunity to wish for magic resistance.''\n** ''Bear in mind that attack spells generally require the monster to be in melee range, so careful use of missile attacks and/or [[Elbereth]] can mitigate this danger to some extent.''\n* Magic resistance protects you from [[wand of striking|wands of striking]], which cannot be reflected.\n** ''Wands of striking do much less damage than the elemental wands, and will not damage your equipment.''\n* Magic resistance provides protection from teleport and level-teleport traps, which can place unwary characters in dangerous situations.\n** ''Level teleporters are more likely to take you up. Fully exploring levels top-down makes those destinations safe.''\n* Magic resistance provides full protection from [[polymorph trap]]s, and allows you to safely displace your [[pet]]s onto them.\n** ''SDSM provides partial protection against polytraps: you will turn into a [[silver dragon]], trashing your shirt and cloak but keeping your armor. This will not protect you or your armor against subsequent polymorphs while in silver dragon form. Polymorphing in this way will revert your scale mail back to scales, negating much of its AC bonus, but not the extrinsic. Also, neither suit protects against polymorphs caused by [[lycanthropy]].''\n*** ''Low-level players will rehumanize quickly, and a silver dragon is a good fighting form until then.''\n*** ''[[Lycanthropy]] can be almost completely prevented by [[magic cancellation]], and cured e.g. by prayer.''\n* Reflection is usually easier to obtain without wishing than magic resistance, particularly because of the possible [[amulet of reflection]] in [[Sokoban]] and the possible [[shield of reflection]] on [[Medusa's Island]]. Spending a wish or genocide scroll on GDSM makes it easier to obtain both properties, since magic resistance would usually be obtained by wishing for a [[cloak of magic resistance]] or [[quest artifact]] anyway.''\n** ''Medusa's shield only comes rather late in the game, and close to the Castle wand of wishing.''\n* Obtaining magic resistance from your suit frees up your [[cloak]] slot. This allows you to wear something more useful, such as a [[robe]] or [[oilskin cloak]].\n** ''On the other hand, you will need to employ an [[amulet of reflection|amulet]], [[shield of reflection|shield]], or the [[Longbow of Diana]] for reflection.''\n* [[Crowning]], should the player have access to it, will protect against the wands that magic resistance gives no defense against.\n** ''The player still needs to protect their items in open inventory from damage. It is difficult to crown without obtaining a [[luckstone]]. Crowning does not grant [[disintegration resistance]].''\n* [[Chaotic]] players cannot get magic resistance by wishing for another role's [[quest artifact]].\n** ''Chaotic [[monk]]s and [[wizard]]s are still guaranteed a magic resistance artifact in their own Quest.''\n\n== Silver dragon scale mail ==\n\n* Reflection protects you and your equipment from wands and breath attacks of fire, cold, and lightning, which are rather common and can deal tremendous amounts of damage.\n** ''You can protect scrolls and potions against only fire and cold by placing them in a container. Rings and wands kept at the ready will still be vulnerable to lightning. In particular, only SDSM protects your [[escape items]].''\n* Reflection protects you from a [[black dragon]]'s disintegration breath.\n** ''A shield will be disintegrated first, which usually gives you enough time to [[escape item|escape]] or leave the line of fire.''\n** ''[[Disintegration resistance]] can also protect you and your armor, but is difficult to obtain without defeating a black dragon.''\n* Reflection protects you from wands and breath attacks of sleep.\n** ''[[Sleep resistance]] will also protect you from these.''\n* Accidentally attacking a [[floating eye]] will not paralyze you.\n** ''Careful play will usually prevent floating eye accidents, as will a [[ring of free action]].''\n* While both suits protect against a [[wand of death]], reflection gives a chance of killing the zapper on a [[rebound]], preventing him from wasting valuable charges.\n** ''This does not apply to [[Orcus]], who is a demon and therefore immune to his own wand of death.''\n* Obtaining reflection from your suit frees up your [[amulet]] and off-hand slots. This allows you to wear another amulet (such as [[amulet of life saving|life saving]]), and potentially allows [[two weapon combat]] and combat spellcasting.\n** ''On the other hand, you will need to employ a [[cloak of magic resistance|cloak]], a (possibly wished-for) [[quest artifact]] or [[Magicbane]] for magic resistance.''\n\n== Strategy ==\nIn the early game, the player has few, if any, elemental resistances and low max HP. This makes silver dragon scale mail almost invariably the better choice at this point in the game. Players who reach the [[Castle]] and obtain the [[wand of wishing]] have a wealth of resources at their disposal, and can be more flexible with their [[ascension kit]].\n\nIn the end game as well, SDSM is usually the better choice. The table below attempts to clarify the decision by prioritizing the need for [[Magic resistance]] (MR), [[Reflection]] (R), [[Magic cancellation]] (MC), [[Two-weaponing]] (2w), and [[spellcasting]] in the endgame. It attempts to make the amulet slot available for an [[amulet of life saving]], the shield hand free for two-weaponing, and the cloak slot open for a [[robe]] or [[cloak of protection]]. For those labelled \"medium\" under the spellcasting column, a [[robe]] is prioritized. A [[shield of reflection]] is avoided due to [[encumbrance]]; moreover, it is avoided for two-weaponers and spellcasters. While ascending from the Sanctum with the Amulet of Yendor, your [[quest artifacts]] cannot be relied upon for protection as long as the [[Wizard of Yendor]] may steal them; that is also taken into account here.\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" | Role\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:smaller;\"| [[quest artifact]] \n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:smaller;\"| (2w)\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:smaller;\"| Spellcasting\n!colspan=\"2\" | GDSM vs SDSM in the endgame\n|-\n! style=\"font-size:smaller;\"| Ascending from the Sanctum\n! style=\"font-size:smaller;\"| Astral Plane (no [[Rodney]])\n|-\n| [[Archeologist]]\n| MR (carried)\n| y\n| medium\n| SDSM (R)<br>\nCloak of magic resistance (MR)(MC1)*<br>\nAmulet of life saving<br>\nTwo-weaponing\n| SDSM (R)<br>\nQuest artifact (MR)<br>\nRobe (MC2)<br>\nAmulet of life saving<br>\nTwo-weaponing\n|-\n| [[Barbarian]]\n| \n| y\n| low\n|colspan=\"2\" | SDSM (R)<br>\nCloak of magic resistance (MR)(MC1)*<br>\nAmulet of life saving<br>\nTwo-weaponing or two-handed artifact weapon\n|-\n| [[Caveman]]\n| MR (mace, wielded)\n| \n| low\n|colspan=\"2\" | GDSM (MR)<br>\nShield of reflection (R)<br>\nCloak of protection (MC3) or robe (MC2)<br>\nAmulet of life saving\n|-\n| [[Healer]]\n| \n| \n| high\n|colspan=\"2\" | same as Barbarian<br>\n(Two-handed artifact weapon)\n|-\n| [[Knight]]\n| MR (carried)\n| y\n| medium\n| SDSM (R)<br>\nCloak of magic resistance (MR)(MC1)<br>\nAmulet of life saving<br>\nTwo-weaponing\n| SDSM (R)<br>\nQuest Artifact (MR)<br>\nRobe (MC2)<br>\nAmulet of life saving<br>\nTwo-weaponing\n|-\n| [[Monk]]\n| MR (lenses, worn)\n| \n| medium\n| same as Knight<br>\n(Beware of Monk to-hit penalties for wearing body armor)\n| same as Knight<br>\n(Beware of Monk to-hit penalties for wearing body armor.

Artifacts received through [[wishing]]--which may provide [[reflection]] or [[magic resistance]]--are  not taken into account in any case.<br>\n<br>\n\nConclusion: GDSM is a solid choice for cavemen, priests, and rangers. For all other roles SDSM seems to be the more versatile choice--especially once wishing for additional MR artifacts is taken into account.\n\n==General==\n===SLASH'EM===\nIn general, one will still want to wish for GDSM or SDSM as a first wish in SLASH'EM, and all the above arguments apply much the same. However, lawful characters will prefer GDSM since they have access to minions including [[movanic deva]]s beginning at level 7 and [[monadic deva]]s beginning at level 10, both of whom have a 25% chance of being generated with a [[shield of reflection]], which can be obtained by allowing the minion to be killed (easily accomplished by bringing them near [[Oracle (monster)|the Oracle]]) or by stealing it while polymorphed into a [[nymph]], [[pixie]], [[quickling]], or [[brownie]]. Conversely, non-lawfuls will prefer SDSM as any [[elven cloak]] has a 1/4 chance of being upgraded to a [[cloak of magic resistance]] if #dipped in a [[potion of gain level]], or upgraded with the gnome's [[tinker]] technique.\n\nAdditionally, three types of dragon scale mail become useful in the later game, if one has other sources of magic resistance and reflection.  These are [[deep dragon scale mail]] which provides [[drain resistance]], [[yellow dragon scale mail]] which provides [[acid resistance]], and [[shimmering dragon scale mail]] which provides [[displacement]]. Drain resistance is a somewhat vital property in SLASH'EM, with [[wand of draining|wands of draining]] being a prominent factor in the late game.  However, SLASH'EM provides numerous other ways to get it, in addition to wielding [[Excalibur]] or [[Stormbringer]].  These include an [[amulet of drain resistance]], some new artifact weapons, being a lycanthrope, necromancer, or undead slayer, or wielding [[The Hand of Vecna (SLASH'EM)|the Hand of Vecna]] (which is an item all adventurers will want to get anyway). Acid resistance is more desirable in SLASH'EM because of monsters with very powerful acid attacks, including the feared [[giant shoggoth]], and the [[lab coat]] (SLASH'EM's version of the [[alchemy smock]]) doesn't provide [[MC]] 3. Finally, shimmering dragon scale mail makes it possible to get displacement without the [[cloak of displacement|cloak]], which also doesn't provide MC 3.\n\n===GruntHack===\nIn [[GruntHack]], thanks to [[object properties]], the discussion of GDSM vs. SDSM is superfluous. As you can wish for a dragonhide cloak of magic resistance of reflection which gives you an [[AC]] 9 cloak with both properties, yellow dragon scale mail is usually a better choice, especially given that spellcasters may cast {{spell of|acid blast}} at you.\n{{nethack-360}}\n[[Category:Strategy]]\n[[Category:Dragon armor]]"}

{"title":"Lessons learned the hard way","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Lessons_learned_the_hard_way","type":"markdown","data":"[![](/images/f/f4/You_die....png)](/wiki/File:You_die....png)\n\nYou die...(again)\n\n**Lessons learned the hard way** was a set of statements hosted by [Rodney](/wiki/Rodney_\\(bot\\) \"Rodney (bot)\"). It eventually became so large that it had to be removed from the database, as Rodney would become unresponsive to everyone else whenever someone requested the entry. Prior to eventually being moved onto [NetHackWiki](/wiki/NetHackWiki \"NetHackWiki\"), it was hosted by [GreyKnight](/wiki/GreyKnight \"GreyKnight\").\n\nThe lessons old and new alike are listed below, loosely sorted by dungeon branch. Some of the lessons don't apply to post-[3.4.3](/wiki/3.4.3 \"3.4.3\") versions of NetHack, but may still apply to variants based on older versions.\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 The lessons](#The_lessons)\n\n  - [1.1 Dungeons of Doom](#Dungeons_of_Doom)\n  - [1.2 Gnomish Mines](#Gnomish_Mines)\n  - [1.3 Sokoban](#Sokoban)\n  - [1.4 Medusa's Island](#Medusa.27s_Island)\n  - [1.5 Quest](#Quest)\n  - [1.6 Castle](#Castle)\n  - [1.7 Gehennom](#Gehennom)\n  - [1.8 Ascension run](#Ascension_run)\n\n- [2 See also](#See_also)\n\n## The lessons\n\n### [Dungeons of Doom](/wiki/Dungeons_of_Doom \"Dungeons of Doom\")\n\n- Don't try to cancel your own spellcasting by pressing Escape, especially when polypiling. Skipping the direction prompt releases the magic power to the previously used direction!\n\n- When you get a blessed [scroll of genocide](/wiki/Scroll_of_genocide \"Scroll of genocide\"), @ means you, even when you aren't a human.\n  - Commentary: Besides, many important @ monsters (such as [shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeepers \"Shopkeepers\")) can't be genocided anyway.\n\n- A blessed scroll of genocide will wipe out all species in a monster class, even if you explicitly specify a single species. Don't try to use one to genocide (master) mind flayers if you're a dwarf.\n\n- Sleep rays bounce, and elves don't start with sleep resistance.\n\n- \"Huh. Didn't know a [bag of tricks](/wiki/Bag_of_tricks \"Bag of tricks\") would explode a [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\").\"\n\n- You have to really be INSIDE a temple for sanctuary to work. The door isn't good enough.\n  - Commentary: Unless the monsters are inside the temple too.\n    - ...in which case they'll just flee from you, though they'll still try to use ranged attacks.\n\n- Don't wear [levitation](/wiki/Levitation \"Levitation\") items until you need them. They deprive you of [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") and other useful escapes.\n\n- Don't panic. Always know where your [towel](/wiki/Towel \"Towel\") is.\n\n- Be very careful with uncontrolled [teleportitis](/wiki/Teleportitis \"Teleportitis\") and [quantum mechanics](/wiki/Quantum_mechanic \"Quantum mechanic\") in stores!\n  - Commentary: [Drop your gold first.](/wiki/Teleportitis#Shopping_with_uncontrolled_teleportitis \"Teleportitis\")\n\n- Never eat [tins](/wiki/Tin \"Tin\") in shops whilst wielding potentially expensive [artifacts](/wiki/Artifact \"Artifact\"). Also don't let [nymphs](/wiki/Nymph \"Nymph\") get near you.\n  - Commentary: Doubly true if you're in the [black market](/wiki/Black_market \"Black market\").\n\n- Remember, \"Thou shalt not worship graven images\"\n\n- Never sacrifice something you can't touch! Attempting to lure a [cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") onto an [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\") for sacrifice with the idea that you can do so without touching it will cause you to develop a stony appearance without the chance to eat a [lizard](/wiki/Lizard \"Lizard\").\n\n- Don't carry [wands](/wiki/Wand \"Wand\")/[scrolls](/wiki/Scroll \"Scroll\")/[potions](/wiki/Potion \"Potion\") outside bags. Nothing like standing on the [vibrating square](/wiki/Vibrating_square \"Vibrating square\") with the [Bell of Opening](/wiki/Bell_of_Opening \"Bell of Opening\") (0:0), complaining about exploding [wand of cancellation](/wiki/Wand_of_cancellation \"Wand of cancellation\") and [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\") and not having a [scroll of charging](/wiki/Scroll_of_charging \"Scroll of charging\") handy, or losing that brand new, unused wand of wishing to an [electric eel](/wiki/Electric_eel \"Electric eel\").\n\n  - Commentary: Or at least minimize the vulnerable [items](/wiki/Item \"Item\") you have out. It is worth risking a few [escape items](/wiki/Escape_item \"Escape item\") to have them ready when you really need them.\n  - Also you better be sure you've identified the [wand of cancellation](/wiki/Wand_of_cancellation \"Wand of cancellation\") before you accidentally put one in a [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\").\n\n- If you have crappy ISP, NEVER reconnect to server right after you got your Internet connection back. There can still be some glitches with it.\n\n- NetHack doesn't know about arrows/function/home/end/page up/page down keys and treats them as escape. Therefore **don't try to edit your [wishes](/wiki/Wish \"Wish\") with them.**\n  - Commentary: NetHack 3.6 lets you clear the input with escape, as did [NAO](/wiki/NAO \"NAO\") before.\n\n- NEVER leave [fragile](/wiki/Fragile \"Fragile\") items (such as potions) unattended when there are intelligent foes around. [Wand of striking](/wiki/Wand_of_striking \"Wand of striking\") == BOOM!\n\n- NEVER skip messages with space. Ever. Especially when handling petrifying monsters.\n\n- When you have a laggy connection, NEVER type the next command before you see how the previous one ended.\n\n- When running from a nasty monster, go back the way you came.\n\n- Be careful of what items are marked as 'y' and 'n' in your inventory to avoid confusion with yes/no prompts. For example, trying to eat something on the ground while [levitating](/wiki/Levitating \"Levitating\") by typing 'ey' quickly will have disastrous effects if your inventory contains 'y - a [cockatrice corpse](/wiki/Cockatrice_corpse \"Cockatrice corpse\")'.\n  - Commentary: Watch out in the [spells](/wiki/Spell \"Spell\") menu too; double tapping \"y\" and casting a spell without seeing which one it was could put you in an interesting predicament. Was it [FOD](/wiki/Spellbook_of_finger_of_death \"Spellbook of finger of death\")? [Poly](/wiki/Spellbook_of_polymorph \"Spellbook of polymorph\")? Or maybe [extra healing](/wiki/Spellbook_of_extra_healing \"Spellbook of extra healing\")?\n\n- Be careful of what items are marked as direction-moving keys in your inventory, in case you miss a key, so instead of 'ahky' (apply h-a key north Unlock the door? yes) you hit 'aky' (apply k-a wand of cancellation Really break your wand of cancellation? yes)\n\n- When hiding in a [shop](/wiki/Shop \"Shop\") to recover [HP](/wiki/HP \"HP\"), make sure to [rest](/wiki/Rest \"Rest\") instead of [search](/wiki/Search \"Search\") to avoid finding (and waking) [mimics](/wiki/Mimic \"Mimic\").\n\n- Make sure comestibles (esp. [rubber chickens](/wiki/Rubber_chicken \"Rubber chicken\")) aren't assigned 'e', wands aren't assigned 'z' or 'a', potions aren't assigned 'q', scrolls and spellbooks aren't assigned 'r', tools aren't assigned 'a', weapons that might be cursed aren't assigned 'w', armor that might be cursed isn't assigned 'W', rings that might be cursed aren't assigned 'P', etc.\n\n- When the ground around you looks the same except for being a different color, examine it with [/](/wiki/What_is \"What is\") or [;](/wiki/; \";\") before stepping there.\n\n- Don't try to polymorph a merely annoying monster just to get it out of your way; save your charges (or mana) for things that are just about to kill you, since the creature it becomes might be something deadly. (StormEagle, [blue jelly](/wiki/Blue_jelly \"Blue jelly\") => [ice devil](/wiki/Ice_devil \"Ice devil\"); nabru, [wood nymph](/wiki/Wood_nymph \"Wood nymph\") => [demilich](/wiki/Demilich \"Demilich\") and [floating eye](/wiki/Floating_eye \"Floating eye\") => [Aleax](/wiki/Aleax \"Aleax\")).\n\n- If you [levelport](/wiki/Levelport \"Levelport\"), angry shopkeepers are somehow able to levelport with you.\n  - Commentary: Because they are [followers](/wiki/Follower \"Follower\") like pets and most human monsters. Make sure you get some distance between you and the angry shopkeep before attempting to levelport.\n\n- There is a vital difference between '<[god](/wiki/God \"God\")> is displeased' due to praying too soon, and praying on the wrong altar or with negative [luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\")/[alignment](/wiki/Alignment \"Alignment\"). Only the first one makes your god [angry](/wiki/Angry \"Angry\").\n  - Commentary: Is this really true? Also, a water prayer on a cross-aligned altar will make your god angry.\n\n- If you are being held/crushed by an [owlbear](/wiki/Owlbear \"Owlbear\"), zapping down with a [wand of digging](/wiki/Wand_of_digging \"Wand of digging\") is not as effective as you might think. Engrave [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") with it instead...\n\n- If you leave [skeleton keys](/wiki/Skeleton_key \"Skeleton key\") (but not [lock picks](/wiki/Lock_pick \"Lock pick\") or [credit cards](/wiki/Credit_card \"Credit card\")) lying around, monsters that can open doors are smart enough to pick them up and unlock doors with them.\n\n- For beginners: if your HP shows as yellow or red (with the [statuscolors patch](/wiki/Statuscolors \"Statuscolors\")), you have the [spell of healing](/wiki/Spell_of_healing \"Spell of healing\") and you have enough power to cast it, do so. You'll never know which [gnome](/wiki/Gnome \"Gnome\") has the [wand of lightning](/wiki/Wand_of_lightning \"Wand of lightning\")/[cold](/wiki/Wand_of_cold \"Wand of cold\")/[fire](/wiki/Wand_of_fire \"Wand of fire\").\n  - Commentary: Of course, if said [gnome](/wiki/Gnome \"Gnome\") [happens to have a](/wiki/GWTWOD \"GWTWOD\") [wand of death](/wiki/Wand_of_death \"Wand of death\") it won't matter anyway.\n\n- If you're trying for #conduct weaponless, just leave pick-axes on the ground. Don't even bother to put them in your BoH. Use wands of digging instead (which are not wielded). If you're going for #conduct pacifist, wield a cream pie and never let go. Rely on 5 to move.\n  - Commentary: (Unless VERY careful: this means thinking for 5 seconds before every move.) You can remap the movement keys to use [5](/wiki/5 \"5\") or [m](/wiki/M \"M\") to cut down on accidents.\n\n- Never underestimate a [bones](/wiki/Bones \"Bones\") level.\n\n- Get a second or third opinion. ALWAYS.\n\n- Don't stone-to-flesh statues from a bones file. They are likely to be well-armed and armored.\n\n- If a [zombie](/wiki/Zombie \"Zombie\") of your race dies on your [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\") during a sacfest, move the human corpse away *before* trying to sacrifice anything.\n  - Commentary: Rotted corpses still anger [gods](/wiki/God \"God\").\n\n- Don't just try on unidentified rings if you're near a priest or any other friendly \"@\". If that [ring](/wiki/Ring \"Ring\") turns out to be [conflict](/wiki/Ring_of_conflict \"Ring of conflict\"), you won't live to regret it.\n  - Commentary: Unless you know it isn't conflict. Other powerful or threatening peaceful monsters, not just \"@\", are also to be avoided, though trying on an unidentified ring near a weak peaceful monster is a good way to identify conflict. Also, priests will wield their weapons before attacking; you can watch for this from a safe distance and take the ring off as soon as they do.\n\n- Locking a door will not do much if you leave a pick axe or mattock immediately outside it.\n  - Commentary: In NetHack 3.4.3, engrave [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") under the pick, since all digging monsters respect that.\n\n- When attacking a [gas spore](/wiki/Gas_spore \"Gas spore\"), make sure your pet isn't within the range of the explosion when the spore dies. It will count as if you killed the pet.\n  - Commentary: Unless your [pet](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\") can survive the 4d6. This also applies to aligned priests—losing the only co-aligned temple in your entire dungeon is a real bummer.\n\n- Don't try to polymorph at experience level 1 or 2, unless you like being killed by unsuccessful polymorphs.\n  - Commentary: The [polyself bug](/wiki/Polyself_bug \"Polyself bug\") was one reason you might actually want to do this.\n\n- Don't zap your kitten with a wand of polymorph. It may die from [system shock](/wiki/System_shock \"System shock\") and you will have killed it.\n  - Commentary: Prefer a [polymorph trap](/wiki/Polymorph_trap \"Polymorph trap\")—it will not kill, and you can retry indefinitely.\n\n- Before you kick in a locked door, make sure it's not attached to a [shop](/wiki/Shop \"Shop\"), lest you anger the shopkeeper.\n\n  - Commentary: Check for the \"Closed for inventory\" engraving (in dust) outside the [door](/wiki/Door \"Door\"). Unlocking the door is okay though, and open shops (even empty ones) never close.\n  - Note, this means you must never kick down any doors while blind unless you already know they are not shop doors!\n\n- When waiting for monsters to show up and force you back into human form, don't wander away from your only weapon just because you couldn't carry it.\n  - Commentary: Try throwing that weapon upwards.\n\n- When in a zoo, fight [shriekers](/wiki/Shrieker \"Shrieker\") and [gas spores](/wiki/Gas_spore \"Gas spore\") last.\n  - Commentary: If you can avoid killing them, [yellow lights](/wiki/Yellow_light \"Yellow light\"), [black lights](/wiki/Black_light \"Black light\"), [freezing spheres](/wiki/Freezing_sphere \"Freezing sphere\"), [flaming spheres](/wiki/Flaming_sphere \"Flaming sphere\"), and [shocking spheres](/wiki/Shocking_sphere \"Shocking sphere\") should also be left for last. Never kick down treasure zoo doors, else *every* monster inside will wake up (unless you plan on using conflict or something).\n\n- Pause every time you see a monster. Watching the contents of your inventory, or what you are [polymorphed](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") into, is free. Thinking of a tactic is also free. Going toe-to-toe with a [footrice](/wiki/Footrice \"Footrice\") when you're poly'd into a [master mind flayer](/wiki/Master_mind_flayer \"Master mind flayer\") is priceless.\n\n- [Werecreatures](/wiki/Werecreatures \"Werecreatures\") are considered [human](/wiki/Human \"Human\"). Sacrificing werecreatures is a good idea only if you are chaotic or playing an elf/orc/dwarf/gnome.\n\n  - Commentary: Werecreatures return to human form upon death in [SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\").\n  - Moreover, [doppelgangers](/wiki/Doppelganger \"Doppelganger\") are considered human, too.\n\n- [Chameleons](/wiki/Chameleon \"Chameleon\") leave brown corpses. They can also impersonate monsters which leave brown corpses.\n\n- If you're confused in a shop and standing next to the shopkeeper with your very promising character, keep doing nothing for as long as it takes. Yes I know it's only a 1 in 8 chance. Yes it will kill you. [Stunning](/wiki/Stun \"Stun\") is even worse.\n  - Commentary: The same may happen for blind characters without telepathy. The [m](/wiki/M \"M\") prefix to [movement](/wiki/Movement \"Movement\") commands is only safe if you can detect the shopkeeper, even as I—you will say \"Pardon me\" instead of attacking.\n\n- A [bugle](/wiki/Bugle \"Bugle\") is not a good tool for a [knight](/wiki/Knight \"Knight\") to use to wake sleeping monsters—especially in [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\").\n  - Commentary: Bugling in Minetown is not recommended for any other role, either, if any of the watch are still alive.\n\n- Never use force bolt in a level with a shop ([you hear the chime of a cash register](/wiki/You_hear_the_chime_of_a_cash_register \"You hear the chime of a cash register\")) if you haven't explored the area in the direction you're shooting if you can't pay for broken things, unless you can fight the shopkeeper.\n\n- Engraving with wands is useful. If you get the message \"The bugs on the floor stop moving!\", more often than not, it will be a wand of sleep, but rarely it can be a wand of death. Don't zap it at walls that can reflect back to you. It will be that wand of death.\n\n  - Commentary: All walls reflect [rays](/wiki/Ray \"Ray\"). Death and sleep can be distinguished via price-ID. Also, even if it isn't, putting yourself to sleep is quite dangerous too—allowing yourself to possibly get hit by the wand is only safe if you have [reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\") or can deal with both effects.\n  - Commentary: In a nutshell, when reflection is involved, don't dish out what you can't take.\n\n- Do not pray on an cross-aligned altar when you are starving. You stomach won't change, but your prayer timeout will.\n\n- When you accidentally get [water moccasins](/wiki/Water_moccasin \"Water moccasin\") from a fountain, run. Don't fight, run.\n  - Commentary: Unless you deliberately drank from the fountain and are capable of handling them. Ordinary [snakes](/wiki/Snake_\\(monster_class\\) \"Snake (monster class)\") are functionally identical to water moccasins, minus appearing in groups.\n\n- Go ahead - leave [autopickup](/wiki/Autopickup \"Autopickup\") on. It's handy until you walk over that [footrice](/wiki/Footrice \"Footrice\") corpse without gloves.\n  - Configuring [pickup\\_types](/wiki/Pickup_types \"Pickup types\") or better yet [autopickup exceptions](/wiki/Autopickup_exception \"Autopickup exception\") gives you the best of both worlds.\n\n- Don't fight the [soldier ant](/wiki/Soldier_ant \"Soldier ant\") fairly. Just don't.\n\n- In NetHackW (graphical version) please remember to turn off auto-pickup. It's nice until you find a statue. You wonder why you can't pick up anything when *You see here 57 gold coins. There is nothing here to pick up.* Or *You see here a statue. You can barely move a hand's reach with this load!*\n  - Commentary: Or set pickup\\_types, or [pickup\\_burden](/wiki/Pickup_burden \"Pickup burden\"). Or compile in and set autopickup exceptions.\n\n- Be sure to identify wands before zapping them at enemies, especially if you're zapping an unknown wand of make invisible at a nymph!\n\n- For crying out loud, don't kick down doors if they have an engraving in front of them! Even if it's *??o?? f? I???t???*.\n  - Commentary: A bones level may have a pre-eroded engraving. Or you may have stepped on it and not noticed.\n\n- If you find a dead end, don't hold down **s**. It'll just make things worse if you encounter a monster and are still searching.\n  - Commentary: Use a [numeric prefix](/wiki/Numeric_prefix \"Numeric prefix\") instead, like n10s or just 10s if using vikeys.\n\n- When you find a [small mimic](/wiki/Small_mimic \"Small mimic\") in a shop, be sure to attack it, not the shopkeeper! There's no way to say that you meant to hit the mimic!\n\n- Similarly, when attacking a mimic with wands or spells, check your [rebound](/wiki/Rebound \"Rebound\") path every single time. The shopkeeper does not stand still while you're fighting.\n\n- When playing NAO, if you get lag, don't just keep pressing buttons; once the prompt has stopped lagging, I guarantee you will have the message, *\"Do you want your possessions identified? \\[yn]\\(n)\"*\n\n- If you're multi-tasking with NetHack, be sure you're in the chat box with your friend(s) and not still on the NetHack command prompt. \"r u playing nethack again?\" yes (**y**: *Unknown extended command* **e**: *What do you want to eat? \\[acdsR-?\\*]* **s**: *A cockatrice corpse. Do you want your possessions identified?*)\n\n- Engraving with your fingers in the dust is fine unless your Elbereth happens to be E**¦**bereth.\n  - Commentary: Always, always check your writing with [:](/wiki/Colon \"Colon\") (but not if you are blind, in which case that will use a turn).\n\n- Just because you survived that rolling boulder trap DOES NOT mean you or your pet will survive it again.\n\n- If you fall through a trap door into a vault without a pickaxe or wand of digging, don't keep saying that your name is Croesus; the vault doesn't have a kitchen, refrigerator, or any other type of food producing place that you'd find in your house.\n\n- When casting force bolt, be sure that there are no pets, shopkeepers, guards, etc. behind what you're hitting. Or nymphs — you'll break their (likely) potion of object detection and incur a loss of luck.\n  - Commentary: You're thinking of a [mirror](/wiki/Mirror \"Mirror\"), which they also carry often.\n\n- Don't put every single damn piece of armor, gloves, or shoes you find on! Sure they might not be cursed, but when you do put them on, they'll be cursed. Every single time!\n  - Commentary: Unless you have the spell of remove curse and enough power. Try pet-testing also.\n\n- Make sure to remove that [ring of conflict](/wiki/Ring_of_conflict \"Ring of conflict\") you might be wearing before you enter a shop.\n\n- Eating a chickatrice corpse does not make you petrification resistant.\n\n- If you're kicking things off traps, make sure you aren't low on HP, and are strong.\n\n- Even if you happen to be wearing a ring of polymorph control, don't try to polymorph (quaffing sinks ...) when you are a low level (like XL1) - you risk death from [system shock](/wiki/System_shock \"System shock\") or from level drain after feeling like a new man/elf/orc.\n  - Commentary: Polymorph control protects you from system shock, but you still have a 8% chance of fatal level drain.\n\n- So wait, I'm NOT supposed to use that fireball scroll while hallucinating?\n\n- Don't eat eggs unless you're sure of what's in them. Just because you haven't seen any cockatrices yet doesn't mean the egg is safe.\n\n- Don't bang on the keyboard, you'll just be angrier.\n\n- And don't rest on the keyboard as well!\n\n- Have a laptop? Move carefully!\n\n- Attacking a floating eye isn't fatal... unless there might be a powerful monster nearby...\n  - Commentary: If you attack a floating eye, there is invariably a powerful monster nearby. When you're paralyzed, a [newt](/wiki/Newt \"Newt\") can be considered a powerful monster.\n\n- Collecting useful items from bones files is great! Reading/Using anything immediately after isn't.\n  - Commentary: Determine [BUC](/wiki/BUC \"BUC\") first.\n\n- Yes, pressing any directional key counts as 1 turn, no matter what! (Except for trying to move into a wall or solid rock.)\n\n- Just because your laptop doesn't have a numpad, doesn't mean you can't move diagonally. Then again, normal numbers hate laptops that play NetHack. Especially if you're confused.\n\n- Don't try to play 2 NetHack games at the same time. Just don't.\n\n- If you're listening to music while playing NetHack, don't, don't, **DON'T **press buttons (especially directional keys) to your music; you'll miss your YASD.\n\n- In SLASH'EM as an ice or flame mage, don't youpoly into a dragon when you are wearing armor. Unlike lycanthropes and doppelgangers, you will break out of it. And unlike regular polymorphs into them, your dragon scale mail is not preserved.\n\n- Don't even try to read spell books at level 1.\n  - Commentary: [Wizards](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\") will get a warning if the book is too hard, so long as it isn't cursed. Blessed books are safe.\n\n- Remember, [look](/wiki/Far_look \"Far look\"), don't [touch](/wiki/Direction \"Direction\")!\n\n- Organized pack helps. a - primary weapon, d - pick axe, g - unicorn horn, etc. Arrange to taste.\n\n- After clearing a screenful of monsters involving c, leave for a few hundred tics, to let the corpses expire.\n  - Commentary: Or pick all of them up and use for yourself or safely put away—but be sure you're wearing gloves! Corpses almost always rot after 250 turns.\n\n- Finding a blindfold from a [bones](/wiki/Bones \"Bones\") file while having intrinsic [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\") is great! Now don't get all excited and wear it immediately after just to \"try it out\", because you'll be \"trying it out\" much longer that you'd like.\n\n- Get greedy, get killed.\n\n- If your spells spill over onto a second page, make sure that [healing](/wiki/Spellbook_of_healing \"Spellbook of healing\") and [finger of death](/wiki/Spellbook_of_finger_of_death \"Spellbook of finger of death\") aren't represented by the same letter.\n\n- Be careful when BUC-testing items with a [leashed](/wiki/Leash \"Leash\") [pet](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\"). You won't necessarily get the \"\\<Pet> moves only reluctantly\" message--very bad if you then put on a cursed [ring of conflict](/wiki/Ring_of_conflict \"Ring of conflict\") with no known [method](/wiki/Potion_of_holy_water \"Potion of holy water\") [of](/wiki/Scroll_of_remove_curse \"Scroll of remove curse\") [removing](/wiki/Spellbook_of_remove_curse \"Spellbook of remove curse\") [curses](/wiki/Wand_of_cancellation \"Wand of cancellation\") [handy](/wiki/Spellbook_of_cancellation \"Spellbook of cancellation\").\n\n- NetHack is a good patience detector. Hurry equals death. Which can also be fun actually, if you don't mind not ascending\n\n- NEVER use a figurine of a monster that might be strong enough to kill you without curse-testing it, unless desperate. (And even if it is uncursed or blessed, there's still that 10% chance ...)\n\n- ^S (control + S), in some \\*nix shells, suspends output to your screen. Your keystrokes will go through, but the results won't be displayed yet. ^Q un-suspends it. ^I is an invalid command that happens to also be the tab key, if you want to test a \"frozen\" terminal, press this. Then try ^Q. DO NOT SPAM KEYS. You will, upon resuming your session, or killing your session and starting a new one--whether because it really is frozen or because you didn't know about traditional terminal flow control--that you have died.\n  - To disable XON/XOFF flow control in a \\*nix terminal, run `stty -ixon` from a shell prompt.\n\n- Just because you found a [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\") on DL 8 doesn't mean that a [spotted jelly](/wiki/Spotted_jelly \"Spotted jelly\") can't hurt you.\n\n- Pets are not invincible!\n\n- Be sure you know the distinction between the lowercase o and capital O in your inventory. Bad things can happen...very bad things...\n\n- Cockatrices are very dangerous creatures. In every way.\n\n- If you see something like [\"a? ae??r|um\"](/wiki/Vault \"Vault\") in front of a door, don't open the door if you don't have teleportation control. Okay, fine, you can open it, but don't go in unless you're carrying pocket change at most, want to #occupy [Fort Ludios](/wiki/Fort_Ludios \"Fort Ludios\"), or are willing to lie about your name.\n  - Commentary: If you've got enough food to wait a few turns, it's fine. Just drop your gold before you go in. Let the guard show you out, and now you know exactly where the vault is, for easy digging later when you find a pick.\n\n- Eating killer bee corpses is a bad idea, unless you're going for some sort of low-strength conduct.\n  - But if you have [poison resistance](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\") from a ring or amulet, or a [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\") (in 3.6.6 and earlier versions), this can be a quick and easy way to get intrinsic poison resistance.\n\n- Praying to recover your HP? Don't do it unless your HP falls below max/5 at levels 1-6 (or below 6 HP), max/6 at levels 6-13, max/7 at levels 14-21. Otherwise, you're screwed.\n\n- If you're not sure if a corpse is spoiled yet, DON'T eat it. Otherwise the next word you see may be [the eight-letter F-word](/wiki/Food_poisoning \"Food poisoning\").\n\n- Be wary if you have poor eyesight. If you see a blue, round-looking letter, look at it closely before you move next to it or else [I guarantee you'll see lots of messages culminating in \"You die...\"](/wiki/Floating_eye \"Floating eye\")\n  - Commentary: Watch out for [soldier ants](/wiki/Soldier_ant \"Soldier ant\") as well, which also are blue, round-looking, [and will likely ruin your day](/wiki/YASD \"YASD\").\n\n- Dwarven Valkyries and Human Tourists are VERY different.\n\n- Don't dip for Excalibur if you aren't equipped for some [possible](/wiki/Water_demon \"Water demon\") [nasty](/wiki/Water_moccasin \"Water moccasin\") [surprises](/wiki/Water_nymph \"Water nymph\")!\n\n- Don't dip for Excalibur if there aren't enough fountains around. Fountains can dry up; you don't want to run around searching for another one with a cursed thoroughly rusted long sword.\n\n- Don't eat during combat situations if you can avoid it. There's always the chance that you'll be knocked out for several turns by rotten food.\n\n- If your monk gets an uncursed scroll of genocide, do NOT misspell \"master mind flayer\". The slightest error will cause YASD, and [lifesaving](/wiki/Lifesaving \"Lifesaving\") won't protect you. Yes, that also applies if you write \"master mindflayer\".\n  - 'mindflayer' is now recognised as of [NetHack 3.6.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.6.0 \"NetHack 3.6.0\").\n\n- Don't read random unidentified scrolls while confused unless you're absolutely sure they're [cursed](/wiki/Reverse_genocide \"Reverse genocide\") or you've identified genocide already!\n\n- If you got a dragon scale mail from wish, and a wand of polymorph, and you encountered a dangerous monster (ex. water demon), why don't you zap yourself?\n  - Commentary: Your [cloak](/wiki/Cloak \"Cloak\") will rip, and your mail will revert to scales.\n\n- [BUC-testing](/wiki/BUC \"BUC\") potions at an [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\") while levitating will result in acrimony and broken glass.\n\n- Make sure there is no co-aligned priest in the firing line before zapping [Speed monster](/wiki/Speed_monster \"Speed monster\") at your pet. This will anger the priest and you won't be able to enter his temple without being attacked.\n  - If you manage to escape, don't return to that level with uncontrolled [teleportitis](/wiki/Teleportitis \"Teleportitis\") as the RNG will teleport you into his temple and he will kill you.\n\n- When playing with number\\_pad off, be careful when going northwest. \"Really attack Izchak?\"\n\n- Beware the hallucinating pet arch-lich. (Make sure that that black light over there blows up in your face and not your pet's.)\n\n- Don't eat [wraith](/wiki/Wraith \"Wraith\") corpses when [satiated](/wiki/Satiated \"Satiated\"). You don't get a warning.\n  - This also goes for [tins](/wiki/Tin \"Tin\") and [meatballs](/wiki/Meatballs \"Meatballs\").\n\n- If you just spent a year extincting/genociding everything and then [polypiling](/wiki/Polypiling \"Polypiling\") gems, hauling them to the first floor, trying for hours to get your [giants](/wiki/Giant \"Giant\") arranged around the upstair, and [Rodney](/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor \"Wizard of Yendor\") comes... for the love of God, don't quaff the [potion of gain level](/wiki/Potion_of_gain_level \"Potion of gain level\") he may drop on death without checking [BUC](/wiki/BUC \"BUC\") first. [Lives have been ruined that way.](/wiki/DeathOnAStick \"DeathOnAStick\")\n\n- [Plains centaurs](/wiki/Plains_centaur \"Plains centaur\") in the mirror are stronger than they appear.\n\n- [Baby silver dragons](/wiki/Baby_silver_dragon \"Baby silver dragon\") don't reflect zaps of cold that you shoot at them. Looks like it's going to storm!\n\n- Hitting e instead of w can be a fatal mistake when you have a [cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") corpse.\n\n- Don't stand on [ice](/wiki/Ice \"Ice\") when there are foes with fire attack around.\n\n- What do you think [amulet of life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\") is for?\n\n- When [polypiling](/wiki/Polypiling \"Polypiling\"), be careful with where you aim. In particular, don't hit that damn chest with goodies - if it polymorphs into non-container, ALL CONTENTS ARE LOST.\n  - Contents are always lost on polymorph, but the container has a 5% chance of resisting the polymorph beam. (95% for the Wallet of Perseus in SLASH'EM.)\n\n- Wield the [cockatrice corpse](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") when you're already in position to attack (you won't be moving into any unknown squares). Otherwise you will fall into a [spiked pit](/wiki/Spiked_pit \"Spiked pit\") on your way to your victim.\n  - Commentary: and be instantaneously [stoned](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\"). Any [pit](/wiki/Pit \"Pit\"), [trap door](/wiki/Trap_door \"Trap door\"), or [hole](/wiki/Hole \"Hole\") will have the same effect. If there is an item, you can check for known traps with the [^](/wiki/%5E \"^\") command.\n\n- Don't anger your [god](/wiki/God \"God\") after getting [divine protection](/wiki/Intrinsic_protection \"Intrinsic protection\"). Praying for [unholy water](/wiki/Unholy_water \"Unholy water\") on a crossaligned [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\"), for example.\n  - Commentary: Unless you can afford to buy it back. ([Unholy water](/wiki/Potion_of_unholy_water \"Potion of unholy water\") can also be manufactured via [confused](/wiki/Confused \"Confused\") [blessed](/wiki/BUC \"BUC\") [remove curse](/wiki/Scroll_of_remove_curse \"Scroll of remove curse\") or [dipping](/wiki/Dip \"Dip\") [potions of water](/wiki/Potions_of_water \"Potions of water\") into [fountains](/wiki/Fountain \"Fountain\").)\n\n- Don't melee [cockatrices](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") if you're [polymorphed](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\"), *especially* if you are a [vrock](/wiki/Vrock \"Vrock\"), [master mind flayer](/wiki/Master_mind_flayer \"Master mind flayer\"), [vampire lord](/wiki/Vampire_lord \"Vampire lord\"), [dragon](/wiki/Dragon \"Dragon\") or any other biting monster.\n  - If you are a yellow dragon it is safe. (You need to *be* a yellow dragon—yellow [dragon scale mail](/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail \"Dragon scale mail\") isn't enough.)\n\n- Drop your [gold](/wiki/Gold \"Gold\"), [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\"), and [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\") on another square before [#sitting](/wiki/Sit \"Sit\") on a [throne](/wiki/Throne \"Throne\").\n  - Commentary: It is only necessary to drop your [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\") or [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\") if your [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") is zero or less, in which case they could be [cursed](/wiki/BUC \"BUC\"). See [throne](/wiki/Throne \"Throne\") for more details on exact [throne](/wiki/Throne \"Throne\") effects and precautions to take. It is also safer to put them into a container than to drop them, so that monsters can't get at them.\n\n- If you have recently dispatched a [cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") while being blind and not wearing [gloves](/wiki/Glove \"Glove\"), always move with the '[m](/wiki/M \"M\")' key. Doing so will cause you not to automatically feel objects on the ground.\n\n- If someone throws an egg at you, it might have been a [cockatrice egg](/wiki/Cockatrice_egg \"Cockatrice egg\") - don't skip through the messages about stiffening and turning to stone as if they were ordinary battle spam, if you don't want to become a [statue](/wiki/Statue \"Statue\").\n  - Commentary: Cockatrice eggs are the only eggs monsters ever use.\n\n- If you don't have a way to protect against [touch of death](/wiki/Touch_of_death \"Touch of death\"), NEVER step off of an [E-square](/wiki/E-square \"E-square\") when facing an [arch-lich](/wiki/Arch-lich \"Arch-lich\").\n  - Commentary: Or a [scroll of scare monster](/wiki/Scroll_of_scare_monster \"Scroll of scare monster\") as of 3.6.0.\n\n- While trying to tame something using [charm monster](/wiki/Spellbook_of_charm_monster \"Spellbook of charm monster\") that can resist, you'll probably gain a lot of pets. Naming them \\*all\\* will help keep you from sacrificing a pet (since corpses retain names) and losing your 50 points of [protection](/wiki/Protection \"Protection\").\n\n- Always kill shapechangers when you see them. If you don't they turn into bad things that will kill you. (argiopeweb -- Minotaur in Soko3)\n  - Commentary: (Demin -- Black Dragon Gnomish Mines lv 2) (RegalStar -- Archlich in Soko4) (Beezor -- Master Lich on the Rogue Quest. Of course, I didn't realize there were like 8 guaranteed chameleons on that level at the time, so avoiding that level entirely was probably the best idea. It tele'd in w/ ToD before I could even see it)\n\n- If you see any messages pertaining to a [swamp](/wiki/Swamp \"Swamp\"), do NOT blithely skip along the level. You WILL hit the water, and all your stuff WILL get blanked.\n\n- If you're dipping potions into a fountain, don't typo and dip your bag of holding. The RNG will curse it. Every time.\n\n  - Commentary: You can dig down on a [fountain](/wiki/Fountain \"Fountain\") to make a [pool of water](/wiki/Moat \"Moat\"), which is much safer to work with.\n  - Commentary: When digging down on a fountain, don't stash your armor, weapons, and BoH within four squares of the fountain. The resulting flood can extend out to five. If 3.4.3 and earlier, write several [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") in the dust below the items; as of 3.6.0, use scrolls of scare monster instead. If you have a rustproof weapon like Grayswandir, it's probably best to take it with you into the moat.\n\n- Wielding a [cockatrice corpse](/wiki/Cockatrice_corpse \"Cockatrice corpse\") around a [foocubus](/wiki/Foocubus \"Foocubus\") is an excellent way to get a [permanent hard-on](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\").\n  - Commentary: A [charisma](/wiki/Charisma \"Charisma\") of 20 will reliably allow you to tell the foocubus not to take your [gloves](/wiki/Gloves \"Gloves\") off. Don't type too fast though.\n\n- Don't try to feed a [dragon](/wiki/Dragon \"Dragon\") unless it is currently [tame](/wiki/Tame \"Tame\"). If it is [peaceful](/wiki/Peaceful \"Peaceful\"), [thrown](/wiki/Thrown \"Thrown\") [food](/wiki/Food \"Food\") will anger it.\n  - Commentary: Food can only be used to tame [dogs](/wiki/Dog \"Dog\"), [cats](/wiki/Cat \"Cat\"), and [horses](/wiki/Horse \"Horse\"), including their little and large stages; bananas will also tame some [apelike creatures](/wiki/Apelike_creature \"Apelike creature\").\n\n- Standing on a burnt Elbereth and reverse genociding dragons to create DSM is a great idea... unless you have uncontrolled teleportitis.\n  - Commentary: In that case, go to [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") and use an [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") cage.\n\n- If you are riding a dragon over water avoid any foocubus. There is a chance a given attack hits your steed and it will remove the saddle.\n\n- Destroying a drawbridge with force bolt kills everything in the same way as closing it. Including you.\n\n- Even if you've been struggling with containerless inventory management for 10,000 turns, and you've finally got a [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\") from a wish, don't get all excited and just throw everything into it. That pesky [wand of cancellation](/wiki/Wand_of_cancellation \"Wand of cancellation\") will go in last, and then you're screwed.\n\n- If your luck is negative, or even if you think it MIGHT be negative, DON'T WISH UNTIL YOU FIX IT!\n\n- Never eat an unknown tin whilst hallucinating. It WILL be cockatrice meat.\n  - Commentary: Cockatrice and chickatrice meat always \"smells like chicken\" when hallucinating. (Chickens don't exist in vanilla NetHack.) Tins of [disenchanter](/wiki/Disenchanter \"Disenchanter\") meat or anything of [your race](/wiki/Cannibalism \"Cannibalism\") give no warning, however.\n\n- Be careful if you have suffered amnesia. Although not remembering the exact layout of a level while climbing the dungeon with the Amulet is annoying, what's more annoying is forgetting that ELAM EBOW is a scroll of enchant weapon, deciding not to identify it first, and then reading it while wielding your blessed +7 Grayswandir.\n  - If you get mind-flayed very often, it helps to collect a specimen of everything in your [stash](/wiki/Stash \"Stash\"), to mass-identify.\n\n- Stand back when casting fireball unless you want your pets and belongings to burn.\n\n- When it comes to genociding (Master) Mind flayers, if you're a dwarf ... enough said ...\n\n- When surrounded by resurrecting rock troll corpses, don't quaff an unidentified potion. It will be polymorph, and you will become a grid bug.\n\n- In SLASH'EM, make sure you beware creatures hiding under items. It could be a deadly [asphynx](/wiki/Asphynx \"Asphynx\"), which has the ability to petrify you and cause an easy-to-miss YASD.\n\n- Unless you are in immediate danger of dying, don't break an unidentified wand. You may be killed by a blast of magic.\n  - Commentary: Most of them blast you for some amount of damage dependent on their charges. Many of them have secondary effects like teleportation or slowing.\n\n- If the RNG gives you another bag of holding after you already have one, leave it alone. Don't carry it around as a spare. You *will *space out and try to put one of them in the other.\n  - Commentary: Hauling it to your stash is good, but do so carefully, and possibly on a separate trip. Alternatively, putting both bags into another container will eliminate the possibility of typos.\n\n- When trying to get [crowned](/wiki/Crowning \"Crowning\") so that your god will give you a [spellbook of finger of death](/wiki/Spellbook_of_finger_of_death \"Spellbook of finger of death\"), make sure your luck is actually maxed before casting create monster a couple hundred times.\n\n- Carrying around a lot of potions in your main inventory is a bad idea. You will step on a magic trap and die when a blast of fire causes all of your potions to boil and explode right after you've wished for blessed +3 [silver dragon scale mail](/wiki/Silver_dragon_scale_mail \"Silver dragon scale mail\") and [the Master Key of Thievery](/wiki/The_Master_Key_of_Thievery \"The Master Key of Thievery\").\n  - Commentary: You ideally want to stash them at some point anyway, unless you have a bag to keep them all in - the weight of potions can add up pretty quickly.\n\n- Don't try that genocide scroll until you've BUC tested it! A room full of Liches at level 3 leads to YASD!\n\n- A throne room full of dragons is fantastic for intrinsics but take your damn time in eating them. They're a lot to choke down and it sucks to find out that you have just choked on your disintegration resistance.\n  - Commentary: Killing and eating them one at a time is good. A [tinning kit](/wiki/Tinning_kit \"Tinning kit\") will also help. They are larger than most other corpses.\n\n- Using a cursed [scroll of create monster](/wiki/Scroll_of_create_monster \"Scroll of create monster\") to create sacrifice fodder is never a good idea.\n\n  - Commentary: Though a confused one is handy at times (it will produce only acid blobs, good for blocking movement.)\n  - Commentary: **Never** try to create monsters as a weak character without a good escape route. Almost every monster creation method has a chance of summoning a horde rather than a single monster.\n\n- Don't throw Mjollnir while blind -- you won't catch it, and will likely be hit and lose all your wands and rings.\n\n- Consider that Mjollnir returns only 99% of the time before throwing it at a Titan.\n\n- Sex in real life can cause life-threatening conditions. This applies to NetHack too, for [different reasons](/wiki/Foocubus \"Foocubus\").\n\n- Wishes are valuable. To avoid wasting one on a redundant item, know your inventory *before* employing a potential source of wishing.\n  - Commentary: Wishes are divine in nature, so praying right after receiving one is a bad idea.\n\n- Found the [Big Room](/wiki/Big_Room \"Big Room\")? Stay on the up stair and watch out for [quantum mechanics](/wiki/Quantum_mechanic \"Quantum mechanic\")!\n\n- Dragon scales don't make good polyfodder.\n\n- If you're wearing the Tie-Dye Shirt of Shambhala (in dNetHack) that your god gave you, wear your [ring of polymorph control](/wiki/Ring_of_polymorph_control \"Ring of polymorph control\") too (a mask isn't enough), or stepping on a polytrap will deprive you of its increased carrying capacity for the rest of your run!\n\n- [Teleport control](/wiki/Teleport_control \"Teleport control\") doesn't work when you're unconscious from rotten food, so even it's not a complete safeguard against [teleportitis](/wiki/Teleportitis \"Teleportitis\").\n\n- A greased helmet is not a license to melee [mind flayers](/wiki/Mind_flayer \"Mind flayer\").\n\n- Always use up [cockatrice eggs](/wiki/Cockatrice_egg \"Cockatrice egg\") you lay. Tame cockatrices turn any [golem](/wiki/Golem \"Golem\") to [stone golem](/wiki/Stone_golem \"Stone golem\"), which is hard to kill.\n  - Commentary: Or store the [egg](/wiki/Egg \"Egg\") in a [container](/wiki/Container \"Container\") until it is no longer hatchable after 200 [turns](/wiki/Turns \"Turns\"). It will still [petrify](/wiki/Petrify \"Petrify\") when you want to use it.\n\n- Cursed [athames](/wiki/Athame \"Athame\") aren't good items to [engrave](/wiki/Engrave \"Engrave\") with.\n\n- After you're done dancing with nurses or foocubuses, DON'T FORGET TO RE-EQUIP YOURSELF!\n\n- On that note, be sure to remove all armor AND weapons before reverse-genociding that swarm of nurses.\n\n- A [xorn](/wiki/Xorn \"Xorn\") will gladly munch your [Magicbane](/wiki/Magicbane \"Magicbane\"), especially when you disrobe to take a bath and blank scrolls.\n  - Sacrifice gifts are always rustproof, and if you wish for it you should order it rustproof, so there is usually no reason to unwield artifacts for that anyway.\n\n- When you're on a level with water or lava, and you have uncontrolled teleportitis, and your connection is laggy, TREAD LIGHTLY.\n\n- If you've altar scummed for [Magicbane](/wiki/Magicbane \"Magicbane\") as a wizard who started with a [ring of slow digestion](/wiki/Ring_of_slow_digestion \"Ring of slow digestion\"), don't forget that you can actually use it to engrave an E-square when you're facing a giant ant.\n  - Commentary: Engrave with Magicbane, not the ring of course ;).\n\n- Be careful about wishing for cross-aligned/cross-class artifacts when low-level or low on health, especially when said artifacts are intelligent.\n\n- Don't polymorph an air elemental in Slash'em. You will get a very fast baby dragon that is even more powerful.\n  - Commentary: Also applies to vanilla, and the resulting monster will be that fast only for 1 turn.\n\n- Do not try to [make](/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail#Making_dragon_scale_mail_from_scales \"Dragon scale mail\") a set of dragon scales into a dragon scale mail if the dragon scales are already enchanted to +4 or higher. As of NetHack 3.6.2, the evaporation check takes place before the merging, so you risk losing it. Even an uncursed [scroll](/wiki/Scroll_of_enchant_armor \"Scroll of enchant armor\"), which would not normally add an enchantment point, will try to evaporate an overenchanted set of scales.\n  - Commentary: this situation might happen as a result of stepping onto a [polymorph trap](/wiki/Polymorph_trap \"Polymorph trap\") without magic resistance while wearing an overenchanted dragon scale mail. You turn into a dragon and the mail is reverted to a set of scales, yet the enchantment is preserved. After returning to your normal form, lower the enchantment to +3 before trying to convert them to a dragon scale mail again.\n\n- Just because you're at -20 AC and dodged a shot from a [wand of death](/wiki/Wand_of_death \"Wand of death\") doesn't mean you'll be able to do it a second time. When in doubt, just play it safe and teleport out of there.\n\n- Don't ever try clearing a [throne room](/wiki/Throne_room \"Throne room\") with a newly-gifted [Mjollnir](/wiki/Mjollnir \"Mjollnir\") when you have no means of escape or other ways to fight them, or else you'll find yourself with a room full of awake monsters throwing everything they have at you.\n\n- Be extra careful with powerful pets, such as a dragon, around shopkeepers or priests. They will be more than happy to paint the town red for you and leave you without a source of price ID or protection. Remember, power is nothing without control.\n\n### [Gnomish Mines](/wiki/Gnomish_Mines \"Gnomish Mines\")\n\n- Be wary of statues in the [Gnomish Mines](/wiki/Gnomish_Mines \"Gnomish Mines\")...\n- And also remember to press *k *if you want to kick things off a rolling boulder trap in the Gnomish Mines\n- Skip the Gnomish Mines and come back when you're more powerful, or, you won't get past level 3 of the main branch and will die in the Gnomish Mines.\n  - Commentary: If you're playing as a [gnome](/wiki/Gnome_\\(starting_race\\) \"Gnome (starting race)\") or [dwarf](/wiki/Dwarf_\\(starting_race\\) \"Dwarf (starting race)\"), most of the monsters will be peaceful.\n- If you find [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\") [bones](/wiki/Bones \"Bones\"), before you go #chatting up the [priest](/wiki/Priest \"Priest\"), make SURE both the priest and the [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\") are of the same [alignment](/wiki/Alignment \"Alignment\").\n  - Commentary: Also make sure that the [temple](/wiki/Temple \"Temple\") isn't haunted. There is no way to fix that.\n- If a fountain in [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\") reduces to a trickle, cease using it immediately.\n- If you want to create [Excalibur](/wiki/Excalibur \"Excalibur\") in Minetown, make absolutely sure that there are no watchmen around (or that you have a pet strong enough to deal with them). Even if they aren't in sight, they will somehow sense you and get angry at you, and killing them count as murder.\n- Do not walk around Minetown blind for easy guard murder as a chaotic until you can smite a [leocrotta](/wiki/Leocrotta \"Leocrotta\") in one hit. The Watch Captain hits hard at lower levels. If not chaotic, wait it out.\n  - Commentary: #[Chat](/wiki/Chat \"Chat\") will get responses from watchmen: if you get none, it is safe to move there.\n- A trio of [large cats](/wiki/Large_cat \"Large cat\") will not protect you from a [floating eye](/wiki/Floating_eye \"Floating eye\") in [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\").\n\n### [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\")\n\n- Do NOT do Sokoban if your NetHack lags.\n\n- Just because you beat [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") and got a [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\") doesn't mean you're invincible.\n\n- When in [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\"), and you are at the fringe of death, do not try to teleport away using a scroll of teleportation. Sokoban is a [no-teleport area](/wiki/Non-teleport_level \"Non-teleport level\"), which will result in a few more hits from that monster you are trying to flee from, possibly resulting in your death.\n\n- When you solve a [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") level and open the door at the end of the hall, it will be packed with monsters. One might just be a [Nymph](/wiki/Nymph \"Nymph\") who will charm you, steal your [wand of death](/wiki/Wand_of_death \"Wand of death\"), fail to teleport then use it on you.\n\n  - Instead, displace a pet inside, or fight diagonally at the door because monsters are less likely to zap you at melee range.\n  - For that matter, always use [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\") to scout out the [treasure zoo](/wiki/Treasure_zoo \"Treasure zoo\") before rushing inside.\n\n- Keep in mind that an [AoR](/wiki/Amulet_of_reflection \"Amulet of reflection\") from [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") can be cursed, although you should put it on anyway. BUC status has no effect on the amulet's power; you just can't take it off as with any cursed amulet.\n  - Commentary: If the amulet is missing for some reason, kill and search every monster on the level. Monsters will never pick up the [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\").\n\n- Training escape spells by repeatedly casting \"[jumping](/wiki/Spellbook_of_jumping \"Spellbook of jumping\")\" is a sound strategy -- except in Sokoban. Especially if you plan to zap your wand of wishing soon afterward.\n  - Commentary: Jumping in Sokoban carries a −1 Luck penalty. You don't get dinged if you press escape at the prompt where you want to jump. You can also jump without penalty on a level you have already solved.\n\n- If you just broke boulders or did anything that could reduce your luck, be extra careful. You don't want your prayer to fail.\n\n### [Medusa's Island](/wiki/Medusa%27s_Island \"Medusa's Island\")\n\n- [Levitation](/wiki/Spellbook_of_levitation \"Spellbook of levitation\") spells don't cut it on [Medusa's Island](/wiki/Medusa%27s_Island \"Medusa's Island\"). Find a permanent source.\n\n  - Commentary: With [escape spells](/wiki/Escape_spells \"Escape spells\") at a [skill](/wiki/Skill \"Skill\") level of Skilled or Expert, the spell is equivalent to a blessed [potion of levitation](/wiki/Potion_of_levitation \"Potion of levitation\"), giving 250–299 turns of [levitation](/wiki/Levitation \"Levitation\"), which should be sufficient. At Unskilled or Basic, this spell may give you as few as *ten* turns.\n  - Commentary: In Nethack 3.6.1, you will get a warning when your levitation is about to run out, giving you time to cast the spell again or get above ground if you watch your warnings.\n\n- Don't go below dungeon level 18 or so without a means of crossing water. Falling past [Medusa](/wiki/Medusa \"Medusa\") through a hole can really ruin your whole day.\n  - Commentary: You can continue pressing onward and find a means to cross, e.g. a wand of cold or some scrolls of earth - at minimum you're very likely to get something from the Castle, aside from the guaranteed wand of wishing.\n\n- Don't eat anything while standing on [Medusa](/wiki/Medusa \"Medusa\")'s corpse. You WILL fatfinger it and suffer a legendarily stupid [stoning](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\").\n  - Commentary: Watch out for [footrices](/wiki/Footrice \"Footrice\") as well. [Green slimes](/wiki/Green_slime \"Green slime\") are dangerous as well, to a lesser extent.\n\n- AVOID [foocubi](/wiki/Foocubus \"Foocubus\") of opposite gender when levitating over water in Medusa's level using boots. Drowning is not kinky.\n  - Commentary: A [charisma](/wiki/Charisma \"Charisma\") of 20 will force the foocubi to ask, but watch out for typos.\n\n- Blind yourself BEFORE walking up the stairs to Medusa's house if you've dug to avoid moving over her water. Else she will petrify you right away.\n  - Commentary: Medusa is @. Elbereth won't stop her, even if you have time to burn it.\n\n- If you have [jumping boots](/wiki/Jumping_boots \"Jumping boots\") or can cast the spell, it's possible to cross the water on Medusa's level by jumping from island to island. Just make sure that the statue you're about to jump towards really is a statue, and not a mimic who will block your jump with fatal results.\n\n- Don't bring a pet [gremlin](/wiki/Gremlin \"Gremlin\") to [Medusa](/wiki/Medusa \"Medusa\")'s level.\n\n### [Quest](/wiki/Quest \"Quest\")\n\n- Don't EVER tangle with [Cyclops](/wiki/Cyclops \"Cyclops\"), the [Healer](/wiki/Healer \"Healer\") quest nemesis, in melee.\n  - Commentary: [Magic cancellation](/wiki/Magic_cancellation \"Magic cancellation\") has no effect on [the Staff of Aesculapius](/wiki/The_Staff_of_Aesculapius \"The Staff of Aesculapius\")'s level draining attack.\n- Don't rely on a [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\") as the only source of ANYTHING.\n  - Commentary: That is, in the late game, where the [Wizard of Yendor](/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor \"Wizard of Yendor\") can appear and steal it. Before that, it is fine.\n- Any monster in the '[follower](/wiki/Follower \"Follower\")' category will follow you through portals created by [the Eye of the Aethiopica](/wiki/The_Eye_of_the_Aethiopica \"The Eye of the Aethiopica\").\n  - Commentary: They will also follow you through [staircases](/wiki/Staircases \"Staircases\") or any other level change.\n- Monsters will follow you through your quest portal. Engraving on the portal square doesn't work.\n- If you [Branchport](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Aethiopica \"Eye of the Aethiopica\") into [Fort Ludios](/wiki/Fort_Ludios \"Fort Ludios\"), you may very well land in the area just outside the inner keep and get swarmed by everything. While it's (generally) not a fatal error, it can still get rather annoying when you can't deal with about fifty creatures one-on-one.\n- [Ashikaga Takauji](/wiki/Ashikaga_Takauji \"Ashikaga Takauji\") gets two attacks per round. While extremely unlikely, it's possible to get [bisected](/wiki/Tsurugi_of_Muramasa \"Tsurugi of Muramasa\") twice in a row, so even an [Amulet of life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\") isn't a surefire way to survive!\n- Don't kick trees in the [ranger quest](/wiki/Ranger_quest \"Ranger quest\") maze, unless you want the resident [minotaur](/wiki/Minotaur \"Minotaur\") to ruin your day.\n- Never, ever, ever [jump](/wiki/Jump \"Jump\") near your [quest leader](/wiki/Quest_leader \"Quest leader\"). Your [quest portal](/wiki/Quest_portal \"Quest portal\") will be removed, with only one way to salvage your game: [the Eye of the Aethiopica](/wiki/The_Eye_of_the_Aethiopica \"The Eye of the Aethiopica\"). Better hope you're a [neutral](/wiki/Neutral \"Neutral\") non-[wizard](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\"). It also helps to be able to cast [charm monster](/wiki/Spellbook_of_charm_monster \"Spellbook of charm monster\") with a relatively low failure rate.\n- If you genocide [giants](/wiki/Giant \"Giant\") before you do the [Valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\") [quest](/wiki/Quest \"Quest\"), you will get lots of [titans](/wiki/Titan \"Titan\") instead. You don't want lots of titans.\n- If you have controlled teleportitis, don't use an uncursed scroll of earth to build your boulder fort - especially in Kaen's lair.\n- In SLASH'EM, yes, you **can** sacrifice [the Hand of Vecna](/wiki/The_Hand_of_Vecna_\\(SLASH%27EM\\) \"The Hand of Vecna (SLASH'EM)\"). And yes, this gets rid of it permanently.\n- On the Valkyrie goal level, there's a good chance that a boulder dropped or thrown by a giant will block a drawbridge. If you must use a wand of striking to dispose of it, do so from a safe distance.\n- Reflection is very important on the Ranger Quest. Lots of centaurs means lots of attack wands.\n\n### [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\")\n\n- The castle level is a cruel, cruel place... Trust me...\n- Don't crush [peacefuls](/wiki/Peaceful \"Peaceful\") in the Castle [drawbridge](/wiki/Drawbridge \"Drawbridge\"), even if you don't want a [red naga](/wiki/Red_naga \"Red naga\") to fry you under conflict. The resulting bad luck can make your wished-for blessed magic marker come out cursed. The resulting cursed scrolls of charging will *discharge* and waste your wand of wishing.\n- Even though you're fire resistant and put on that ring of levitation to get out of the [lava](/wiki/Lava \"Lava\"), you'll still die instantly when your legs get stuck.\n- Forcing the lock on the chest with a blunt weapon on the castle level isn't the best idea. Kicking it isn't such a good idea either, if the object you're expecting happens to be made of glass or crystal.\n- If you drop your weapons and armor to go for a scroll-blanking swim in the [castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\")'s moat, please take care where you leave those items lying around. Chasing down a [master mind flayer](/wiki/Master_mind_flayer \"Master mind flayer\") that's made off with your +7 [Grayswandir](/wiki/Grayswandir \"Grayswandir\") is not fun when you're unarmed.\n  - Commentary: it's typically unnecessary to unequip your main weapon for this, unless it's not [rustproof](/wiki/Rustproof \"Rustproof\") (and all [gifts](/wiki/Gift \"Gift\") are). In particular, Grayswandir is [silver](/wiki/Silver \"Silver\") and thus cannot rust.\n- When you get to the [castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\") level, do not burn [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") on the drawbridge and fight the monsters there. A wand of striking will kill you instantly, and it won't be fun.\n- Plugging the [trap doors](/wiki/Trap_door \"Trap door\") on the Castle level with boulders is a [Bad Idea](/wiki/Bad_Idea \"Bad Idea\"). It will result in the lower levels being inaccessible, except through a [controlled](/wiki/Controlled \"Controlled\") level teleport.\n  - Commentary: You cannot dig downwards on the [castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\") level. Leaving even one trap door open is sufficient. Since [NetHack 3.6.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.6.0 \"NetHack 3.6.0\") you can dig through the filled trap doors.\n- When you're cutting a swathe on your way to the castle and you spot a master mind flayer nearby, and you're confident because you greased a helmet specifically for this occasion, if you're going to engage him in melee, ***make sure you put the blasted thing on.***\n\n### [Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\")\n\n- When breaking wands for their area-denial purpose, DO NOT break a [wand of lightning](/wiki/Wand_of_lightning \"Wand of lightning\") unless you hate your rings.\n- Especially not when Demogorgon is on the level. Not even if double-meleeing arch liches.\n  - Commentary: the Wizard of Yendor and his clone are better examples, since arch-liches are resistant anyway.\n    - Sorry, it was me who did that, and it just makes the original death even stupider in retrospect… — Preceding [unsigned](/wiki/NetHackWiki:Style_guide#Sign_your_posts \"NetHackWiki:Style guide\") comment added by [Ais523](/wiki/User:Ais523 \"User:Ais523\") ([talk](/wiki/User_talk:Ais523 \"User talk:Ais523\") • [contribs](/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ais523 \"Special:Contributions/Ais523\")) 12:43, 20 October 2012 (UTC)\n- In [Moloch's Sanctum](/wiki/Moloch%27s_Sanctum \"Moloch's Sanctum\"), be sure that you have entered the temple, and that the [high priest](/wiki/High_priest \"High priest\") has called you an infidel, before killing him. If you don't, you'll get dinged for [murder](/wiki/Murder \"Murder\").\n- Watch where you kill the Wizard the first time. Killing him above the moat is a VERY VERY bad idea if you can't swim.\n  - Commentary: A way to fill the moat like a [scroll of earth](/wiki/Scroll_of_earth \"Scroll of earth\"), [wand of cold](/wiki/Wand_of_cold \"Wand of cold\"), [frost horn](/wiki/Frost_horn \"Frost horn\"), the spell of [cone of cold](/wiki/Spellbook_of_cone_of_cold \"Spellbook of cone of cold\"), or access to white or silver [dragon](/wiki/Dragon \"Dragon\") breath attacks will resolve the problem. The [invocation artifacts](/wiki/Invocation_artifacts \"Invocation artifacts\") and the [Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor \"Amulet of Yendor\") will always rise to the surface.\n- After spending hours of hard work and effort to descend into Gehennom, only to be swamped by monsters, remember to check your status as often as your inventory. Scrolls of genocide may be great escape items, but only if that umber hulk next to you isn't looking your way!\n  - Commentary: And no, your AoLS will not save your sorry self here! In general, the [amulet of life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\") will fail to save you if you genocide yourself or have your intelligence reduced below 3 by a [mind flayer](/wiki/Mind_flayer \"Mind flayer\").\n- When you've been fighting hordes of monsters as a master mind flayer, remember that your stomach is now quite full. Do not try eating anything, especially a randomly generated newt in the lower levels of Gehennom just to try and get that one extra point of power for the heck of it.\n- If you enter an area (say, perhaps the zoo on the way to kill the Wizard) with cockatrices and weapon-wielding monsters (say, perhaps a troll), back off and make SURE you've got a lizard corpse handy in your inventory. Be a good Boy Scout and always be prepared.\n- Do not [teleport at will](/wiki/Teleport_at_will \"Teleport at will\") while hungry if there is a demon prince attacking you. You will likely faint from the energy cost of this and be entirely at their mercy.\n  - Commentary: As of NetHack 3.7, it doesn't work in their presence anyway.\n- Don't attack [Orcus](/wiki/Orcus \"Orcus\") with [Mjollnir](/wiki/Mjollnir \"Mjollnir\"), unless you want that shiny [Wand of Death](/wiki/Wand_of_death \"Wand of death\") to be destroyed by lightning.\n- Just walk right up to the [Executioner](/wiki/Executioner \"Executioner\") in [Sheol](/wiki/Sheol \"Sheol\") ([UnNethack](/wiki/UnNethack \"UnNethack\")). Come on Punk, make my day.\n- [Levitation](/wiki/Levitation \"Levitation\") does not protect you from the [kraken](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\") in [Rodney](/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor \"Wizard of Yendor\")'s (the wizard, not the bot) [moat](/wiki/Moat \"Moat\").\n  - Commentary: And neither does [flight](/wiki/Flight \"Flight\").\n- Don't engrave [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") on the [vibrating square](/wiki/Vibrating_square \"Vibrating square\"). Else [Orcus](/wiki/Orcus \"Orcus\") won't follow you into the [Sanctum](/wiki/Sanctum \"Sanctum\") to retrieve the Amulet. (He will no longer retrieve it for you anyway as of 3.6.1.)\n\n### [Ascension run](/wiki/Ascension_run \"Ascension run\")\n\n- Using [water walking boots](/wiki/Water_walking_boots \"Water walking boots\") on the [plane of water](/wiki/Plane_of_water \"Plane of water\") will result in you drowning. [Levitation](/wiki/Levitation \"Levitation\"), on the other hand, will work safely.\n  - Commentary: As of version 3.6, you can't levitate there either.\n- Don't try to disarm/disarmor your [Archon](/wiki/Archon \"Archon\") with F command when [polymorphed](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") into a [nymph](/wiki/Nymph \"Nymph\"). You can untame it.\n  - Commentary: Instead, [enchant](/wiki/Scroll_of_enchant_armor \"Scroll of enchant armor\") its new [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\") better than what it's currently wearing, and drop the armor in front of your [pet](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\"). It will change once it eventually picks it up. [Weapons](/wiki/Weapon \"Weapon\") are a bit trickier—a [bullwhip](/wiki/Bullwhip \"Bullwhip\") is a safe way to disarm your pet. To keep it from swapping artifacts, you want it to drop as many items as possible before you give it its new weapon.\n- Zapping a high priest/priestess on the Astral Plane with a wand of teleportation to move them off an altar DOES NOT WORK. It makes them angry instead, even if they were peaceful beforehand.\n- Don't polymorph in > direction while riding. Even your ki-rin is not invincible; A's are vulnerable to system shocks!\n- Don't mess with player type characters on the Astral Plane. Yes, there's only a small chance they'll be spawned with the Vorpal Blade. Yes, there's only a slight chance that the Vorpal Blade will instantly behead you. The RNG will kill you. Every time.\n- [Archons](/wiki/Archon \"Archon\")' dazzle is incredibly annoying — [lenses](/wiki/Pair_of_lenses \"Pair of lenses\") are nearly worthless.\n  - Commentary: Lenses do not stop an Archon's gaze attack, only [blinding venom](/wiki/Blinding_venom \"Blinding venom\") and [raven](/wiki/Raven \"Raven\") claws.\n- Despite an Archon being a very powerful and useful pet capable of dispatching many enemies on its own, it is not immune to being engulfed and digested.\n- Don't let your flying steed die when you're over water or lava. [Fire elementals](/wiki/Fire_elemental \"Fire elemental\") on the [Plane of Fire](/wiki/Plane_of_Fire \"Plane of Fire\") can do a lot of damage to a steed without [fire resistance](/wiki/Fire_resistance \"Fire resistance\").\n- A steam vortex will happily carry you out of an air bubble on the Plane of Water, even if you aren't levitating. You'll drown as soon as you're expelled.\n- [Far look](/wiki/Far_look \"Far look\") won't tell you if a high altar is co-aligned - [\"aligned\" and \"co-aligned\" are not the same.](/wiki/Altar#High_altars \"Altar\")\n- If you lack [reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\"), don't forget about [Medusa](/wiki/Medusa \"Medusa\").\n- Polymorphing into a (master) [mind flayer](/wiki/Mind_flayer \"Mind flayer\") on Astral might not be such a good idea - eating the brains of any [Rider](/wiki/Rider \"Rider\") will kill you instantly.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Bad Idea](/wiki/Bad_Idea \"Bad Idea\")\n- [YASD](/wiki/YASD \"YASD\")\n- [DeathOnAStick](/wiki/DeathOnAStick \"DeathOnAStick\")\n\n[![This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.7.

die...(again)]]\n'''Lessons learned the hard way''' was a set of statements hosted by [[Rodney (bot)|Rodney]]. It eventually became so large that it had to be removed from the database, as Rodney would become unresponsive to everyone else whenever someone requested the entry. Prior to eventually being moved onto [[NetHackWiki]], it was hosted by [[GreyKnight]].\n\nThe lessons old and new alike are listed below, loosely sorted by dungeon branch. Some of the lessons don't apply to post-[[3.4.3]] versions of NetHack, but may still apply to variants based on older versions.\n\n==The lessons==\n===[[Dungeons of Doom]]===\n* Don't try to cancel your own spellcasting by pressing Escape, especially when polypiling. Skipping the direction prompt releases the magic power to the previously used direction!\n* When you get a blessed [[scroll of genocide]], @ means you, even when you aren't a human.\n** Commentary: Besides, many important @ monsters (such as [[shopkeepers]]) can't be genocided anyway.\n* A blessed scroll of genocide will wipe out all species in a monster class, even if you explicitly specify a single species. Don't try to use one to genocide (master) mind flayers if you're a dwarf.\n* Sleep rays bounce, and elves don't start with sleep resistance.\n* \"Huh. Didn't know a [[bag of tricks]] would explode a [[bag of holding]].\"\n* You have to really be INSIDE a temple for sanctuary to work. The door isn't good enough.\n** Commentary: Unless the monsters are inside the temple too.\n*** ...in which case they'll just flee from you, though they'll still try to use ranged attacks.\n* Don't wear [[levitation]] items until you need them. They deprive you of [[Elbereth]] and other useful escapes.\n* Don't panic. Always know where your [[towel]] is.\n* Be very careful with uncontrolled [[teleportitis]] and [[quantum mechanic]]s in stores!\n** Commentary: [[Teleportitis#Shopping with uncontrolled teleportitis|Drop your gold first.]]\n* Never eat [[tin]]s in shops whilst wielding potentially expensive [[artifact]]s. Also don't let [[nymph]]s get near you.\n** Commentary: Doubly true if you're in the [[black market]].\n* Remember, \"Thou shalt not worship graven images\"\n* Never sacrifice something you can't touch! Attempting to lure a [[cockatrice]] onto an [[altar]] for sacrifice with the idea that you can do so without touching it will cause you to develop a stony appearance without the chance to eat a [[lizard]].\n* Don't carry [[wand]]s/[[scroll]]s/[[potion]]s outside bags. Nothing like standing on the [[vibrating square]] with the [[Bell of Opening]] (0:0), complaining about exploding [[wand of cancellation]] and [[wand of wishing]] and not having a [[scroll of charging]] handy, or losing that brand new, unused wand of wishing to an [[electric eel]].\n** Commentary: Or at least minimize the vulnerable [[item]]s you have out. It is worth risking a few [[escape item]]s to have them ready when you really need them.\n** Also you better be sure you've identified the [[wand of cancellation]] before you accidentally put one in a [[bag of holding]].\n* If you have crappy ISP, NEVER reconnect to server right after you got your Internet connection back. There can still be some glitches with it.\n* NetHack doesn't know about arrows/function/home/end/page up/page down keys and treats them as escape. Therefore '''don't try to edit your [[wish]]es with them.'''\n** Commentary: NetHack 3.6 lets you clear the input with escape, as did [[NAO]] before.\n* NEVER leave [[fragile]] items (such as potions) unattended when there are intelligent foes around. [[Wand of striking]] == BOOM!\n* NEVER skip messages with space. Ever. Especially when handling petrifying monsters.\n* When you have a laggy connection, NEVER type the next command before you see how the previous one ended.\n* When running from a nasty monster, go back the way you came.\n* Be careful of what items are marked as 'y' and 'n' in your inventory to avoid confusion with yes/no prompts. For example, trying to eat something on the ground while [[levitating]] by typing 'ey' quickly will have disastrous effects if your inventory contains 'y - a [[cockatrice corpse]]'.\n** Commentary: Watch out in the [[spell]]s menu too; double tapping \"y\" and casting a spell without seeing which one it was could put you in an interesting predicament. Was it [[spellbook of finger of death|FOD]]? [[spellbook of polymorph|Poly]]? Or maybe {{spell of|extra healing}}?\n* Be careful of what items are marked as direction-moving keys in your inventory, in case you miss a key, so instead of 'ahky' (apply h-a key north Unlock the door? yes) you hit 'aky' (apply k-a wand of cancellation Really break your wand of cancellation? yes)\n* When hiding in a [[shop]] to recover [[HP]], make sure to [[rest]] instead of [[search]] to avoid finding (and waking) [[mimic]]s.\n* Make sure comestibles (esp. [[rubber chicken]]s) aren't assigned 'e', wands aren't assigned 'z' or 'a', potions aren't assigned 'q', scrolls and spellbooks aren't assigned 'r', tools aren't assigned 'a', weapons that might be cursed aren't assigned 'w', armor that might be cursed isn't assigned 'W', rings that might be cursed aren't assigned 'P', etc.\n* When the ground around you looks the same except for being a different color, examine it with [[what_is|/]] or [[;]] before stepping there.\n* Don't try to polymorph a merely annoying monster just to get it out of your way; save your charges (or mana) for things that are just about to kill you, since the creature it becomes might be something deadly. (StormEagle, [[blue jelly]] => [[ice devil]]; nabru, [[wood nymph]] => [[demilich]] and [[floating eye]] => [[Aleax]]).\n* If you [[levelport]], angry shopkeepers are somehow able to levelport with you.\n** Commentary: Because they are [[follower]]s like pets and most human monsters. Make sure you get some distance between you and the angry shopkeep before attempting to levelport.\n* There is a vital difference between '<[[god]]> is displeased' due to praying too soon, and praying on the wrong altar or with negative [[luck]]/[[alignment]]. Only the first one makes your god [[angry]].\n** Commentary: Is this really true? Also, a water prayer on a cross-aligned altar will make your god angry.\n* If you are being held/crushed by an [[owlbear]], zapping down with a [[wand of digging]] is not as effective as you might think. Engrave [[Elbereth]] with it instead...\n* If you leave [[skeleton key]]s (but not [[lock pick]]s or [[credit card]]s) lying around, monsters that can open doors are smart enough to pick them up and unlock doors with them.\n* For beginners: if your HP shows as yellow or red (with the [[Statuscolors|statuscolors patch]]), you have the [[spell of healing]] and you have enough power to cast it, do so. You'll never know which [[gnome]] has the [[wand of lightning]]/[[wand of cold|cold]]/[[wand of fire|fire]].\n**Commentary: Of course, if said [[gnome]] [[GWTWOD|happens to have a]] [[wand of death]] it won't matter anyway.\n* If you're trying for #conduct weaponless, just leave pick-axes on the ground. Don't even bother to put them in your BoH. Use wands of digging instead (which are not wielded). If you're going for #conduct pacifist, wield a cream pie and never let go. Rely on 5 to move.  \n**Commentary: (Unless VERY careful: this means thinking for 5 seconds before every move.) You can remap the movement keys to use {{kbd|5}} or {{kbd|m}} to cut down on accidents.\n* Never underestimate a [[bones]] level.\n* Get a second or third opinion. ALWAYS.\n* Don't stone-to-flesh statues from a bones file. They are likely to be well-armed and armored.\n* If a [[zombie]] of your race dies on your [[altar]] during a sacfest, move the human corpse away ''before'' trying to sacrifice anything.\n** Commentary: Rotted corpses still anger [[god]]s.\n* Don't just try on unidentified rings if you're near a priest or any other friendly \"@\". If that [[ring]] turns out to be [[ring of conflict|conflict]], you won't live to regret it.\n** Commentary: Unless you know it isn't conflict. Other powerful or threatening peaceful monsters, not just \"@\", are also to be avoided, though trying on an unidentified ring near a weak peaceful monster is a good way to identify conflict. Also, priests will wield their weapons before attacking; you can watch for this from a safe distance and take the ring off as soon as they do.\n* Locking a door will not do much if you leave a pick axe or mattock immediately outside it.\n** Commentary: In NetHack 3.4.3, engrave [[Elbereth]] under the pick, since all digging monsters respect that.\n* When attacking a [[gas spore]], make sure your pet isn't within the range of the explosion when the spore dies. It will count as if you killed the pet.\n** Commentary: Unless your [[pet]] can survive the 4d6. This also applies to aligned priests&mdash;losing the only co-aligned temple in your entire dungeon is a real bummer.\n* Don't try to polymorph at experience level 1 or 2, unless you like being killed by unsuccessful polymorphs.\n** Commentary: The [[polyself bug]] was one reason you might actually want to do this.\n* Don't zap your kitten with a wand of polymorph.  It may die from [[system shock]] and you will have killed it.\n** Commentary: Prefer a [[polymorph trap]]&mdash;it will not kill, and you can retry indefinitely.\n* Before you kick in a locked door, make sure it's not attached to a [[shop]], lest you anger the shopkeeper.\n** Commentary: Check for the \"Closed for inventory\" engraving (in dust) outside the [[door]]. Unlocking the door is okay though, and open shops (even empty ones) never close.\n** Note, this means you must never kick down any doors while blind unless you already know they are not shop doors!\n* When waiting for monsters to show up and force you back into human form, don't wander away from your only weapon just because you couldn't carry it.\n** Commentary: Try throwing that weapon upwards.\n* When in a zoo, fight [[shrieker]]s and [[gas spore]]s last.\n** Commentary: If you can avoid killing them, [[yellow light]]s, [[black light]]s, [[freezing sphere]]s, [[flaming sphere]]s, and [[shocking sphere]]s should also be left for last. Never kick down treasure zoo doors, else ''every'' monster inside will wake up (unless you plan on using conflict or something).\n* Pause every time you see a monster. Watching the contents of your inventory, or what you are [[polymorph]]ed into, is free. Thinking of a tactic is also free. Going toe-to-toe with a [[footrice]] when you're poly'd into a [[master mind flayer]] is priceless.\n* [[Werecreatures]] are considered [[human]]. Sacrificing werecreatures is a good idea only if you are chaotic or playing an elf/orc/dwarf/gnome.\n** Commentary:  Werecreatures return to human form upon death in [[SLASH'EM]].\n** Moreover, [[doppelganger]]s are considered human, too. \n* [[Chameleon]]s leave brown corpses. They can also impersonate monsters which leave brown corpses.\n* If you're confused in a shop and standing next to the shopkeeper with your very promising character, keep doing nothing for as long as it takes. Yes I know it's only a 1 in 8 chance. Yes it will kill you. [[Stun]]ning is even worse.\n** Commentary: The same may happen for blind characters without telepathy. The {{kbd|m}} prefix to [[movement]] commands is only safe if you can detect the shopkeeper, even as {{white|I}}&mdash;you will say \"Pardon me\" instead of attacking.\n* A [[bugle]] is not a good tool for a [[knight]] to use to wake sleeping monsters&mdash;especially in [[Minetown]].\n** Commentary: Bugling in Minetown is not recommended for any other role, either, if any of the watch are still alive.\n* Never use force bolt in a level with a shop ([[you hear the chime of a cash register]]) if you haven't explored the area in the direction you're shooting if you can't pay for broken things, unless you can fight the shopkeeper.\n* Engraving with wands is useful. If you get the message \"The bugs on the floor stop moving!\", more often than not, it will be a wand of sleep, but rarely it can be a wand of death. Don't zap it at walls that can reflect back to you. It will be that wand of death.\n** Commentary: All walls reflect [[ray]]s. Death and sleep can be distinguished via price-ID. Also, even if it isn't, putting yourself to sleep is quite dangerous too&mdash;allowing yourself to possibly get hit by the wand is only safe if you have [[reflection]] or can deal with both effects.\n** Commentary: In a nutshell, when reflection is involved, don't dish out what you can't take.\n* Do not pray on an cross-aligned altar when you are starving. You stomach won't change, but your prayer timeout will.\n* When you accidentally get [[water moccasin]]s from a fountain, run. Don't fight, run.\n** Commentary: Unless you deliberately drank from the fountain and are capable of handling them. Ordinary [[Snake (monster class)|snakes]] are functionally identical to water moccasins, minus appearing in groups.\n* Go ahead - leave [[autopickup]] on. It's handy until you walk over that [[footrice]] corpse without gloves.\n** Configuring [[pickup_types]] or better yet [[autopickup exception]]s gives you the best of both worlds.\n* Don't fight the [[soldier ant]] fairly. Just don't.\n* In NetHackW (graphical version) please remember to turn off auto-pickup. It's nice until you find a statue. You wonder why you can't pick up anything when ''You see here 57 gold coins. There is nothing here to pick up.'' Or ''You see here a statue. You can barely move a hand's reach with this load!''\n** Commentary: Or set pickup_types, or [[pickup_burden]]. Or compile in and set autopickup exceptions.\n* Be sure to identify wands before zapping them at enemies, especially if you're zapping an unknown wand of make invisible at a nymph!\n* For crying out loud, don't kick down doors if they have an engraving in front of them! Even if it's ''??o?? f? I???t???''.\n** Commentary: A bones level may have a pre-eroded engraving. Or you may have stepped on it and not noticed.\n* If you find a dead end, don't hold down '''s'''. It'll just make things worse if you encounter a monster and are still searching.\n** Commentary: Use a [[numeric prefix]] instead, like n10s or just 10s if using vikeys.\n* When you find a [[small mimic]] in a shop, be sure to attack it, not the shopkeeper! There's no way to say that you meant to hit the mimic!\n* Similarly, when attacking a mimic with wands or spells, check your [[rebound]] path every single time. The shopkeeper does not stand still while you're fighting.\n* When playing NAO, if you get lag, don't just keep pressing buttons; once the prompt has stopped lagging, I guarantee you will have the message, ''\"Do you want your possessions identified? [yn](n)\"''\n* If you're multi-tasking with NetHack, be sure you're in the chat box with your friend(s) and not still on the NetHack command prompt. \"r u playing nethack again?\" yes ('''y''': ''Unknown extended command'' '''e''': ''What do you want to eat? [acdsR-?*]'' '''s''': ''A cockatrice corpse. Do you want your possessions identified?'')\n* Engraving with your fingers in the dust is fine unless your Elbereth happens to be E'''¦'''bereth.\n** Commentary: Always, always check your writing with {{kbd|:}} (but not if you are blind, in which case that will use a turn).\n* Just because you survived that rolling boulder trap DOES NOT mean you or your pet will survive it again.\n* If you fall through a trap door into a vault without a pickaxe or wand of digging, don't keep saying that your name is Croesus; the vault doesn't have a kitchen, refrigerator, or any other type of food producing place that you'd find in your house.\n* When casting force bolt, be sure that there are no pets, shopkeepers, guards, etc. behind what you're hitting. Or nymphs &mdash; you'll break their (likely) potion of object detection and incur a loss of luck.\n** Commentary: You're thinking of a [[mirror]], which they also carry often.\n* Don't put every single damn piece of armor, gloves, or shoes you find on! Sure they might not be cursed, but when you do put them on, they'll be cursed. Every single time!\n** Commentary: Unless you have the spell of remove curse and enough power. Try pet-testing also.\n* Make sure to remove that [[ring of conflict]] you might be wearing before you enter a shop.\n* Eating a chickatrice corpse does not make you petrification resistant.\n* If you're kicking things off traps, make sure you aren't low on HP, and are strong.\n* Even if you happen to be wearing a ring of polymorph control, don't try to polymorph (quaffing sinks ...) when you are a low level (like XL1) - you risk death from [[system shock]] or from level drain after feeling like a new man/elf/orc.\n** Commentary: Polymorph control protects you from system shock, but you still have a 8% chance of fatal level drain.\n* So wait, I'm NOT supposed to use that fireball scroll while hallucinating?\n* Don't eat eggs unless you're sure of what's in them. Just because you haven't seen any cockatrices yet doesn't mean the egg is safe.\n* Don't bang on the keyboard, you'll just be angrier.\n* And don't rest on the keyboard as well!\n* Have a laptop? Move carefully!\n* Attacking a floating eye isn't fatal... unless there might be a powerful monster nearby...\n** Commentary: If you attack a floating eye, there is invariably a powerful monster nearby. When you're paralyzed, a [[newt]] can be considered a powerful monster.\n* Collecting useful items from bones files is great! Reading/Using anything immediately after isn't.\n** Commentary: Determine [[BUC]] first.\n* Yes, pressing any directional key counts as 1 turn, no matter what! (Except for trying to move into a wall or solid rock.)\n* Just because your laptop doesn't have a numpad, doesn't mean you can't move diagonally. Then again, normal numbers hate laptops that play NetHack. Especially if you're confused.\n* Don't try to play 2 NetHack games at the same time. Just don't.\n* If you're listening to music while playing NetHack, don't, don't, '''DON'T '''press buttons (especially directional keys) to your music; you'll miss your YASD.\n* In SLASH'EM as an ice or flame mage, don't youpoly into a dragon when you are wearing armor. Unlike lycanthropes and doppelgangers, you will break out of it. And unlike regular polymorphs into them, your dragon scale mail is not preserved.\n* Don't even try to read spell books at level 1.\n** Commentary: [[Wizard]]s will get a warning if the book is too hard, so long as it isn't cursed. Blessed books are safe.\n* Remember, [[far look|look]], don't [[Direction|touch]]!\n* Organized pack helps.  a - primary weapon, d - pick axe, g - unicorn horn, etc.  Arrange to taste.\n* After clearing a screenful of monsters involving c, leave for a few hundred tics, to let the corpses expire.\n** Commentary: Or pick all of them up and use for yourself or safely put away&mdash;but be sure you're wearing gloves! Corpses almost always rot after 250 turns.\n* Finding a blindfold from a [[bones]] file while having intrinsic [[telepathy]] is great! Now don't get all excited and wear it immediately after just to \"try it out\", because you'll be \"trying it out\" much longer that you'd like.\n* Get greedy, get killed.\n* If your spells spill over onto a second page, make sure that {{spell of|healing}} and {{spell of|finger of death}} aren't represented by the same letter.\n* Be careful when BUC-testing items with a [[leash]]ed [[pet]]. You won't necessarily get the \"<Pet> moves only reluctantly\" message--very bad if you then put on a cursed [[ring of conflict]] with no known [[Potion of holy water|method]] [[Scroll of remove curse|of]] [[Spellbook of remove curse|removing]] [[Wand of cancellation|curses]] [[Spellbook of cancellation|handy]].\n* NetHack is a good patience detector. Hurry equals death. Which can also be fun actually, if you don't mind not ascending\n* NEVER use a figurine of a monster that might be strong enough to kill you without curse-testing it, unless desperate. (And even if it is uncursed or blessed, there's still that 10% chance ...)\n* ^S (control + S), in some *nix shells, suspends output to your screen. Your keystrokes will go through, but the results won't be displayed yet. ^Q un-suspends it. ^I is an invalid command that happens to also be the tab key, if you want to test a \"frozen\" terminal, press this. Then try ^Q. DO NOT SPAM KEYS. You will, upon resuming your session, or killing your session and starting a new one--whether because it really is frozen or because you didn't know about traditional terminal flow control--that you have died.\n** To disable XON/XOFF flow control in a *nix terminal, run <code>stty -ixon</code> from a shell prompt.\n* Just because you found a [[wand of wishing]] on DL 8 doesn't mean that a [[spotted jelly]] can't hurt you.\n* Pets are not invincible!\n* Be sure you know the distinction between the lowercase o and capital O in your inventory. Bad things can happen...very bad things...\n* Cockatrices are very dangerous creatures. In every way.\n* If you see something like [[Vault|\"a? ae??r|um\"]] in front of a door, don't open the door if you don't have teleportation control. Okay, fine, you can open it, but don't go in unless you're carrying pocket change at most, want to #occupy [[Fort Ludios]], or are willing to lie about your name.\n** Commentary:  If you've got enough food to wait a few turns, it's fine.  Just drop your gold before you go in.  Let the guard show you out, and now you know exactly where the vault is, for easy digging later when you find a pick.\n* Eating killer bee corpses is a bad idea, unless you're going for some sort of low-strength conduct.\n** But if you have [[poison resistance]] from a ring or amulet, or a [[unicorn horn]] (in 3.6.6 and earlier versions), this can be a quick and easy way to get intrinsic poison resistance.\n* Praying to recover your HP? Don't do it unless your HP falls below max/5 at levels 1-6 (or below 6 HP), max/6 at levels 6-13, max/7 at levels 14-21.  Otherwise, you're screwed.\n* If you're not sure if a corpse is spoiled yet, DON'T eat it. Otherwise the next word you see may be [[Food poisoning|the eight-letter F-word]].\n* Be wary if you have poor eyesight. If you see a blue, round-looking letter, look at it closely before you move next to it or else [[Floating eye|I guarantee you'll see lots of messages culminating in \"You die...\"]]\n** Commentary: Watch out for [[soldier ant]]s as well, which also are blue, round-looking, [[YASD|and will likely ruin your day]].\n* Dwarven Valkyries and Human Tourists are VERY different.\n* Don't dip for Excalibur if you aren't equipped for some [[water demon|possible]] [[water moccasin|nasty]] [[water nymph|surprises]]!\n* Don't dip for Excalibur if there aren't enough fountains around. Fountains can dry up; you don't want to run around searching for another one with a cursed thoroughly rusted long sword.\n* Don't eat during combat situations if you can avoid it. There's always the chance that you'll be knocked out for several turns by rotten food.\n* If your monk gets an uncursed scroll of genocide, do NOT misspell \"master mind flayer\". The slightest error will cause YASD, and [[lifesaving]] won't protect you. Yes, that also applies if you write \"master mindflayer\".\n** 'mindflayer' is now recognised as of [[NetHack 3.6.0]].\n* Don't read random unidentified scrolls while confused unless you're absolutely sure they're [[reverse genocide|cursed]] or you've identified genocide already!\n* If you got a dragon scale mail from wish, and a wand of polymorph, and you encountered a dangerous monster (ex. water demon), why don't you zap yourself?\n** Commentary: Your [[cloak]] will rip, and your mail will revert to scales.\n* [[BUC|BUC-testing]] potions at an [[altar]] while levitating will result in acrimony and broken glass.\n* Make sure there is no co-aligned priest in the firing line before zapping [[Speed monster]] at your pet.  This will anger the priest and you won't be able to enter his temple without being attacked.\n** If you manage to escape, don't return to that level with uncontrolled [[teleportitis]] as the RNG will teleport you into his temple and he will kill you.\n* When playing with number_pad off, be careful when going northwest. \"Really attack Izchak?\"\n* Beware the hallucinating pet arch-lich. (Make sure that that black light over there blows up in your face and not your pet's.)\n* Don't eat [[wraith]] corpses when [[satiated]]. You don't get a warning.\n** This also goes for [[tin]]s and [[meatballs]].\n* If you just spent a year extincting/genociding everything and then [[polypiling]] gems, hauling them to the first floor, trying for hours to get your [[giant]]s arranged around the upstair, and [[Wizard of Yendor|Rodney]] comes... for the love of God, don't quaff the [[potion of gain level]] he may drop on death without checking [[BUC]] first. [[DeathOnAStick|Lives have been ruined that way.]]\n* [[Plains centaur]]s in the mirror are stronger than they appear.\n* [[Baby silver dragon]]s don't reflect zaps of cold that you shoot at them. Looks like it's going to storm!\n* Hitting e instead of w can be a fatal mistake when you have a [[cockatrice]] corpse.\n* Don't stand on [[ice]] when there are foes with fire attack around.\n* What do you think [[amulet of life saving]] is for?\n* When [[polypiling]], be careful with where you aim. In particular, don't hit that damn chest with goodies - if it polymorphs into non-container, ALL CONTENTS ARE LOST.\n** Contents are always lost on polymorph, but the container has a 5% chance of resisting the polymorph beam. (95% for the Wallet of Perseus in SLASH'EM.)\n* Wield the [[cockatrice|cockatrice corpse]] when you're already in position to attack (you won't be moving into any unknown squares). Otherwise you will fall into a [[spiked pit]] on your way to your victim.\n**Commentary: and be instantaneously [[stoning|stoned]]. Any [[pit]], [[trap door]], or [[hole]] will have the same effect. If there is an item, you can check for known traps with the {{kbd|^}} command.\n* Don't anger your [[god]] after getting [[Intrinsic protection|divine protection]]. Praying for [[unholy water]] on a crossaligned [[altar]], for example.\n**Commentary: Unless you can afford to buy it back. ([[potion of unholy water|Unholy water]] can also be manufactured via [[confused]] [[BUC|blessed]] [[scroll of remove curse|remove curse]] or [[dip|dipping]] [[potions of water]] into [[fountain]]s.)\n* Don't melee [[cockatrice]]s if you're [[polymorph]]ed, ''especially'' if you are a [[vrock]], [[master mind flayer]], [[vampire lord]], [[dragon]] or any other biting monster.\n** If you are a yellow dragon it is safe. (You need to ''be'' a yellow dragon&mdash;yellow [[dragon scale mail]] isn't enough.)\n* Drop your [[gold]], [[bag of holding]], and [[unicorn horn]] on another square before [[sit|#sitting]] on a [[throne]].\n**Commentary: It is only necessary to drop your [[bag of holding]] or [[unicorn horn]] if your [[Luck]] is zero or less, in which case they could be [[BUC|cursed]]. See [[throne]] for more details on exact [[throne]] effects and precautions to take. It is also safer to put them into a container than to drop them, so that monsters can't get at them.\n* If you have recently dispatched a [[cockatrice]] while being blind and not wearing [[glove]]s, always move with the '[[m]]' key. Doing so will cause you not to automatically feel objects on the ground.\n* If someone throws an egg at you, it might have been a [[cockatrice egg]] - don't skip through the messages about stiffening and turning to stone as if they were ordinary battle spam, if you don't want to become a [[statue]].\n** Commentary: Cockatrice eggs are the only eggs monsters ever use.\n* If you don't have a way to protect against [[touch of death]], NEVER step off of an [[E-square]] when facing an [[arch-lich]].\n** Commentary: Or a [[scroll of scare monster]] as of 3.6.0.\n* While trying to tame something using {{spell of|charm monster}} that can resist, you'll probably gain a lot of pets. Naming them *all* will help keep you from sacrificing a pet (since corpses retain names) and losing your 50 points of [[protection]].\n* Always kill shapechangers when you see them.  If you don't they turn into bad things that will kill you. (argiopeweb -- Minotaur in Soko3)\n**Commentary: (Demin -- Black Dragon Gnomish Mines lv 2) (RegalStar -- Archlich in Soko4) (Beezor -- Master Lich on the Rogue Quest. Of course, I didn't realize there were like 8 guaranteed chameleons on that level at the time, so avoiding that level entirely was probably the best idea. It tele'd in w/ ToD before I could even see it)\n* If you see any messages pertaining to a [[swamp]], do NOT blithely skip along the level. You WILL hit the water, and all your stuff WILL get blanked.\n* If you're dipping potions into a fountain, don't typo and dip your bag of holding. The RNG will curse it. Every time.\n**Commentary: You can dig down on a [[fountain]] to make a [[moat|pool of water]], which is much safer to work with.\n**Commentary: When digging down on a fountain, don't stash your armor, weapons, and BoH within four squares of the fountain. The resulting flood can extend out to five. If 3.4.3 and earlier, write several [[Elbereth]] in the dust below the items; as of 3.6.0, use scrolls of scare monster instead. If you have a rustproof weapon like Grayswandir, it's probably best to take it with you into the moat.\n* Wielding a [[cockatrice corpse]] around a [[foocubus]] is an excellent way to get a [[Stoning|permanent hard-on]].\n**Commentary: A [[charisma]] of 20 will reliably allow you to tell the foocubus not to take your [[gloves]] off. Don't type too fast though.\n* Don't try to feed a [[dragon]] unless it is currently [[tame]]. If it is [[peaceful]], [[thrown]] [[food]] will anger it.\n**Commentary: Food can only be used to tame [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, and [[horse]]s, including their little and large stages; bananas will also tame some [[apelike creature]]s.\n* Standing on a burnt Elbereth and reverse genociding dragons to create DSM is a great idea... unless you have uncontrolled teleportitis.\n**Commentary: In that case, go to [[Sokoban]] and use an [[Elbereth]] cage.\n* If you are riding a dragon over water avoid any foocubus. There is a chance a given attack hits your steed and it will remove the saddle.\n* Destroying a drawbridge with force bolt kills everything in the same way as closing it. Including you.\n* Even if you've been struggling with containerless inventory management for 10,000 turns, and you've finally got a [[bag of holding]] from a wish, don't get all excited and just throw everything into it. That pesky [[wand of cancellation]] will go in last, and then you're screwed.\n* If your luck is negative, or even if you think it MIGHT be negative, DON'T WISH UNTIL YOU FIX IT!\n* Never eat an unknown tin whilst hallucinating. It WILL be cockatrice meat.\n**Commentary: Cockatrice and chickatrice meat always \"smells like chicken\" when hallucinating. (Chickens don't exist in vanilla NetHack.) Tins of [[disenchanter]] meat or anything of [[cannibalism|your race]] give no warning, however.\n* Be careful if you have suffered amnesia. Although not remembering the exact layout of a level while climbing the dungeon with the Amulet is annoying, what's more annoying is forgetting that ELAM EBOW is a scroll of enchant weapon, deciding not to identify it first, and then reading it while wielding your blessed +7 Grayswandir.\n** If you get mind-flayed very often, it helps to collect a specimen of everything in your [[stash]], to mass-identify.\n* Stand back when casting fireball unless you want your pets and belongings to burn.\n* When it comes to genociding (Master) Mind flayers, if you're a dwarf ... enough said ...\n* When surrounded by resurrecting rock troll corpses, don't quaff an unidentified potion. It will be polymorph, and you will become a grid bug.\n* In SLASH'EM, make sure you beware creatures hiding under items. It could be a deadly [[asphynx]], which has the ability to petrify you and cause an easy-to-miss YASD.\n* Unless you are in immediate danger of dying, don't break an unidentified wand. You may be killed by a blast of magic.\n**Commentary: Most of them blast you for some amount of damage dependent on their charges. Many of them have secondary effects like teleportation or slowing.\n* If the RNG gives you another bag of holding after you already have one, leave it alone. Don't carry it around as a spare. You ''will ''space out and try to put one of them in the other.\n**Commentary: Hauling it to your stash is good, but do so carefully, and possibly on a separate trip. Alternatively, putting both bags into another container will eliminate the possibility of typos.\n* When trying to get [[crowning|crowned]] so that your god will give you a [[spellbook of finger of death]], make sure your luck is actually maxed before casting create monster a couple hundred times.\n* Carrying around a lot of potions in your main inventory is a bad idea. You will step on a magic trap and die when a blast of fire causes all of your potions to boil and explode right after you've wished for blessed +3 [[silver dragon scale mail]] and [[the Master Key of Thievery]].\n** Commentary: You ideally want to stash them at some point anyway, unless you have a bag to keep them all in - the weight of potions can add up pretty quickly.\n* Don't try that genocide scroll until you've BUC tested it! A room full of Liches at level 3 leads to YASD!\n* A throne room full of dragons is fantastic for intrinsics but take your damn time in eating them. They're a lot to choke down and it sucks to find out that you have just choked on your disintegration resistance.\n** Commentary: Killing and eating them one at a time is good. A [[tinning kit]] will also help. They are larger than most other corpses.\n* Using a cursed [[scroll of create monster]] to create sacrifice fodder is never a good idea.\n**Commentary: Though a confused one is handy at times (it will produce only acid blobs, good for blocking movement.)\n**Commentary: '''Never''' try to create monsters as a weak character without a good escape route. Almost every monster creation method has a chance of summoning a horde rather than a single monster. \n* Don't throw Mjollnir while blind -- you won't catch it, and will likely be hit and lose all your wands and rings.\n* Consider that Mjollnir returns only 99% of the time before throwing it at a Titan.\n* Sex in real life can cause life-threatening conditions. This applies to NetHack too, for [[Foocubus|different reasons]].\n* Wishes are valuable. To avoid wasting one on a redundant item, know your inventory ''before'' employing a potential source of wishing.\n** Commentary: Wishes are divine in nature, so praying right after receiving one is a bad idea.\n* Found the [[Big Room]]? Stay on the up stair and watch out for [[quantum mechanic]]s!\n* Dragon scales don't make good polyfodder.\n* If you're wearing the Tie-Dye Shirt of Shambhala (in dNetHack) that your god gave you, wear your [[ring of polymorph control]] too (a mask isn't enough), or stepping on a polytrap will deprive you of its increased carrying capacity for the rest of your run!\n* [[Teleport control]] doesn't work when you're unconscious from rotten food, so even it's not a complete safeguard against [[teleportitis]].\n* A greased helmet is not a license to melee [[mind flayer]]s.\n* Always use up [[cockatrice egg]]s you lay. Tame cockatrices turn any [[golem]] to [[stone golem]], which is hard to kill.\n**Commentary: Or store the [[egg]] in a [[container]] until it is no longer hatchable after 200 [[turns]]. It will still [[petrify]] when you want to use it.\n* Cursed [[athame]]s aren't good items to [[engrave]] with.\n* After you're done dancing with nurses or foocubuses, DON'T FORGET TO RE-EQUIP YOURSELF!\n* On that note, be sure to remove all armor AND weapons before reverse-genociding that swarm of nurses.\n* A [[xorn]] will gladly munch your [[Magicbane]], especially when you disrobe to take a bath and blank scrolls.\n** Sacrifice gifts are always rustproof, and if you wish for it you should order it rustproof, so there is usually no reason to unwield artifacts for that anyway.\n* When you're on a level with water or lava, and you have uncontrolled teleportitis, and your connection is laggy, TREAD LIGHTLY.\n* If you've altar scummed for [[Magicbane]] as a wizard who started with a [[ring of slow digestion]], don't forget that you can actually use it to engrave an E-square when you're facing a giant ant.\n**Commentary: Engrave with Magicbane, not the ring of course ;).\n* Be careful about wishing for cross-aligned/cross-class artifacts when low-level or low on health, especially when said artifacts are intelligent.\n* Don't polymorph an air elemental in Slash'em. You will get a very fast baby dragon that is even more powerful.\n** Commentary: Also applies to vanilla, and the resulting monster will be that fast only for 1 turn.\n* Do not try to [[Dragon scale mail#Making dragon scale mail from scales|make]] a set of dragon scales into a dragon scale mail if the dragon scales are already enchanted to +4 or higher. As of NetHack 3.6.2, the evaporation check takes place before the merging, so you risk losing it. Even an uncursed [[Scroll of enchant armor|scroll]], which would not normally add an enchantment point, will try to evaporate an overenchanted set of scales.\n** Commentary: this situation might happen as a result of stepping onto a [[polymorph trap]] without magic resistance while wearing an overenchanted dragon scale mail. You turn into a dragon and the mail is reverted to a set of scales, yet the enchantment is preserved. After returning to your normal form, lower the enchantment to +3 before trying to convert them to a dragon scale mail again.\n* Just because you're at -20 AC and dodged a shot from a [[wand of death]] doesn't mean you'll be able to do it a second time. When in doubt, just play it safe and teleport out of there.\n* Don't ever try clearing a [[throne room]] with a newly-gifted [[Mjollnir]] when you have no means of escape or other ways to fight them, or else you'll find yourself with a room full of awake monsters throwing everything they have at you.\n* Be extra careful with powerful pets, such as a dragon, around shopkeepers or priests. They will be more than happy to paint the town red for you and leave you without a source of price ID or protection. Remember, power is nothing without control.\n\n===[[Gnomish Mines]]===\n* Be wary of statues in the [[Gnomish Mines]]...\n* And also remember to press ''k ''if you want to kick things off a rolling boulder trap in the Gnomish Mines\n* Skip the Gnomish Mines and come back when you're more powerful, or, you won't get past level 3 of the main branch and will die in the Gnomish Mines.\n**Commentary: If you're playing as a [[Gnome (starting race)|gnome]] or [[Dwarf (starting race)|dwarf]], most of the monsters will be peaceful.\n* If you find [[Minetown]] [[bones]], before you go #chatting up the [[priest]], make SURE both the priest and the [[altar]] are of the same [[alignment]].\n**Commentary: Also make sure that the [[temple]] isn't haunted. There is no way to fix that.\n* If a fountain in [[Minetown]] reduces to a trickle, cease using it immediately.\n* If you want to create [[Excalibur]] in Minetown, make absolutely sure that there are no watchmen around (or that you have a pet strong enough to deal with them). Even if they aren't in sight, they will somehow sense you and get angry at you, and killing them count as murder.\n* Do not walk around Minetown blind for easy guard murder as a chaotic until you can smite a [[leocrotta]] in one hit. The Watch Captain hits hard at lower levels. If not chaotic, wait it out.\n**Commentary: #[[Chat]] will get responses from watchmen: if you get none, it is safe to move there.\n* A trio of [[large cat]]s will not protect you from a [[floating eye]] in [[Minetown]].\n\n===[[Sokoban]]===\n* Do NOT do Sokoban if your NetHack lags.\n* Just because you beat [[Sokoban]] and got a [[bag of holding]] doesn't mean you're invincible.\n* When in [[Sokoban]], and you are at the fringe of death, do not try to teleport away using a scroll of teleportation. Sokoban is a [[non-teleport level|no-teleport area]], which will result in a few more hits from that monster you are trying to flee from, possibly resulting in your death.\n* When you solve a [[Sokoban]] level and open the door at the end of the hall, it will be packed with monsters. One might just be a [[Nymph]] who will charm you, steal your [[wand of death]], fail to teleport then use it on you.\n** Instead, displace a pet inside, or fight diagonally at the door because monsters are less likely to zap you at melee range.\n** For that matter, always use [[telepathy]] to scout out the [[treasure zoo]] before rushing inside.\n* Keep in mind that an [[amulet of reflection|AoR]] from [[Sokoban]] can be cursed, although you should put it on anyway. BUC status has no effect on the amulet's power; you just can't take it off as with any cursed amulet.\n** Commentary: If the amulet is missing for some reason, kill and search every monster on the level. Monsters will never pick up the [[bag of holding]].\n* Training escape spells by repeatedly casting \"{{spell of|jumping}}\" is a sound strategy -- except in Sokoban. Especially if you plan to zap your wand of wishing soon afterward.\n**Commentary: Jumping in Sokoban carries a &minus;1 Luck penalty. You don't get dinged if you press escape at the prompt where you want to jump.  You can also jump without penalty on a level you have already solved.\n* If you just broke boulders or did anything that could reduce your luck, be extra careful. You don't want your prayer to fail.\n\n===[[Medusa's Island]]===\n* {{spell of|Levitation}} spells don't cut it on [[Medusa's Island]]. Find a permanent source.\n** Commentary: With [[escape spells]] at a [[skill]] level of Skilled or Expert, the spell is equivalent to a blessed [[potion of levitation]], giving 250&ndash;299 turns of [[levitation]], which should be sufficient. At Unskilled or Basic, this spell may give you as few as ''ten'' turns.\n** Commentary: In Nethack 3.6.1, you will get a warning when your levitation is about to run out, giving you time to cast the spell again or get above ground if you watch your warnings.\n* Don't go below dungeon level 18 or so without a means of crossing water. Falling past [[Medusa]] through a hole can really ruin your whole day.\n** Commentary: You can continue pressing onward and find a means to cross, e.g. a wand of cold or some scrolls of earth - at minimum you're very likely to get something from the Castle, aside from the guaranteed wand of wishing.\n* Don't eat anything while standing on [[Medusa]]'s corpse. You WILL fatfinger it and suffer a legendarily stupid [[stoning]].\n** Commentary: Watch out for [[footrice]]s as well. [[Green slime]]s are dangerous as well, to a lesser extent.\n* AVOID [[foocubus|foocubi]] of opposite gender when levitating over water in Medusa's level using boots. Drowning is not kinky.\n** Commentary: A [[charisma]] of 20 will force the foocubi to ask, but watch out for typos.\n* Blind yourself BEFORE walking up the stairs to Medusa's house if you've dug to avoid moving over her water. Else she will petrify you right away.\n**Commentary: Medusa is @. Elbereth won't stop her, even if you have time to burn it.\n* If you have [[jumping boots]] or can cast the spell, it's possible to cross the water on Medusa's level by jumping from island to island. Just make sure that the statue you're about to jump towards really is a statue, and not a mimic who will block your jump with fatal results.\n* Don't bring a pet [[gremlin]] to [[Medusa]]'s level.\n\n===[[Quest]]===\n* Don't EVER tangle with [[Cyclops]], the [[Healer]] quest nemesis, in melee.\n**Commentary: [[Magic cancellation]] has no effect on [[the Staff of Aesculapius]]'s level draining attack.\n* Don't rely on a [[quest artifact]] as the only source of ANYTHING.\n**Commentary: That is, in the late game, where the [[Wizard of Yendor]] can appear and steal it. Before that, it is fine.\n* Any monster in the '[[follower]]' category will follow you through portals created by [[the Eye of the Aethiopica]].\n**Commentary: They will also follow you through [[staircases]] or any other level change.\n* Monsters will follow you through your quest portal. Engraving on the portal square doesn't work.\n* If you [[Eye of the Aethiopica|Branchport]] into [[Fort Ludios]], you may very well land in the area just outside the inner keep and get swarmed by everything. While it's (generally) not a fatal error, it can still get rather annoying when you can't deal with about fifty creatures one-on-one.\n* [[Ashikaga Takauji]] gets two attacks per round.  While extremely unlikely, it's possible to get [[Tsurugi of Muramasa|bisected]] twice in a row, so even an [[Amulet of life saving]] isn't a surefire way to survive!\n* Don't kick trees in the [[ranger quest]] maze, unless you want the resident [[minotaur]] to ruin your day.\n* Never, ever, ever [[jump]] near your [[quest leader]]. Your [[quest portal]] will be removed, with only one way to salvage your game: [[the Eye of the Aethiopica]].  Better hope you're a [[neutral]] non-[[wizard]].  It also helps to be able to cast {{Spell of|charm monster}} with a relatively low failure rate.\n* If you genocide [[giant]]s before you do the [[Valkyrie]] [[quest]], you will get lots of [[titan]]s instead. You don't want lots of titans.\n* If you have controlled teleportitis, don't use an uncursed scroll of earth to build your boulder fort - especially in Kaen's lair.\n* In SLASH'EM, yes, you '''can''' sacrifice [[The Hand of Vecna (SLASH'EM)|the Hand of Vecna]]. And yes, this gets rid of it permanently.\n* On the Valkyrie goal level, there's a good chance that a boulder dropped or thrown by a giant will block a drawbridge. If you must use a wand of striking to dispose of it, do so from a safe distance.\n* Reflection is very important on the Ranger Quest. Lots of centaurs means lots of attack wands.\n\n===[[Castle]]===\n* The castle level is a cruel, cruel place... Trust me...\n* Don't crush [[peaceful]]s in the Castle [[drawbridge]], even if you don't want a [[red naga]] to fry you under conflict. The resulting bad luck can make your wished-for blessed magic marker come out cursed. The resulting cursed scrolls of charging will ''discharge'' and waste your wand of wishing.\n* Even though you're fire resistant and put on that ring of levitation to get out of the [[lava]], you'll still die instantly when your legs get stuck.\n* Forcing the lock on the chest with a blunt weapon on the castle level isn't the best idea. Kicking it isn't such a good idea either, if the object you're expecting happens to be made of glass or crystal.\n* If you drop your weapons and armor to go for a scroll-blanking swim in the [[castle]]'s moat, please take care where you leave those items lying around. Chasing down a [[master mind flayer]] that's made off with your +7 [[Grayswandir]] is not fun when you're unarmed.\n** Commentary: it's typically unnecessary to unequip your main weapon for this, unless it's not [[rustproof]] (and all [[gift]]s are).  In particular, Grayswandir is [[silver]] and thus cannot rust.\n* When you get to the [[castle]] level, do not burn [[Elbereth]] on the drawbridge and fight the monsters there. A wand of striking will kill you instantly, and it won't be fun.\n* Plugging the [[trap door]]s on the Castle level with boulders is a [[Bad Idea]].  It will result in the lower levels being inaccessible, except through a [[controlled]] level teleport.\n**Commentary: You cannot dig downwards on the [[castle]] level. Leaving even one trap door open is sufficient. Since [[NetHack 3.6.0]] you can dig through the filled trap doors.\n*When you're cutting a swathe on your way to the castle and you spot a master mind flayer nearby, and you're confident because you greased a helmet specifically for this occasion, if you're going to engage him in melee, '''''make sure you put the blasted thing on.'''''\n\n===[[Gehennom]]===\n* When breaking wands for their area-denial purpose, DO NOT break a [[wand of lightning]] unless you hate your rings.\n* Especially not when Demogorgon is on the level. Not even if double-meleeing arch liches.\n** Commentary: the Wizard of Yendor and his clone are better examples, since arch-liches are resistant anyway.\n*** Sorry, it was me who did that, and it just makes the original death even stupider in retrospect…  {{unsigned|Ais523|12:43, 20 October 2012 (UTC)}}\n* In [[Moloch's Sanctum]], be sure that you have entered the temple, and that the [[high priest]] has called you an infidel, before killing him. If you don't, you'll get dinged for [[murder]].\n* Watch where you kill the Wizard the first time. Killing him above the moat is a VERY VERY bad idea if you can't swim.\n**Commentary: A way to fill the moat like a [[scroll of earth]], [[wand of cold]], [[frost horn]], the spell of {{spell of|cone of cold}}, or access to white or silver [[dragon]] breath attacks will resolve the problem. The [[invocation artifacts]] and the [[Amulet of Yendor]] will always rise to the surface.\n* After spending hours of hard work and effort to descend into Gehennom, only to be swamped by monsters, remember to check your status as often as your inventory. Scrolls of genocide may be great escape items, but only if that umber hulk next to you isn't looking your way!\n**Commentary: And no, your AoLS will not save your sorry self here! In general, the [[amulet of life saving]] will fail to save you if you genocide yourself or have your intelligence reduced below 3 by a [[mind flayer]].\n* When you've been fighting hordes of monsters as a master mind flayer, remember that your stomach is now quite full. Do not try eating anything, especially a randomly generated newt in the lower levels of Gehennom just to try and get that one extra point of power for the heck of it.\n* If you enter an area (say, perhaps the zoo on the way to kill the Wizard) with cockatrices and weapon-wielding monsters (say, perhaps a troll), back off and make SURE you've got a lizard corpse handy in your inventory. Be a good Boy Scout and always be prepared.\n* Do not [[teleport at will]] while hungry if there is a demon prince attacking you. You will likely faint from the energy cost of this and be entirely at their mercy.\n** Commentary: As of NetHack 3.7, it doesn't work in their presence anyway.\n* Don't attack [[Orcus]] with [[Mjollnir]], unless you want that shiny [[Wand of death|Wand of Death]] to be destroyed by lightning.\n* Just walk right up to the [[Executioner]] in [[Sheol]] ([[UnNethack]]). Come on Punk, make my day.\n* [[Levitation]] does not protect you from the [[kraken]] in [[Wizard of Yendor|Rodney]]'s (the wizard, not the bot) [[moat]].\n** Commentary: And neither does [[flight]].\n* Don't engrave [[Elbereth]] on the [[vibrating square]]. Else [[Orcus]] won't follow you into the [[Sanctum]] to retrieve the Amulet. (He will no longer retrieve it for you anyway as of 3.6.1.)\n\n===[[Ascension run]]===\n* Using [[water walking boots]] on the [[plane of water]] will result in you drowning. [[Levitation]], on the other hand, will work safely.\n**Commentary: As of version 3.6, you can't levitate there either.\n* Don't try to disarm/disarmor your [[Archon]] with F command when [[polymorph]]ed into a [[nymph]]. You can untame it.\n** Commentary: Instead, [[scroll of enchant armor|enchant]] its new [[armor]] better than what it's currently wearing, and drop the armor in front of your [[pet]]. It will change once it eventually picks it up. [[Weapon]]s are a bit trickier&mdash;a [[bullwhip]] is a safe way to disarm your pet. To keep it from swapping artifacts, you want it to drop as many items as possible before you give it its new weapon.\n* Zapping a high priest/priestess on the Astral Plane with a wand of teleportation to move them off an altar DOES NOT WORK. It makes them angry instead, even if they were peaceful beforehand.\n* Don't polymorph in > direction while riding. Even your ki-rin is not invincible; A's are vulnerable to system shocks!\n* Don't mess with player type characters on the Astral Plane. Yes, there's only a small chance they'll be spawned with the Vorpal Blade. Yes, there's only a slight chance that the Vorpal Blade will instantly behead you. The RNG will kill you. Every time.\n* [[Archon]]s' dazzle is incredibly annoying — {{of|pair|lenses}} are nearly worthless.\n**Commentary: Lenses do not stop an Archon's gaze attack, only [[blinding venom]] and [[raven]] claws.\n* Despite an Archon being a very powerful and useful pet capable of dispatching many enemies on its own, it is not immune to being engulfed and digested.\n* Don't let your flying steed die when you're over water or lava. [[Fire elemental]]s on the [[Plane of Fire]] can do a lot of damage to a steed without [[fire resistance]].\n* A steam vortex will happily carry you out of an air bubble on the Plane of Water, even if you aren't levitating.  You'll drown as soon as you're expelled.\n* [[Far look]] won't tell you if a high altar is co-aligned - [[Altar#High altars|\"aligned\" and \"co-aligned\" are not the same.]]\n* If you lack [[reflection]], don't forget about [[Medusa]].\n* Polymorphing into a (master) [[mind flayer]] on Astral might not be such a good idea - eating the brains of any [[Rider]] will kill you instantly.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Bad Idea]]\n*[[YASD]]\n*[[DeathOnAStick]]\n{{nethack-367}}\n[[Category:Community]]"}

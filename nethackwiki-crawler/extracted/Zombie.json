The group consists of undead monsters in the [zombie](/wiki/Zombie_\\(monster_class\\) \"Zombie (monster class)\") [monster](/wiki/Monster \"Monster\") class that correspond to a living monster, and includes the following:[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-undead_to_corpse-1)\n\n- Z [kobold zombie](/wiki/Kobold_zombie \"Kobold zombie\")\n- Z [gnome zombie](/wiki/Gnome_zombie \"Gnome zombie\")\n- Z [orc zombie](/wiki/Orc_zombie \"Orc zombie\")\n- Z [dwarf zombie](/wiki/Dwarf_zombie \"Dwarf zombie\")\n- Z [elf zombie](/wiki/Elf_zombie \"Elf zombie\")\n- Z [human zombie](/wiki/Human_zombie \"Human zombie\")\n- Z [ettin zombie](/wiki/Ettin_zombie \"Ettin zombie\")\n- Z [giant zombie](/wiki/Giant_zombie \"Giant zombie\")\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Common traits](#Common_traits)\n  - [1.1 Generation](#Generation)\n\n- [2 History](#History)\n\n- [3 Origin](#Origin)\n\n- [4 Variants](#Variants)\n\n  - [4.1 SLASH'EM](#SLASH.27EM)\n  - [4.2 GruntHack](#GruntHack)\n  - [4.3 dNetHack](#dNetHack)\n  - [4.4 xNetHack](#xNetHack)\n  - [4.5 EvilHack](#EvilHack)\n  - [4.6 Hack'EM](#Hack.27EM)\n\n- [5 Encyclopedia entry](#Encyclopedia_entry)\n\n- [6 See also](#See_also)\n\n- [7 References](#References)\n\n## Common traits\n\nAll zombies are chaotic, [mindless](/wiki/Mindless \"Mindless\") [humanoid](/wiki/Humanoid \"Humanoid\") [undead](/wiki/Undead \"Undead\") that possess [unbreathing](/wiki/Unbreathing \"Unbreathing\") and [infravision](/wiki/Infravision \"Infravision\"), and are [inediate](/wiki/Inediate \"Inediate\"). They can [follow](/wiki/Follow \"Follow\") [you](/wiki/You \"You\") to another level if they are adjacent to you when you leave the level.\n\n### Generation\n\nRandomly generated zombies will always be hostile. Zombies are frequently found in [graveyards](/wiki/Graveyard \"Graveyard\"), where they are always generated hostile and asleep. As the zombie monster class is the first [quest](/wiki/Quest \"Quest\") monster class for [Priests](/wiki/Priest \"Priest\"), the 14% of monsters from that class that are randomly generated within the [Priest quest](/wiki/Priest_quest \"Priest quest\") will include the various zombie monsters.\n\nZombies are considered [corpseless](/wiki/Corpseless \"Corpseless\"), with a special case that generates an aged [corpse](/wiki/Corpse \"Corpse\") of their living counterpart upon \"death\" in circumstances where a monster would ordinarily leave a corpse (e.g. a gnome zombie leaves an old [gnome](/wiki/Gnome \"Gnome\") corpse when \"killed\" in combat).[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-undead_to_corpse-1)[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-make_corpse-2) This means that listed nutritional values for zombies are only relevant to [pets](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\") or [polymorphed](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") player characters that [digest](/wiki/Digest \"Digest\") zombies - corpses left behind by zombies use their normal nutritional values, though they are usually too old to be eaten safely without a [tinning kit](/wiki/Tinning_kit \"Tinning kit\").\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\n[Liches](/wiki/Lich_\\(monster_class\\) \"Lich (monster class)\") and other zombies can now raise monsters killed by them without a weapon as zombies, unless they are [cancelled](/wiki/Cancelled \"Cancelled\") - the corpse will rise 5-20 turns after death if it has a corresponding zombie type, and [you](/wiki/You \"You\") can also do this if polymorphed into a zombie or lich. Zombies and liches will [grudge](/wiki/Grudge \"Grudge\") living monsters that can be turned into zombies. Players killed by a lich will arise in bones as a zombie of the corresponding type - as of [commit 3c421da7](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/3c421da746cdd3844c7f8d2312c7be5e5a25cfb9), the zombie will have the same intrinsics as the former character.\n\nThe mausoleum [themed room](/wiki/Themed_room \"Themed room\") may have a randomly generated zombie sealed and [meditating](/wiki/Meditating \"Meditating\") within its central subroom.\n\nAs of [commit 852f8e4](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/852f8e49961a613fea4238cf23b89449ee5120bf) and [commit 98d2b0e](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/98d2b0ecb3145e698ea1f6155a75f8021d13dcfb), buried zombie corpses will revive if items land, are placed or are dropped on their square, with the response dependent on the weight of the item and the type of impact.\n\n## History\n\nThe zombie first appears in Hack 1.21, a variant of [Jay Fenlason's Hack](/wiki/Jay_Fenlason%27s_Hack \"Jay Fenlason's Hack\"), where is uses the z glyph; it also appears in Hack for PDP-11, where it first uses the current glyph, Z. The zombie is included in the initial bestiary for [Hack 1.0](/wiki/Hack_1.0 \"Hack 1.0\"), and appears in the game from that version to [NetHack 2.3e](/wiki/NetHack_2.3e \"NetHack 2.3e\"), using the same glyph throughout; in these versions, it is the equivalent of the modern [human zombie](/wiki/Human_zombie \"Human zombie\").\n\nIn [NetHack 3.0.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.0.0 \"NetHack 3.0.0\"), most of the zombies are introduced and differentiated with the exception of the dwarf zombie, which is added in [NetHack 3.3.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.3.0 \"NetHack 3.3.0\").\n\n## Origin\n\n[![Wikipedia](/images/thumb/f/f8/Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png/50px-Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png)](/wiki/File:Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png \"Wikipedia\")\n\n[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page \"wikipedia:Main Page\") has an article about:\n\n***[Zombie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Zombie \"wikipedia:Special:Search/Zombie\")***\n\nA zombie is a form of reanimated corpse raised by magical means, such as witchcraft, or science fictional methods such as fungi or pathogens. First recorded in 1819, the word originates from the Hatian French *zombi* among other similar roots, and appears in various forms in cultural folklore as well as fantasy and horror media. One of the first books to expose Western culture to the concept of the voodoo zombie was W. B. Seabrook's 1929 novel *[The Magic Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Island \"wikipedia:The Magic Island\")*, presented as the account of a narrator who encounters voodoo cults in Haiti and their resurrected thralls.\n\nThe modern zombie may have been codified by the [George A. Romero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_A._Romero \"wikipedia:George A. Romero\") film *[Night of the Living Dead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Living_Dead \"wikipedia:Night of the Living Dead\")*, where the titular undead flesh-eaters were referred to as \"zombies\" by many film critics, though they were much closer to ghouls in mannerisms and are referred to as such in Romero's original scripts and the film itself. The film and its monsters are also partly inspired by 1954 [Richard Matheson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Matheson \"wikipedia:Richard Matheson\") novel *[I Am Legend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Legend_\\(novel\\) \"wikipedia:I Am Legend (novel)\")* - despite considering them distinct from zombies (e.g. as seen in *White Zombie* starring Bela Lugosi), Romero came to use the term similarly in later interviews and eventually accepted the linkage between the concepts.\n\n*Night of the Living Dead*, as well as two of Romero's later films, the 1978 *Dawn of the Dead* and the 1985 *The Return of the Living Dead*, helped to further establish the image of the zombie in popular culture, further assisted by the release of break-out franchise-starting video games *Resident Evil* and *The House of the Dead* in the mid-1990s; the \"zombie apocalypse\" concept, in which the civilized world is brought low by a global zombie infestation, has since become a staple of modern popular art, seen in such media as *The Walking Dead*. Still-later portrayals would come to humanize and even romanticize the zombie\n\nThe zombies of *[Dungeons & Dragons](/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons \"Dungeons & Dragons\")* are introduced in the first editions as magically animated corpses commanded by an evil spellcaster or cleric that animated them, and are typically found near graveyards, in dungeons, and in similar. Zombies obey simple commands and are slow-moving, but always deal damage when they hit and will fight until they are either destroyed or [turned back](/wiki/Turn_undead \"Turn undead\") by a cleric. They are immune to magic that induces sleep, charming, holding, and cold, but are especially vulnerable to [holy water](/wiki/Holy_water \"Holy water\").\n\n## Variants\n\nMany variants implement a form of mutual [grudge](/wiki/Grudge \"Grudge\") between zombies and living monsters, as well as a form of revival similar to [trolls](/wiki/Troll_\\(monster_class\\) \"Troll (monster class)\"). [Material hatred](/wiki/Material_hatred \"Material hatred\") that applies to a living monster is typically not applied to their zombie forms.\n\n### SLASH'EM\n\nIn [SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\"), zombies can be generated by using the [raise zombies](/wiki/Raise_zombies \"Raise zombies\") [technique](/wiki/Technique \"Technique\") near the appropriate corpses.\n\nPlayer [gnomes](/wiki/Gnome_\\(starting_race\\) \"Gnome (starting race)\") and [dwarves](/wiki/Dwarf_\\(starting_race\\) \"Dwarf (starting race)\") in the [Gnomish Mines](/wiki/Gnomish_Mines \"Gnomish Mines\") will find most of the ordinarily peaceful denizens from *NetHack* replaced with zombies and other hostile monsters, ensuring that all player roles and races must contend with a dangerous descent through the branch.[\\[3\\]](#cite_note-3) The specific following substitutions generate zombies:\n\n- G Gnomes become Z [gnome zombies](/wiki/Gnome_zombie \"Gnome zombie\")\n- h [Dwarves](/wiki/Dwarf_\\(monster\\) \"Dwarf (monster)\") become Z [dwarf zombies](/wiki/Dwarf_zombie \"Dwarf zombie\")\n\n### GruntHack\n\n- *Main article: [Zombie (GruntHack)](/wiki/Zombie_\\(GruntHack\\) \"Zombie (GruntHack)\")*\n\nIn [GruntHack](/wiki/GruntHack \"GruntHack\"), zombies are [racial monsters](/wiki/Racial_monster \"Racial monster\") and can be any of the following races: human, elf, kobold, gnome, dwarf, giant, ettin, orc, and ogre.\n\nZombies in GruntHack are incredibly dangerous compared to their *NetHack* counterparts: they have bites that can inflict [intelligence drain](/wiki/Intelligence_drain \"Intelligence drain\") similar to [mind flayers](/wiki/Mind_flayer \"Mind flayer\") and/or make you [terminally ill](/wiki/Terminally_ill \"Terminally ill\"), and can revive from the corpses they leave behind; these corpses also inflict terminal illness if eaten as well, in addition to the normal effects of eating that corpse. Monsters that die of terminal illness from a zombie will rise as a zombie if they have a compatible form, including the player (who will always be of a compatible form).\n\nAdditionally, zombies will grudge other living monsters and vice versa, making them as much of a danger to the other denizens of the dungeon as they are to you - interestingly, grudges between monsters also apply to their undead forms. A means of curing sickness should be a priority for any GruntHack character, along with a means to permanently dispose of them (e.g., via locked [container](/wiki/Container \"Container\") or [tinning kit](/wiki/Tinning_kit \"Tinning kit\")). As with mind flayers, a [helm](/wiki/Helm \"Helm\") can sometimes block the additional effects of a zombie's bite attack (though it does not do so as often due to a bug), and a helm that is either [greased](/wiki/Greased \"Greased\") or has the [oilskin](/index.php?title=Oilskin\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Oilskin (page does not exist)\") [object property](/wiki/Object_property \"Object property\") (limited to [cloth](/wiki/Cloth \"Cloth\") helms) will block them outright.\n\n### dNetHack\n\n- *Main article: [Zombie (dNetHack)](/wiki/Zombie_\\(dNetHack\\) \"Zombie (dNetHack)\")*\n\nIn [dNetHack](/wiki/DNetHack \"DNetHack\"), a majority of zombies exist as a form of templated monster, making it possible for most living monsters to have zombie counterparts. There are also new and returning monsters in the zombie monster class.\n\nMonsters that are attacked in melee by zombies are infected, and 1⁄20 of melee attacks from [skeleton monsters](/index.php?title=Skeleton_\\(dNetHack\\)\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Skeleton (dNetHack) (page does not exist)\") will also infect a target monster; once killed, the infected monster will rise from their corpse as a zombie. A player of a living race that is killed by any zombie monster will arise as a zombie of that races if a [bones](/wiki/Bones \"Bones\") file is left. The presence of a [dread seraph](/wiki/Dread_seraph \"Dread seraph\") on a level will cause corpses dropped on that level to potentially revive as zombies, regardless of whether that seraph is awake, sepulchered or otherwise; leaving normal bones (i.e. corpse and a player ghost) on a level with a dread seraph will result in the corpse animating as a zombie as normal.\n\nZombies themselves can reanimate from their corpses with nearly the same the same rules as trolls, e.g. they cannot revive if they are [cancelled](/wiki/Cancelled \"Cancelled\") or locked into a container. Since zombies are unbreathing, they can also revive while in water.\n\n### xNetHack\n\nIn [xNetHack](/wiki/XNetHack \"XNetHack\"), the list of zombie monsters matches that of *NetHack*, but they are given many new characteristics, including those drawn from upcoming versions of *NetHack*: Zombies will occasionally revive from their own corpses similar to trolls, but they have a lower overall chance, and will not revive at all if cancelled or [beheaded](/wiki/Behead \"Behead\"); they can also revive when buried. Zombies will also grudge monsters that they can zombify, and vice-versa.\n\nMonsters with zombie forms that are killed in melee by zombies and [liches](/wiki/Lich_\\(monster_class\\) \"Lich (monster class)\") will immediately rise as zombies, and zombies created by a tame zombie or lich will also be tame. Players that die at the hands of a zombie or lich will rise as a zombie in [bones](/wiki/Bones \"Bones\"), and have a 1⁄4 chance of immediately resurrecting as a zombie with permanent intrinsic [unchanging](/wiki/Unchanging \"Unchanging\").\n\n### EvilHack\n\n- *Main article: [Zombie (EvilHack)](/wiki/Zombie_\\(EvilHack\\) \"Zombie (EvilHack)\")*\n\nIn [EvilHack](/wiki/EvilHack \"EvilHack\"), zombies can be any of the variations encountered in *NetHack*, with the addition of the [hobbit zombie](/wiki/Hobbit_zombie \"Hobbit zombie\"), [gnoll witherling](/wiki/Gnoll_witherling \"Gnoll witherling\") and [drow zombie](/wiki/Drow_zombie \"Drow zombie\") as well. EvilHack zombies behave similarly to GruntHack, though they have their own entries in monst.c rather than racial templates, and several modifications are made to keep them distinct and less overwhelmingly difficult while still being quite challenging.\n\nA zombie's claw attack is poisonous (with frequency similar to that of a [rabid rat](/wiki/Rabid_rat \"Rabid rat\")), and their brain-eating bite can cause intelligence loss, but they also have a lower chance of reviving from their corpse, and they will not revive at all if cancelled or beheaded. Zombies can transfer illness the same way as in GruntHack - either via their bite or a player consuming their corpse - and monsters with zombie forms that are killed by a zombie will eventually revive as one; as in xNetHack, a player killed this way may rarely be able to continue on as a zombie with permanent unchanging.\n\nThe same methods for permanently disposing of zombies in GruntHack are generally applicable in EvilHack; zombie corpses will always cause terminal illness when eaten, making it possible to permanently get rid of them by eating one and then using a reliable illness cure such as a unicorn horn. [Lava](/wiki/Lava \"Lava\") is slightly more common in the main dungeon, making it easier to burn up the corpses by [dipping](/wiki/Dip \"Dip\"), throwing or dropping them into the lava square; dipping a zombie corpse into a [forge](/wiki/Forge_\\(dungeon_feature\\) \"Forge (dungeon feature)\") will also incinerate it. [Sunsword](/wiki/Sunsword \"Sunsword\") can vaporize zombies it kills permanently, including a chance of instantly destroying them similar to other [Bane](/wiki/Bane \"Bane\")-style weapons in EvilHack.\n\nHelms will more reliably prevent the effects of a zombie's bites compared to GruntHack, and helms that are greased or oilskin will block them outright; applying [barding](/wiki/Barding \"Barding\") to a steed can protect them from zombie bites. [Illithids](/wiki/Illithid_\\(starting_race\\) \"Illithid (starting race)\") and mind flayers have [psychic resistance](/index.php?title=Psychic_resistance\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Psychic resistance (page does not exist)\"), giving them immunity to the brain-targeting secondary effects of a zombie bite, though they can still be poisoned and made ill. The [cure sickness](/wiki/Cure_sickness \"Cure sickness\") spell, which is directional in EvilHack, can damage zombies in the path of the beam.\n\n### Hack'EM\n\nIn [Hack'EM](/wiki/Hack%27EM \"Hack'EM\"), zombies can be any of the monster races encountered in EvilHack, with the addition of the [centaur zombie](/index.php?title=Centaur_zombie\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Centaur zombie (page does not exist)\") as well. Hack'EM zombies behave primarily the same as they do in EvilHack, and are additionally damaged by wands of [healing](/wiki/Wand_of_healing \"Wand of healing\") and [extra healing](/wiki/Wand_of_extra_healing \"Wand of extra healing\").\n\nThe [artifact weapon](/wiki/Artifact_weapon \"Artifact weapon\") [Mortality Dial](/wiki/Mortality_Dial \"Mortality Dial\") prevents zombies and other monsters from automatically reviving.\n\n## Encyclopedia entry\n\nThe zombi ... is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but taken from the grave and endowed by sorcery with a mechanical semblance of life, -- it is a dead body which is made to walk and act and move as if it were alive.\n\n\\[ W.

First recorded in 1819, the word originates from the Hatian French <i>zombi</i> among other similar roots, and appears in various forms in cultural folklore as well as fantasy and horror media. One of the first books to expose Western culture to the concept of the voodoo zombie was W. B. Seabrook's 1929 novel <i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Island\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:The Magic Island\">The Magic Island</a></i>, presented as the account of a narrator who encounters voodoo cults in Haiti and their resurrected thralls.\n</p><p>The modern zombie may have been codified by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_A._Romero\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:George A. Romero\">George A. Romero</a> film <i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Living_Dead\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Night of the Living Dead\">Night of the Living Dead</a></i>, where the titular undead flesh-eaters were referred to as \"zombies\" by many film critics, though they were much closer to ghouls in mannerisms and are referred to as such in Romero's original scripts and the film itself. The film and its monsters are also partly inspired by 1954 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Matheson\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Richard Matheson\">Richard Matheson</a> novel <i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Legend_(novel)\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:I Am Legend (novel)\">I Am Legend</a></i> - despite considering them distinct from zombies (e.g. as seen in <i>White Zombie</i> starring Bela Lugosi), Romero came to use the term similarly in later interviews and eventually accepted the linkage between the concepts.\n</p><p><i>Night of the Living Dead</i>, as well as two of Romero's later films, the 1978 <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> and the 1985 <i>The Return of the Living Dead</i>, helped to further establish the image of the zombie in popular culture, further assisted by the release of break-out franchise-starting video games <i>Resident Evil</i> and <i>The House of the Dead</i> in the mid-1990s; the \"zombie apocalypse\" concept, in which the civilized world is brought low by a global zombie infestation, has since become a staple of modern popular art, seen in such media as <i>The Walking Dead</i>. Still-later portrayals would come to humanize and even romanticize the zombie \n</p><p>The zombies of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons\" title=\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></i> are introduced in the first editions as magically animated corpses commanded by an evil spellcaster or cleric that animated them, and are typically found near graveyards, in dungeons, and in similar. Zombies obey simple commands and are slow-moving, but always deal damage when they hit and will fight until they are either destroyed or <a href=\"/wiki/Turn_undead\" title=\"Turn undead\">turned back</a> by a cleric. They are immune to magic that induces sleep, charming, holding, and cold, but are especially vulnerable to <a href=\"/wiki/Holy_water\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Holy water\">holy water</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Variants\">Variants</span></h2>\n<p>Many variants implement a form of mutual <a href=\"/wiki/Grudge\" title=\"Grudge\">grudge</a> between zombies and living monsters, as well as a form of revival similar to <a href=\"/wiki/Troll_(monster_class)\" title=\"Troll (monster class)\">trolls</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/Material_hatred\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Material hatred\">Material hatred</a> that applies to a living monster is typically not applied to their zombie forms.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"SLASH'EM\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"SLASH.27EM\">SLASH'EM</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/SLASH%27EM\" title=\"SLASH&#39;EM\">SLASH'EM</a>, zombies can be generated by using the <a href=\"/wiki/Raise_zombies\" title=\"Raise zombies\">raise zombies</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Technique\" title=\"Technique\">technique</a> near the appropriate corpses.\n</p><p>Player <a href=\"/wiki/Gnome_(starting_race)\" title=\"Gnome (starting race)\">gnomes</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Dwarf_(starting_race)\" title=\"Dwarf (starting race)\">dwarves</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Gnomish_Mines\" title=\"Gnomish Mines\">Gnomish Mines</a> will find most of the ordinarily peaceful denizens from <i>NetHack</i> replaced with zombies and other hostile monsters, ensuring that all player roles and races must contend with a dangerous descent through the branch.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The specific following substitutions generate zombies:\n</p>\n<ul><li><span class=\"nhsym clr-brown\">G</span> Gnomes become <span class=\"nhsym clr-brown\">Z</span> <a href=\"/wiki/Gnome_zombie\" title=\"Gnome zombie\">gnome zombies</a></li>\n<li><span class=\"nhsym clr-red\">h</span> <a href=\"/wiki/Dwarf_(monster)\" title=\"Dwarf (monster)\">Dwarves</a> become <span class=\"nhsym clr-red\">Z</span> <a href=\"/wiki/Dwarf_zombie\" title=\"Dwarf zombie\">dwarf zombies</a></li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"GruntHack\">GruntHack</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><div class=\"noprint relarticle mainarticle\"><i>Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Zombie_(GruntHack)\" title=\"Zombie (GruntHack)\">Zombie (GruntHack)</a></i></div></dd></dl>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/GruntHack\" title=\"GruntHack\">GruntHack</a>, zombies are <a href=\"/wiki/Racial_monster\" title=\"Racial monster\">racial monsters</a> and can be any of the following races: human, elf, kobold, gnome, dwarf, giant, ettin, orc, and ogre.\n</p><p>Zombies in GruntHack are incredibly dangerous compared to their <i>NetHack</i> counterparts: they have bites that can inflict <a href=\"/wiki/Intelligence_drain\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intelligence drain\">intelligence drain</a> similar to <a href=\"/wiki/Mind_flayer\" title=\"Mind flayer\">mind flayers</a> and/or make you <a href=\"/wiki/Terminally_ill\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Terminally ill\">terminally ill</a>, and can revive from the corpses they leave behind; these corpses also inflict terminal illness if eaten as well, in addition to the normal effects of eating that corpse. Monsters that die of terminal illness from a zombie will rise as a zombie if they have a compatible form, including the player (who will always be of a compatible form).\n</p><p>Additionally, zombies will grudge other living monsters and vice versa, making them as much of a danger to the other denizens of the dungeon as they are to you - interestingly, grudges between monsters also apply to their undead forms.

As with mind flayers, a <a href=\"/wiki/Helm\" title=\"Helm\">helm</a> can sometimes block the additional effects of a zombie's bite attack (though it does not do so as often due to a bug), and a helm that is either <a href=\"/wiki/Greased\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Greased\">greased</a> or has the <a href=\"/index.php?title=Oilskin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Oilskin (page does not exist)\">oilskin</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Object_property\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Object property\">object property</a> (limited to <a href=\"/wiki/Cloth\" title=\"Cloth\">cloth</a> helms) will block them outright.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"dNetHack\">dNetHack</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><div class=\"noprint relarticle mainarticle\"><i>Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Zombie_(dNetHack)\" title=\"Zombie (dNetHack)\">Zombie (dNetHack)</a></i></div></dd></dl>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/DNetHack\" title=\"DNetHack\">dNetHack</a>, a majority of zombies exist as a form of templated monster, making it possible for most living monsters to have zombie counterparts.

EvilHack zombies behave similarly to GruntHack, though they have their own entries in monst.c rather than racial templates, and several modifications are made to keep them distinct and less overwhelmingly difficult while still being quite challenging.\n</p><p>A zombie's claw attack is poisonous (with frequency similar to that of a <a href=\"/wiki/Rabid_rat\" title=\"Rabid rat\">rabid rat</a>), and their brain-eating bite can cause intelligence loss, but they also have a lower chance of reviving from their corpse, and they will not revive at all if cancelled or beheaded. Zombies can transfer illness the same way as in GruntHack - either via their bite or a player consuming their corpse - and monsters with zombie forms that are killed by a zombie will eventually revive as one; as in xNetHack, a player killed this way may rarely be able to continue on as a zombie with permanent unchanging.\n</p><p>The same methods for permanently disposing of zombies in GruntHack are generally applicable in EvilHack; zombie corpses will always cause terminal illness when eaten, making it possible to permanently get rid of them by eating one and then using a reliable illness cure such as a unicorn horn. <a href=\"/wiki/Lava\" title=\"Lava\">Lava</a> is slightly more common in the main dungeon, making it easier to burn up the corpses by <a href=\"/wiki/Dip\" title=\"Dip\">dipping</a>, throwing or dropping them into the lava square; dipping a zombie corpse into a <a href=\"/wiki/Forge_(dungeon_feature)\" title=\"Forge (dungeon feature)\">forge</a> will also incinerate it. <a href=\"/wiki/Sunsword\" title=\"Sunsword\">Sunsword</a> can vaporize zombies it kills permanently, including a chance of instantly destroying them similar to other <a href=\"/wiki/Bane\" title=\"Bane\">Bane</a>-style weapons in EvilHack.\n</p><p>Helms will more reliably prevent the effects of a zombie's bites compared to GruntHack, and helms that are greased or oilskin will block them outright; applying <a href=\"/wiki/Barding\" title=\"Barding\">barding</a> to a steed can protect them from zombie bites. <a href=\"/wiki/Illithid_(starting_race)\" title=\"Illithid (starting race)\">Illithids</a> and mind flayers have <a href=\"/index.php?title=Psychic_resistance&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Psychic resistance (page does not exist)\">psychic resistance</a>, giving them immunity to the brain-targeting secondary effects of a zombie bite, though they can still be poisoned and made ill. The <a href=\"/wiki/Cure_sickness\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cure sickness\">cure sickness</a> spell, which is directional in EvilHack, can damage zombies in the path of the beam.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Hack'EM\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hack.27EM\">Hack'EM</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Hack%27EM\" title=\"Hack&#39;EM\">Hack'EM</a>, zombies can be any of the monster races encountered in EvilHack, with the addition of the <a href=\"/index.php?title=Centaur_zombie&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Centaur zombie (page does not exist)\">centaur zombie</a> as well.

As the zombie monster class is the first [[quest]] monster class for [[Priest]]s, the 14% of monsters from that class that are randomly generated within the [[Priest quest]] will include the various zombie monsters.\n\nZombies are considered [[corpseless]], with a special case that generates an aged [[corpse]] of their living counterpart upon \"death\" in circumstances where a monster would ordinarily leave a corpse (e.g. a gnome zombie leaves an old [[gnome]] corpse when \"killed\" in combat).<ref name=\"undead_to_corpse\"/>{{refsrc|src/mon.c|372|nethack=3.6.7|name=\"make_corpse\"|comment=Undead corpses and their ages are handled with other \"special\" death drops}} This means that listed nutritional values for zombies are only relevant to [[pet]]s or [[polymorph]]ed player characters that [[digest]] zombies - corpses left behind by zombies use their normal nutritional values, though they are usually too old to be eaten safely without a [[tinning kit]].\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|[[Lich (monster class)|Liches]] and other zombies can now raise monsters killed by them without a weapon as zombies, unless they are [[cancelled]] - the corpse will rise 5-20 turns after death if it has a corresponding zombie type, and [[you]] can also do this if polymorphed into a zombie or lich. Zombies and liches will [[grudge]] living monsters that can be turned into zombies. Players killed by a lich will arise in bones as a zombie of the corresponding type - as of {{commit|3c421da746cdd3844c7f8d2312c7be5e5a25cfb9}}, the zombie will have the same intrinsics as the former character.\n\nThe mausoleum [[themed room]] may have a randomly generated zombie sealed and [[meditating]] within its central subroom.\n\nAs of {{commit|852f8e49961a613fea4238cf23b89449ee5120bf|commit 852f8e4}} and {{commit|98d2b0ecb3145e698ea1f6155a75f8021d13dcfb|commit 98d2b0e}}, buried zombie corpses will revive if items land, are placed or are dropped on their square, with the response dependent on the weight of the item and the type of impact.}}\n\n==History==\nThe zombie first appears in Hack 1.21, a variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]], where is uses the {{white|z}} glyph; it also appears in Hack for PDP-11, where it first uses the current glyph, {{white|Z}}. The zombie is included in the initial bestiary for [[Hack 1.0]], and appears in the game from that version to [[NetHack 2.3e]], using the same glyph throughout; in these versions, it is the equivalent of the modern [[human zombie]].\n\nIn [[NetHack 3.0.0]], most of the zombies are introduced and differentiated with the exception of the dwarf zombie, which is added in [[NetHack 3.3.0]].\n\n==Origin==\n{{wikipedia}}\nA zombie is a form of reanimated corpse raised by magical means, such as witchcraft, or science fictional methods such as fungi or pathogens. First recorded in 1819, the word originates from the Hatian French ''zombi'' among other similar roots, and appears in various forms in cultural folklore as well as fantasy and horror media. One of the first books to expose Western culture to the concept of the voodoo zombie was W. B. Seabrook's 1929 novel ''[[wikipedia:The Magic Island|The Magic Island]]'', presented as the account of a narrator who encounters voodoo cults in Haiti and their resurrected thralls.\n\nThe modern zombie may have been codified by the [[wikipedia:George A. Romero|George A. Romero]] film ''[[wikipedia:Night of the Living Dead|Night of the Living Dead]]'', where the titular undead flesh-eaters were referred to as \"zombies\" by many film critics, though they were much closer to ghouls in mannerisms and are referred to as such in Romero's original scripts and the film itself. The film and its monsters are also partly inspired by 1954 [[wikipedia:Richard Matheson|Richard Matheson]] novel ''[[wikipedia:I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'' - despite considering them distinct from zombies (e.g. as seen in ''White Zombie'' starring Bela Lugosi), Romero came to use the term similarly in later interviews and eventually accepted the linkage between the concepts.\n\n''Night of the Living Dead'', as well as two of Romero's later films, the 1978 ''Dawn of the Dead'' and the 1985 ''The Return of the Living Dead'', helped to further establish the image of the zombie in popular culture, further assisted by the release of break-out franchise-starting video games ''Resident Evil'' and ''The House of the Dead'' in the mid-1990s; the \"zombie apocalypse\" concept, in which the civilized world is brought low by a global zombie infestation, has since become a staple of modern popular art, seen in such media as ''The Walking Dead''. Still-later portrayals would come to humanize and even romanticize the zombie \n\nThe zombies of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' are introduced in the first editions as magically animated corpses commanded by an evil spellcaster or cleric that animated them, and are typically found near graveyards, in dungeons, and in similar. Zombies obey simple commands and are slow-moving, but always deal damage when they hit and will fight until they are either destroyed or [[Turn undead|turned back]] by a cleric. They are immune to magic that induces sleep, charming, holding, and cold, but are especially vulnerable to [[holy water]].\n\n==Variants==\nMany variants implement a form of mutual [[grudge]] between zombies and living monsters, as well as a form of revival similar to [[Troll (monster class)|trolls]]. [[Material hatred]] that applies to a living monster is typically not applied to their zombie forms.\n\n===SLASH'EM===\nIn [[SLASH'EM]], zombies can be generated by using the [[raise zombies]] [[technique]] near the appropriate corpses.\n\nPlayer [[Gnome (starting race)|gnomes]] and [[Dwarf (starting race)|dwarves]] in the [[Gnomish Mines]] will find most of the ordinarily peaceful denizens from ''NetHack'' replaced with zombies and other hostile monsters, ensuring that all player roles and races must contend with a dangerous descent through the branch.{{refsrc|sp_lev.c|854|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2|comment=Only explicitly specified monsters are replaced, while random {{white|G}} and {{white|h}} are not.}} The specific following substitutions generate zombies:\n\n* {{monsym|Gnome}} Gnomes become {{monsym|Gnome zombie}} [[gnome zombie]]s\n* {{monsym|Dwarf}} [[Dwarf (monster)|Dwarves]] become {{monsym|dwarf zombie}} [[dwarf zombie]]s\n\n===GruntHack===\n{{main|Zombie (GruntHack)}}\nIn [[GruntHack]], zombies are [[racial monster]]s and can be any of the following races: human, elf, kobold, gnome, dwarf, giant, ettin, orc, and ogre.\n\nZombies in GruntHack are incredibly dangerous compared to their ''NetHack'' counterparts: they have bites that can inflict [[intelligence drain]] similar to [[mind flayer]]s and/or make you [[terminally ill]], and can revive from the corpses they leave behind; these corpses also inflict terminal illness if eaten as well, in addition to the normal effects of eating that corpse. Monsters that die of terminal illness from a zombie will rise as a zombie if they have a compatible form, including the player (who will always be of a compatible form).\n\nAdditionally, zombies will grudge other living monsters and vice versa, making them as much of a danger to the other denizens of the dungeon as they are to you - interestingly, grudges between monsters also apply to their undead forms. A means of curing sickness should be a priority for any GruntHack character, along with a means to permanently dispose of them (e.g., via locked [[container]] or [[tinning kit]]). As with mind flayers, a [[helm]] can sometimes block the additional effects of a zombie's bite attack (though it does not do so as often due to a bug), and a helm that is either [[greased]] or has the [[oilskin]] [[object property]] (limited to [[cloth]] helms) will block them outright.<!--Double check ASAP-->\n\n===dNetHack===\n{{main|Zombie (dNetHack)}}\nIn [[dNetHack]], a majority of zombies exist as a form of templated monster, making it possible for most living monsters to have zombie counterparts. There are also new and returning monsters in the zombie monster class.\n\nMonsters that are attacked in melee by zombies are infected, and {{frac|20}} of melee attacks from [[Skeleton (dNetHack)|skeleton monsters]] will also infect a target monster; once killed, the infected monster will rise from their corpse as a zombie. A player of a living race that is killed by any zombie monster will arise as a zombie of that races if a [[bones]] file is left. The presence of a [[dread seraph]] on a level will cause corpses dropped on that level to potentially revive as zombies, regardless of whether that seraph is awake, sepulchered or otherwise; leaving normal bones (i.e. corpse and a player ghost) on a level with a dread seraph will result in the corpse animating as a zombie as normal.\n\nZombies themselves can reanimate from their corpses with nearly the same the same rules as trolls, e.g. they cannot revive if they are [[cancelled]] or locked into a container. Since zombies are unbreathing, they can also revive while in water.\n\n===xNetHack===\nIn [[xNetHack]], the list of zombie monsters matches that of ''NetHack'', but they are given many new characteristics, including those drawn from upcoming versions of ''NetHack'': Zombies will occasionally revive from their own corpses similar to trolls, but they have a lower overall chance, and will not revive at all if cancelled or [[behead]]ed; they can also revive when buried. Zombies will also grudge monsters that they can zombify, and vice-versa. \n\nMonsters with zombie forms that are killed in melee by zombies and [[Lich (monster class)|liches]] will immediately rise as zombies, and zombies created by a tame zombie or lich will also be tame. Players that die at the hands of a zombie or lich will rise as a zombie in [[bones]], and have a {{frac|4}} chance of immediately resurrecting as a zombie with permanent intrinsic [[unchanging]].\n\n===EvilHack===\n{{main|Zombie (EvilHack)}}\nIn [[EvilHack]], zombies can be any of the variations encountered in ''NetHack'', with the addition of the [[hobbit zombie]], [[gnoll witherling]] and [[drow zombie]] as well. EvilHack zombies behave similarly to GruntHack, though they have their own entries in monst.c rather than racial templates, and several modifications are made to keep them distinct and less overwhelmingly difficult while still being quite challenging.\n\nA zombie's claw attack is poisonous (with frequency similar to that of a [[rabid rat]]), and their brain-eating bite can cause intelligence loss, but they also have a lower chance of reviving from their corpse, and they will not revive at all if cancelled or beheaded. Zombies can transfer illness the same way as in GruntHack - either via their bite or a player consuming their corpse - and monsters with zombie forms that are killed by a zombie will eventually revive as one; as in xNetHack, a player killed this way may rarely be able to continue on as a zombie with permanent unchanging.\n\nThe same methods for permanently disposing of zombies in GruntHack are generally applicable in EvilHack; zombie corpses will always cause terminal illness when eaten, making it possible to permanently get rid of them by eating one and then using a reliable illness cure such as a unicorn horn. [[Lava]] is slightly more common in the main dungeon, making it easier to burn up the corpses by [[dip]]ping, throwing or dropping them into the lava square; dipping a zombie corpse into a [[Forge (dungeon feature)|forge]] will also incinerate it. [[Sunsword]] can vaporize zombies it kills permanently, including a chance of instantly destroying them similar to other [[Bane]]-style weapons in EvilHack.\n\nHelms will more reliably prevent the effects of a zombie's bites compared to GruntHack, and helms that are greased or oilskin will block them outright; applying [[barding]] to a steed can protect them from zombie bites. [[Illithid (starting race)|Illithids]] and mind flayers have [[psychic resistance]], giving them immunity to the brain-targeting secondary effects of a zombie bite, though they can still be poisoned and made ill. The [[cure sickness]] spell, which is directional in EvilHack, can damage zombies in the path of the beam.\n\n===Hack'EM===\nIn [[Hack'EM]], zombies can be any of the monster races encountered in EvilHack, with the addition of the [[centaur zombie]] as well. Hack'EM zombies behave primarily the same as they do in EvilHack, and are additionally damaged by wands of {{wand of|healing|and=1|extra healing}}.\n\nThe [[artifact weapon]] [[Mortality Dial]] prevents zombies and other monsters from automatically reviving.\n\n==Encyclopedia entry==\n{{encyclopedia|The zombi ... is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but taken from the grave and endowed by sorcery with a mechanical semblance of life, -- it is a dead body which is made to walk and act and move as if it were alive.\n|[ W.

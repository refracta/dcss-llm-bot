All liches are [breathless](/wiki/Breathless \"Breathless\"), [inediate](/wiki/Inediate \"Inediate\"), [poisonous](/wiki/Poisonous \"Poisonous\") to [digest](/wiki/Digest \"Digest\"), and have enhanced [regeneration](/wiki/Regeneration \"Regeneration\") and [infravision](/wiki/Infravision \"Infravision\"); the stronger liches (informally called \"purple Ls\") are also [covetous](/wiki/Covetous \"Covetous\"). All liches possess a [cold](/wiki/Cold \"Cold\") touch attack and the ability to cast mage [monster spells](/wiki/Monster_spell \"Monster spell\") once per round. Liches are [slow](/wiki/Slow \"Slow\")-moving, and have resistance to [cold](/wiki/Cold_resistance \"Cold resistance\"), [sleep](/wiki/Sleep_resistance \"Sleep resistance\") and [poison](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\") like most undead monsters; they also convey cold resistance when eaten, but lich corpses and tins do not exist.\n\nIf [chatted](/wiki/Chat \"Chat\") to, a lich will \"mumble incomprehensibly\".\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nLiches that are not [cancelled](/wiki/Cancelled \"Cancelled\") can now raise monsters killed by them as [zombies](/wiki/Zombie \"Zombie\") of the corresponding type; if they have one, they will be raised 5-20 turns after they are initially killed. This also applies to [you](/wiki/You \"You\") if you are polymorphed into a lich. Liches will also [grudge](/wiki/Grudge \"Grudge\") living monsters that can be turned into zombies. Players killed by a lich will arise in bones as a zombie of the corresponding type - as of [commit 3c421da7](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/3c421da746cdd3844c7f8d2312c7be5e5a25cfb9), the zombie will have the same intrinsics as the former character.\n\nMonsters with [digestion](/wiki/Digestion \"Digestion\") attacks can gain [intrinsics](/wiki/Intrinsic \"Intrinsic\") from swallowing monsters whole, making it possible for them to gain cold resistance from a lich that is digested.}}\n\n### Generation\n\nRandomly-generated liches are always hostile, and [never leave a corpse](/wiki/Corpseless \"Corpseless\") when killed - if killed by any method that ordinarily leaves a corpse, a message is printed about their body crumbling to dust.[\\[3\\]](#cite_note-dusted-3) The master lich and arch-lich are only randomly generated in Gehennom.\n\nRandom liches appear among the [throne room](/wiki/Throne_room \"Throne room\") monsters placed in the center of the [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\") on level creation - the class-specific monster generation used here makes it possible for master liches and arch-liches to generate outside of Gehennom. A random lich is generated within the [Valley of the Dead](/wiki/Valley_of_the_Dead \"Valley of the Dead\") at level creation outside of [bones](/wiki/Bones \"Bones\"), while another random lich is placed somewhere within the left side of the inner rooms of [Asmodeus' Lair](/wiki/Asmodeus%27_Lair \"Asmodeus' Lair\") at level creation outside of bones.\n\nEach of the [Fake Wizard's Towers](/wiki/Fake_Wizard%27s_Tower \"Fake Wizard's Tower\") has a random lich dwelling inside, while two random liches inhabit the first floor of the real [Wizard's Tower](/wiki/Wizard%27s_Tower \"Wizard's Tower\"), including one in the tower-like structure that houses the up [ladder](/wiki/Ladder \"Ladder\"). Two random liches are generated within [Moloch's Sanctum](/wiki/Moloch%27s_Sanctum \"Moloch's Sanctum\") at level creation, and three random liches are placed around the [Astral Plane](/wiki/Astral_Plane \"Astral Plane\") at level creation.\n\n## Strategy\n\nLiches are generally annoying at best and incredibly lethal at worst: Many of them will frequently cast [monster spells](/wiki/Monster_spell \"Monster spell\") such as [curse items](/wiki/Curse_items \"Curse items\"), use [aggravate](/wiki/Aggravate \"Aggravate\") to awaken other hostiles, and severely weaken your defenses with [destroy armor](/wiki/Destroy_armor_\\(monster_spell\\) \"Destroy armor (monster spell)\") - the stronger covetous ones can freely warp towards you (including on [no-teleport](/wiki/No-teleport \"No-teleport\") levels) and even use the [touch of death](/wiki/Touch_of_death \"Touch of death\") on you. Liches are often the target of [genocide](/wiki/Genocide \"Genocide\") by many players that are not observing [genocideless](/wiki/Genocideless \"Genocideless\") [conduct](/wiki/Conduct \"Conduct\"), and it is often considered worth a blessed [scroll of genocide](/wiki/Scroll_of_genocide \"Scroll of genocide\") to remove them all from the game.\n\nOne of the best ways to deal with a lich in combat is to have a source of [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\"), which dampens the effects of its spells and prevents the higher-level ones from [instantly ending your game](/wiki/Instadeath \"Instadeath\"): [Magicbane](/wiki/Magicbane \"Magicbane\") in particular will absorb a mass majority of curses from the curse items monster spell. Even covetous liches will respect [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") and the scroll of [scare monster](/wiki/Scare_monster \"Scare monster\"), though the former does not allow you to fight while standing on it and will not work in [Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\") - additionally, neither method prevents liches from casting certain ranged spells at you, and one particular spell, [summon nasties](/wiki/Summon_nasties \"Summon nasties\"), may generate monsters that do not respect Elbereth or the scroll, such as [captains](/wiki/Captain \"Captain\"), [minotaurs](/wiki/Minotaur \"Minotaur\") and [Elvenkings](/wiki/Elvenking \"Elvenking\").\n\nAll liches minus the arch-lich do not have [shock resistance](/wiki/Shock_resistance \"Shock resistance\"), making [Mjollnir](/wiki/Mjollnir \"Mjollnir\") an excellent option to deal with most of them; similarly, strong non-elemental [artifact weapons](/wiki/Artifact_weapon \"Artifact weapon\") like [Excalibur](/wiki/Excalibur \"Excalibur\") and [Sunsword](/wiki/Sunsword \"Sunsword\") (which deals double damage against liches and other undead) also work quite well. Liches are especially vulnerable to [stoning](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\"), [disintegration](/wiki/Disintegration \"Disintegration\") and [digestion](/wiki/Digestion \"Digestion\") attacks, all of which can reliably instakill them - their summon nasties spell can generate monsters with such attacks, which can be turned against them using [conflict](/wiki/Conflict \"Conflict\").\n\nAll types of lich can be pacified by reading the blessed [Book of the Dead](/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead \"Book of the Dead\"), and it is additionally possible to tame liches and demiliches this way if done as a chaotic character.\n\n### As pets\n\nLiches are generally strong pets with some trade-offs that are quite inconvenient. Their solid [AC](/wiki/AC \"AC\") and increasingly powerful [MR score](/wiki/Magic_resistance_\\(monster\\) \"Magic resistance (monster)\") make them difficult for most other monsters to kill and can prevent polymorphing, but said MR score also makes them difficult to tame. Covetous liches in particular cannot be tamed magically, though a tame lich can [grow up](/wiki/Grow_up \"Grow up\") into a covetous one as normal, and an existing pet can also be polymorphed into a tame covetous lich. Liches are also quite slow, with demiliches and stronger forms reaching a peak speed of 12 after casting [haste self](/wiki/Haste_self_\\(monster_spell\\) \"Haste self (monster spell)\").\n\nLiches cannot cast spells against other monsters, forcing them to rely on their cold touch to deal damage. They cannot wield weapons to counteract this due to lacking a weapon attack, and their cold touch may destroy [potions](/wiki/Potion \"Potion\") in the target's inventory and renders them completely unable to kill any cold-resistant monsters, such as [winter wolves](/wiki/Winter_wolves \"Winter wolves\") or [zombies](/wiki/Zombie_\\(monster_class\\) \"Zombie (monster class)\") - this is applicable even to their stronger forms, and requires you to kill such monsters yourself. Fortunately, their AC, MR score, and resistances combined with their regeneration and ability to [cure self](/wiki/Cure_self \"Cure self\") makes them difficult for monsters to kill, and liches gain more of each as they grow up.\n\nMaster liches and arch-liches in particular will constantly warp towards your position, making them easier to keep nearby without a [magic whistle](/wiki/Magic_whistle \"Magic whistle\") and lowering the risk of abandoning one - unfortunately, this also makes it incredibly dangerous for them to be [confused](/wiki/Confused \"Confused\"), so be sure to give any tame lich you have a [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\") as soon as possible. The warping will also make it perilous to navigate while wielding [Stormbringer](/wiki/Stormbringer \"Stormbringer\"): although liches will not take as much damage from the [bloodthirsty](/wiki/Bloodthirsty \"Bloodthirsty\") [artifact](/wiki/Artifact \"Artifact\"), carelessly untaming your pet arch-lich is asking for trouble. It is also nearly impossible to keep covetous liches away from [aligned priests](/wiki/Aligned_priest \"Aligned priest\") and [shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeepers \"Shopkeepers\"), and makes navigating around traps such as [level teleporters](/wiki/Level_teleporter \"Level teleporter\") difficult. Furthermore, a covetous lich will often warp away to the up stair at the slightest sign of damage, which can be annoying; they are also inediate, making it near-impossible to raise tameness. Most annoying of all is the fact that even the strongest liches are still vulnerable to various instadeaths and similar attacks: stoning, disintegration, digestion and [sliming](/wiki/Sliming \"Sliming\") will all make short work of a pet lich.\n\n[Reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\") is not as vital for a higher-level lich due to the amount of resistances they can gain, but it is still useful to protect against the [disintegration](/wiki/Disintegration \"Disintegration\") [breath](/wiki/Breath \"Breath\") attacks of [black dragons](/wiki/Black_dragon \"Black dragon\") in particular - this is the best use for their amulet slot, since they cannot use the [amulet of life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\"). Similarly, while a lich has nothing to fear from death magic, a source of magic resistance can still protect them against stronger magical attacks such as an [Angel](/wiki/Angel \"Angel\")'s magic missile.\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([3.7.0](/wiki/3.7.0 \"3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nPer [commit 8d2407f8](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/8d2407f), monsters can gain intrinsics from eating corpses, making the inediate liches slightly weaker pets, though a lich can still gain useful resistances from becoming an arch-lich; pets that are polymorphed retain any intrinsics they gained previously.\n\n### As a polyform\n\nLich polyforms can wear all armor, and have similar strengths and weaknesses to pet liches: you have at least a few useful intrinsics and your base AC improves with the stronger polyforms chosen, but your base speed is lower, you cannot use your wielded weapon, and your only attack is a cold touch that does nothing against resistant monsters. Fortunately, you have access to spellcasting and several other forms of offense that can compensate, and your defensive qualities (including [a resistance to death magic](/wiki/Death_resistance \"Death resistance\")) are more than enough to ensure survival against all but the most powerful or nasty monsters.\n\n## History\n\nThe base lich, demilich and master lich first appear in [NetHack 3.0.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.0.0 \"NetHack 3.0.0\"), and the arch-lich is added in [NetHack 3.3.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.3.0 \"NetHack 3.3.0\").\n\n## Origin\n\n[![Wikipedia](/images/thumb/f/f8/Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png/50px-Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png)](/wiki/File:Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png \"Wikipedia\")\n\n[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page \"wikipedia:Main Page\") has an article about:\n\n***[Lich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lich \"wikipedia:Lich\")***\n\nIn fantasy works and media, a lich (which comes from the Old English *līċ*, meaning \"corpse\" or \"body\") is a type of undead creature. Previously used as recently as early 20th-century fantasy fiction to refer to any corpse (animate or otherwise), media such as *[Dungeons & Dragons](/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons \"Dungeons & Dragons\")* has spurred the portrayal of liches as powerful undead spellcasters that are proficient in necromancy, and typically undergo the transformation in order to defy death, allowing them to retain their intelligence and magical abilities and command lesser undead. *Dungeons & Dragons* in particular also takes inspiration from sources such as [H.P. Lovecraft](/wiki/H.P._Lovecraft \"H.P. Lovecraft\") story \"The Thing on the Doorstep\" and Gardner Fox's titular mage of \"The Sword of the Sorcerer\".\n\nA lich is generally depicted as a revenant with an undecaying body that is cadaverous, desiccated or completely skeletal, and has glowing lights in place of their eyes. Liches are often capable of sustaining tremendous physical damage, and are immune to disease, poison, fatigue and other effects that affect only the living; they were also quite resistant to various forms of magic, and the mere sight of them often compelled the weak-willed to flee. The lich's most dangerous asset, beyond even its undead gifts, is their vast intellect, mastery of sorcery and limitless time to research, plot and scheme. *Dungeons & Dragons* introduces the lich in 1975 as part of its first supplement, *Greyhawk*.\n\nIn *Dungeons & Dragons* settings, a mage that becomes a lich usually gives up some portion or the entirety of their soul to form \"soul-artifacts\" (also referred to as \"soul gems\" or \"phylacteries\") that are the source of their magic and immortality. Many liches take precautions to hide and/or safeguard them, as they anchor a part of a lich's soul to the material world: if their corporeal body is killed, those portions of the lich's soul within it will continue to exist in a non-corporeal form capable of being resurrected from that \"soul-artifact\" in the near future. However, if all of the lich's soul-artifacts are destroyed, then destroying the lich's body will kill it permanently. Most forays into lichdom often require the creation and consumption of a deadly potion on a full moon; the exact details vary, but almost universally involves acts of utter evil and vile components. Despite this process and their commonplace detachment from mortal morality, it is possible for liches to ascribe to any alignment - in very rare instances truly good liches can arise, either from possessing a more noble purpose for seeking lichdom or from having lichdom forced upon them; these were known as \"archliches\", not to be confused with the arch-liches of *NetHack*.\n\nThere are various other types of liches as well: demiliches, advanced liches who took to astral projection to traval other planes for knowledge and no longer had need for a body, concentrating their power into a single body part and leaving the rest to crumble away; elven archliches, or [baelnorns](/wiki/Baelnorn \"Baelnorn\"), whose undeath is gifted to them by the Seldarine in order to act as sources of magic, wise council, and guardianship; [alhoons](/wiki/Alhoon \"Alhoon\"), illithids who have achieved a limited form of lichdom and are considered deviant among their kind; and even dracoliches, dragons that tied their soul to a phylactery and can use their spirit to inhabit the body of any reptilian corpse upon death, though they are at their most powerful inhabiting the corpse of a dragon.\n\n## Messages\n\n- \\<The lich> mumbles incomprehensibly.\n\n  You chatted to a lich.\n\n- \\<The lich>'s body crumbles into dust.\n\n  A lich was killed in a way that would normally leave a corpse.[\\[3\\]](#cite_note-dusted-3)\n\n## Variants\n\n### SLASH'EM\n\n[SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\") adds one new monster to the monster class:\n\n- L [Vecna](/wiki/Vecna \"Vecna\")\n\nVecna and seventeen other random liches are generated across the [Chaotic Quest](/wiki/Chaotic_Quest \"Chaotic Quest\") at level creation.\n\n### UnNetHack\n\nIn [UnNetHack](/wiki/UnNetHack \"UnNetHack\"), a random lich is generated among the many monsters inhabiting the middle level of [Sheol](/wiki/Sheol \"Sheol\") at level creation.\n\n### dNetHack\n\n[dNetHack](/wiki/DNetHack \"DNetHack\") adds several new monsters to the monster class:\n\n- L lich:\n\n  - L [baelnorn](/wiki/Baelnorn \"Baelnorn\")\n  - L [death knight](/wiki/Death_knight \"Death knight\")\n  - L [dokkalfar eternal matriarch](/wiki/Dokkalfar_eternal_matriarch \"Dokkalfar eternal matriarch\")\n  - L [Acererak](/wiki/Acererak \"Acererak\")\n  - L [Lich, the Fiend of Earth](/wiki/Lich,_the_Fiend_of_Earth \"Lich, the Fiend of Earth\")\n  - Deferred monsters\n    - L [Vecna](/wiki/Vecna \"Vecna\")\n\nOf the undead that make up 1⁄7 of the randomly generated monsters on the [Anachrononaut quest](/wiki/Anachrononaut_quest \"Anachrononaut quest\"), approximately \\~4.69% of them will be liches. The [Binder quest](/wiki/Binder_quest \"Binder quest\") generates a random lich tending to the unaligned altar that is unlocked once you have converted all three temples.\n\n### SpliceHack\n\n[SpliceHack](/wiki/SpliceHack \"SpliceHack\") adds two new monsters to the monster class:\n\n- L [worm that walks](/wiki/Worm_that_walks \"Worm that walks\")\n- L [eye of fear and flame](/index.php?title=Eye_of_fear_and_flame\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Eye of fear and flame (page does not exist)\")\n\n### EvilHack\n\n[EvilHack](/wiki/EvilHack \"EvilHack\") adds one new monster to the monster class:\n\n- L [Vecna](/wiki/Vecna \"Vecna\")\n\nPlayers killed by any type of lich will arise as a [revenant](/wiki/Revenant \"Revenant\") instead of a [ghost](/wiki/Ghost \"Ghost\") in [bones](/wiki/Bones \"Bones\") files.\n\nVarious liches are generated across the floors of [Vecna's Domain](/wiki/Vecna%27s_Domain \"Vecna's Domain\"), a three-level [branch](/wiki/Branch \"Branch\") where Vecna resides. Vecna's presence prevents the genocide of liches, as well as [alhoons](/wiki/Alhoon \"Alhoon\") - once he is destroyed, they can be subjected to genocide as normal.\n\nLiches are much more dangerous compared to vanilla *[NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\")*, since they have access to several new monster spells, including [cancellation](/wiki/Cancellation_\\(monster_spell\\) \"Cancellation (monster spell)\"), [reflection](/wiki/Reflection_\\(monster_spell\\) \"Reflection (monster spell)\") and [stone to flesh](/wiki/Stone_to_flesh_\\(monster_spell\\) \"Stone to flesh (monster spell)\"). This also makes them much better pets and polyforms, with full access to their repertoire of monster spells when fighting other monsters.\n\nSunsword now has a chance of instakilling any liches it hits. [The Sword of Kas](/wiki/The_Sword_of_Kas \"The Sword of Kas\") is an [artifact](/wiki/Artifact \"Artifact\") [gemstone](/wiki/Gemstone \"Gemstone\") [two-handed](/wiki/Two-handed \"Two-handed\") sword that deals double damage versus liches *except* for Vecna: the sword instead deals three times the damage when used specifically against him.\n\n### SlashTHEM\n\n[SlashTHEM](/wiki/SlashTHEM \"SlashTHEM\") adds one new monster to the monster class:\n\n- L [baby lich](/index.php?title=Baby_lich\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Baby lich (page does not exist)\")\n\n### Hack'EM\n\n[Hack'EM](/wiki/Hack%27EM \"Hack'EM\") adds a few monsters to the monster class from other variants:\n\n- L [worm that walks](/wiki/Worm_that_walks \"Worm that walks\")\n- L [eye of fear and flame](/index.php?title=Eye_of_fear_and_flame\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Eye of fear and flame (page does not exist)\")\n- L [Vecna](/wiki/Vecna \"Vecna\")\n\nAs in EvilHack, players killed by any type of lich will arise as a revenant instead of a ghost in bones files.\n\n## Encyclopedia entry\n\nBut on its heels ere the sunset faded, there came a second apparition, striding with incredible strides and halting when it loomed almost upon me in the red twilight-the monstrous mummy of some ancient king still crowned with untarnished gold but turning to my gaze a visage that more than time or the worm had wasted. Broken swathings flapped about the skeleton legs, and above the crown that was set with sapphires and orange rubies, a black something swayed and nodded horribly; but, for an instant, I did not dream what it was. Then, in its middle, two oblique and scarlet eyes opened and glowed like hellish coals, and two ophidian fangs glittered in an ape-like mouth. A squat, furless, shapeless head on a neck of disproportionate extent leaned unspeakably down and whispered in the mummy's ear. Then, with one stride, the titanic lich took half the distance between us, and from out the folds of the tattered sere-cloth a gaunt arm arose, and fleshless, taloned fingers laden with glowering gems, reached out and fumbled for my throat . . .\n\n\\[ The Abominations of Yondo, Clark Ashton Smith, 1926 ]\n\n## References\n\n1.

Liches are often the target of <a href=\"/wiki/Genocide\" title=\"Genocide\">genocide</a> by many players that are not observing <a href=\"/wiki/Genocideless\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Genocideless\">genocideless</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Conduct\" title=\"Conduct\">conduct</a>, and it is often considered worth a blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_genocide\" title=\"Scroll of genocide\">scroll of genocide</a> to remove them all from the game.\n</p><p>One of the best ways to deal with a lich in combat is to have a source of <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a>, which dampens the effects of its spells and prevents the higher-level ones from <a href=\"/wiki/Instadeath\" title=\"Instadeath\">instantly ending your game</a>: <a href=\"/wiki/Magicbane\" title=\"Magicbane\">Magicbane</a> in particular will absorb a mass majority of curses from the curse items monster spell. Even covetous liches will respect <a href=\"/wiki/Elbereth\" title=\"Elbereth\">Elbereth</a> and the scroll of <a href=\"/wiki/Scare_monster\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scare monster\">scare monster</a>, though the former does not allow you to fight while standing on it and will not work in <a href=\"/wiki/Gehennom\" title=\"Gehennom\">Gehennom</a> - additionally, neither method prevents liches from casting certain ranged spells at you, and one particular spell, <a href=\"/wiki/Summon_nasties\" title=\"Summon nasties\">summon nasties</a>, may generate monsters that do not respect Elbereth or the scroll, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Captain\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Captain\">captains</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Minotaur\" title=\"Minotaur\">minotaurs</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Elvenking\" title=\"Elvenking\">Elvenkings</a>.\n</p><p>All liches minus the arch-lich do not have <a href=\"/wiki/Shock_resistance\" title=\"Shock resistance\">shock resistance</a>, making <a href=\"/wiki/Mjollnir\" title=\"Mjollnir\">Mjollnir</a> an excellent option to deal with most of them; similarly, strong non-elemental <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact_weapon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Artifact weapon\">artifact weapons</a> like <a href=\"/wiki/Excalibur\" title=\"Excalibur\">Excalibur</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Sunsword\" title=\"Sunsword\">Sunsword</a> (which deals double damage against liches and other undead) also work quite well. Liches are especially vulnerable to <a href=\"/wiki/Stoning\" title=\"Stoning\">stoning</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Disintegration\" title=\"Disintegration\">disintegration</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Digestion\" title=\"Digestion\">digestion</a> attacks, all of which can reliably instakill them - their summon nasties spell can generate monsters with such attacks, which can be turned against them using <a href=\"/wiki/Conflict\" title=\"Conflict\">conflict</a>.\n</p><p>All types of lich can be pacified by reading the blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead\" title=\"Book of the Dead\">Book of the Dead</a>, and it is additionally possible to tame liches and demiliches this way if done as a chaotic character.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"As_pets\">As pets</span></h3>\n<p>Liches are generally strong pets with some trade-offs that are quite inconvenient. Their solid <a href=\"/wiki/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a> and increasingly powerful <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance_(monster)\" title=\"Magic resistance (monster)\">MR score</a> make them difficult for most other monsters to kill and can prevent polymorphing, but said MR score also makes them difficult to tame. Covetous liches in particular cannot be tamed magically, though a tame lich can <a href=\"/wiki/Grow_up\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Grow up\">grow up</a> into a covetous one as normal, and an existing pet can also be polymorphed into a tame covetous lich. Liches are also quite slow, with demiliches and stronger forms reaching a peak speed of 12 after casting <a href=\"/wiki/Haste_self_(monster_spell)\" title=\"Haste self (monster spell)\">haste self</a>.\n</p><p>Liches cannot cast spells against other monsters, forcing them to rely on their cold touch to deal damage. They cannot wield weapons to counteract this due to lacking a weapon attack, and their cold touch may destroy <a href=\"/wiki/Potion\" title=\"Potion\">potions</a> in the target's inventory and renders them completely unable to kill any cold-resistant monsters, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Winter_wolves\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Winter wolves\">winter wolves</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Zombie_(monster_class)\" title=\"Zombie (monster class)\">zombies</a> - this is applicable even to their stronger forms, and requires you to kill such monsters yourself. Fortunately, their AC, MR score, and resistances combined with their regeneration and ability to <a href=\"/wiki/Cure_self\" title=\"Cure self\">cure self</a> makes them difficult for monsters to kill, and liches gain more of each as they grow up.\n</p><p>Master liches and arch-liches in particular will constantly warp towards your position, making them easier to keep nearby without a <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_whistle\" title=\"Magic whistle\">magic whistle</a> and lowering the risk of abandoning one - unfortunately, this also makes it incredibly dangerous for them to be <a href=\"/wiki/Confused\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Confused\">confused</a>, so be sure to give any tame lich you have a <a href=\"/wiki/Unicorn_horn\" title=\"Unicorn horn\">unicorn horn</a> as soon as possible. The warping will also make it perilous to navigate while wielding <a href=\"/wiki/Stormbringer\" title=\"Stormbringer\">Stormbringer</a>: although liches will not take as much damage from the <a href=\"/wiki/Bloodthirsty\" title=\"Bloodthirsty\">bloodthirsty</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact\" title=\"Artifact\">artifact</a>, carelessly untaming your pet arch-lich is asking for trouble. It is also nearly impossible to keep covetous liches away from <a href=\"/wiki/Aligned_priest\" title=\"Aligned priest\">aligned priests</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Shopkeepers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shopkeepers\">shopkeepers</a>, and makes navigating around traps such as <a href=\"/wiki/Level_teleporter\" title=\"Level teleporter\">level teleporters</a> difficult. Furthermore, a covetous lich will often warp away to the up stair at the slightest sign of damage, which can be annoying; they are also inediate, making it near-impossible to raise tameness. Most annoying of all is the fact that even the strongest liches are still vulnerable to various instadeaths and similar attacks: stoning, disintegration, digestion and <a href=\"/wiki/Sliming\" title=\"Sliming\">sliming</a> will all make short work of a pet lich.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Reflection\" title=\"Reflection\">Reflection</a> is not as vital for a higher-level lich due to the amount of resistances they can gain, but it is still useful to protect against the <a href=\"/wiki/Disintegration\" title=\"Disintegration\">disintegration</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Breath\" title=\"Breath\">breath</a> attacks of <a href=\"/wiki/Black_dragon\" title=\"Black dragon\">black dragons</a> in particular - this is the best use for their amulet slot, since they cannot use the <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving\" title=\"Amulet of life saving\">amulet of life saving</a>.

Previously used as recently as early 20th-century fantasy fiction to refer to any corpse (animate or otherwise), media such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons\" title=\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></i> has spurred the portrayal of liches as powerful undead spellcasters that are proficient in necromancy, and typically undergo the transformation in order to defy death, allowing them to retain their intelligence and magical abilities and command lesser undead. <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> in particular also takes inspiration from sources such as <a href=\"/wiki/H.P._Lovecraft\" title=\"H.P. Lovecraft\">H.P. Lovecraft</a> story \"The Thing on the Doorstep\" and Gardner Fox's titular mage of \"The Sword of the Sorcerer\".\n</p><p>A lich is generally depicted as a revenant with an undecaying body that is cadaverous, desiccated or completely skeletal, and has glowing lights in place of their eyes. Liches are often capable of sustaining tremendous physical damage, and are immune to disease, poison, fatigue and other effects that affect only the living; they were also quite resistant to various forms of magic, and the mere sight of them often compelled the weak-willed to flee. The lich's most dangerous asset, beyond even its undead gifts, is their vast intellect, mastery of sorcery and limitless time to research, plot and scheme. <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> introduces the lich in 1975 as part of its first supplement, <i>Greyhawk</i>.\n</p><p>In <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> settings, a mage that becomes a lich usually gives up some portion or the entirety of their soul to form \"soul-artifacts\" (also referred to as \"soul gems\" or \"phylacteries\") that are the source of their magic and immortality. Many liches take precautions to hide and/or safeguard them, as they anchor a part of a lich's soul to the material world: if their corporeal body is killed, those portions of the lich's soul within it will continue to exist in a non-corporeal form capable of being resurrected from that \"soul-artifact\" in the near future. However, if all of the lich's soul-artifacts are destroyed, then destroying the lich's body will kill it permanently. Most forays into lichdom often require the creation and consumption of a deadly potion on a full moon; the exact details vary, but almost universally involves acts of utter evil and vile components. Despite this process and their commonplace detachment from mortal morality, it is possible for liches to ascribe to any alignment - in very rare instances truly good liches can arise, either from possessing a more noble purpose for seeking lichdom or from having lichdom forced upon them; these were known as \"archliches\", not to be confused with the arch-liches of <i>NetHack</i>.\n</p><p>There are various other types of liches as well: demiliches, advanced liches who took to astral projection to traval other planes for knowledge and no longer had need for a body, concentrating their power into a single body part and leaving the rest to crumble away; elven archliches, or <a href=\"/wiki/Baelnorn\" title=\"Baelnorn\">baelnorns</a>, whose undeath is gifted to them by the Seldarine in order to act as sources of magic, wise council, and guardianship; <a href=\"/wiki/Alhoon\" title=\"Alhoon\">alhoons</a>, illithids who have achieved a limited form of lichdom and are considered deviant among their kind; and even dracoliches, dragons that tied their soul to a phylactery and can use their spirit to inhabit the body of any reptilian corpse upon death, though they are at their most powerful inhabiting the corpse of a dragon.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Messages\">Messages</span></h2>\n<dl><dt><span id=\"mumbles_incomprehensibly.\">&lt;The lich&gt; mumbles incomprehensibly.</span></dt>\n<dd>You chatted to a lich.</dd>\n<dt><span id=\".27s_body_crumbles_into_dust.\">&lt;The lich&gt;'s body crumbles into dust.</span></dt>\n<dd>A lich was killed in a way that would normally leave a corpse.<sup id=\"cite_ref-dusted_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-dusted-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Variants\">Variants</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"SLASH'EM\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"SLASH.27EM\">SLASH'EM</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/SLASH%27EM\" title=\"SLASH&#39;EM\">SLASH'EM</a> adds one new monster to the monster class:\n</p>\n<ul><li><span class=\"nhsym clr-magenta\">L</span>&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Vecna\" title=\"Vecna\">Vecna</a></li></ul>\n<p>Vecna and seventeen other random liches are generated across the <a href=\"/wiki/Chaotic_Quest\" title=\"Chaotic Quest\">Chaotic Quest</a> at level creation.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"UnNetHack\">UnNetHack</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/UnNetHack\" title=\"UnNetHack\">UnNetHack</a>, a random lich is generated among the many monsters inhabiting the middle level of <a href=\"/wiki/Sheol\" title=\"Sheol\">Sheol</a> at level creation.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"dNetHack\">dNetHack</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/DNetHack\" title=\"DNetHack\">dNetHack</a> adds several new monsters to the monster class:\n</p>\n<ul><li><span class=\"nhsym clr-white\">L</span> lich:\n<ul><li><span class=\"nhsym clr-brightgreen\">L</span> <a href=\"/wiki/Baelnorn\" title=\"Baelnorn\">baelnorn</a></li>\n<li><span class=\"nhsym clr-brightcyan\">L</span> <a href=\"/wiki/Death_knight\" title=\"Death knight\">death knight</a></li>\n<li><span class=\"nhsym clr-darkgray\">L</span> <a href=\"/wiki/Dokkalfar_eternal_matriarch\" title=\"Dokkalfar eternal matriarch\">dokkalfar eternal matriarch</a></li>\n<li><span class=\"nhsym clr-yellow\">L</span> <a href=\"/wiki/Acererak\" title=\"Acererak\">Acererak</a></li>\n<li><span class=\"nhsym clr-brown\">L</span> <a href=\"/wiki/Lich,_the_Fiend_of_Earth\" title=\"Lich, the Fiend of Earth\">Lich, the Fiend of Earth</a></li>\n<li>Deferred monsters\n<ul><li><span class=\"nhsym clr-magenta\">L</span>&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Vecna\" title=\"Vecna\">Vecna</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Of the undead that make up <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>7</sub> of the randomly generated monsters on the <a href=\"/wiki/Anachrononaut_quest\" title=\"Anachrononaut quest\">Anachrononaut quest</a>, approximately ~4.69% of them will be liches.

Broken swathings flapped about the skeleton legs, and above the crown that was set with sapphires and orange rubies, a black something swayed and nodded horribly; but, for an instant, I did not dream what it was.  Then, in its middle, two oblique and scarlet eyes opened and glowed like hellish coals, and two ophidian fangs glittered in an ape-like mouth.  A squat, furless, shapeless head on a neck of disproportionate extent leaned unspeakably down and whispered in the mummy's ear. Then, with one stride, the titanic lich took half the distance between us, and from out the folds of the tattered sere-cloth a gaunt arm arose, and fleshless, taloned fingers laden with glowering gems, reached out and fumbled for my throat . . .<br />\n</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:right\">[ The Abominations of Yondo, Clark Ashton Smith, 1926 ] </div>\n</div></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/NetHack-3.6.7_Released/include/monsym.h#L52\">include/monsym.h in NetHack 3.6.7, line 52</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/NetHack-3.6.7_Released/src/monst.c#L1512\">src/monst.c in NetHack 3.6.7, line 1512</a>\n     </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-dusted-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">↑ <sup><a href=\"#cite_ref-dusted_3-0\">3.0</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#cite_ref-dusted_3-1\">3.1</a></sup></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/NetHack-3.6.7_Released/src/mon.c#L2083\">src/mon.c in NetHack 3.6.7, line 2083</a>\n      </span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<div style=\"display:none; right:10px; padding-bottom: 17px\" class=\"metadata topicon nopopups\"><div style=\"margin-top: -10px\"><a href=\"/wiki/NetHackWiki:Next_version\" title=\"This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.7.

monster|Lich}}\nThe '''lich''' is a [[monster class]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]'', and is represented by the uppercase [[L]] glyph ({{white|L}}). Liches are designated internally by the macro '''S_LICH'''.{{refsrc|include/monsym.h|52|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}\n\nThe monster class contains the following [[monster]]s:{{refsrc|src/monst.c|1512|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}\n\n* {{monsymlink|lich}}\n* {{monsymlink|demilich}}\n* {{monsymlink|master lich}}\n* {{monsymlink|arch-lich}}\n\n==Common traits==\nLiches are [[chaotic]], medium-sized [[undead]] [[humanoid]]s that are [[intelligent]] spellcasters. All liches are [[breathless]], [[inediate]], [[poisonous]] to [[digest]], and have enhanced [[regeneration]] and [[infravision]]; the stronger liches (informally called \"purple Ls\") are also [[covetous]]. All liches possess a [[cold]] touch attack and the ability to cast mage [[monster spell]]s once per round. Liches are [[slow]]-moving, and have resistance to [[cold resistance|cold]], [[sleep resistance|sleep]] and [[poison resistance|poison]] like most undead monsters; they also convey cold resistance when eaten, but lich corpses and tins do not exist.\n\nIf [[chat]]ted to, a lich will \"mumble incomprehensibly\".\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Liches that are not [[cancelled]] can now raise monsters killed by them as [[zombie]]s of the corresponding type; if they have one, they will be raised 5-20 turns after they are initially killed. This also applies to [[you]] if you are polymorphed into a lich. Liches will also [[grudge]] living monsters that can be turned into zombies. Players killed by a lich will arise in bones as a zombie of the corresponding type - as of {{commit|3c421da746cdd3844c7f8d2312c7be5e5a25cfb9}}, the zombie will have the same intrinsics as the former character.}}\n\nMonsters with [[digestion]] attacks can gain [[intrinsic]]s from swallowing monsters whole, making it possible for them to gain cold resistance from a lich that is digested.}}\n\n===Generation===\nRandomly-generated liches are always hostile, and [[Corpseless|never leave a corpse]] when killed - if killed by any method that ordinarily leaves a corpse, a message is printed about their body crumbling to dust.{{refsrc|src/mon.c|2083|nethack=3.6.7|name=\"dusted\"}} The master lich and arch-lich are only randomly generated in Gehennom.\n\nRandom liches appear among the [[throne room]] monsters placed in the center of the [[Castle]] on level creation - the class-specific monster generation used here makes it possible for master liches and arch-liches to generate outside of Gehennom. A random lich is generated within the [[Valley of the Dead]] at level creation outside of [[bones]], while another random lich is placed somewhere within the left side of the inner rooms of [[Asmodeus' Lair]] at level creation outside of bones.\n\nEach of the [[Fake Wizard's Tower]]s has a random lich dwelling inside, while two random liches inhabit the first floor of the real [[Wizard's Tower]], including one in the tower-like structure that houses the up [[ladder]]. Two random liches are generated within [[Moloch's Sanctum]] at level creation, and three random liches are placed around the [[Astral Plane]] at level creation.\n\n==Strategy==\nLiches are generally annoying at best and incredibly lethal at worst: Many of them will frequently cast [[monster spell]]s such as [[curse items]], use [[aggravate]] to awaken other hostiles, and severely weaken your defenses with [[Destroy armor (monster spell)|destroy armor]] - the stronger covetous ones can freely warp towards you (including on [[no-teleport]] levels) and even use the [[touch of death]] on you. Liches are often the target of [[genocide]] by many players that are not observing [[genocideless]] [[conduct]], and it is often considered worth a blessed [[scroll of genocide]] to remove them all from the game.\n\nOne of the best ways to deal with a lich in combat is to have a source of [[magic resistance]], which dampens the effects of its spells and prevents the higher-level ones from [[Instadeath|instantly ending your game]]: [[Magicbane]] in particular will absorb a mass majority of curses from the curse items monster spell. Even covetous liches will respect [[Elbereth]] and the scroll of [[scare monster]], though the former does not allow you to fight while standing on it and will not work in [[Gehennom]] - additionally, neither method prevents liches from casting certain ranged spells at you, and one particular spell, [[summon nasties]], may generate monsters that do not respect Elbereth or the scroll, such as [[captain]]s, [[minotaur]]s and [[Elvenking]]s.\n\nAll liches minus the arch-lich do not have [[shock resistance]], making [[Mjollnir]] an excellent option to deal with most of them; similarly, strong non-elemental [[artifact weapon]]s like [[Excalibur]] and [[Sunsword]] (which deals double damage against liches and other undead) also work quite well. Liches are especially vulnerable to [[stoning]], [[disintegration]] and [[digestion]] attacks, all of which can reliably instakill them - their summon nasties spell can generate monsters with such attacks, which can be turned against them using [[conflict]].\n\nAll types of lich can be pacified by reading the blessed [[Book of the Dead]], and it is additionally possible to tame liches and demiliches this way if done as a chaotic character.\n\n===As pets===\nLiches are generally strong pets with some trade-offs that are quite inconvenient. Their solid [[AC]] and increasingly powerful [[Magic resistance (monster)|MR score]] make them difficult for most other monsters to kill and can prevent polymorphing, but said MR score also makes them difficult to tame. Covetous liches in particular cannot be tamed magically, though a tame lich can [[grow up]] into a covetous one as normal, and an existing pet can also be polymorphed into a tame covetous lich. Liches are also quite slow, with demiliches and stronger forms reaching a peak speed of 12 after casting [[Haste self (monster spell)|haste self]].\n\nLiches cannot cast spells against other monsters, forcing them to rely on their cold touch to deal damage. They cannot wield weapons to counteract this due to lacking a weapon attack, and their cold touch may destroy [[potion]]s in the target's inventory and renders them completely unable to kill any cold-resistant monsters, such as [[winter wolves]] or [[Zombie (monster class)|zombies]] - this is applicable even to their stronger forms, and requires you to kill such monsters yourself. Fortunately, their AC, MR score, and resistances combined with their regeneration and ability to [[cure self]] makes them difficult for monsters to kill, and liches gain more of each as they grow up.\n\nMaster liches and arch-liches in particular will constantly warp towards your position, making them easier to keep nearby without a [[magic whistle]] and lowering the risk of abandoning one - unfortunately, this also makes it incredibly dangerous for them to be [[confused]], so be sure to give any tame lich you have a [[unicorn horn]] as soon as possible. The warping will also make it perilous to navigate while wielding [[Stormbringer]]: although liches will not take as much damage from the [[bloodthirsty]] [[artifact]], carelessly untaming your pet arch-lich is asking for trouble. It is also nearly impossible to keep covetous liches away from [[aligned priest]]s and [[shopkeepers]], and makes navigating around traps such as [[level teleporter]]s difficult. Furthermore, a covetous lich will often warp away to the up stair at the slightest sign of damage, which can be annoying; they are also inediate, making it near-impossible to raise tameness. Most annoying of all is the fact that even the strongest liches are still vulnerable to various instadeaths and similar attacks: stoning, disintegration, digestion and [[sliming]] will all make short work of a pet lich.\n\n[[Reflection]] is not as vital for a higher-level lich due to the amount of resistances they can gain, but it is still useful to protect against the [[disintegration]] [[breath]] attacks of [[black dragon]]s in particular - this is the best use for their amulet slot, since they cannot use the [[amulet of life saving]]. Similarly, while a lich has nothing to fear from death magic, a source of magic resistance can still protect them against stronger magical attacks such as an [[Angel]]'s magic missile.\n\n{{upcoming|3.7.0|Per {{commit|8d2407f}}, monsters can gain intrinsics from eating corpses, making the inediate liches slightly weaker pets, though a lich can still gain useful resistances from becoming an arch-lich; pets that are polymorphed retain any intrinsics they gained previously.}}\n\n===As a polyform===\nLich polyforms can wear all armor, and have similar strengths and weaknesses to pet liches: you have at least a few useful intrinsics and your base AC improves with the stronger polyforms chosen, but your base speed is lower, you cannot use your wielded weapon, and your only attack is a cold touch that does nothing against resistant monsters. Fortunately, you have access to spellcasting and several other forms of offense that can compensate, and your defensive qualities (including [[Death resistance|a resistance to death magic]]) are more than enough to ensure survival against all but the most powerful or nasty monsters.\n\n==History==\nThe base lich, demilich and master lich first appear in [[NetHack 3.0.0]], and the arch-lich is added in [[NetHack 3.3.0]].\n\n==Origin==\n{{wikipedia|Lich}}\nIn fantasy works and media, a lich (which comes from the Old English ''līċ'', meaning \"corpse\" or \"body\") is a type of undead creature. Previously used as recently as early 20th-century fantasy fiction to refer to any corpse (animate or otherwise), media such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' has spurred the portrayal of liches as powerful undead spellcasters that are proficient in necromancy, and typically undergo the transformation in order to defy death, allowing them to retain their intelligence and magical abilities and command lesser undead. ''Dungeons & Dragons'' in particular also takes inspiration from sources such as [[H.P. Lovecraft]] story \"The Thing on the Doorstep\" and Gardner Fox's titular mage of \"The Sword of the Sorcerer\".\n\nA lich is generally depicted as a revenant with an undecaying body that is cadaverous, desiccated or completely skeletal, and has glowing lights in place of their eyes. Liches are often capable of sustaining tremendous physical damage, and are immune to disease, poison, fatigue and other effects that affect only the living; they were also quite resistant to various forms of magic, and the mere sight of them often compelled the weak-willed to flee. The lich's most dangerous asset, beyond even its undead gifts, is their vast intellect, mastery of sorcery and limitless time to research, plot and scheme. ''Dungeons & Dragons'' introduces the lich in 1975 as part of its first supplement, ''Greyhawk''.\n\nIn ''Dungeons & Dragons'' settings, a mage that becomes a lich usually gives up some portion or the entirety of their soul to form \"soul-artifacts\" (also referred to as \"soul gems\" or \"phylacteries\") that are the source of their magic and immortality. Many liches take precautions to hide and/or safeguard them, as they anchor a part of a lich's soul to the material world: if their corporeal body is killed, those portions of the lich's soul within it will continue to exist in a non-corporeal form capable of being resurrected from that \"soul-artifact\" in the near future. However, if all of the lich's soul-artifacts are destroyed, then destroying the lich's body will kill it permanently. Most forays into lichdom often require the creation and consumption of a deadly potion on a full moon; the exact details vary, but almost universally involves acts of utter evil and vile components. Despite this process and their commonplace detachment from mortal morality, it is possible for liches to ascribe to any alignment - in very rare instances truly good liches can arise, either from possessing a more noble purpose for seeking lichdom or from having lichdom forced upon them; these were known as \"archliches\", not to be confused with the arch-liches of ''NetHack''.\n\nThere are various other types of liches as well: demiliches, advanced liches who took to astral projection to traval other planes for knowledge and no longer had need for a body, concentrating their power into a single body part and leaving the rest to crumble away; elven archliches, or [[baelnorn]]s, whose undeath is gifted to them by the Seldarine in order to act as sources of magic, wise council, and guardianship; [[alhoon]]s, illithids who have achieved a limited form of lichdom and are considered deviant among their kind; and even dracoliches, dragons that tied their soul to a phylactery and can use their spirit to inhabit the body of any reptilian corpse upon death, though they are at their most powerful inhabiting the corpse of a dragon.\n\n==Messages==\n{{message|<The lich> mumbles incomprehensibly.|You chatted to a lich.}}\n{{message|<The lich>'s body crumbles into dust.|A lich was killed in a way that would normally leave a corpse.<ref name=\"dusted\"/>}}\n\n==Variants==\n===SLASH'EM===\n[[SLASH'EM]] adds one new monster to the monster class:\n\n* {{monsymlink|Vecna}}\n\nVecna and seventeen other random liches are generated across the [[Chaotic Quest]] at level creation.\n\n===UnNetHack===\nIn [[UnNetHack]], a random lich is generated among the many monsters inhabiting the middle level of [[Sheol]] at level creation.\n\n===dNetHack===\n[[dNetHack]] adds several new monsters to the monster class:\n\n* {{white|L}} lich:\n** {{brightgreen|L}} [[baelnorn]]\n** {{brightcyan|L}} [[death knight]]\n** {{black|L}} [[dokkalfar eternal matriarch]]\n** {{yellow|L}} [[Acererak]]\n** {{brown|L}} [[Lich, the Fiend of Earth]]\n** Deferred monsters\n*** {{monsymlink|Vecna}}\n\nOf the undead that make up {{frac|7}} of the randomly generated monsters on the [[Anachrononaut quest]], approximately ~4.69% of them will be liches. The [[Binder quest]] generates a random lich tending to the unaligned altar that is unlocked once you have converted all three temples.\n\n===SpliceHack===\n[[SpliceHack]] adds two new monsters to the monster class:\n\n* {{green|L}} [[worm that walks]]\n* {{orange|L}} [[eye of fear and flame]]\n\n===EvilHack===\n[[EvilHack]] adds one new monster to the monster class:\n\n* {{monsymlink|Vecna}}\n\nPlayers killed by any type of lich will arise as a [[revenant]] instead of a [[ghost]] in [[bones]] files.\n\nVarious liches are generated across the floors of [[Vecna's Domain]], a three-level [[branch]] where Vecna resides. Vecna's presence prevents the genocide of liches, as well as [[alhoon]]s - once he is destroyed, they can be subjected to genocide as normal.\n\nLiches are much more dangerous compared to vanilla ''[[NetHack]]'', since they have access to several new monster spells, including [[Cancellation (monster spell)|cancellation]], [[Reflection (monster spell)|reflection]] and [[Stone to flesh (monster spell)|stone to flesh]]. This also makes them much better pets and polyforms, with full access to their repertoire of monster spells when fighting other monsters.\n\nSunsword now has a chance of instakilling any liches it hits. [[The Sword of Kas]] is an [[artifact]] [[gemstone]] [[two-handed]] sword that deals double damage versus liches ''except'' for Vecna: the sword instead deals three times the damage when used specifically against him.\n\n===SlashTHEM===\n[[SlashTHEM]] adds one new monster to the monster class:\n\n* {{yellow|L}} [[baby lich]]\n\n===Hack'EM===\n[[Hack'EM]] adds a few monsters to the monster class from other variants:\n\n* {{green|L}} [[worm that walks]]\n* {{orange|L}} [[eye of fear and flame]]\n* {{monsymlink|Vecna}}\n\nAs in EvilHack, players killed by any type of lich will arise as a revenant instead of a ghost in bones files.\n\n==Encyclopedia entry==\n{{encyclopedia|\nBut on its heels ere the sunset faded, there came a second apparition, striding with incredible strides and halting when it loomed almost upon me in the red twilight-the monstrous mummy of some ancient king still crowned with untarnished gold but turning to my gaze a visage that more than time or the worm had wasted. Broken swathings flapped about the skeleton legs, and above the crown that was set with sapphires and orange rubies, a black something swayed and nodded horribly; but, for an instant, I did not dream what it was.  Then, in its middle, two oblique and scarlet eyes opened and glowed like hellish coals, and two ophidian fangs glittered in an ape-like mouth.  A squat, furless, shapeless head on a neck of disproportionate extent leaned unspeakably down and whispered in the mummy's ear. Then, with one stride, the titanic lich took half the distance between us, and from out the folds of the tattered sere-cloth a gaunt arm arose, and fleshless, taloned fingers laden with glowering gems, reached out and fumbled for my throat . . .\n|[ The Abominations of Yondo, Clark Ashton Smith, 1926 ]\n}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{nethack-367}}\n[[Category:Monster classes]]"}

The potion is always used up (you cannot quaff only part of a potion, or quaff the same potion twice).\n\nMost potions are identified when you quaff them. In some cases, \"You have a peculiar feeling for a moment, then it passes.\" (if hallucinating, you feel \"normal feeling\" instead), and the potion is not identified. These cases will be marked as \"peculiar feeling\". There are also case when the potion is not identified without peculiar feeling. They are also mentioned in text.\n\n## Milky or smoky potion\n\nIf you quaff milky or smoky potion, whatever is true identity, there are additional effects. These precede the main effects of the potion.[\\[1\\]](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.6.0/src/potion.c#line502)\n\nMilky potion may produce a hostile ghost, while smoky potion may produce a djinni. The chance is 1/(13+2n) in both cases, where n is the number of ghosts or djinn already produced. Djinni may grant you a [wish](/wiki/Wish \"Wish\") (chance 80% for blessed smoky potion, 20% for uncursed, 5% for cursed).[\\[2\\]](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.6.0/src/potion.c#djinni_from_bottle) See [Smoky and milky potions](/wiki/Smoky_and_milky_potions \"Smoky and milky potions\") for more information.\n\n## Main effects\n\nSource:[\\[3\\]](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.6.0/src/potion.c#peffects)\n\n### [Potion of restore ability](/wiki/Potion_of_restore_ability \"Potion of restore ability\")\n\nSource: [\\[4\\]](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.6.0/src/potion.c#line553)\n\nNot identified.\n\nCursed: \"Ulch!

If two of more abilities are less than the maximal previously achieved value, restores one of them.\n\n  - Weakness from hunger is not cured this way.\n  - The algorithm is as follows: starting at a random ability, it checks all abilities until it either finds one which can be restored (and restores it) or it has visited all abilities (in which case there is no effect because no ability needs to be restored.)\n\nBlessed\n\n- \"Wow! This makes you feel great/better!\" (\"better\" if you are stoned, strangled, have wounded legs and not riding, slimed, confused, sick, hallucinating, vomiting, stunned, or deaf)\n- Restores all your abilities to theirs maximal previously achieved values.\n  - Weakness from hunger is not cured this way.\n\n### [Potion of hallucination](/wiki/Potion_of_hallucination \"Potion of hallucination\")\n\nMakes you hallucinating for 300-499 (more) turns (if blessed), 600-799 (more) turns (if uncursed), or 900-1099 (more) turns (if cursed).[\\[5\\]](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.6.0/src/potion.c#line582)\n\nIf you are already hallucinating, or resistant to hallucinations, it is \"peculiar feeling\".\n\n- \"Oh wow!

can quaff only one potion at a time. The potion is always used up (you cannot quaff only part of a potion, or quaff the same potion twice).  \n\nMost potions are identified when you quaff them. In some cases, \"You have a peculiar feeling for a moment, then it passes.\" (if hallucinating, you feel \"normal feeling\" instead), and the potion is not identified. These cases will be marked as \"peculiar feeling\".  There are also case when the potion is not identified without peculiar feeling.  They are also mentioned in text.\n\n==Milky or smoky potion==\n\nIf you quaff milky or smoky potion, whatever is true identity, there are additional effects. These precede the main effects of the potion.[https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.6.0/src/potion.c#line502] \n\nMilky potion may produce a hostile ghost, while smoky potion may produce a djinni. The chance is 1/(13+2n) in both cases, where n is the number of ghosts or djinn already produced. Djinni may grant you a [[wish]] (chance 80% for blessed smoky potion, 20% for uncursed, 5% for cursed).[https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.6.0/src/potion.c#djinni_from_bottle]  See [[Smoky and milky potions]] for more information.\n\n== Main effects ==\n\nSource:[https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.6.0/src/potion.c#peffects]\n\n=== [[Potion of restore ability]] ===\n\nSource: [https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.6.0/src/potion.c#line553]\n\nNot identified.\n\nCursed: \"Ulch!  This makes you feel mediocre!\"\n\nUncursed: \n* \"Wow!  This makes you feel good!\"\n* If one of your abilities is less than the maximal previously achieved value, restores it. If two of more abilities are less than the maximal previously achieved value, restores one of them.\n** Weakness from hunger is not cured this way.\n** The algorithm is as follows: starting at a random ability, it checks all abilities until it either finds one which can be restored (and restores it) or it has visited all abilities (in which case there is no effect because no ability needs to be restored.)\n\nBlessed\n* \"Wow!

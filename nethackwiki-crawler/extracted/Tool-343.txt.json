The COST field denotes the base\nprice of each item.  WGT specifies the weight (100 zorkmids weighs 1).\nThe existence of some items depends on options chosen when the program\nwas compiled; they are noted with an asterisk (*).\n\nTools comprise 8% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,\n0% in containers, 0% on the Rogue level, and 12% in hell.  PROB is\nthe relative probability of each subtype.  See below for more details\non item generation.\n\nIf the CHG field is not blank, then the tool can be charged by a scroll\nof charging or the Platinum Yendorian Express Card. The number shows the\nmaximum number of initial charges. An exclamation mark (!) indicates\nthat the tool can only be recharged once.\n\nFinally, some items have a different APPEARANCE until they are identified.\nNote that many tools share the same appearance with other types of tools.\n\n\nUsing containers\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nContainers are generated uncursed, with the CONTENTS described below. \nContainers will not be generated containing tools, weapons, armour or\nrocks. Containers in your initial inventory will be empty.  If the\ncontainer can be LOCKED, then there is an 80% chance that it will be\ngenerated locked and a different 10% chance that it will be trapped.  Not\nall containers FIT into other containers.  Some containers have special\nEFFECTS.  All of the containers except ice boxes can be eaten by\ngelatinous cubes; the contents will be engulfed but unharmed.\n  CONTAINER       CONTENTS      LOCKED  FIT  EFFECTS\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~  ~~~~~~~\n  sack            0-1 items     No      Yes  --\n  large box       0-3 items     Yes     No   --\n  chest           0-5 items     Yes     No   --\n  ice box         0-20 corpses  No      No   Suspends rotting of corpses.\n  bag of holding  0-1 items     No      Yes  May reduce weight.\n  bag of tricks   1-20 charges  No      Yes  Bites you / creates monsters.\n  oilskin sack    0-1 items     No      Yes  May prevent water damage.\n\nQuantum mechanics may carry a large box containing either a live or\ndead housecat named Schroedinger's Cat.  The state of the cat is not\ndetermined until the box is opened.  There is nothing special about\nthis cat; it is just a silly physics joke. \n\nThe weight of a bag of holding (wgt) -- including the 15 for the bag\nitself -- depends on the weight of its contents (cwgt) and its blessed\nstatus:\n  blessed:   wgt = 15 + cwgt/4 + 1\n  uncursed:  wgt = 15 + cwgt/2 + 1\n  cursed:    wgt = 15 + cwgt*2\n\nYou may also lose items when you use a cursed bag of holding; each item\nin the bag has a 1/13 chance of disappearing each time you apply or loot\nthe bag.\n\nPutting any of the following (and ONLY the following) items into any bag\nof holding will cause it to explode:\n  (another) bag of holding\n  bag of tricks (with non-zero charge)\n  wand of cancellation (with non-zero charge)\nIt is sometimes possible to put one of these items into nested sacks\nand/or oilskin sacks and then place them safely inside a bag of holding.\nThe chance of an explosion occurring then depends on the amount of\nnesting:\n  sacks:  0    1    2    3    4     5     6      7      8        n\n  odds:  1/1  2/2  3/4  4/8  5/16  6/32  7/64  8/128  9/128  (n+1)/128\n\nWhen a bag of tricks is #looted, it will bite you (1 to 10 hit points\ndamage) and become identified.  If you (a)pply it and it has charges\nleft, it will create one monster 22 out of 23 times, and create 2 to\n8 monsters 1 out of 23 times.  \"Nothing happens\" when you apply a bag\nwith zero charges. Bags of tricks are generated with 1 to 20 charges.\nIf the bag has more than 10 charges, a blessed scroll of charging will\nadd 6 to 10 charges, otherwise it will add 6 to 15 charges; an uncursed\nscroll will always add 1 to 5 charges.  Cannot be charged higher than 50\ncharges.\n\nWhen ungreased bags get wet, their contents may also get wet.  A\nnon-cursed oilskin sack will prevent this; if the oilskin sack is\ncursed, there is a 1/3 chance that the contents can get wet.  Boxes\nand chests are all waterproof.\n\nIf a container (other than a bag of holding) is kicked, thrown, or\ndropped from a height, fragile contents (glass items (other than\nworthless glass) and eggs) may be destroyed. Kicking a locked large\nbox or chest may also break it open (see below).\n\n\nUsing unlocking tools\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEach of the tools, wands, and spells listed below can be used for locking\nand unlocking doors, large boxes, and chests.  Not all methods can LOCK\nor UNLOCK.  DOOR and BOX represent the probability (in percent) of\nsucceeding each turn when attempting to unlock doors and large boxes or\nchests respectively; it may be based on your Dexterity and you will fail\nafter 50 turns.  ROGUEs may get an additional percentile bonus for using an\nimplement (the numbers before and after the slash being added to DOOR/BOX\nrespectively).  The per-turn probability of picking the lock is halved if\nyou use a cursed credit card, lock pick, or skeleton key.  All unlocking\ntools are generated uncursed.\n  TOOL             LOCK  UNLOCK  DOOR    BOX     ROGUE\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~\n  credit card      No     Yes    2*Dex   Dex     20/20\n  lock pick        Yes    Yes    3*Dex   4*Dex   30/25\n  skeleton key     Yes    Yes    70+Dex  75+Dex   0/0\n  wand/spell open  No     Yes    100     100      0/0\n  wand/spell lock  Yes    No     100     100      0/0\n\nUsing any of the first three types will exercise your dexterity, even if\nyou don't succeed.  Please note that a credit card has no special effects\nin shops, although you can unlock a shop \"Closed for inventory\" and you\ncan buy and sell it like any other item.  If a watchman or watch captain\nsees you pick a door with any tool, he may get upset; if he warns you\noff, a trap is automatically added to the door in question.\n\nWands of opening and locking and the spells of knock and wizard lock\nalways work in one turn and can be performed from a distance.  Zapped\nopening will also unlock doors in the same turn, will lower drawbridges,\nand can remove a ball and chain (as will ringing the blessed Bell of\nOpening).  Zapped closing will close a door in the same turn (if there\nare no objects in the way; creating one if necessary) and will raise\ndrawbridges. \n\nYou can also attempt to break a lock on a large box or chest by #forcing\nit with a suitable weapon or kicking it open. This may EXERCISE your\ndexterity or strength, but may also destroy any WEAPON you use, the\nCONTAINER and/or some of the CONTENTS (possibly restricted to fragile\nones, namely glass items (other than worthless glass) and eggs):\n  METHOD        WEAPON  CONTAINER  CONTENTS  EXERCISE \n  ~~~~~~        ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~\n  Blunt weapon    No       Yes       Yes       STR\n  Edged weapon   Yes        No        No       DEX\n  Kicking         --        No      Fragile     No   \n\n\nUsing light sources\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nLight sources are generated to stay lit for the number of TURNS noted\nbelow.  They are GENERATED in the quantity and blessed state shown.\nCursed light sources will sometimes not light.\n  LIGHT SOURCE   TURNS        GENERATED\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~\n  tallow candle           200  1 to 7; 10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed\n  wax candle              400  1 to 7; 10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed\n  brass lantern  1000 to 1499  10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed\n  oil lamp       1000 to 1499  10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed\n  magic lamp       Infinite    25% blessed, 50% uncursed, 25% cursed\n  potion of oil           400  1/8 blessed, 3/4 uncursed, 1/8 cursed\n  Sunsword         Infinite    10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed\n\nCandles can also be applied to the Candelabrum of Invocation.  Brass\nlanterns and oil lamps can be refilled by a scroll of charging; a blessed\nscroll will refill them to 1500 turns, an uncursed scroll will add 750\nturns to a maximum of 1500. Oil lamps with 1000 or fewer turns left can\nalso be refilled with potions of oil, getting twice the remaining turns\nin the potion of oil. (Attempting to refill an oil lamp with a *lit*\npotion of oil, or while the lamp is lit, will cause an explosion dealing\n6 to 36 points of damage). No lamp can be filled beyond 1500 turns.\n\nThe artifact weapon Sunsword will act as a light source whenever wielded,\neither by you or by a monster.\n\nIf you wish for a magic lamp, you will instead get an ordinary oil lamp.\n\nMagic lamps never run out of power, and may summon a djinni and lead to\na wish when #rubbed.  Each time you rub the lamp, there is a 1/3 chance\nthat \"You see a puff of smoke\" and another 1/3 chance that \"Nothing\nhappens\"; in either case, just try again.\n\nThe remaining 1/3 of the time a djinni appears, the lamp is identified\nand turned into an oil lamp, and one of five outcomes can occur.  The\nrelative chance of these outcomes depends on whether the lamp was\nblessed, uncursed, or cursed:\n  BLESSED  UNCURSED  CURSED  OUTCOME\n  ~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~\n    80%       20%       5%   Grants one wish, then disappears.\n                             \"I am in your debt.  I will grant one wish!\"\n     5%       20%       5%   Remains as a pet.\n                             \"Thank you for freeing me!\"\n     5%       20%       5%   Remains as a peaceful monster.\n                             \"You freed me!\"\n     5%       20%       5%   Speaks, then vanishes.\n                             \"It is about time!\"\n     5%       20%      80%   Remains as a hostile monster.\n                             \"You disturbed me, fool!\"\nNOTE: There is no way to get a wish from the djinni other than the first\noutcome above.\n\nThere is a limit of 120 djinn per game.  Beyond this limit, they are\nextinct and no more can be created.\n\nUsing instruments\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAll instruments are generated uncursed.  In this section, \"nearby\" means\nwithin some distance from you that depends on your experience level.\nDepending on your system, configuration, and options, sounds may also be\nproduced on your system's speaker.\n\ntin whistle\n  Wakes nearby monsters and calls nearby pets.\n    \"You produce a high whistling sound.\"  (non-cursed)\n    \"You produce a shrill whistling sound.\"  (cursed)\n\nmagic whistle\n  non-cursed\n    Teleports pets next to you.\n      \"You produce a strange whistling sound.\"  (not hallucinating)\n      \"You produce a normal whistling sound.\"  (hallucinating)\n  cursed\n    50% chance of acting as non-cursed; otherwise, wakes nearby monsters\n    and calls nearby pets.\n      \"You produce a high-pitched humming noise.\"\n\nhorn of plenty\n  Created with 1 to 20 charges. If more than 10 charges, blessed scrolls of\n  charging add 6 to 10 charges, otherwise 6 to 15 charges. Uncursed\n  scrolls of charging add 1 to 5 charges. Cannot be charged higher than\n  50 charges.\n  No effect if no charges.\n  Creates some food (including royal jelly) or a potion of water, fruit\n  juice, booze, acid, sickness, or oil.\n  The blessed/uncursed/cursed state of the object produced is the same as\n  the horn.\n\nleather drum\n  Awakens and may scare nearby monsters. Abuses wisdom.\n    \"You beat a deafening row!\"\n\ndrum of earthquake\n  Created with 4 to 8 charges. Blessed scrolls of charging add 2 to 8\n  charges; uncursed scrolls 1 to 4 charges.  Drums cannot have more than\n  20 charges.\n  Creates several pits around you, and angers peaceful monsters in the\n  vicinity. Awakens and may scare all monsters on the level.\n    \"You produce a heavy, thunderous rolling! The entire dungeon is\n    shaking around you!\"\n\nbell\n  Doesn't work under water or when swallowed.\n  non-cursed\n    Wakes nearby monsters and calls nearby pets.\n  cursed\n    There is a 1/4 chance of summoning a nymph (with no inventory), if they\n    aren't already genocided or extinct. There is a further chance that the\n    bell breaks, and/or that you are paralyzed or the nymph is made fast.\n    Wakes nearby monsters and calls nearby pets.\n\nThe following instruments can be used to play notes to open the Castle\ndrawbridge. You will hear one \"gear turn\" for each correct note in the\nright position and one \"tumbler click\" for each correct note in the wrong\nposition. However, if you improvise, you will get the EFFECT shown; some\nmonsters may resist.  Charged instruments are created with 4 to 8 charges.\nBlessed scrolls of charging add 2 to 8 charges; uncursed scrolls 1 to 4\ncharges.  They can never have more than 20 charges.\n  INSTRUMENT          EFFECT\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~\n  bugle               Awaken and anger soldiers on level, abuse wisdom.\n  wooden flute        Make nearby snakes peaceful (if enough dexterity and\n                      experience), exercise dexterity.\n  magic flute         May put nearby monsters to sleep, exercise dexterity.\n  tooled horn         Awaken and may scare nearby monsters, abuse wisdom.\n  frost horn          Same as a wand of cold other than dealing 6 to 66\n                      base damage (plus 6 to 33 against fire resistant\n                      monsters).\n  fire horn           Same as a wand of fire other than dealing 6 to 66\n                      base damage (plus 6 to 33 against cold resistant\n                      monsters).\n  wooden harp (koto)  Make nearby nymphs peaceful (if enough dexterity and\n                      experience), exercise dexterity.\n  magic harp          May tame nearby monsters, exercise dexterity.\n\n\nUsing other tools\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nUnless noted, all items in this section are generated uncursed. Not all\nof them are actual tools; a few items of other object types can also be\na)pplied.\n\nbeartrap or land mine\n  If you successfully #untrap one of these traps, the trap becomes a tool.\n  You can pick up the tool and later re-arm the trap at your current\n  location by (a)pplying the tool.\n\nbullwhip\n  This weapon can also be applied to get yourself out of a pit, unwield\n  or steal another monster's weapon, hit a monster, whip your steed into a\n  gallop, or grab objects off the floor while levitating.\n\npick-axe\n  You can dig by (a)pplying a pick-axe or dwarvish mattock.  Specify > to \n  dig downward (first makes a pit, then a hole), or a direction to dig\n  through rock, walls, or doors, or to smash up statues or boulders.\n\naxe or battle-axe\n  These weapons can also be applied to chop down doors or trees.\n\ncream pie\n  You can apply this food item to blind yourself for 1 to 25 (more) turns.\n\neucalyptus leaf\n  non-blessed\n    Acts like a tin whistle (see instruments, above).\n  blessed\n    Acts like a blessed magic whistle (see instruments, above). Each\n    use has a 1/49 chance of unblessing the leaf.\n\ngrappling hook\n  You can apply this tool to grab an object at a distance, hit a monster\n  (or, if small, drag it towards you), drag yourself in a direction, or\n  hit yourself for 10 to 19 points of damage. If you are at least skilled\n  in flail, you can attempt to choose between the first three options\n  (with a 50% chance of accuracy if skilled, 95% if expert); otherwise,\n  the effect will be randomly chosen. \n\nunicorn horn\n  non-cursed\n    Randomly fixes one or more of the following troubles: sickness,\n    blindness, hallucination, vomiting, confusion, stunning, and loss of\n    an attribute.  The approximate chances of fixing a certain number of\n    troubles are shown here:\n      # Troub:    0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7\n      blessed:  22.7%  22.7%  19.5%  15.4%  10.7%   5.7%   2.6%   0.8%\n     uncursed:  35.4%  35.4%  22.9%   6.3%    0      0      0      0\n  cursed\n    You get one of the following: illness, blindness, confusion,\n    stunning, hallucination, or a decremented attribute.\n  Unicorn horns don't fix stoning, sliming, strangulation, or wounded legs.\n  #dipping a unicorn horn in a potion of blindness, confusion, or\n  hallucination turns the potion into uncursed water.  Dipping it in\n  a potion of sickness produces non-blessed fruit juice.\n  Unicorn horns also make a fairly good weapon.  They are two-handed.\n\nexpensive camera\n  Generated with 30 to 99 charges. An uncursed scroll of charging will\n  add 10 to 20 charges, and then bring the camera to a minimum of 50\n  charges. A blessed scroll of charging will add 15 to 30 charges,\n  and then bring the camera to a minimum of 50 charges (75 if between\n  51 and 74). A camera may never have more than 127 charges.\n  You can get several humorous messages by applying it in certain\n  situations.\n  A cursed camera has a 50% chance of blinding you when applied.\n  Otherwise, you can blind monsters.\n\nmirror\n  Cursed mirrors only work half of the time.\n  You can get several humorous messages by applying it in certain\n  situations (especially hallucinating; try underwater or at yourself\n  while polymorphed into a floating eye).\n  You can use a mirror to make a monster's gaze attacks work against\n  itself (if the monster isn't cancelled):\n    vampire or ghost   No reflection\n    Medusa             Turns to stone\n    floating eye       Paralyzed, if it is not invisible\n    umber hulk         Confused\n    nymph or succubus  Steals the mirror, if she is not invisible\n  Otherwise, you have a 4 out of 5 chance of scaring the monster\n  in that direction for 2 to 8 turns.  The monster cannot be a\n  unicorn or humanoid, must have eyes and be unblind, and must be able\n  to see invisible if it is invisible.\n  Breaking any mirror (except by kicking a container) carries a -2 penalty\n  to luck.\n\ncrystal ball\n  Generated 1/4 blessed, 1/2 uncursed, 1/4 cursed.\n  Generated with 1 to 5 charges. (If your Quest Artifact is a crystal ball,\n  it is always generated with 5 charges.) Blessed scrolls of charging set\n  the ball to 6 charges. Uncursed scrolls of charging add one charge, to a\n  maximum of 5.\n  Applying a crystal ball will cause you to be immobile (in a trance) for 1\n  to 10 turns.\n  There are several humorous messages if used when hallucinating.\n  non-cursed\n    You may look for an object, monster or symbol (including traps and\n    portals, ^, but not stairs or other dungeon features).  There is an\n    (intelligence in 20) chance of success; otherwise, you suffer the same\n    effects as a cursed crystal ball.\n  cursed\n    One of the following happens: nothing, you are confused, you are\n    blinded, you hallucinate, or the ball explodes (not if an artifact).\n\nlenses\n  These protect you from being blinded by ravens, spat venom or thrown\n  cream pies. They increase the effectiveness of searching, and reduce\n  the failure rate and time taken to learn spells from spellbooks.\n\nblindfold\n  You can controllably blind yourself by (a)pplying it or (P)utting\n  it on.  A cursed blindfold cannot be removed by yourself.\n\ntowel\n  You can controllably blind yourself (like a blindfold) by (P)utting\n  it on.  A cursed towel cannot be removed by yourself.\n  When (a)pplied, a towel can clean greasy hands (e.g., from a tin of\n  greasy food) or clean a cream pie off your face.  A cursed towel has\n  a 1/3 chance of causing each of these problems, or else it works\n  normally.\n  If you (E)ngrave with a towel, you can rub out writing in the dust.\n\nsaddle\n  You can (a)pply it to a monster (equines, quadrupeds, dragons,\n  jabberwocks, ki-rin or couatls) in order to be able to ride it in\n  future. Chance of successfully saddling depends on dexterity,\n  charisma, tameness of monster and riding skill; Knights receive a\n  bonus, as does wearing riding boots or gloves.\n\nleash\n  You can (a)pply it to a tame monster to keep it nearby.\n  Once you have leashed a monster, you can release it by re-(a)pplying the\n  leash.  A cursed leash can't be removed by yourself, and moving too far\n  from your pet may cause it to be choked and take damage.\n\nstethoscope\n  A stethoscope can be (a)pplied once each turn without taking any time.\n  If you use it more than that, each application takes one turn.\n  You can get several humorous messages by applying it in certain\n  situations.\n  A cursed stethoscope has a 50% chance of only hearing your own\n  heartbeat.\n  Otherwise, you can use it to find the status of adjacent monsters or\n  of yourself or your steed (though this latter use may be interfered with\n  if engulfed by a monster), and find secret doors and passages.\n\ntinning kit\n  Created with 30 to 99 charges. An uncursed scroll of charging will\n  add 10 to 20 charges, and then bring the kit to a minimum of 50 charges.\n  A blessed scroll of charging will add 15 to 30 charges, and then bring\n  the kit to a minimum of 50 charges (75 if between 51 and 74). A tinning\n  kit may never have more than 127 charges.\n  You can convert corpses into tins.  The corpse must be uneaten and\n  have non-zero nutrition.  The resulting tin is blessed/uncursed/cursed\n  the same way as the tinning kit that produced it.  Blessed tins are\n  not poisonous or rotten, and can be opened in one turn.  Cursed tins\n  always contain rotten food.  Tins have the same chance of giving an\n  intrinsic as the equivalent corpse; the blessed/cursed status of the\n  tin does NOT affect the chance.\n  Some people tin unique monsters as souvenirs.  You cannot tin the\n  endgame Riders.\n\ntin opener\n  Mostly useless.  Wield the tin opener and you can e)at a tin in one\n  turn.\n\ncan of grease\n  Generated 5% blessed, 90% uncursed, 5% cursed.\n  Created with 1 to 25 charges. If more than 10 charges, blessed\n  scrolls of charging add 6 to 10 charges, otherwise 6 to 15 charges.\n  Uncursed scrolls of charging add 1 to 5 charges.  Cannot be charged\n  higher than 50 charges.\n  When a)pplying a can of grease, you have a 50% chance of dropping it\n  if it is cursed or you have fumbling.  Otherwise, you can grease an\n  item to prevent it from rusting or corroding. If the can of grease is\n  cursed or you specify no object, you get your fingers greasy.\n  Greased outer body armour will protect against grabbing attacks,\n  and greased helmets will protect against (master) mind flayer's\n  tentacles; however, the grease has a 50% chance of wearing off after\n  each attack against which it protects, and grease on cursed armour\n  will only be effective 1/3 of the time.\n  You can also use the can of grease or a potion of oil to #untrap a\n  squeaky board.\n\nfigurine\n  Generated 1/8 blessed, 3/4 uncursed, and 1/8 cursed.\n  Applying a figurine creates that monster in an adjacent square of your\n  choosing.  It will fail if the square is occupied, or if the species is\n  genocided.  The chance of a tame or peaceful monster depends on the\n  blessed state of the figurine:\n              blessed  uncursed  cursed\n    tame        80%      10%      10%\n    peaceful    10%      80%      10%\n    hostile     10%      10%      80%\n  Cursed figurines can spontaneously transform when carried, after\n  201 to 9200 turns in inventory.\n\nmagic marker\n  Generated with 30 to 99 charges.  Can only be recharged once.\n  An uncursed scroll of charging will add 10 to 20 charges, and then bring\n  the marker to a minimum of 50 charges. A blessed scroll of charging will\n  add 15 to 30 charges, and then bring the marker to a minimum of 50\n  charges (75 if between 51 and 74).\n  You can write scrolls and spellbooks from blank ones.  See the spoilers\n  \"scrl-343.txt\" and \"spl1-343.txt\" for details.  The blessed/uncursed/\n  cursed status of the resulting item depends on the marker and\n  scroll/spellbook:\n              blessed   uncursed  cursed\n    blessed   blessed   blessed   uncursed\n    uncursed  blessed   uncursed  cursed\n    cursed    uncursed  cursed    cursed\n  You can also (E)ngrave graffiti on the floor with a magic marker.\n\n\nInvocation items\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe three unique invocation items (Bell, Book, and Candelabrum) cannot be\nplaced in a container or destroyed in any way.  They have special effects\nwhen (a)pplied or #invoked and you are NOT on the vibrating square:\n\nBell of Opening\n  Obtained from your Quest Nemesis. Created with 3 charges. Blessed\n  scrolls of charging add 1 to 3 charges, uncursed scrolls of charging add\n  1 charge. Cannot be charged higher than 5 charges.\n  uncharged\n    Acts like a regular bell.  Will not break.\n  blessed\n    If you are swallowed, you are expelled.\n      \"<monster> opens its mouth!\" (if animal)\n    Else you unlock and open nearby containers and doors, find nearby\n    secret passages and non-statue traps, open nearby drawbridges, and\n    are unpunished.  Items must be in your visual range.\n  uncursed\n    If you are swallowed, you are expelled.\n      \"<monster> opens its mouth!\" (if animal)\n    Else same effect as a wand of secret door detection -- you find\n    nearby secret doors, secret passages, non-statue traps, mimics,\n    and hiding and invisible monsters.\n  cursed\n    If you are swallowed, \"Nothing happens.\"\n    Else you summon undead and wake nearby monsters.\n\nCandelabrum of Invocation\n  Obtained from Vlad the Impaler.\n  blessed or uncursed\n    The Candelabrum acts like an ordinary light source if at least one\n    candle is applied to it.  It will last as many turns as the first\n    candle that was applied would have burned.\n  cursed\n    The Candelabrum won't light.\n\nBook of the Dead\n  Obtained from the Wizard of Yendor.\n  blessed\n    Undead creatures in your sight are made peaceful; nearby ones sharing\n    your alignment may be tamed, others may flee.\n  uncursed\n    No effect.\n    \"Your ancestors are annoyed with you!\"\n    \"The headstones in the cemetery begin to move!\"\n    \"Oh my!  Your name appears in the book!\"\n  cursed\n    You summon undead.\n\nTo complete the invocation, you must be standing on the vibrating square\nand have the non-cursed Candelabrum of Invocation with seven candles\nattached (the candles can be any type(s), and even cursed), the non-cursed\nBell of Opening with at least one charge, and the non-cursed Book of the\nDead.  The Candelabrum burns out twice as fast when on the vibrating\nsquare.  The Bell must be rung within 5 turns before the invocation.  The\nBook must be read last.  Sascha Wostmann described a good way to remember\nthe sequence:\n1. Make some light, to read by.\n2. Ring the bell, to get the attention of an audience.\n3. Finally, read the book.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks to Bruce Cox for proofreading the original version of this file.\nFurther corrections and clarifications provided by Kevin Buhr,\nPaul Collins, Andreas Dorn, Kieron Dunbar, Vladimir Florinski,\nDouglas Freyburger, David Goldfarb, David Grabiner, Kaidur Heliste, Ivan,\nPhilipp Lucas, ManaUser, pervect, Pat Rankin, Irina Rempt, Vasilisha,\nDavid Wescott, and Yoshi348.\n```\n\n*This page is based on a spoiler by [Dylan O'Donnell](https://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.spod-central.org/%257Epsmith/).

The COST field denotes the base\nprice of each item.  WGT specifies the weight (100 zorkmids weighs 1).\nThe existence of some items depends on options chosen when the program\nwas compiled; they are noted with an asterisk (*).\n\nTools comprise 8% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,\n0% in containers, 0% on the Rogue level, and 12% in hell.  PROB is\nthe relative probability of each subtype.  See below for more details\non item generation.\n\nIf the CHG field is not blank, then the tool can be charged by a scroll\nof charging or the Platinum Yendorian Express Card. The number shows the\nmaximum number of initial charges. An exclamation mark (!) indicates\nthat the tool can only be recharged once.\n\nFinally, some items have a different APPEARANCE until they are identified.\nNote that many tools share the same appearance with other types of tools.\n\n\nUsing containers\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nContainers are generated uncursed, with the CONTENTS described below. \nContainers will not be generated containing tools, weapons, armour or\nrocks. Containers in your initial inventory will be empty.  If the\ncontainer can be LOCKED, then there is an 80% chance that it will be\ngenerated locked and a different 10% chance that it will be trapped.  Not\nall containers FIT into other containers.  Some containers have special\nEFFECTS.  All of the containers except ice boxes can be eaten by\ngelatinous cubes; the contents will be engulfed but unharmed.\n  CONTAINER       CONTENTS      LOCKED  FIT  EFFECTS\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~  ~~~~~~~\n  sack            0-1 items     No      Yes  --\n  large box       0-3 items     Yes     No   --\n  chest           0-5 items     Yes     No   --\n  ice box         0-20 corpses  No      No   Suspends rotting of corpses.\n  bag of holding  0-1 items     No      Yes  May reduce weight.\n  bag of tricks   1-20 charges  No      Yes  Bites you / creates monsters.\n  oilskin sack    0-1 items     No      Yes  May prevent water damage.\n\nQuantum mechanics may carry a large box containing either a live or\ndead housecat named Schroedinger's Cat.  The state of the cat is not\ndetermined until the box is opened.  There is nothing special about\nthis cat; it is just a silly physics joke. \n\nThe weight of a bag of holding (wgt) -- including the 15 for the bag\nitself -- depends on the weight of its contents (cwgt) and its blessed\nstatus:\n  blessed:   wgt = 15 + cwgt/4 + 1\n  uncursed:  wgt = 15 + cwgt/2 + 1\n  cursed:    wgt = 15 + cwgt*2\n\nYou may also lose items when you use a cursed bag of holding; each item\nin the bag has a 1/13 chance of disappearing each time you apply or loot\nthe bag.\n\nPutting any of the following (and ONLY the following) items into any bag\nof holding will cause it to explode:\n  (another) bag of holding\n  bag of tricks (with non-zero charge)\n  wand of cancellation (with non-zero charge)\nIt is sometimes possible to put one of these items into nested sacks\nand/or oilskin sacks and then place them safely inside a bag of holding.\nThe chance of an explosion occurring then depends on the amount of\nnesting:\n  sacks:  0    1    2    3    4     5     6      7      8        n\n  odds:  1/1  2/2  3/4  4/8  5/16  6/32  7/64  8/128  9/128  (n+1)/128\n\nWhen a bag of tricks is #looted, it will bite you (1 to 10 hit points\ndamage) and become identified.  If you (a)pply it and it has charges\nleft, it will create one monster 22 out of 23 times, and create 2 to\n8 monsters 1 out of 23 times.  \"Nothing happens\" when you apply a bag\nwith zero charges. Bags of tricks are generated with 1 to 20 charges.\nIf the bag has more than 10 charges, a blessed scroll of charging will\nadd 6 to 10 charges, otherwise it will add 6 to 15 charges; an uncursed\nscroll will always add 1 to 5 charges.  Cannot be charged higher than 50\ncharges.\n\nWhen ungreased bags get wet, their contents may also get wet.  A\nnon-cursed oilskin sack will prevent this; if the oilskin sack is\ncursed, there is a 1/3 chance that the contents can get wet.  Boxes\nand chests are all waterproof.\n\nIf a container (other than a bag of holding) is kicked, thrown, or\ndropped from a height, fragile contents (glass items (other than\nworthless glass) and eggs) may be destroyed. Kicking a locked large\nbox or chest may also break it open (see below).\n\n\nUsing unlocking tools\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEach of the tools, wands, and spells listed below can be used for locking\nand unlocking doors, large boxes, and chests.  Not all methods can LOCK\nor UNLOCK.  DOOR and BOX represent the probability (in percent) of\nsucceeding each turn when attempting to unlock doors and large boxes or\nchests respectively; it may be based on your Dexterity and you will fail\nafter 50 turns.  ROGUEs may get an additional percentile bonus for using an\nimplement (the numbers before and after the slash being added to DOOR/BOX\nrespectively).  The per-turn probability of picking the lock is halved if\nyou use a cursed credit card, lock pick, or skeleton key.  All unlocking\ntools are generated uncursed.\n  TOOL             LOCK  UNLOCK  DOOR    BOX     ROGUE\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~\n  credit card      No     Yes    2*Dex   Dex     20/20\n  lock pick        Yes    Yes    3*Dex   4*Dex   30/25\n  skeleton key     Yes    Yes    70+Dex  75+Dex   0/0\n  wand/spell open  No     Yes    100     100      0/0\n  wand/spell lock  Yes    No     100     100      0/0\n\nUsing any of the first three types will exercise your dexterity, even if\nyou don't succeed.  Please note that a credit card has no special effects\nin shops, although you can unlock a shop \"Closed for inventory\" and you\ncan buy and sell it like any other item.  If a watchman or watch captain\nsees you pick a door with any tool, he may get upset; if he warns you\noff, a trap is automatically added to the door in question.\n\nWands of opening and locking and the spells of knock and wizard lock\nalways work in one turn and can be performed from a distance.  Zapped\nopening will also unlock doors in the same turn, will lower drawbridges,\nand can remove a ball and chain (as will ringing the blessed Bell of\nOpening).  Zapped closing will close a door in the same turn (if there\nare no objects in the way; creating one if necessary) and will raise\ndrawbridges. \n\nYou can also attempt to break a lock on a large box or chest by #forcing\nit with a suitable weapon or kicking it open. This may EXERCISE your\ndexterity or strength, but may also destroy any WEAPON you use, the\nCONTAINER and/or some of the CONTENTS (possibly restricted to fragile\nones, namely glass items (other than worthless glass) and eggs):\n  METHOD        WEAPON  CONTAINER  CONTENTS  EXERCISE \n  ~~~~~~        ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~\n  Blunt weapon    No       Yes       Yes       STR\n  Edged weapon   Yes        No        No       DEX\n  Kicking         --        No      Fragile     No   \n\n\nUsing light sources\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nLight sources are generated to stay lit for the number of TURNS noted\nbelow.  They are GENERATED in the quantity and blessed state shown.\nCursed light sources will sometimes not light.\n  LIGHT SOURCE   TURNS        GENERATED\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~\n  tallow candle           200  1 to 7; 10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed\n  wax candle              400  1 to 7; 10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed\n  brass lantern  1000 to 1499  10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed\n  oil lamp       1000 to 1499  10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed\n  magic lamp       Infinite    25% blessed, 50% uncursed, 25% cursed\n  potion of oil           400  1/8 blessed, 3/4 uncursed, 1/8 cursed\n  Sunsword         Infinite    10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed\n\nCandles can also be applied to the Candelabrum of Invocation.  Brass\nlanterns and oil lamps can be refilled by a scroll of charging; a blessed\nscroll will refill them to 1500 turns, an uncursed scroll will add 750\nturns to a maximum of 1500. Oil lamps with 1000 or fewer turns left can\nalso be refilled with potions of oil, getting twice the remaining turns\nin the potion of oil. (Attempting to refill an oil lamp with a *lit*\npotion of oil, or while the lamp is lit, will cause an explosion dealing\n6 to 36 points of damage). No lamp can be filled beyond 1500 turns.\n\nThe artifact weapon Sunsword will act as a light source whenever wielded,\neither by you or by a monster.\n\nIf you wish for a magic lamp, you will instead get an ordinary oil lamp.\n\nMagic lamps never run out of power, and may summon a djinni and lead to\na wish when #rubbed.  Each time you rub the lamp, there is a 1/3 chance\nthat \"You see a puff of smoke\" and another 1/3 chance that \"Nothing\nhappens\"; in either case, just try again.\n\nThe remaining 1/3 of the time a djinni appears, the lamp is identified\nand turned into an oil lamp, and one of five outcomes can occur.  The\nrelative chance of these outcomes depends on whether the lamp was\nblessed, uncursed, or cursed:\n  BLESSED  UNCURSED  CURSED  OUTCOME\n  ~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~\n    80%       20%       5%   Grants one wish, then disappears.\n                             \"I am in your debt.  I will grant one wish!\"\n     5%       20%       5%   Remains as a pet.\n                             \"Thank you for freeing me!\"\n     5%       20%       5%   Remains as a peaceful monster.\n                             \"You freed me!\"\n     5%       20%       5%   Speaks, then vanishes.\n                             \"It is about time!\"\n     5%       20%      80%   Remains as a hostile monster.\n                             \"You disturbed me, fool!\"\nNOTE: There is no way to get a wish from the djinni other than the first\noutcome above.\n\nThere is a limit of 120 djinn per game.  Beyond this limit, they are\nextinct and no more can be created.\n\nUsing instruments\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAll instruments are generated uncursed.  In this section, \"nearby\" means\nwithin some distance from you that depends on your experience level.\nDepending on your system, configuration, and options, sounds may also be\nproduced on your system's speaker.\n\ntin whistle\n  Wakes nearby monsters and calls nearby pets.\n    \"You produce a high whistling sound.\"  (non-cursed)\n    \"You produce a shrill whistling sound.\"  (cursed)\n\nmagic whistle\n  non-cursed\n    Teleports pets next to you.\n      \"You produce a strange whistling sound.\"  (not hallucinating)\n      \"You produce a normal whistling sound.\"  (hallucinating)\n  cursed\n    50% chance of acting as non-cursed; otherwise, wakes nearby monsters\n    and calls nearby pets.\n      \"You produce a high-pitched humming noise.\"\n\nhorn of plenty\n  Created with 1 to 20 charges. If more than 10 charges, blessed scrolls of\n  charging add 6 to 10 charges, otherwise 6 to 15 charges. Uncursed\n  scrolls of charging add 1 to 5 charges. Cannot be charged higher than\n  50 charges.\n  No effect if no charges.\n  Creates some food (including royal jelly) or a potion of water, fruit\n  juice, booze, acid, sickness, or oil.\n  The blessed/uncursed/cursed state of the object produced is the same as\n  the horn.\n\nleather drum\n  Awakens and may scare nearby monsters. Abuses wisdom.\n    \"You beat a deafening row!\"\n\ndrum of earthquake\n  Created with 4 to 8 charges. Blessed scrolls of charging add 2 to 8\n  charges; uncursed scrolls 1 to 4 charges.  Drums cannot have more than\n  20 charges.\n  Creates several pits around you, and angers peaceful monsters in the\n  vicinity. Awakens and may scare all monsters on the level.\n    \"You produce a heavy, thunderous rolling! The entire dungeon is\n    shaking around you!\"\n\nbell\n  Doesn't work under water or when swallowed.\n  non-cursed\n    Wakes nearby monsters and calls nearby pets.\n  cursed\n    There is a 1/4 chance of summoning a nymph (with no inventory), if they\n    aren't already genocided or extinct. There is a further chance that the\n    bell breaks, and/or that you are paralyzed or the nymph is made fast.\n    Wakes nearby monsters and calls nearby pets.\n\nThe following instruments can be used to play notes to open the Castle\ndrawbridge. You will hear one \"gear turn\" for each correct note in the\nright position and one \"tumbler click\" for each correct note in the wrong\nposition. However, if you improvise, you will get the EFFECT shown; some\nmonsters may resist.  Charged instruments are created with 4 to 8 charges.\nBlessed scrolls of charging add 2 to 8 charges; uncursed scrolls 1 to 4\ncharges.  They can never have more than 20 charges.\n  INSTRUMENT          EFFECT\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~\n  bugle               Awaken and anger soldiers on level, abuse wisdom.\n  wooden flute        Make nearby snakes peaceful (if enough dexterity and\n                      experience), exercise dexterity.\n  magic flute         May put nearby monsters to sleep, exercise dexterity.\n  tooled horn         Awaken and may scare nearby monsters, abuse wisdom.\n  frost horn          Same as a wand of cold other than dealing 6 to 66\n                      base damage (plus 6 to 33 against fire resistant\n                      monsters).\n  fire horn           Same as a wand of fire other than dealing 6 to 66\n                      base damage (plus 6 to 33 against cold resistant\n                      monsters).\n  wooden harp (koto)  Make nearby nymphs peaceful (if enough dexterity and\n                      experience), exercise dexterity.\n  magic harp          May tame nearby monsters, exercise dexterity.\n\n\nUsing other tools\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nUnless noted, all items in this section are generated uncursed. Not all\nof them are actual tools; a few items of other object types can also be\na)pplied.\n\nbeartrap or land mine\n  If you successfully #untrap one of these traps, the trap becomes a tool.\n  You can pick up the tool and later re-arm the trap at your current\n  location by (a)pplying the tool.\n\nbullwhip\n  This weapon can also be applied to get yourself out of a pit, unwield\n  or steal another monster's weapon, hit a monster, whip your steed into a\n  gallop, or grab objects off the floor while levitating.\n\npick-axe\n  You can dig by (a)pplying a pick-axe or dwarvish mattock.  Specify &gt; to \n  dig downward (first makes a pit, then a hole), or a direction to dig\n  through rock, walls, or doors, or to smash up statues or boulders.\n\naxe or battle-axe\n  These weapons can also be applied to chop down doors or trees.\n\ncream pie\n  You can apply this food item to blind yourself for 1 to 25 (more) turns.\n\neucalyptus leaf\n  non-blessed\n    Acts like a tin whistle (see instruments, above).\n  blessed\n    Acts like a blessed magic whistle (see instruments, above). Each\n    use has a 1/49 chance of unblessing the leaf.\n\ngrappling hook\n  You can apply this tool to grab an object at a distance, hit a monster\n  (or, if small, drag it towards you), drag yourself in a direction, or\n  hit yourself for 10 to 19 points of damage. If you are at least skilled\n  in flail, you can attempt to choose between the first three options\n  (with a 50% chance of accuracy if skilled, 95% if expert); otherwise,\n  the effect will be randomly chosen. \n\nunicorn horn\n  non-cursed\n    Randomly fixes one or more of the following troubles: sickness,\n    blindness, hallucination, vomiting, confusion, stunning, and loss of\n    an attribute.  The approximate chances of fixing a certain number of\n    troubles are shown here:\n      # Troub:    0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7\n      blessed:  22.7%  22.7%  19.5%  15.4%  10.7%   5.7%   2.6%   0.8%\n     uncursed:  35.4%  35.4%  22.9%   6.3%    0      0      0      0\n  cursed\n    You get one of the following: illness, blindness, confusion,\n    stunning, hallucination, or a decremented attribute.\n  Unicorn horns don't fix stoning, sliming, strangulation, or wounded legs.\n  #dipping a unicorn horn in a potion of blindness, confusion, or\n  hallucination turns the potion into uncursed water.  Dipping it in\n  a potion of sickness produces non-blessed fruit juice.\n  Unicorn horns also make a fairly good weapon.  They are two-handed.\n\nexpensive camera\n  Generated with 30 to 99 charges. An uncursed scroll of charging will\n  add 10 to 20 charges, and then bring the camera to a minimum of 50\n  charges. A blessed scroll of charging will add 15 to 30 charges,\n  and then bring the camera to a minimum of 50 charges (75 if between\n  51 and 74). A camera may never have more than 127 charges.\n  You can get several humorous messages by applying it in certain\n  situations.\n  A cursed camera has a 50% chance of blinding you when applied.\n  Otherwise, you can blind monsters.\n\nmirror\n  Cursed mirrors only work half of the time.\n  You can get several humorous messages by applying it in certain\n  situations (especially hallucinating; try underwater or at yourself\n  while polymorphed into a floating eye).\n  You can use a mirror to make a monster's gaze attacks work against\n  itself (if the monster isn't cancelled):\n    vampire or ghost   No reflection\n    Medusa             Turns to stone\n    floating eye       Paralyzed, if it is not invisible\n    umber hulk         Confused\n    nymph or succubus  Steals the mirror, if she is not invisible\n  Otherwise, you have a 4 out of 5 chance of scaring the monster\n  in that direction for 2 to 8 turns.  The monster cannot be a\n  unicorn or humanoid, must have eyes and be unblind, and must be able\n  to see invisible if it is invisible.\n  Breaking any mirror (except by kicking a container) carries a -2 penalty\n  to luck.\n\ncrystal ball\n  Generated 1/4 blessed, 1/2 uncursed, 1/4 cursed.\n  Generated with 1 to 5 charges. (If your Quest Artifact is a crystal ball,\n  it is always generated with 5 charges.) Blessed scrolls of charging set\n  the ball to 6 charges. Uncursed scrolls of charging add one charge, to a\n  maximum of 5.\n  Applying a crystal ball will cause you to be immobile (in a trance) for 1\n  to 10 turns.\n  There are several humorous messages if used when hallucinating.\n  non-cursed\n    You may look for an object, monster or symbol (including traps and\n    portals, ^, but not stairs or other dungeon features).  There is an\n    (intelligence in 20) chance of success; otherwise, you suffer the same\n    effects as a cursed crystal ball.\n  cursed\n    One of the following happens: nothing, you are confused, you are\n    blinded, you hallucinate, or the ball explodes (not if an artifact).\n\nlenses\n  These protect you from being blinded by ravens, spat venom or thrown\n  cream pies. They increase the effectiveness of searching, and reduce\n  the failure rate and time taken to learn spells from spellbooks.\n\nblindfold\n  You can controllably blind yourself by (a)pplying it or (P)utting\n  it on.  A cursed blindfold cannot be removed by yourself.\n\ntowel\n  You can controllably blind yourself (like a blindfold) by (P)utting\n  it on.  A cursed towel cannot be removed by yourself.\n  When (a)pplied, a towel can clean greasy hands (e.g., from a tin of\n  greasy food) or clean a cream pie off your face.  A cursed towel has\n  a 1/3 chance of causing each of these problems, or else it works\n  normally.\n  If you (E)ngrave with a towel, you can rub out writing in the dust.\n\nsaddle\n  You can (a)pply it to a monster (equines, quadrupeds, dragons,\n  jabberwocks, ki-rin or couatls) in order to be able to ride it in\n  future. Chance of successfully saddling depends on dexterity,\n  charisma, tameness of monster and riding skill; Knights receive a\n  bonus, as does wearing riding boots or gloves.\n\nleash\n  You can (a)pply it to a tame monster to keep it nearby.\n  Once you have leashed a monster, you can release it by re-(a)pplying the\n  leash.  A cursed leash can't be removed by yourself, and moving too far\n  from your pet may cause it to be choked and take damage.\n\nstethoscope\n  A stethoscope can be (a)pplied once each turn without taking any time.\n  If you use it more than that, each application takes one turn.\n  You can get several humorous messages by applying it in certain\n  situations.\n  A cursed stethoscope has a 50% chance of only hearing your own\n  heartbeat.\n  Otherwise, you can use it to find the status of adjacent monsters or\n  of yourself or your steed (though this latter use may be interfered with\n  if engulfed by a monster), and find secret doors and passages.\n\ntinning kit\n  Created with 30 to 99 charges. An uncursed scroll of charging will\n  add 10 to 20 charges, and then bring the kit to a minimum of 50 charges.\n  A blessed scroll of charging will add 15 to 30 charges, and then bring\n  the kit to a minimum of 50 charges (75 if between 51 and 74). A tinning\n  kit may never have more than 127 charges.\n  You can convert corpses into tins.  The corpse must be uneaten and\n  have non-zero nutrition.  The resulting tin is blessed/uncursed/cursed\n  the same way as the tinning kit that produced it.  Blessed tins are\n  not poisonous or rotten, and can be opened in one turn.  Cursed tins\n  always contain rotten food.  Tins have the same chance of giving an\n  intrinsic as the equivalent corpse; the blessed/cursed status of the\n  tin does NOT affect the chance.\n  Some people tin unique monsters as souvenirs.  You cannot tin the\n  endgame Riders.\n\ntin opener\n  Mostly useless.  Wield the tin opener and you can e)at a tin in one\n  turn.\n\ncan of grease\n  Generated 5% blessed, 90% uncursed, 5% cursed.\n  Created with 1 to 25 charges. If more than 10 charges, blessed\n  scrolls of charging add 6 to 10 charges, otherwise 6 to 15 charges.\n  Uncursed scrolls of charging add 1 to 5 charges.  Cannot be charged\n  higher than 50 charges.\n  When a)pplying a can of grease, you have a 50% chance of dropping it\n  if it is cursed or you have fumbling.  Otherwise, you can grease an\n  item to prevent it from rusting or corroding. If the can of grease is\n  cursed or you specify no object, you get your fingers greasy.\n  Greased outer body armour will protect against grabbing attacks,\n  and greased helmets will protect against (master) mind flayer's\n  tentacles; however, the grease has a 50% chance of wearing off after\n  each attack against which it protects, and grease on cursed armour\n  will only be effective 1/3 of the time.\n  You can also use the can of grease or a potion of oil to #untrap a\n  squeaky board.\n\nfigurine\n  Generated 1/8 blessed, 3/4 uncursed, and 1/8 cursed.\n  Applying a figurine creates that monster in an adjacent square of your\n  choosing.  It will fail if the square is occupied, or if the species is\n  genocided.  The chance of a tame or peaceful monster depends on the\n  blessed state of the figurine:\n              blessed  uncursed  cursed\n    tame        80%      10%      10%\n    peaceful    10%      80%      10%\n    hostile     10%      10%      80%\n  Cursed figurines can spontaneously transform when carried, after\n  201 to 9200 turns in inventory.\n\nmagic marker\n  Generated with 30 to 99 charges.  Can only be recharged once.\n  An uncursed scroll of charging will add 10 to 20 charges, and then bring\n  the marker to a minimum of 50 charges. A blessed scroll of charging will\n  add 15 to 30 charges, and then bring the marker to a minimum of 50\n  charges (75 if between 51 and 74).\n  You can write scrolls and spellbooks from blank ones.  See the spoilers\n  \"scrl-343.txt\" and \"spl1-343.txt\" for details.  The blessed/uncursed/\n  cursed status of the resulting item depends on the marker and\n  scroll/spellbook:\n              blessed   uncursed  cursed\n    blessed   blessed   blessed   uncursed\n    uncursed  blessed   uncursed  cursed\n    cursed    uncursed  cursed    cursed\n  You can also (E)ngrave graffiti on the floor with a magic marker.\n\n\nInvocation items\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe three unique invocation items (Bell, Book, and Candelabrum) cannot be\nplaced in a container or destroyed in any way.  They have special effects\nwhen (a)pplied or #invoked and you are NOT on the vibrating square:\n\nBell of Opening\n  Obtained from your Quest Nemesis. Created with 3 charges. Blessed\n  scrolls of charging add 1 to 3 charges, uncursed scrolls of charging add\n  1 charge. Cannot be charged higher than 5 charges.\n  uncharged\n    Acts like a regular bell.  Will not break.\n  blessed\n    If you are swallowed, you are expelled.\n      \"&lt;monster&gt; opens its mouth!\" (if animal)\n    Else you unlock and open nearby containers and doors, find nearby\n    secret passages and non-statue traps, open nearby drawbridges, and\n    are unpunished.  Items must be in your visual range.\n  uncursed\n    If you are swallowed, you are expelled.\n      \"&lt;monster&gt; opens its mouth!\" (if animal)\n    Else same effect as a wand of secret door detection -- you find\n    nearby secret doors, secret passages, non-statue traps, mimics,\n    and hiding and invisible monsters.\n  cursed\n    If you are swallowed, \"Nothing happens.\"\n    Else you summon undead and wake nearby monsters.\n\nCandelabrum of Invocation\n  Obtained from Vlad the Impaler.\n  blessed or uncursed\n    The Candelabrum acts like an ordinary light source if at least one\n    candle is applied to it.  It will last as many turns as the first\n    candle that was applied would have burned.\n  cursed\n    The Candelabrum won't light.\n\nBook of the Dead\n  Obtained from the Wizard of Yendor.\n  blessed\n    Undead creatures in your sight are made peaceful; nearby ones sharing\n    your alignment may be tamed, others may flee.\n  uncursed\n    No effect.\n    \"Your ancestors are annoyed with you!\"\n    \"The headstones in the cemetery begin to move!\"\n    \"Oh my!  Your name appears in the book!\"\n  cursed\n    You summon undead.\n\nTo complete the invocation, you must be standing on the vibrating square\nand have the non-cursed Candelabrum of Invocation with seven candles\nattached (the candles can be any type(s), and even cursed), the non-cursed\nBell of Opening with at least one charge, and the non-cursed Book of the\nDead.  The Candelabrum burns out twice as fast when on the vibrating\nsquare.  The Bell must be rung within 5 turns before the invocation.  The\nBook must be read last.  Sascha Wostmann described a good way to remember\nthe sequence:\n1. Make some light, to read by.\n2. Ring the bell, to get the attention of an audience.\n3. Finally, read the book.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks to Bruce Cox for proofreading the original version of this file.\nFurther corrections and clarifications provided by Kevin Buhr,\nPaul Collins, Andreas Dorn, Kieron Dunbar, Vladimir Florinski,\nDouglas Freyburger, David Goldfarb, David Grabiner, Kaidur Heliste, Ivan,\nPhilipp Lucas, ManaUser, pervect, Pat Rankin, Irina Rempt, Vasilisha,\nDavid Wescott, and Yoshi348.\n</pre>\n<div class=\"license_dod\">\n<p><i>This page is based on a spoiler by <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.spod-central.org/%257Epsmith/\">Dylan O'Donnell</a>.

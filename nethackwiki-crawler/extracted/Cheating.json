Additionally, the [Rogue](/wiki/Rogue \"Rogue\") starts the game with a [sack](/wiki/Sack \"Sack\") that can be used for credit cloning, and is essentially the \"thief\" role of the game.\n\n## Dubious actions\n\nThe legitimacy of these actions, on the other hand, is somewhat more unclear and subject to discussion, and even some controversy. While most people would not refer to these as \"cheating\", some of these would be considered poor form at worst depending on who you ask.\n\n### Farming\n\nWhile [farming](/wiki/Farming \"Farming\") is considered by some to be against the spirit of *NetHack*, there are few rules or protections and nothing in the game explicitly disallowing farming in general, so other people consider farming a legitimate strategy. Even at its most extreme, however, farming does not *fully* guarantee victory, and excessive farming can potentially prove counterproductive with the tedium outweighing the benefits. In addition, the DevTeam has taken steps to curtail more genuinely game-breaking methods of farming.\n\nFor specifics on certain types of farming, visit the following pages:\n\n- [Altar scumming](/wiki/Altar_scumming \"Altar scumming\")\n- [Death farming](/wiki/Death_farming \"Death farming\")\n- [Kraken farming](/wiki/Kraken_farming \"Kraken farming\")\n- [Polypiling](/wiki/Polypiling \"Polypiling\") (considered \"farming\" when taken to significant enough measures)\n- [Pudding farming](/wiki/Pudding_farming \"Pudding farming\")\n- [Start scumming](/wiki/Start_scumming \"Start scumming\")\n\n### Reading spoilers\n\nNetHack is a difficult game by design, and knowing how to bypass every single problem presented is considered to be against the spirit of the game. However, even for the most spoiled players, applying that knowledge is still a significant matter of skill - reading about something is far different from experiencing it first-hand, and not all of that knowledge will be applicable or even required during a given ascension attempt. Explore mode is intended to allow newer players to experience the game without having to constantly fear character death; other people also consider spoilers to be a kind of \"missing manual\", and many players choose to spoil themselves voluntarily.\n\nThe community does *not* consider spoilers to be an \"ethical\" problem by and large - but as with other communities, common courtesy and good public forum etiquette dictate that warning others ahead of time to prevent inadvertent spoiling is ideal when discussing aspects of the game.\n\n### Out-of-game notes\n\nMany players take minor notes, such as which levels have altars or shops, where their stashes are, and the like; some other players believe too many out-of-game notes constitutes a mild form of cheating, as it renders [amnesia](/wiki/Amnesia \"Amnesia\") ineffective. On top of many methods for extensive note-taking existing within the game already, such as [engraving](/wiki/Engraving \"Engraving\") and the ability to [call](/wiki/Call \"Call\") and [name](/wiki/Name \"Name\") objects, the [NetHack 3.6.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.6.0 \"NetHack 3.6.0\") series grants players the ability to [annotate](/wiki/Annotate \"Annotate\") the current level. This, along with the potential length of an average *NetHack* game and the amount of information needed to navigate effectively, seems to have mostly quelled the debate on this matter.\n\n### Metagaming\n\nAs many servers create and post dumpfiles upon a game's end, players can use **metagaming** to gain an advantage, most often by looking up the inventory of killed characters through their dumplogs and matching them to a [bones](/wiki/Bones \"Bones\") file encountered in-game. While this allows the player to easily gain knowledge they would not have by skipping item sorting and identification, most of the skill involved is not completely removed from the equation - that player still has to contend with the previous character's killer, as well as hostile monsters potentially grabbing their leftover items and using them against the player. In addition, much of the appropriated inventory will be cursed, requiring that player to uncurse those items to get the desired use out of them.\n\n## Probably cheating\n\nThe following actions are more commonly considered to be poor form and even cheating to a degree:\n\n- Exploiting a [bug](/wiki/Software_bug \"Software bug\") - this is distinct from discovering a bug that would potentially benefit you or another player\n- Changing the system clock to obtain a more advantageous [moon phase](/wiki/Moon_phase \"Moon phase\")\n- Bones stuffing\n\n### Bones stuffing\n\nBones stuffing consists of playing a game to gather useful items (up to and including a full [ascension kit](/wiki/Ascension_kit \"Ascension kit\")) and then deliberately killing that character to leave a bones pile for another player to exploit. In more extreme cases, the identities of [randomized](/wiki/Randomized_appearance \"Randomized appearance\") items are [engraved](/wiki/Engrave \"Engrave\") on the floor to aid future players. Bones stuffing is not considered exploitation and, technically speaking, is within the rules of the game; however, most regard it as violating the spirit of the game (e.g., a [pacifist](/wiki/Pacifist \"Pacifist\") character who ascends using a \"bones-stuffed\" ascension kit would not generally be considered a legitimate ascension). An exception would be something that explicitly sets out to use prepared bones beforehand, like a [speed ascension](/wiki/Speed_ascension \"Speed ascension\").\n\nBones stuffing on a multi-user system (e.g. a server) is less likely to succeed, as it is possible that another player will get the benefit of your bones pile. In addition, some servers such as [NAO](/wiki/NAO \"NAO\") make use of bones \"pools\" to reduce the effectiveness of stuffing, as well as deter people from using bones to intentionally create difficult situations for other players.\n\nIt is important to remember that encountering and making use of bones piles is a legitimate action by itself, even those containing full ascension kits - the difference is the deliberation inherent in bones stuffing, as opposed to more \"normal\" bones piles resulting from an 'honest' (albeit failed) attempt to survive. For those who do not want a lucky bones file to interfere with the challenge, or simply prefer not to use bones in general, they can set [the corresponding option](/wiki/Options#bones \"Options\") to false in their rcfile.\n\n## Definitely cheating\n\nNone of the methods of cheating described below are intended to be possible on a multi-user system. The file permissions will prevent you from fiddling with the game files, and you will not be allowed to play in wizard mode. Abusing the random number generator, however, may be possible if it has not been specifically [patched](/wiki/Patch \"Patch\").\n\n### Save scumming\n\n[Save scumming](/wiki/Save_scumming \"Save scumming\") is the practice of copying a NetHack save file from the [NetHack playground](/wiki/Playground \"Playground\"), so that if the character dies or suffers a calamity, the game can be restored by copying the file back into the playground. This directly bypasses a major design decision of the game—to disallow saving-and-restoring. However, it can also be used as an aid to learn how to play initially, although [explore mode](/wiki/Explore_mode \"Explore mode\") may be a much better option. In addition, backing up saves may be required to safeguard against sudden crashes on some systems.\n\n### Quit scumming\n\nSome players believe that the object identification game is the heart of NetHack, which makes it all the more remarkable that an unscrupulous player can completely short-circuit this aspect of the game through a technique derived from save scumming. Simply save your game, make a backup copy of your save file, and restart. Then [quit](/wiki/Quit \"Quit\") the game, and you can have all of your possessions identified. Restore your backup, and you've completely eliminated one of the deepest elements of NetHack.\n\n### Resetting individual levels\n\nYou can revert an individual dungeon level to a previous state using the following technique:\n\n- While playing, locate the directory containing your save files.\n- Look for a file named \"\\[user name]-\\[player name].\\[dungeon level]\".\n- Copy that file into a different directory.\n- When you want to revert the level, delete the original file and replace it with the copy. The level will be in the same state it was when you copied it.\n\nIn this way, you can duplicate money, items, pets, and monsters.\n\nYou *must not save and restore* between copying out and copying in. If you do, the process ID in the level file will not match the ID of the current process. The game will detect the manipulation (the level file might even belong to a different game) and declare a [trickery](/wiki/Trickery \"Trickery\").\n\n### Selectively deleting bones\n\nIt is possible to delete bones files. If you do this selectively, deleting only the ones that you think will kill you again, this is cheating. If you always delete all bones files including ones you would be glad to find, this is not cheating, as it is the equivalent of playing every game on a fresh install.\n\nNetHack has a limited ability to detect cheating done by fiddling with the game files. If it finds something suspicious, a [death](/wiki/Death_\\(character\\) \"Death (character)\") by [trickery](/wiki/Trickery \"Trickery\") is likely.\n\n### Wizard mode bones\n\nShould a wizard mode character die, and remain dead (as the player is given a possibility to resurrect him/her), the player can choose to leave a [bones](/wiki/Bones \"Bones\") file of them for others to find, including characters not in wizard mode. Thus, a wizard mode player can wish for practically every item in the game, drop the items to the ground, and commit suicide in order for another character (usually them) to find the bones file left by the character. Of note is that the [invocation artifacts](/wiki/Invocation_artifacts \"Invocation artifacts\") and the current class's [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\") will be replaced with normal items of the same type, and the [Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor \"Amulet of Yendor\") will be replaced with a [cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/Cheap_plastic_imitation_of_the_Amulet_of_Yendor \"Cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor\").\n\n### Abusing the random number generator\n\nA sufficiently determined player can find the seed of the [random number generator](/wiki/Random_number_generator \"Random number generator\") after starting the game and then use it to their advantage, e.g. to gain an unlimited number of [wishes](/wiki/Wish \"Wish\") from a [fountain](/wiki/Fountain \"Fountain\"). While this has been demonstrated as possible, it is ultimately a proof-of-concept and generally unlikely to see much actual use.[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1)[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2)\n\n### Hangup saves\n\nDeliberately provoking a [hangup](/wiki/Hangup \"Hangup\") save can be used to \"awake\" on a [sleeping gas trap](/wiki/Sleeping_gas_trap \"Sleeping gas trap\"), to escape [holes](/wiki/Hole \"Hole\") you [dig](/wiki/Dig \"Dig\"), to avoid dropping [scrolls of scare monster](/wiki/Scrolls_of_scare_monster \"Scrolls of scare monster\") or inserting a [wand of cancellation](/wiki/Wand_of_cancellation \"Wand of cancellation\") into a [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\") when you realize you accidentally selected your entire inventory, or to obtain a [price quote](/wiki/Price_identification \"Price identification\") for objects a [shopkeeper](/wiki/Shopkeeper \"Shopkeeper\") would not normally sell.\n\n## References\n\n1.

In addition, much of the appropriated inventory will be cursed, requiring that player to uncurse those items to get the desired use out of them.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Probably_cheating\">Probably cheating</span></h2>\n<p>The following actions are more commonly considered to be poor form and even cheating to a degree:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Exploiting a <a href=\"/wiki/Software_bug\" title=\"Software bug\">bug</a> - this is distinct from discovering a bug that would potentially benefit you or another player</li>\n<li>Changing the system clock to obtain a more advantageous <a href=\"/wiki/Moon_phase\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Moon phase\">moon phase</a></li>\n<li>Bones stuffing</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bones_stuffing\">Bones stuffing</span></h3>\n<p>Bones stuffing consists of playing a game to gather useful items (up to and including a full <a href=\"/wiki/Ascension_kit\" title=\"Ascension kit\">ascension kit</a>) and then deliberately killing that character to leave a bones pile for another player to exploit. In more extreme cases, the identities of <a href=\"/wiki/Randomized_appearance\" title=\"Randomized appearance\">randomized</a> items are <a href=\"/wiki/Engrave\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Engrave\">engraved</a> on the floor to aid future players. Bones stuffing is not considered exploitation and, technically speaking, is within the rules of the game; however, most regard it as violating the spirit of the game (e.g., a <a href=\"/wiki/Pacifist\" title=\"Pacifist\">pacifist</a> character who ascends using a \"bones-stuffed\" ascension kit would not generally be considered a legitimate ascension). An exception would be something that explicitly sets out to use prepared bones beforehand, like a <a href=\"/wiki/Speed_ascension\" title=\"Speed ascension\">speed ascension</a>.\n</p><p>Bones stuffing on a multi-user system (e.g. a server) is less likely to succeed, as it is possible that another player will get the benefit of your bones pile. In addition, some servers such as <a href=\"/wiki/NAO\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"NAO\">NAO</a> make use of bones \"pools\" to reduce the effectiveness of stuffing, as well as deter people from using bones to intentionally create difficult situations for other players.\n</p><p>It is important to remember that encountering and making use of bones piles is a legitimate action by itself, even those containing full ascension kits - the difference is the deliberation inherent in bones stuffing, as opposed to more \"normal\" bones piles resulting from an 'honest' (albeit failed) attempt to survive. For those who do not want a lucky bones file to interfere with the challenge, or simply prefer not to use bones in general, they can set <a href=\"/wiki/Options#bones\" title=\"Options\">the corresponding option</a> to false in their rcfile.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Definitely_cheating\">Definitely cheating</span></h2>\n<p>None of the methods of cheating described below are intended to be possible on a multi-user system. The file permissions will prevent you from fiddling with the game files, and you will not be allowed to play in wizard mode. Abusing the random number generator, however, may be possible if it has not been specifically <a href=\"/wiki/Patch\" title=\"Patch\">patched</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Save_scumming\">Save scumming</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Save_scumming\" title=\"Save scumming\">Save scumming</a> is the practice of copying a NetHack save file from the <a href=\"/wiki/Playground\" title=\"Playground\">NetHack playground</a>, so that if the character dies or suffers a calamity, the game can be restored by copying the file back into the playground. This directly bypasses a major design decision of the game&#8212;to disallow saving-and-restoring. However, it can also be used as an aid to learn how to play initially, although <a href=\"/wiki/Explore_mode\" title=\"Explore mode\">explore mode</a> may be a much better option. In addition, backing up saves may be required to safeguard against sudden crashes on some systems.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Quit_scumming\">Quit scumming</span></h3>\n<p>Some players believe that the object identification game is the heart of NetHack, which makes it all the more remarkable that an unscrupulous player can completely short-circuit this aspect of the game through a technique derived from save scumming. Simply save your game, make a backup copy of your save file, and restart. Then <a href=\"/wiki/Quit\" title=\"Quit\">quit</a> the game, and you can have all of your possessions identified. Restore your backup, and you've completely eliminated one of the deepest elements of NetHack. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Resetting_individual_levels\">Resetting individual levels</span></h3>\n<p>You can revert an individual dungeon level to a previous state using the following technique:\n</p>\n<ul><li>While playing, locate the directory containing your save files.</li>\n<li>Look for a file named \"[user name]-[player name].[dungeon level]\".</li>\n<li>Copy that file into a different directory.</li>\n<li>When you want to revert the level, delete the original file and replace it with the copy. The level will be in the same state it was when you copied it.</li></ul>\n<p>In this way, you can duplicate money, items, pets, and monsters.\n</p><p>You <i>must not save and restore</i> between copying out and copying in.  If you do, the process ID in the level file will not match the ID of the current process.  The game will detect the manipulation (the level file might even belong to a different game) and declare a <a href=\"/wiki/Trickery\" title=\"Trickery\">trickery</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Selectively_deleting_bones\">Selectively deleting bones</span></h3>\n<p>It is possible to delete bones files. If you do this selectively, deleting only the ones that you think will kill you again, this is cheating. If you always delete all bones files including ones you would be glad to find, this is not cheating, as it is the equivalent of playing every game on a fresh install.\n</p><p>NetHack has a limited ability to detect cheating done by fiddling with the game files. If it finds something suspicious, a <a href=\"/wiki/Death_(character)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Death (character)\">death</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Trickery\" title=\"Trickery\">trickery</a> is likely.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wizard_mode_bones\">Wizard mode bones</span></h3>\n<p>Should a wizard mode character die, and remain dead (as the player is given a possibility to resurrect him/her), the player can choose to leave a <a href=\"/wiki/Bones\" title=\"Bones\">bones</a> file of them for others to find, including characters not in wizard mode. Thus, a wizard mode player can wish for practically every item in the game, drop the items to the ground, and commit suicide in order for another character (usually them) to find the bones file left by the character. Of note is that the <a href=\"/wiki/Invocation_artifacts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Invocation artifacts\">invocation artifacts</a> and the current class's <a href=\"/wiki/Quest_artifact\" title=\"Quest artifact\">quest artifact</a> will be replaced with normal items of the same type, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor\" title=\"Amulet of Yendor\">Amulet of Yendor</a> will be replaced with a <a href=\"/wiki/Cheap_plastic_imitation_of_the_Amulet_of_Yendor\" title=\"Cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor\">cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Abusing_the_random_number_generator\">Abusing the random number generator</span></h3>\n<p>A sufficiently determined player can find the seed of the <a href=\"/wiki/Random_number_generator\" title=\"Random number generator\">random number generator</a> after starting the game and then use it to their advantage, e.g. to gain an unlimited number of <a href=\"/wiki/Wish\" title=\"Wish\">wishes</a> from a <a href=\"/wiki/Fountain\" title=\"Fountain\">fountain</a>. While this has been demonstrated as possible, it is ultimately a proof-of-concept and generally unlikely to see much actual use.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hangup_saves\">Hangup saves</span></h3>\n<p>Deliberately provoking a <a href=\"/wiki/Hangup\" title=\"Hangup\">hangup</a> save can be used to \"awake\" on a <a href=\"/wiki/Sleeping_gas_trap\" title=\"Sleeping gas trap\">sleeping gas trap</a>, to escape <a href=\"/wiki/Hole\" title=\"Hole\">holes</a> you <a href=\"/wiki/Dig\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dig\">dig</a>, to avoid dropping <a href=\"/wiki/Scrolls_of_scare_monster\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scrolls of scare monster\">scrolls of scare monster</a> or inserting a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_cancellation\" title=\"Wand of cancellation\">wand of cancellation</a> into a <a href=\"/wiki/Bag_of_holding\" title=\"Bag of holding\">bag of holding</a> when you realize you accidentally selected your entire inventory, or to obtain a <a href=\"/wiki/Price_identification\" title=\"Price identification\">price quote</a> for objects a <a href=\"/wiki/Shopkeeper\" title=\"Shopkeeper\">shopkeeper</a> would not normally sell.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://pellsson.github.io/\">https://pellsson.github.io/</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://redd.it/adbgzd\">https://redd.it/adbgzd</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<div style=\"display:none; right:10px; padding-bottom: 17px\" class=\"metadata topicon nopopups\"><div style=\"margin-top: -10px\"><a href=\"/wiki/NetHackWiki:Next_version\" title=\"This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.7.

The game will detect some more egregious forms of cheating and declare a [[trickery]], causing an unavoidable [[instant death]] and forfeiting the current game.\n\n==What is and isn't cheating==\nAs what falls under the curtain of \"cheating\" is a subjective matter, especially where it related to ''NetHack'', it may help to start with some \"obvious\" examples of what does ''not'' constitute cheating:\n\n* Using [[explore mode]] or [[wizard mode]], provided any resulting ascensions are not claimed as genuine.\n* Engraving [[Elbereth]], as this is a gameplay feature.\n* [[Price identification]], given that associating certain scrolls with their prices is effectively basic pattern recognition.\n* [[Credit cloning]]. Shopkeeper code is complex and carefully crafted, and the ability to dupe them using this method suggests that it was left in for crafty players to discover and utilize. Additionally, the [[Rogue]] starts the game with a [[sack]] that can be used for credit cloning, and is essentially the \"thief\" role of the game.\n\n==Dubious actions==\nThe legitimacy of these actions, on the other hand, is somewhat more unclear and subject to discussion, and even some controversy. While most people would not refer to these as \"cheating\", some of these would be considered poor form at worst depending on who you ask.\n\n===Farming===\nWhile [[farming]] is considered by some to be against the spirit of ''NetHack'', there are few rules or protections and nothing in the game explicitly disallowing farming in general, so other people consider farming a legitimate strategy. Even at its most extreme, however, farming does not ''fully'' guarantee victory, and excessive farming can potentially prove counterproductive with the tedium outweighing the benefits. In addition, the DevTeam has taken steps to curtail more genuinely game-breaking methods of farming.\n\nFor specifics on certain types of farming, visit the following pages:\n\n* [[Altar scumming]]\n* [[Death farming]]\n* [[Kraken farming]]\n* [[Polypiling]] (considered \"farming\" when taken to significant enough measures)\n* [[Pudding farming]]\n* [[Start scumming]]\n\n===Reading spoilers===\nNetHack is a difficult game by design, and knowing how to bypass every single problem presented is considered to be against the spirit of the game. However, even for the most spoiled players, applying that knowledge is still a significant matter of skill - reading about something is far different from experiencing it first-hand, and not all of that knowledge will be applicable or even required during a given ascension attempt. Explore mode is intended to allow newer players to experience the game without having to constantly fear character death; other people also consider spoilers to be a kind of \"missing manual\", and many players choose to spoil themselves voluntarily.\n\nThe community does ''not'' consider spoilers to be an \"ethical\" problem by and large - but as with other communities, common courtesy and good public forum etiquette dictate that warning others ahead of time to prevent inadvertent spoiling is ideal when discussing aspects of the game.\n\n===Out-of-game notes===\nMany players take minor notes, such as which levels have altars or shops, where their stashes are, and the like; some other players believe too many out-of-game notes constitutes a mild form of cheating, as it renders [[amnesia]] ineffective. On top of many methods for extensive note-taking existing within the game already, such as [[engraving]] and the ability to [[call]] and [[name]] objects, the [[NetHack 3.6.0]] series grants players the ability to [[annotate]] the current level. This, along with the potential length of an average ''NetHack'' game and the amount of information needed to navigate effectively, seems to have mostly quelled the debate on this matter.\n\n===Metagaming===\nAs many servers create and post dumpfiles upon a game's end, players can use '''metagaming''' to gain an advantage, most often by looking up the inventory of killed characters through their dumplogs and matching them to a [[bones]] file encountered in-game. While this allows the player to easily gain knowledge they would not have by skipping item sorting and identification, most of the skill involved is not completely removed from the equation - that player still has to contend with the previous character's killer, as well as hostile monsters potentially grabbing their leftover items and using them against the player. In addition, much of the appropriated inventory will be cursed, requiring that player to uncurse those items to get the desired use out of them.\n\n==Probably cheating==\nThe following actions are more commonly considered to be poor form and even cheating to a degree:\n \n* Exploiting a [[software bug|bug]] - this is distinct from discovering a bug that would potentially benefit you or another player\n* Changing the system clock to obtain a more advantageous [[moon phase]]\n* Bones stuffing\n\n===Bones stuffing===\nBones stuffing consists of playing a game to gather useful items (up to and including a full [[ascension kit]]) and then deliberately killing that character to leave a bones pile for another player to exploit. In more extreme cases, the identities of [[randomized appearance|randomized]] items are [[engrave]]d on the floor to aid future players. Bones stuffing is not considered exploitation and, technically speaking, is within the rules of the game; however, most regard it as violating the spirit of the game (e.g., a [[pacifist]] character who ascends using a \"bones-stuffed\" ascension kit would not generally be considered a legitimate ascension). An exception would be something that explicitly sets out to use prepared bones beforehand, like a [[speed ascension]].\n\nBones stuffing on a multi-user system (e.g. a server) is less likely to succeed, as it is possible that another player will get the benefit of your bones pile. In addition, some servers such as [[NAO]] make use of bones \"pools\" to reduce the effectiveness of stuffing, as well as deter people from using bones to intentionally create difficult situations for other players.\n\nIt is important to remember that encountering and making use of bones piles is a legitimate action by itself, even those containing full ascension kits - the difference is the deliberation inherent in bones stuffing, as opposed to more \"normal\" bones piles resulting from an 'honest' (albeit failed) attempt to survive. For those who do not want a lucky bones file to interfere with the challenge, or simply prefer not to use bones in general, they can set [[Options#bones|the corresponding option]] to false in their rcfile.\n\n==Definitely cheating==\nNone of the methods of cheating described below are intended to be possible on a multi-user system. The file permissions will prevent you from fiddling with the game files, and you will not be allowed to play in wizard mode. Abusing the random number generator, however, may be possible if it has not been specifically [[patch]]ed.\n\n===Save scumming===\n[[Save scumming]] is the practice of copying a NetHack save file from the [[Playground|NetHack playground]], so that if the character dies or suffers a calamity, the game can be restored by copying the file back into the playground. This directly bypasses a major design decision of the game&mdash;to disallow saving-and-restoring. However, it can also be used as an aid to learn how to play initially, although [[explore mode]] may be a much better option. In addition, backing up saves may be required to safeguard against sudden crashes on some systems.\n\n===Quit scumming===\nSome players believe that the object identification game is the heart of NetHack, which makes it all the more remarkable that an unscrupulous player can completely short-circuit this aspect of the game through a technique derived from save scumming. Simply save your game, make a backup copy of your save file, and restart. Then [[quit]] the game, and you can have all of your possessions identified. Restore your backup, and you've completely eliminated one of the deepest elements of NetHack. <!--(This method of cheating can be used even on a multiuser system by saving the game, then reloading the save in [[explore mode]], choosing to keep the original save, then quitting and continuing the original game outside explore mode. The [[DevTeam]] consider this to be a bug, and intend to patch it in the [[next version]].) What came of this, if anything?-->\n\n===Resetting individual levels===\nYou can revert an individual dungeon level to a previous state using the following technique:\n* While playing, locate the directory containing your save files.\n* Look for a file named \"[user name]-[player name].[dungeon level]\".\n* Copy that file into a different directory.\n* When you want to revert the level, delete the original file and replace it with the copy. The level will be in the same state it was when you copied it.\n\nIn this way, you can duplicate money, items, pets, and monsters.\n\nYou ''must not save and restore'' between copying out and copying in.  If you do, the process ID in the level file will not match the ID of the current process.  The game will detect the manipulation (the level file might even belong to a different game) and declare a [[trickery]].\n\n===Selectively deleting bones===\nIt is possible to delete bones files. If you do this selectively, deleting only the ones that you think will kill you again, this is cheating. If you always delete all bones files including ones you would be glad to find, this is not cheating, as it is the equivalent of playing every game on a fresh install.\n\nNetHack has a limited ability to detect cheating done by fiddling with the game files. If it finds something suspicious, a [[death (character)|death]] by [[trickery]] is likely.\n\n===Wizard mode bones===\nShould a wizard mode character die, and remain dead (as the player is given a possibility to resurrect him/her), the player can choose to leave a [[bones]] file of them for others to find, including characters not in wizard mode. Thus, a wizard mode player can wish for practically every item in the game, drop the items to the ground, and commit suicide in order for another character (usually them) to find the bones file left by the character. Of note is that the [[invocation artifacts]] and the current class's [[quest artifact]] will be replaced with normal items of the same type, and the [[Amulet of Yendor]] will be replaced with a [[cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor]].\n\n===Abusing the random number generator===\nA sufficiently determined player can find the seed of the [[random number generator]] after starting the game and then use it to their advantage, e.g. to gain an unlimited number of [[wish]]es from a [[fountain]]. While this has been demonstrated as possible, it is ultimately a proof-of-concept and generally unlikely to see much actual use.<ref>https://pellsson.github.io/</ref><ref>https://redd.it/adbgzd</ref>\n\n===Hangup saves===\nDeliberately provoking a [[hangup]] save can be used to \"awake\" on a [[sleeping gas trap]], to escape [[hole]]s you [[dig]], to avoid dropping [[scrolls of scare monster]] or inserting a [[wand of cancellation]] into a [[bag of holding]] when you realize you accidentally selected your entire inventory, or to obtain a [[price identification|price quote]] for objects a [[shopkeeper]] would not normally sell.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{nethack-367}}\n[[Category:Cheating]]"}

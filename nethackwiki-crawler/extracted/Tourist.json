{"title":"Tourist","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Tourist","type":"markdown","data":"The **Tourist** is one of the [roles](/wiki/Role \"Role\") in *[NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\")*. A Tourist has low starting [HP](/wiki/HP \"HP\") and poor equipment, so playing one is quite the [challenge](/wiki/Role_difficulty \"Role difficulty\") in the early levels, but they have the potential to become very powerful near the end of the game. Tourists always start as [neutral](/wiki/Neutral \"Neutral\") [humans](/wiki/Human_\\(starting_race\\) \"Human (starting race)\").\n\nThe Tourist is inspired by [Terry Pratchett](/wiki/Terry_Pratchett \"Terry Pratchett\")'s *[Discworld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld \"wikipedia:Discworld\")* books; Twoflower, the tourist from these books, appears as the [quest leader](/wiki/Quest_leader \"Quest leader\") for the Tourist role. A further influence is Diana Wynne Jones's *Tough Guide to Fantasyland*, a \"travel guide for the hapless fantasy tourist\" that spoofs sword-and-sorcery novels by reinterpreting them as carefully orchestrated guided tours, with the main protagonist as the \"tourist\".\n\nThe [guidebook](/wiki/Guidebook \"Guidebook\") has this to say about Tourists:\n\n```\nTourists start out with lots of gold (suitable for shopping with), a credit card, lots of food, some maps, and an expensive camera. Most monsters don't like being photographed.\n```\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Starting equipment](#Starting_equipment)\n\n- [2 Intrinsics](#Intrinsics)\n\n- [3 Skills](#Skills)\n\n- [4 Special rules](#Special_rules)\n\n- [5 Rank titles](#Rank_titles)\n\n- [6 Quest](#Quest)\n\n- [7 Strategy](#Strategy)\n\n  - [7.1 Character creation](#Character_creation)\n\n  - [7.2 Early game](#Early_game)\n\n    - [7.2.1 Objectives](#Objectives)\n    - [7.2.2 Weapons](#Weapons)\n    - [7.2.3 General](#General)\n\n  - [7.3 Midgame](#Midgame)\n\n    - [7.3.1 Objectives](#Objectives_2)\n    - [7.3.2 Weapons](#Weapons_2)\n    - [7.3.3 General](#General_2)\n\n  - [7.4 Late game](#Late_game)\n    - [7.4.1 Weapons](#Weapons_3)\n\n  - [7.5 General](#General_3)\n\n- [8 Variants](#Variants)\n\n  - [8.1 SLASH'EM](#SLASH.27EM)\n  - [8.2 SlashTHEM](#SlashTHEM)\n  - [8.3 SporkHack](#SporkHack)\n  - [8.4 UnNetHack](#UnNetHack)\n  - [8.5 FIQHack](#FIQHack)\n\n- [9 Encyclopedia entry](#Encyclopedia_entry)\n\n## Starting equipment\n\n- 1–1000 [gold](/wiki/Gold \"Gold\") pieces\n\n- 21–40 +2 [darts](/wiki/Dart \"Dart\")\n\n- a +0 [Hawaiian shirt](/wiki/Hawaiian_shirt \"Hawaiian shirt\")\n\n- 10–20 random items of [food](/wiki/Food \"Food\")\n\n- 4 [scrolls of magic mapping](/wiki/Scroll_of_magic_mapping \"Scroll of magic mapping\")\n\n- 2 [potions of extra healing](/wiki/Potion_of_extra_healing \"Potion of extra healing\")\n\n- an uncursed [expensive camera](/wiki/Expensive_camera \"Expensive camera\") with 30–99 charges\n\n- an uncursed [credit card](/wiki/Credit_card \"Credit card\")\n\n- 4% chance of a [tin opener](/wiki/Tin_opener \"Tin opener\"); otherwise:\n\n  - 4% chance of a [leash](/wiki/Leash \"Leash\") (3.84%); otherwise:\n  - 4% chance of a [towel](/wiki/Towel \"Towel\") (3.6864%); otherwise:\n  - 4% chance of an uncursed [magic marker](/wiki/Magic_marker \"Magic marker\") (3.538944%)\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")).

Despite not starting with a melee weapon, they start Unskilled in *Bare hands*, because only roles which can reach Master start with Basic skill in *Bare hands*, and Tourists can only reach Skilled.\n\nCompensating somewhat for their poor starting equipment, a Tourist can advance to Basic skill in every type of weapon except [clubs](/wiki/Club \"Club\"), making the role a \"jack of all trades\" that can make use of almost any weapon without restriction.\n\n## Special rules\n\n[Shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper \"Shopkeeper\") recognize Tourists below experience level 15 as suckers and charge them an extra 1⁄3 markup when buying and only offer 1⁄3 the base price of sold items. (The same problem will be experienced by other roles when wearing a visible [shirt](/wiki/Shirt \"Shirt\") or a [dunce cap](/wiki/Dunce_cap \"Dunce cap\").)\n\nTourists have a +1 *penalty* with [emergency spells](/wiki/Emergency_spell \"Emergency spell\").\n\nTourists don't receive the [multishot](/wiki/Multishot \"Multishot\") bonus for being Skilled at any weapon other than darts. They do receive the bonus for becoming Expert at daggers.\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nTourists are the only role capable of reading a [conical hat](/wiki/Conical_hat \"Conical hat\"). Only 1⁄3 of conical hats have any lettering, but those that do read either \"DUNCE\" or \"WIZZARD\", unambiguously identifying the hat.\n\n## Rank titles\n\nThe [status line](/wiki/Status_line \"Status line\") shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\n\n- XL 1–2: Rambler\n- XL 3–5: Sightseer\n- XL 6–9: Excursionist\n- XL 10–13: Peregrinator/Peregrinatrix\n- XL 14–17: Traveler\n- XL 18–21: Journeyer\n- XL 22–25: Voyager\n- XL 26–29: Explorer\n- XL 30: Adventurer\n\n## Quest\n\n- *Main article: [Tourist quest](/wiki/Tourist_quest \"Tourist quest\")*\n\nThe Tourist quest requires fighting the [Master of Thieves](/wiki/Master_of_Thieves \"Master of Thieves\") for [the Platinum Yendorian Express Card](/wiki/The_Platinum_Yendorian_Express_Card \"The Platinum Yendorian Express Card\").\n\n## Strategy\n\n### Character creation\n\nThe only choice available when generating a Tourist is their [gender](/wiki/Gender \"Gender\"), which is generally inconsequential outside of consorting with [foocubi](/wiki/Foocubi \"Foocubi\"): the Quest's goal level for Tourists contains four guaranteed incubi, but only two succubi. Players who want to raise their level and energy as high as possible for spellcasting purposes will probably want their Tourist to be female. A Tourist that finds an [amulet of change](/wiki/Amulet_of_change \"Amulet of change\") or a [ring of polymorph control](/wiki/Ring_of_polymorph_control \"Ring of polymorph control\") can use up the foocubi of one gender, then switch and start consorting with the other.\n\n### Early game\n\n#### Objectives\n\nTourists tend to start with comically low HP and strength, and no real [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\") to speak of. Thus, the early game must be played with extreme caution. Unlike most other roles, Tourists need to rely heavily on items that they find.\n\nIt is critical to find armor as soon as possible. Tourists should use their starting pet to [curse-test](/wiki/Curse-test \"Curse-test\") every weapon and piece of armor that they find. Non-cursed armor should be worn immediately, unless it [encumbers](/wiki/Encumbrance \"Encumbrance\") you. In the early game, the most common source of magical armor items is an armor shop, and Tourists typically start out with enough gold to buy most of the good items in the shop.\n\nHeading directly for [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") or [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\") is a valid strategy, but the monsters may get too difficult too quickly. A very cautious strategy is to wait somewhere around dungeon level 3 or so and kill easy monsters until you gain a few levels, then descend deeper.\n\n#### Weapons\n\nThe initial stock of 21–40 +2 darts should be viewed as a bridge to a better weapon. Each dart will, on average, last for 4 throws (given that each dart has a 1⁄4 chance of [breakage](/wiki/Missile#Breakage \"Missile\") per throw), which means that Tourists will get about 84–160 dart throws before the supply is exhausted. Once a better weapon is found, any remaining darts should be kept for use in attacking monsters from long range, preferably after [blessing](/wiki/BUC \"BUC\").\n\nAt low experience levels, it is difficult to hit anything with a weapon in which you are unskilled, since unskilled usage confers a −4 to-hit penalty. Hence, unless you find a high-damage weapon such as a [dwarvish mattock](/wiki/Dwarvish_mattock \"Dwarvish mattock\") or [two-handed sword](/wiki/Two-handed_sword \"Two-handed sword\"), you find a highly enchanted weapon, or you are facing weak monsters, it is much safer to kill things by throwing your darts in the very early game. Once you do find a weapon that you want to train, you can use it on non-threatening monsters (such as [lichens](/wiki/Lichen \"Lichen\"), [fog clouds](/wiki/Fog_cloud \"Fog cloud\"), and [grid bugs](/wiki/Grid_bug \"Grid bug\")) and save your darts for true challenges.\n\nBy the time you reach experience level 5 or thereabouts, you will often have found a better weapon (such as a [dwarvish mattock](/wiki/Dwarvish_mattock \"Dwarvish mattock\"), [two-handed sword](/wiki/Two-handed_sword \"Two-handed sword\"), [long sword](/wiki/Long_sword \"Long sword\"), [silver saber](/wiki/Silver_saber \"Silver saber\"), or [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\")), which you can start using in place of the darts since your experience level is now high enough to partly offset the unskilled to-hit penalty. Of course, your weapon will not *stay* unskilled for long; you should advance it to at least basic as quickly as possible.\n\n#### General\n\nTake off your shirt immediately - it grants no [AC](/wiki/AC \"AC\") or [magic cancellation](/wiki/Magic_cancellation \"Magic cancellation\"), and could be destroyed by a [polymorph trap](/wiki/Polymorph_trap \"Polymorph trap\") or [destroy armor](/wiki/Destroy_armor_\\(monster_spell\\) \"Destroy armor (monster spell)\") [monster spell](/wiki/Monster_spell \"Monster spell\"). Shirts are best enchanted when you have [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\") and other means to protect it from being destroyed.\n\nThe most useful starting item for a Tourist is the [expensive camera](/wiki/Expensive_camera \"Expensive camera\"): when [applied](/wiki/Applied \"Applied\"), the camera will [blind](/wiki/Blind \"Blind\") any monster in the path of the flash, and has a 3⁄4 chance of scaring monsters if used within two tiles. This is useful for fighting or escaping difficult monsters, since fleeing monsters often won't stop to attack you, and you gain an accuracy bonus against them. If you lack a [towel](/wiki/Towel \"Towel\") or [blindfold](/wiki/Blindfold \"Blindfold\"), you can also flash yourself for temporary blindness to use [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\") or avoid a [gaze attack](/wiki/Gaze_attack \"Gaze attack\"). Writing [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") in the dust can also scare monsters, and pets can help kill retreating foes - keep in mind that monsters blinded by your expensive camera will not respond to Elbereth!\n\nIn terms of other useful items, the credit card is useful for opening locked doors and chests without having to kick, bash, or pry them open, though a [lock pick](/wiki/Lock_pick \"Lock pick\") or [key](/wiki/Key \"Key\") is preferable if you can find one. The quantity of starting food also makes taming or pacifying domestic monsters trivial, and in particular can help you avoid fights against them since they are usually faster. The starting food can also last quite a while, making it less necessary to rely on corpses for nutrition.\n\nDespite the sucker markup on shop prices, the Tourist's high natural [charisma](/wiki/Charisma \"Charisma\") more than makes up for it and will often get them better prices than [Barbarians](/wiki/Barbarian \"Barbarian\") or [Rangers](/wiki/Ranger \"Ranger\") - be sure to account for the buying and selling modifiers when performing [price identification](/wiki/Price_identification \"Price identification\"). Their high charisma and above-average [intelligence](/wiki/Intelligence \"Intelligence\") also makes consorting with [foocubi](/wiki/Foocubi \"Foocubi\") less risky than for other early-game characters: foocubi can help them gain the last couple of levels to qualify for their Quest, which they'll want to complete as soon as possible for the PYEC and shop loot.\n\n### Midgame\n\n#### Objectives\n\nOnce you are able to bring your AC down below zero, and you obtain a better weapon than the starting darts, you have a reasonable chance at going after the [luckstone](/wiki/Luckstone \"Luckstone\") in [Mines' End](/wiki/Mines%27_End \"Mines' End\") and the prize at the end of [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\"). After that, continue down the dungeon until you find the portal to the quest.\n\nThe [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\") for the Tourist is [the Platinum Yendorian Express Card](/wiki/The_Platinum_Yendorian_Express_Card \"The Platinum Yendorian Express Card\"). This artifact is so useful that in most cases a Tourist should try to complete the [quest](/wiki/Tourist_quest \"Tourist quest\") as soon as possible. The most important intrinsic to have for the quest is [reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\"), because the quest's locate and goal levels contain several large rooms filled with soldiers armed with attack wands. The [Master of Thieves](/wiki/Master_of_Thieves \"Master of Thieves\"), the quest nemesis, is not particularly difficult compared to other quest nemeses, and any character capable of dispatching the soldiers should have no special trouble with him.\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nAs part of a general buff to quest leaders, the Master of Thieves has been made stronger, and thus his difficulty relative to other quest nemeses has increased.\n\nThe quest also contains a sizable amount of loot: between the many [shops](/wiki/Shop \"Shop\"), [barracks](/wiki/Barracks \"Barracks\") and [graveyard](/wiki/Graveyard \"Graveyard\") treasure, and items generated along with the [spiders](/wiki/Spider \"Spider\"), you will likely find an [ascension kit](/wiki/Ascension_kit \"Ascension kit\") item or two. Consider postponing sitting on the two [thrones](/wiki/Throne \"Throne\") until you loot the entire branch. Further, the lower levels have several guaranteed [captains](/wiki/Captain \"Captain\"), which have a good chance of carrying at least one [silver saber](/wiki/Silver_saber \"Silver saber\").\n\n#### Weapons\n\nIt's likely that you've found an altar at this stage, and can sacrifice for a good artifact weapon such as Mjollnir, Magicbane, [Fire Brand](/wiki/Fire_Brand \"Fire Brand\"), [Frost Brand](/wiki/Frost_Brand \"Frost Brand\"), or [Vorpal Blade](/wiki/Vorpal_Blade \"Vorpal Blade\"). Otherwise, you can enchant other good weapons like a long sword or silver saber that you may have found.\n\n#### General\n\nTourists should seek out the same types of [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\") that a warrior-type character such as a [Valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\") or [Barbarian](/wiki/Barbarian \"Barbarian\") would use. In most cases, it is not worth avoiding metal armor to improve spell casting rates, because Tourists suffer enormous spell casting penalties from even one peripheral piece of metal armor, and it is not practical to avoid metal armor entirely. Typical armor for a mid-game Tourist would be a [mithril-coat](/wiki/Mithril-coat \"Mithril-coat\"), [iron shoes](/wiki/Iron_shoes \"Iron shoes\"), a [dwarvish iron helm](/wiki/Dwarvish_iron_helm \"Dwarvish iron helm\") or [orcish helm](/wiki/Orcish_helm \"Orcish helm\"), and an [elven cloak](/wiki/Elven_cloak \"Elven cloak\") or [dwarvish cloak](/wiki/Dwarvish_cloak \"Dwarvish cloak\"), with perhaps one or two pieces of magical armor.\n\n### Late game\n\n#### Weapons\n\nIn the advanced stages of the game, a Tourist should have several [artifact weapons](/wiki/Artifact_weapon \"Artifact weapon\") available from which to choose. Because Tourists have almost no weapon restrictions to speak of, any decent artifact weapon is a good choice. However, if you have a choice, the following weapons are especially desirable and are worth pursuing if your character has the opportunity (e.g., via a [wish](/wiki/Wish \"Wish\")):\n\n- [Grayswandir](/wiki/Grayswandir \"Grayswandir\") – Tourists can advance [saber](/wiki/Saber \"Saber\") to Skilled. In most cases it must be obtained from a wish, since Tourists start out neutral. It can then be dual-wielded with another silver saber; this is the most powerful melee weapon combination for an endgame Tourist.\n- [Magicbane](/wiki/Magicbane \"Magicbane\") – Tourists can advance daggers to expert and can get this by [sacrificing](/wiki/Sacrifice \"Sacrifice\").\n- [Mjollnir](/wiki/Mjollnir \"Mjollnir\") – Unless the enemy is shock-resistant, this weapon inflicts the most damage out of all the aligned weapons that a Tourist can obtain by sacrificing.\n\nTourists can become skilled in [two-weapon combat](/wiki/Two-weapon_combat \"Two-weapon combat\"), but this only becomes useful late in the game, when good weapons are available. Using two weapons is preferred unless your character needs a shield for [reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\"). For ranged weapons, highly enchanted [darts](/wiki/Dart \"Dart\") or [daggers](/wiki/Dagger \"Dagger\") work well, since both are readily available and Tourists can get to Expert skill in both daggers and darts. Of the two, darts are preferable since Tourists suffer a [multishot](/wiki/Multishot \"Multishot\") penalty for all other weapons.\n\n### General\n\nWith regards to armor selection, a Tourist is no different from any other role and should follow the same guidelines as any other character in terms of assembling the various pieces of armor that form a typical [ascension kit](/wiki/Ascension_kit \"Ascension kit\"). One advantage you have over other roles is that you don't have to look for a shirt to complete your set.\n\nThe main function of the Platinum Yendorian Express Card is that it can be #[invoked](/wiki/Invoke \"Invoke\") to charge wands and tools like a [scroll of charging](/wiki/Scroll_of_charging \"Scroll of charging\"). Properly exploited, this function gives the Tourist the equivalent of a blessed scroll of charging every few hundred turns, a feat which is not possible with any other role. This makes the Tourist role one of the easiest to ascend once the quest has been completed.\n\nWands have an increased chance of exploding each time they are charged, so a post-quest Tourist will usually want to keep several of each type of wand on hand to maximize the number of recharging opportunities. For rare wands, such as [wands of death](/wiki/Wand_of_death \"Wand of death\"), a small number of such wands will last an entire game if properly managed. For common wands, such as [wands of digging](/wiki/Wand_of_digging \"Wand of digging\"), it is a good idea to maintain a rotating stock of such wands, discarding the ones which have been charged many times and replacing them with newer ones.\n\nThe Platinum Yendorian Express Card can also be used to charge [tools](/wiki/Tool \"Tool\"). This is especially useful because most tools, unlike wands, can be recharged infinitely many times. For example, a [horn of plenty](/wiki/Horn_of_plenty \"Horn of plenty\") combined with the Platinum Yendorian Express Card means that a Tourist can get by with carrying very little [food](/wiki/Food \"Food\"). A [bag of tricks](/wiki/Bag_of_tricks \"Bag of tricks\") can be used to [create monsters](/wiki/Create_monster \"Create monster\") indefinitely. Other useful chargeable tools include [brass lanterns](/wiki/Brass_lantern \"Brass lantern\"), [crystal balls](/wiki/Crystal_ball \"Crystal ball\"), [tinning kits](/wiki/Tinning_kit \"Tinning kit\"), [magic harps](/wiki/Magic_harp \"Magic harp\"), [magic flutes](/wiki/Magic_flute \"Magic flute\"), [fire horns](/wiki/Fire_horn \"Fire horn\"), [frost horns](/wiki/Frost_horn \"Frost horn\"), the [Bell of Opening](/wiki/Bell_of_Opening \"Bell of Opening\"), and even the [expensive camera](/wiki/Expensive_camera \"Expensive camera\") that comes in the initial inventory.\n\nCertain [rings](/wiki/Ring \"Ring\") can be charged with the Platinum Yendorian Express Card as well. You may want to wear a +6 or +7 [ring of increase damage](/wiki/Ring_of_increase_damage \"Ring of increase damage\") full time, especially for [two weapon combat](/wiki/Two_weapon_combat \"Two weapon combat\"). Since rings can explode when charged, a good strategy is keep two of the same type of ring, and charge the one with the lowest charge, so as to not risk destroying a highly charged ring.\n\nBecause the game will not display the number of charges and recharges on an unidentified item, finding a [spellbook of identify](/wiki/Spellbook_of_identify \"Spellbook of identify\") may be convenient for a Tourist.\n\n## Variants\n\n### SLASH'EM\n\nIn [SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\"), a Tourist may also be a [doppelganger](/wiki/Doppelganger_\\(starting_race\\) \"Doppelganger (starting race)\") or a [hobbit](/wiki/Hobbit_\\(starting_race\\) \"Hobbit (starting race)\").\n\n### SlashTHEM\n\nIn addition to SLASH'EM, they can be [incantifiers](/wiki/Incantifiers \"Incantifiers\").\n\n### SporkHack\n\n[SporkHack](/wiki/SporkHack \"SporkHack\") offers a wider selection of races for various roles. An orc Tourist is an interesting choice that starts with [potions of sickness](/wiki/Potion_of_sickness \"Potion of sickness\"); dipping the starting darts into one offers an instant kill attack from the second move.\n\n### UnNetHack\n\nIn [UnNetHack](/wiki/UnNetHack \"UnNetHack\"), items in shops are [automatically identified](/wiki/Auto-identify \"Auto-identify\") when playing as a Tourist, regardless of whether the player has seen them before or not. Similarly, selling unidentified items will automatically identify them. [Enchantments](/wiki/Enchantment \"Enchantment\") and [BUC](/wiki/BUC \"BUC\") status are not identified.\n\n### FIQHack\n\nIn [FIQHack](/wiki/FIQHack \"FIQHack\"), tourists ID shop items in the same manner as UnNetHack. Additionally, a Tourist may be a [gnome](/wiki/Gnome_\\(starting_race\\) \"Gnome (starting race)\"). Tourists start with all of their optional equipment. The [magic marker](/wiki/Magic_marker \"Magic marker\") that a tourist starts with is always 0:0.\n\n## Encyclopedia entry\n\nThe road from Ankh-Morpork to Chrim is high, white and winding, a thirty-league stretch of potholes and half-buried rocks that spirals around mountains and dips into cool green valleys of citrus trees, crosses liana-webbed gorges on creaking rope bridges and is generally more picturesque than useful.  \nPicturesque. That was a new word to Rincewind the wizard (BMgc, Unseen University \\[failed]). It was one of a number he had picked up since leaving the charred ruins of Ankh-Morpork. Quaint was another one. Picturesque meant -- he decided after careful observation of the scenery that inspired Twoflower to use the word -- that the landscape was horribly precipitous. Quaint, when used to describe the occasional village through which they passed, meant fever-ridden and tumbledown.  \nTwoflower was a tourist, the first ever seen on the discworld. Tourist, Rincewind had decided, meant \"idiot\".\n\n\\[ The Colour of Magic, by Terry Pratchett ]\n\n[![This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.0.

Players who want to raise their level and energy as high as possible for spellcasting purposes will probably want their Tourist to be female. A Tourist that finds an <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_change\" title=\"Amulet of change\">amulet of change</a> or a <a href=\"/wiki/Ring_of_polymorph_control\" title=\"Ring of polymorph control\">ring of polymorph control</a> can use up the foocubi of one gender, then switch and start consorting with the other.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_game\">Early game</span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives\">Objectives</span></h4>\n<p>Tourists tend to start with comically low HP and strength, and no real <a href=\"/wiki/Armor\" title=\"Armor\">armor</a> to speak of. Thus, the early game must be played with extreme caution. Unlike most other roles, Tourists need to rely heavily on items that they find.\n</p><p>It is critical to find armor as soon as possible. Tourists should use their starting pet to <a href=\"/wiki/Curse-test\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Curse-test\">curse-test</a> every weapon and piece of armor that they find. Non-cursed armor should be worn immediately, unless it <a href=\"/wiki/Encumbrance\" title=\"Encumbrance\">encumbers</a> you. In the early game, the most common source of magical armor items is an armor shop, and Tourists typically start out with enough gold to buy most of the good items in the shop.\n</p><p>Heading directly for <a href=\"/wiki/Sokoban\" title=\"Sokoban\">Sokoban</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Minetown\" title=\"Minetown\">Minetown</a> is a valid strategy, but the monsters may get too difficult too quickly. A very cautious strategy is to wait somewhere around dungeon level 3 or so and kill easy monsters until you gain a few levels, then descend deeper. \n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapons\">Weapons</span></h4>\n<p>The initial stock of 21&#8211;40 +2 darts should be viewed as a bridge to a better weapon. Each dart will, on average, last for 4 throws (given that each dart has a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> chance of <a href=\"/wiki/Missile#Breakage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Missile\">breakage</a> per throw), which means that Tourists will get about 84&#8211;160 dart throws before the supply is exhausted. Once a better weapon is found, any remaining darts should be kept for use in attacking monsters from long range, preferably after <a href=\"/wiki/BUC\" title=\"BUC\">blessing</a>.\n</p><p>At low experience levels, it is difficult to hit anything with a weapon in which you are unskilled, since unskilled usage confers a &#8722;4 to-hit penalty. Hence, unless you find a high-damage weapon such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Dwarvish_mattock\" title=\"Dwarvish mattock\">dwarvish mattock</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Two-handed_sword\" title=\"Two-handed sword\">two-handed sword</a>, you find a highly enchanted weapon, or you are facing weak monsters, it is much safer to kill things by throwing your darts in the very early game. Once you do find a weapon that you want to train, you can use it on non-threatening monsters (such as <a href=\"/wiki/Lichen\" title=\"Lichen\">lichens</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Fog_cloud\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fog cloud\">fog clouds</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Grid_bug\" title=\"Grid bug\">grid bugs</a>) and save your darts for true challenges.\n</p><p>By the time you reach experience level 5 or thereabouts, you will often have found a better weapon (such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Dwarvish_mattock\" title=\"Dwarvish mattock\">dwarvish mattock</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Two-handed_sword\" title=\"Two-handed sword\">two-handed sword</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Long_sword\" title=\"Long sword\">long sword</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Silver_saber\" title=\"Silver saber\">silver saber</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Unicorn_horn\" title=\"Unicorn horn\">unicorn horn</a>), which you can start using in place of the darts since your experience level is now high enough to partly offset the unskilled to-hit penalty. Of course, your weapon will not <i>stay</i> unskilled for long; you should advance it to at least basic as quickly as possible.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"General\">General</span></h4>\n<p>Take off your shirt immediately - it grants no <a href=\"/wiki/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_cancellation\" title=\"Magic cancellation\">magic cancellation</a>, and could be destroyed by a <a href=\"/wiki/Polymorph_trap\" title=\"Polymorph trap\">polymorph trap</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Destroy_armor_(monster_spell)\" title=\"Destroy armor (monster spell)\">destroy armor</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Monster_spell\" title=\"Monster spell\">monster spell</a>. Shirts are best enchanted when you have <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a> and other means to protect it from being destroyed.\n</p><p>The most useful starting item for a Tourist is the <a href=\"/wiki/Expensive_camera\" title=\"Expensive camera\">expensive camera</a>: when <a href=\"/wiki/Applied\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Applied\">applied</a>, the camera will <a href=\"/wiki/Blind\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Blind\">blind</a> any monster in the path of the flash, and has a <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> chance of scaring monsters if used within two tiles. This is useful for fighting or escaping difficult monsters, since fleeing monsters often won't stop to attack you, and you gain an accuracy bonus against them. If you lack a <a href=\"/wiki/Towel\" title=\"Towel\">towel</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Blindfold\" title=\"Blindfold\">blindfold</a>, you can also flash yourself for temporary blindness to use <a href=\"/wiki/Telepathy\" title=\"Telepathy\">telepathy</a> or avoid a <a href=\"/wiki/Gaze_attack\" title=\"Gaze attack\">gaze attack</a>. Writing <a href=\"/wiki/Elbereth\" title=\"Elbereth\">Elbereth</a> in the dust can also scare monsters, and pets can help kill retreating foes - keep in mind that monsters blinded by your expensive camera will not respond to Elbereth!\n</p><p>In terms of other useful items, the credit card is useful for opening locked doors and chests without having to kick, bash, or pry them open, though a <a href=\"/wiki/Lock_pick\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lock pick\">lock pick</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Key\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Key\">key</a> is preferable if you can find one. The quantity of starting food also makes taming or pacifying domestic monsters trivial, and in particular can help you avoid fights against them since they are usually faster. The starting food can also last quite a while, making it less necessary to rely on corpses for nutrition.\n</p><p>Despite the sucker markup on shop prices, the Tourist's high natural <a href=\"/wiki/Charisma\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Charisma\">charisma</a> more than makes up for it and will often get them better prices than <a href=\"/wiki/Barbarian\" title=\"Barbarian\">Barbarians</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Ranger\" title=\"Ranger\">Rangers</a> - be sure to account for the buying and selling modifiers when performing <a href=\"/wiki/Price_identification\" title=\"Price identification\">price identification</a>. Their high charisma and above-average <a href=\"/wiki/Intelligence\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intelligence\">intelligence</a> also makes consorting with <a href=\"/wiki/Foocubi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Foocubi\">foocubi</a> less risky than for other early-game characters: foocubi can help them gain the last couple of levels to qualify for their Quest, which they'll want to complete as soon as possible for the PYEC and shop loot.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Midgame\">Midgame</span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives_2\">Objectives</span></h4>\n<p>Once you are able to bring your AC down below zero, and you obtain a better weapon than the starting darts, you have a reasonable chance at going after the <a href=\"/wiki/Luckstone\" title=\"Luckstone\">luckstone</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Mines%27_End\" title=\"Mines&#39; End\">Mines' End</a> and the prize at the end of <a href=\"/wiki/Sokoban\" title=\"Sokoban\">Sokoban</a>. After that, continue down the dungeon until you find the portal to the quest.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Quest_artifact\" title=\"Quest artifact\">quest artifact</a> for the Tourist is <a href=\"/wiki/The_Platinum_Yendorian_Express_Card\" title=\"The Platinum Yendorian Express Card\">the Platinum Yendorian Express Card</a>. This artifact is so useful that in most cases a Tourist should try to complete the <a href=\"/wiki/Tourist_quest\" title=\"Tourist quest\">quest</a> as soon as possible. The most important intrinsic to have for the quest is <a href=\"/wiki/Reflection\" title=\"Reflection\">reflection</a>, because the quest's locate and goal levels contain several large rooms filled with soldiers armed with attack wands. The <a href=\"/wiki/Master_of_Thieves\" title=\"Master of Thieves\">Master of Thieves</a>, the quest nemesis, is not particularly difficult compared to other quest nemeses, and any character capable of dispatching the soldiers should have no special trouble with him.\n</p>\n<div class=\"upcoming\">\n<p><i>The following information pertains to an upcoming version (<a href=\"/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0\" title=\"NetHack 3.7.0\">NetHack 3.7.0</a>). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.</i>\n</p>\nAs part of a general buff to quest leaders, the Master of Thieves has been made stronger, and thus his difficulty relative to other quest nemeses has increased.</div>\n<p>The quest also contains a sizable amount of loot: between the many <a href=\"/wiki/Shop\" title=\"Shop\">shops</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Barracks\" title=\"Barracks\">barracks</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Graveyard\" title=\"Graveyard\">graveyard</a> treasure, and items generated along with the <a href=\"/wiki/Spider\" title=\"Spider\">spiders</a>, you will likely find an <a href=\"/wiki/Ascension_kit\" title=\"Ascension kit\">ascension kit</a> item or two. Consider postponing sitting on the two <a href=\"/wiki/Throne\" title=\"Throne\">thrones</a> until you loot the entire branch. Further, the lower levels have several guaranteed <a href=\"/wiki/Captain\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Captain\">captains</a>, which have a good chance of carrying at least one <a href=\"/wiki/Silver_saber\" title=\"Silver saber\">silver saber</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapons_2\">Weapons</span></h4>\n<p>It's likely that you've found an altar at this stage, and can sacrifice for a good artifact weapon such as Mjollnir, Magicbane, <a href=\"/wiki/Fire_Brand\" title=\"Fire Brand\">Fire Brand</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Frost_Brand\" title=\"Frost Brand\">Frost Brand</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Vorpal_Blade\" title=\"Vorpal Blade\">Vorpal Blade</a>. Otherwise, you can enchant other good weapons like a long sword or silver saber that you may have found.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"General_2\">General</span></h4>\n<p>Tourists should seek out the same types of <a href=\"/wiki/Armor\" title=\"Armor\">armor</a> that a warrior-type character such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Valkyrie\" title=\"Valkyrie\">Valkyrie</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Barbarian\" title=\"Barbarian\">Barbarian</a> would use. In most cases, it is not worth avoiding metal armor to improve spell casting rates, because Tourists suffer enormous spell casting penalties from even one peripheral piece of metal armor, and it is not practical to avoid metal armor entirely. Typical armor for a mid-game Tourist would be a <a href=\"/wiki/Mithril-coat\" title=\"Mithril-coat\">mithril-coat</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Iron_shoes\" title=\"Iron shoes\">iron shoes</a>, a <a href=\"/wiki/Dwarvish_iron_helm\" title=\"Dwarvish iron helm\">dwarvish iron helm</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Orcish_helm\" title=\"Orcish helm\">orcish helm</a>, and an <a href=\"/wiki/Elven_cloak\" title=\"Elven cloak\">elven cloak</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Dwarvish_cloak\" title=\"Dwarvish cloak\">dwarvish cloak</a>, with perhaps one or two pieces of magical armor.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Late_game\">Late game</span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapons_3\">Weapons</span></h4>\n<p>In the advanced stages of the game, a Tourist should have several <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact_weapon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Artifact weapon\">artifact weapons</a> available from which to choose. Because Tourists have almost no weapon restrictions to speak of, any decent artifact weapon is a good choice. However, if you have a choice, the following weapons are especially desirable and are worth pursuing if your character has the opportunity (e.g., via a <a href=\"/wiki/Wish\" title=\"Wish\">wish</a>):\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Grayswandir\" title=\"Grayswandir\">Grayswandir</a> &#8211; Tourists can advance <a href=\"/wiki/Saber\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Saber\">saber</a> to Skilled. In most cases it must be obtained from a wish, since Tourists start out neutral. It can then be dual-wielded with another silver saber; this is the most powerful melee weapon combination for an endgame Tourist.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Magicbane\" title=\"Magicbane\">Magicbane</a> &#8211; Tourists can advance daggers to expert and can get this by <a href=\"/wiki/Sacrifice\" title=\"Sacrifice\">sacrificing</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Mjollnir\" title=\"Mjollnir\">Mjollnir</a> &#8211; Unless the enemy is shock-resistant, this weapon inflicts the most damage out of all the aligned weapons that a Tourist can obtain by sacrificing.</li></ul>\n<p>Tourists can become skilled in <a href=\"/wiki/Two-weapon_combat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Two-weapon combat\">two-weapon combat</a>, but this only becomes useful late in the game, when good weapons are available. Using two weapons is preferred unless your character needs a shield for <a href=\"/wiki/Reflection\" title=\"Reflection\">reflection</a>. For ranged weapons, highly enchanted <a href=\"/wiki/Dart\" title=\"Dart\">darts</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Dagger\" title=\"Dagger\">daggers</a> work well, since both are readily available and Tourists can get to Expert skill in both daggers and darts. Of the two, darts are preferable since Tourists suffer a <a href=\"/wiki/Multishot\" title=\"Multishot\">multishot</a> penalty for all other weapons.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"General_3\">General</span></h3>\n<p>With regards to armor selection, a Tourist is no different from any other role and should follow the same guidelines as any other character in terms of assembling the various pieces of armor that form a typical <a href=\"/wiki/Ascension_kit\" title=\"Ascension kit\">ascension kit</a>. One advantage you have over other roles is that you don't have to look for a shirt to complete your set.\n</p><p>The main function of the Platinum Yendorian Express Card is that it can be #<a href=\"/wiki/Invoke\" title=\"Invoke\">invoked</a> to charge wands and tools like a <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_charging\" title=\"Scroll of charging\">scroll of charging</a>. Properly exploited, this function gives the Tourist the equivalent of a blessed scroll of charging every few hundred turns, a feat which is not possible with any other role. This makes the Tourist role one of the easiest to ascend once the quest has been completed.\n</p><p>Wands have an increased chance of exploding each time they are charged, so a post-quest Tourist will usually want to keep several of each type of wand on hand to maximize the number of recharging opportunities. For rare wands, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_death\" title=\"Wand of death\">wands of death</a>, a small number of such wands will last an entire game if properly managed. For common wands, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_digging\" title=\"Wand of digging\">wands of digging</a>, it is a good idea to maintain a rotating stock of such wands, discarding the ones which have been charged many times and replacing them with newer ones.\n</p><p>The Platinum Yendorian Express Card can also be used to charge <a href=\"/wiki/Tool\" title=\"Tool\">tools</a>. This is especially useful because most tools, unlike wands, can be recharged infinitely many times. For example, a <a href=\"/wiki/Horn_of_plenty\" title=\"Horn of plenty\">horn of plenty</a> combined with the Platinum Yendorian Express Card means that a Tourist can get by with carrying very little <a href=\"/wiki/Food\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Food\">food</a>. A <a href=\"/wiki/Bag_of_tricks\" title=\"Bag of tricks\">bag of tricks</a> can be used to <a href=\"/wiki/Create_monster\" title=\"Create monster\">create monsters</a> indefinitely. Other useful chargeable tools include <a href=\"/wiki/Brass_lantern\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Brass lantern\">brass lanterns</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Crystal_ball\" title=\"Crystal ball\">crystal balls</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Tinning_kit\" title=\"Tinning kit\">tinning kits</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_harp\" title=\"Magic harp\">magic harps</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_flute\" title=\"Magic flute\">magic flutes</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Fire_horn\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fire horn\">fire horns</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Frost_horn\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Frost horn\">frost horns</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Bell_of_Opening\" title=\"Bell of Opening\">Bell of Opening</a>, and even the <a href=\"/wiki/Expensive_camera\" title=\"Expensive camera\">expensive camera</a> that comes in the initial inventory.\n</p><p>Certain <a href=\"/wiki/Ring\" title=\"Ring\">rings</a> can be charged with the Platinum Yendorian Express Card as well. You may want to wear a +6 or +7 <a href=\"/wiki/Ring_of_increase_damage\" title=\"Ring of increase damage\">ring of increase damage</a> full time, especially for <a href=\"/wiki/Two_weapon_combat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Two weapon combat\">two weapon combat</a>. Since rings can explode when charged, a good strategy is keep two of the same type of ring, and charge the one with the lowest charge, so as to not risk destroying a highly charged ring.\n</p><p>Because the game will not display the number of charges and recharges on an unidentified item, finding a <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_identify\" title=\"Spellbook of identify\">spellbook of identify</a> may be convenient for a Tourist.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Variants\">Variants</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"SLASH'EM\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"SLASH.27EM\">SLASH'EM</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/SLASH%27EM\" title=\"SLASH&#39;EM\">SLASH'EM</a>, a Tourist may also be a <a href=\"/wiki/Doppelganger_(starting_race)\" title=\"Doppelganger (starting race)\">doppelganger</a> or a <a href=\"/wiki/Hobbit_(starting_race)\" title=\"Hobbit (starting race)\">hobbit</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"SlashTHEM\">SlashTHEM</span></h3>\n<p>In addition to SLASH'EM, they can be <a href=\"/wiki/Incantifiers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Incantifiers\">incantifiers</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"SporkHack\">SporkHack</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/SporkHack\" title=\"SporkHack\">SporkHack</a> offers a wider selection of races for various roles.

That was a new word to Rincewind the wizard (BMgc, Unseen University [failed]). It was one of a number he had picked up since leaving the charred ruins of Ankh-Morpork. Quaint was another one. Picturesque meant -- he decided after careful observation of the scenery that inspired Twoflower to use the word -- that the landscape was horribly precipitous. Quaint, when used to describe the occasional village through which they passed, meant fever-ridden and tumbledown.<br />\nTwoflower was a tourist, the first ever seen on the discworld. Tourist, Rincewind had decided, meant \"idiot\".<br />\n</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:right\">[ The Colour of Magic, by Terry Pratchett ] </div>\n</div></div>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<div style=\"display:none; right:44px; padding-bottom: 17px\" class=\"metadata topicon nopopups\"><div style=\"margin-top: -10px\"><a href=\"/wiki/NetHackWiki:Next_version\" title=\"This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.0.

'''Tourist''' is one of the [[role]]s in ''[[NetHack]]''. A Tourist has low starting [[HP]] and poor equipment, so playing one is quite the [[Role difficulty|challenge]] in the early levels, but they have the potential to become very powerful near the end of the game. Tourists always start as [[neutral]] [[Human (starting race)|humans]].\n\nThe Tourist is inspired by [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[wikipedia:Discworld|Discworld]]'' books; Twoflower, the tourist from these books, appears as the [[quest leader]] for the Tourist role. A further influence is Diana Wynne Jones's ''Tough Guide to Fantasyland'', a \"travel guide for the hapless fantasy tourist\" that spoofs sword-and-sorcery novels by reinterpreting them as carefully orchestrated guided tours, with the main protagonist as the \"tourist\".\n\nThe [[guidebook]] has this to say about Tourists:\n Tourists start out with lots of gold (suitable for shopping with), a credit card, lots of food, some maps, and an expensive camera. Most monsters don't like being photographed.\n\n==Starting equipment==\n* 1&ndash;1000 [[gold]] pieces\n* 21&ndash;40 +2 [[dart]]s\n* a +0 [[Hawaiian shirt]]\n* 10&ndash;20 random items of [[food]]\n* 4 [[Scroll of magic mapping|scrolls of magic mapping]]\n* 2 [[Potion of extra healing|potions of extra healing]]\n* an uncursed [[expensive camera]] with 30&ndash;99 charges\n* an uncursed [[credit card]]\n* 4% chance of a [[tin opener]]; otherwise:\n** 4% chance of a [[leash]] (3.84%); otherwise:\n** 4% chance of a [[towel]] (3.6864%); otherwise:\n** 4% chance of an uncursed [[magic marker]] (3.538944%)\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|As of {{commit|9d910773d0a5421a259a228f638f87a04ef2d7a0}}, Tourists have a 5% chance of a magic marker (19&ndash;23 charges) if they do not start with one of the other tools (4.42368% chance, when accounting for the other tool probabilities.)}}\n\n==Intrinsics==\n*XL 10: [[Searching]]\n*XL 20: [[Poison resistance]]\n\n==Skills==\n{{Tourist skill table}}\nTourists start with Basic skill in ''darts''. Despite not starting with a melee weapon, they start Unskilled in ''Bare hands'', because only roles which can reach Master start with Basic skill in ''Bare hands'', and Tourists can only reach Skilled.\n\nCompensating somewhat for their poor starting equipment, a Tourist can advance to Basic skill in every type of weapon except [[club]]s, making the role a \"jack of all trades\" that can make use of almost any weapon without restriction.\n\n==Special rules==\n[[Shopkeeper]]s recognize Tourists below experience level 15 as suckers and charge them an extra {{frac|3}} markup when buying and only offer {{frac|3}} the base price of sold items. (The same problem will be experienced by other roles when wearing a visible [[shirt]] or a [[dunce cap]].)\n\nTourists have a +1 ''penalty'' with [[emergency spell]]s.\n\nTourists don't receive the [[multishot]] bonus for being Skilled at any weapon other than darts. They do receive the bonus for becoming Expert at daggers.\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Tourists are the only role capable of reading a [[conical hat]]. Only {{frac|3}} of conical hats have any lettering, but those that do read either \"DUNCE\" or \"WIZZARD\", unambiguously identifying the hat.}}\n\n==Rank titles==\nThe [[status line]] shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\n\n*XL 1&ndash;2: Rambler\n*XL 3&ndash;5: Sightseer\n*XL 6&ndash;9: Excursionist\n*XL 10&ndash;13: Peregrinator/Peregrinatrix\n*XL 14&ndash;17: Traveler\n*XL 18&ndash;21: Journeyer\n*XL 22&ndash;25: Voyager\n*XL 26&ndash;29: Explorer\n*XL 30: Adventurer\n\n==Quest==\n{{main|Tourist quest}}\nThe Tourist quest requires fighting the [[Master of Thieves]] for [[the Platinum Yendorian Express Card]].\n\n==Strategy==\n===Character creation===\nThe only choice available when generating a Tourist is their [[gender]], which is generally inconsequential outside of consorting with [[foocubi]]: the Quest's goal level for Tourists contains four guaranteed incubi, but only two succubi. Players who want to raise their level and energy as high as possible for spellcasting purposes will probably want their Tourist to be female. A Tourist that finds an [[amulet of change]] or a [[ring of polymorph control]] can use up the foocubi of one gender, then switch and start consorting with the other.\n\n===Early game===\n====Objectives====\nTourists tend to start with comically low HP and strength, and no real [[armor]] to speak of. Thus, the early game must be played with extreme caution. Unlike most other roles, Tourists need to rely heavily on items that they find.\n\nIt is critical to find armor as soon as possible. Tourists should use their starting pet to [[curse-test]] every weapon and piece of armor that they find. Non-cursed armor should be worn immediately, unless it [[encumbrance|encumber]]s you. In the early game, the most common source of magical armor items is an armor shop, and Tourists typically start out with enough gold to buy most of the good items in the shop.\n\nHeading directly for [[Sokoban]] or [[Minetown]] is a valid strategy, but the monsters may get too difficult too quickly. A very cautious strategy is to wait somewhere around dungeon level 3 or so and kill easy monsters until you gain a few levels, then descend deeper. \n\n====Weapons====\nThe initial stock of 21&ndash;40 +2 darts should be viewed as a bridge to a better weapon. Each dart will, on average, last for 4 throws (given that each dart has a {{frac|4}} chance of [[Missile#Breakage|breakage]] per throw), which means that Tourists will get about 84&ndash;160 dart throws before the supply is exhausted. Once a better weapon is found, any remaining darts should be kept for use in attacking monsters from long range, preferably after [[BUC|blessing]].\n\nAt low experience levels, it is difficult to hit anything with a weapon in which you are unskilled, since unskilled usage confers a &minus;4 to-hit penalty. Hence, unless you find a high-damage weapon such as a [[dwarvish mattock]] or [[two-handed sword]], you find a highly enchanted weapon, or you are facing weak monsters, it is much safer to kill things by throwing your darts in the very early game. Once you do find a weapon that you want to train, you can use it on non-threatening monsters (such as [[lichen]]s, [[fog cloud]]s, and [[grid bug]]s) and save your darts for true challenges.\n\nBy the time you reach experience level 5 or thereabouts, you will often have found a better weapon (such as a [[dwarvish mattock]], [[two-handed sword]], [[long sword]], [[silver saber]], or [[unicorn horn]]), which you can start using in place of the darts since your experience level is now high enough to partly offset the unskilled to-hit penalty. Of course, your weapon will not ''stay'' unskilled for long; you should advance it to at least basic as quickly as possible.\n\n====General====\nTake off your shirt immediately - it grants no [[AC]] or [[magic cancellation]], and could be destroyed by a [[polymorph trap]] or [[destroy armor (monster spell)|destroy armor]] [[monster spell]]. Shirts are best enchanted when you have [[magic resistance]] and other means to protect it from being destroyed.\n\nThe most useful starting item for a Tourist is the [[expensive camera]]: when [[applied]], the camera will [[blind]] any monster in the path of the flash, and has a {{frac|3|4}} chance of scaring monsters if used within two tiles. This is useful for fighting or escaping difficult monsters, since fleeing monsters often won't stop to attack you, and you gain an accuracy bonus against them. If you lack a [[towel]] or [[blindfold]], you can also flash yourself for temporary blindness to use [[telepathy]] or avoid a [[gaze attack]]. Writing [[Elbereth]] in the dust can also scare monsters, and pets can help kill retreating foes - keep in mind that monsters blinded by your expensive camera will not respond to Elbereth!\n\nIn terms of other useful items, the credit card is useful for opening locked doors and chests without having to kick, bash, or pry them open, though a [[lock pick]] or [[key]] is preferable if you can find one. The quantity of starting food also makes taming or pacifying domestic monsters trivial, and in particular can help you avoid fights against them since they are usually faster. The starting food can also last quite a while, making it less necessary to rely on corpses for nutrition.\n\nDespite the sucker markup on shop prices, the Tourist's high natural [[charisma]] more than makes up for it and will often get them better prices than [[Barbarian]]s or [[Ranger]]s - be sure to account for the buying and selling modifiers when performing [[price identification]]. Their high charisma and above-average [[intelligence]] also makes consorting with [[foocubi]] less risky than for other early-game characters: foocubi can help them gain the last couple of levels to qualify for their Quest, which they'll want to complete as soon as possible for the PYEC and shop loot.\n\n===Midgame===\n====Objectives====\nOnce you are able to bring your AC down below zero, and you obtain a better weapon than the starting darts, you have a reasonable chance at going after the [[luckstone]] in [[Mines' End]] and the prize at the end of [[Sokoban]]. After that, continue down the dungeon until you find the portal to the quest.\n\nThe [[quest artifact]] for the Tourist is [[the Platinum Yendorian Express Card]]. This artifact is so useful that in most cases a Tourist should try to complete the [[Tourist quest|quest]] as soon as possible. The most important intrinsic to have for the quest is [[reflection]], because the quest's locate and goal levels contain several large rooms filled with soldiers armed with attack wands. The [[Master of Thieves]], the quest nemesis, is not particularly difficult compared to other quest nemeses, and any character capable of dispatching the soldiers should have no special trouble with him.\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|As part of a general buff to quest leaders, the Master of Thieves has been made stronger, and thus his difficulty relative to other quest nemeses has increased.}}\n\nThe quest also contains a sizable amount of loot: between the many [[shop]]s, [[barracks]] and [[graveyard]] treasure, and items generated along with the [[spider]]s, you will likely find an [[ascension kit]] item or two. Consider postponing sitting on the two [[throne]]s until you loot the entire branch. Further, the lower levels have several guaranteed [[captain]]s, which have a good chance of carrying at least one [[silver saber]].\n\n====Weapons====\nIt's likely that you've found an altar at this stage, and can sacrifice for a good artifact weapon such as Mjollnir, Magicbane, [[Fire Brand]], [[Frost Brand]], or [[Vorpal Blade]]. Otherwise, you can enchant other good weapons like a long sword or silver saber that you may have found.\n\n====General====\nTourists should seek out the same types of [[armor]] that a warrior-type character such as a [[Valkyrie]] or [[Barbarian]] would use. In most cases, it is not worth avoiding metal armor to improve spell casting rates, because Tourists suffer enormous spell casting penalties from even one peripheral piece of metal armor, and it is not practical to avoid metal armor entirely. Typical armor for a mid-game Tourist would be a [[mithril-coat]], [[iron shoes]], a [[dwarvish iron helm]] or [[orcish helm]], and an [[elven cloak]] or [[dwarvish cloak]], with perhaps one or two pieces of magical armor.\n\n===Late game===\n====Weapons====\nIn the advanced stages of the game, a Tourist should have several [[artifact weapon]]s available from which to choose. Because Tourists have almost no weapon restrictions to speak of, any decent artifact weapon is a good choice. However, if you have a choice, the following weapons are especially desirable and are worth pursuing if your character has the opportunity (e.g., via a [[wish]]):\n\n* [[Grayswandir]] &ndash; Tourists can advance [[saber]] to Skilled. In most cases it must be obtained from a wish, since Tourists start out neutral. It can then be dual-wielded with another silver saber; this is the most powerful melee weapon combination for an endgame Tourist.\n* [[Magicbane]] &ndash; Tourists can advance daggers to expert and can get this by [[sacrifice|sacrificing]].\n* [[Mjollnir]] &ndash; Unless the enemy is shock-resistant, this weapon inflicts the most damage out of all the aligned weapons that a Tourist can obtain by sacrificing.\n\nTourists can become skilled in [[two-weapon combat]], but this only becomes useful late in the game, when good weapons are available. Using two weapons is preferred unless your character needs a shield for [[reflection]]. For ranged weapons, highly enchanted [[dart]]s or [[dagger]]s work well, since both are readily available and Tourists can get to Expert skill in both daggers and darts. Of the two, darts are preferable since Tourists suffer a [[multishot]] penalty for all other weapons.\n\n===General===\nWith regards to armor selection, a Tourist is no different from any other role and should follow the same guidelines as any other character in terms of assembling the various pieces of armor that form a typical [[ascension kit]]. One advantage you have over other roles is that you don't have to look for a shirt to complete your set.\n\nThe main function of the Platinum Yendorian Express Card is that it can be #[[invoke]]d to charge wands and tools like a [[scroll of charging]]. Properly exploited, this function gives the Tourist the equivalent of a blessed scroll of charging every few hundred turns, a feat which is not possible with any other role. This makes the Tourist role one of the easiest to ascend once the quest has been completed.\n\nWands have an increased chance of exploding each time they are charged, so a post-quest Tourist will usually want to keep several of each type of wand on hand to maximize the number of recharging opportunities. For rare wands, such as [[wand of death|wands of death]], a small number of such wands will last an entire game if properly managed. For common wands, such as [[wand of digging|wands of digging]], it is a good idea to maintain a rotating stock of such wands, discarding the ones which have been charged many times and replacing them with newer ones.\n\nThe Platinum Yendorian Express Card can also be used to charge [[tool]]s. This is especially useful because most tools, unlike wands, can be recharged infinitely many times. For example, a [[horn of plenty]] combined with the Platinum Yendorian Express Card means that a Tourist can get by with carrying very little [[food]]. A [[bag of tricks]] can be used to [[create monster]]s indefinitely. Other useful chargeable tools include [[brass lantern]]s, [[crystal ball]]s, [[tinning kit]]s, [[magic harp]]s, [[magic flute]]s, [[fire horn]]s, [[frost horn]]s, the [[Bell of Opening]], and even the [[expensive camera]] that comes in the initial inventory.\n\nCertain [[ring]]s can be charged with the Platinum Yendorian Express Card as well. You may want to wear a +6 or +7 [[ring of increase damage]] full time, especially for [[two weapon combat]]. Since rings can explode when charged, a good strategy is keep two of the same type of ring, and charge the one with the lowest charge, so as to not risk destroying a highly charged ring.\n\nBecause the game will not display the number of charges and recharges on an unidentified item, finding a [[spellbook of identify]] may be convenient for a Tourist.\n\n==Variants==\n===SLASH'EM===\nIn [[SLASH'EM]], a Tourist may also be a [[Doppelganger (starting race)|doppelganger]] or a [[Hobbit (starting race)|hobbit]].\n\n===SlashTHEM===\nIn addition to SLASH'EM, they can be [[incantifiers]].\n\n===SporkHack===\n[[SporkHack]] offers a wider selection of races for various roles. An orc Tourist is an interesting choice that starts with [[potion of sickness|potions of sickness]]; dipping the starting darts into one offers an instant kill attack from the second move.\n\n===UnNetHack===\nIn [[UnNetHack]], items in shops are [[Auto-identify|automatically identified]] when playing as a Tourist, regardless of whether the player has seen them before or not. Similarly, selling unidentified items will automatically identify them. [[Enchantment]]s and [[BUC]] status are not identified.\n\n===FIQHack===\nIn [[FIQHack]], tourists ID shop items in the same manner as UnNetHack.  Additionally, a Tourist may be a [[gnome (starting race)|gnome]].  Tourists start with all of their optional equipment.  The [[magic marker]] that a tourist starts with is always 0:0.\n\n==Encyclopedia entry==\n{{encyclopedia|\nThe road from Ankh-Morpork to Chrim is high, white and winding, a thirty-league stretch of potholes and half-buried rocks that spirals around mountains and dips into cool green valleys of citrus trees, crosses liana-webbed gorges on creaking rope bridges and is generally more picturesque than useful.\nPicturesque. That was a new word to Rincewind the wizard (BMgc, Unseen University [failed]). It was one of a number he had picked up since leaving the charred ruins of Ankh-Morpork. Quaint was another one. Picturesque meant -- he decided after careful observation of the scenery that inspired Twoflower to use the word -- that the landscape was horribly precipitous. Quaint, when used to describe the occasional village through which they passed, meant fever-ridden and tumbledown.\nTwoflower was a tourist, the first ever seen on the discworld. Tourist, Rincewind had decided, meant \"idiot\".\n|[ The Colour of Magic, by Terry Pratchett ]\n}}\n\n{{nethack-360|offset=1}}\n{{featured}}\n[[Category:Roles]]"}

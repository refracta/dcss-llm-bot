As NetHack has changed since the days of Rogue, text adventures have changed since the olden days.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Colossal Cave Adventure\n\n[Colossal Cave Adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure \"wikipedia:Colossal Cave Adventure\"), first released in 1976, was an early (probably the first) text adventure game; indeed, the name *text adventure* comes from this game.\n\nAn online version of Colossal Cave Adventure is available at <https://rickadams.org/adventure/> .\n\nMichael C. Toy and Glenn Wichman, two of the authors of [Rogue](/wiki/Rogue \"Rogue\"), enjoyed playing Colossal Cave Adventure.[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1)\n\n### NetHack reimagined as a text adventure\n\nFor a relatable example, see the [strip of 8 March 2005](http://www.nicolaas.net/dudley/index.php?f=20050308) in *[Dudley's dungeon](/wiki/Dudley%27s_dungeon \"Dudley's dungeon\")*.\n\n### Dunnet\n\nThe text editor *[GNU Emacs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs \"wikipedia:Emacs\")* contains a text adventure called *dunnet*, written by Ron Schnell. This section features a sample session of dunnet to see what a text adventure is like.\n\n**[Spoiler warning](/wiki/Spoiler \"Spoiler\"):** *The following demonstration contains plot spoilers for the text adventure \"dunnet\". **If you do not want \"dunnet\" spoiled, do not read below this point.***\n\nOkay, since you feel okay with having the beginning of \"dunnet\" spoiled, let us go to a [Unix](/wiki/Unix \"Unix\") machine with \"emacs\" installed and run the usual command to start \"dunnet\":\n\n```\n$ emacs -batch -l dunnet\n```\n\nNow the game starts:\n\n```\nDead end\nYou are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.\nIn the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The\ntrees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant\nfrom each other.\nThere is a shovel here.\n>\n```\n\nOkay. It is a text adventure, so instead of having an ASCII map, you must read through the description of an area. The name of this place is \"Dead end\", while \"There is a shovel here.\" is the usual way to indicate the presence of some [item](/wiki/Item \"Item\"), and substitutes for the `(` symbol in NetHack.\n\nCommands in text adventures are similar to English; they usually consist of \"verb\" or \"verb noun\", though some can be more complex than that. Let us try something:\n\n```\n>shake tree\n```\n\nThe result of this is:\n\n```\nYou begin to shake a tree, and notice a coconut begin to fall from the air.\nAs you try to get your hand up to block it, you feel the impact as it lands\non your head.\nYou are dead.\nYou have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.\n$\n```\n\nOops. Maybe you were surprised that the game even understands the command \"shake tree\", but it is easy to die in old-school text adventures. (In more modern text adventures, instant deaths are less common.) Now the game has quit, and we have returned to the Unix shell prompt (here shown as [$](/wiki/$ \"$\")).\n\nNote, if you type \"eat shovel\" that also works!\n\n#### Manipulating the inventory\n\nThe [inventory](/wiki/Inventory \"Inventory\") in a text adventure is analogous to the inventory in *NetHack*; you can pick up, carry, drop, and use items. Let us start the game again and interact with the shovel:\n\n```\n$ emacs -batch -l dunnet\n```\n\nWe read about the dead end and the shovel again, then we try a command:\n\n```\n>pick up shovel\nI don't understand that.\n>\n```\n\nThat did not work. (In a more modern text adventure, \"pick up shovel\" would almost certainly work.) Though the **help** command has some hints, the *Dunnet* help does not explain much about the inventory. However, part of playing a text adventure is guessing some commands. Also, the inventory commands in *Dunnet* are similar to those in other text adventures.\n\nWe try a different command:\n\n```\n>take shovel\nTaken.\n```\n\nIf we look at this dead end again:\n\n```\n>look\nDead end\nYou are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.\nIn the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The\ntrees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant\nfrom each other.\n```\n\nNote that \"There is a shovel here.\" is gone, because we took the shovel. However, if we look in the inventory:\n\n```\n>inventory\nYou currently have:\nA lamp\nA shovel\n```\n\nWe have the shovel, and apparently we started the game with a lamp.\n\nNow let us try moving around. The word \"east\" from the description gives a hint:\n\n```\n>east\nE/W Dirt road\nYou are on the continuation of a dirt road.  There are more trees on\nboth sides of you.  The road continues to the east and west.\nThere is a large boulder here.\n>east\nFork\nYou are at a fork of two passages, one to the northeast, and one to the\nsoutheast.  The ground here seems very soft. You can also go back west.\n```\n\n\"The ground here seems very soft.\" is a hint; players often need to examine the text for these hints. In this case, maybe this would be a good spot to [apply](/wiki/Apply \"Apply\") the shovel.\n\n```\n>shovel\nI don't understand that.\n>apply shovel\nI don't understand that.\n>dig\nI think you found something.\n```\n\nThe first two commands did not work, but the third seems interesting. What did we find?\n\n```\n>look\nFork\nYou are at a fork of two passages, one to the northeast, and one to the\nsoutheast.  The ground here seems very soft. You can also go back west.\nThere is a CPU card here.\n>take cpu\nTaken.\n```\n\n#### Entering the building\n\nAt the spot where we took the CPU card, we had the option to go northeast or southeast. We go northeast (most text adventures accept the shortcut **ne**, equivalent to [u](/wiki/U \"U\") in *NetHack*):\n\n```\n>ne\nNE/SW road\nYou are on a northeast/southwest road.\n>ne\nBuilding front\nYou are at the end of the road.  There is a building in front of you\nto the northeast, and the road leads back to the southwest.\n>ne\nYou don't have a key that can open this door.\n```\n\nThe need to find a [key](/wiki/Key \"Key\") is a common theme in text adventure games. (Contrast *NetHack*, where you can just [kick](/wiki/Kick \"Kick\") most of the doors down, but then the locked doors are only random.)\n\nMaybe the key is on the other path?\n\n```\n>sw\nNE/SW road\n>sw\nFork\n>se\nSE/NW road\nYou are on a southeast/northwest road.\nThere is some food here.\n>take food\nTaken.\n>se\nBear hangout\nYou are standing at the end of a road.  A passage leads back to the\nnorthwest.\nThere is a ferocious bear here!\n>fight bear\nI don't understand that.\n>attack bear\nI don't understand that.\n```\n\nLuckily the game does not seem to understand our combat commands. This might have saved us, because fighting strong [monsters](/wiki/Monster \"Monster\") is often an easy way to [die](/wiki/Die \"Die\").\n\n```\n>feed bear\nDone.\nThe bear takes the food and runs away with it. He left something behind.\n```\n\nWe had to use the food for something. This game does not seem so hard...\n\n```\n>look\nBear hangout\nYou are standing at the end of a road.  A passage leads back to the\nnorthwest.\nThere is a shiny brass key here.\n```\n\nYes, that is exactly what we need! (Unless, of course, it is the wrong key for our door...)\n\n```\n>take key\nTaken.\n>nw\nSE/NW road\n>nw\nFork\n>ne\nNE/SW road\n>ne\nBuilding front\n>look\nBuilding front\nYou are at the end of the road.  There is a building in front of you\nto the northeast, and the road leads back to the southwest.\n```\n\nLet us check if this key works...\n\n```\n>ne\nOld Building hallway\nYou are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east\nand west, and doors leading out to the north and south.\n```\n\n#### Enabling the computer\n\nWe are now in a building with rooms to the east and west. Let us try one of them:\n\n```\n>west\nComputer room\nYou are in a computer room.  It seems like most of the equipment has\nbeen removed.  There is a VAX 11/780 in front of you, however, with\none of the cabinets wide open.  A sign on the front of the machine\nsays: This VAX is named 'pokey'.  To type on the console, use the\n'type' command.  The exit is to the east.\nThe panel lights are steady and motionless.\n>type\nYou type on the keyboard, but your characters do not even echo.\n```\n\nWait, our inventory contains a CPU card:\n\n```\n>inventory\nYou currently have:\nA lamp\nA shovel\nA computer board\nA brass key\n```\n\nMaybe we need to use this board in this computer?\n\n```\n>read board\nThe CPU board has a VAX chip on it.  It seems to have\n2 Megabytes of RAM onboard.\n```\n\nYes, the computer is a VAX, and this board is for a VAX, so maybe they match.\n\n```\n>install board\nI don't understand that.\n>put board in vax\nAs you put the CPU board in the computer, it immediately springs to life.\nThe lights start flashing, and the fans seem to startup.\n```\n\nThe command \"put *X* in *Y*\" is common in text adventures, and seemed to work here.\n\n```\n>type\n \n\nUNIX System V, Release 2.2 (pokey)\n\nlogin:\n```\n\nWe have the computer working, but we are not sure yet how to login. Computer use is peculiar to *Dunnet* and less common in other text adventures. (Back when *Dunnet* appeared, most Emacs users had significant [Unix](/wiki/Unix \"Unix\") knowledge.) The results of using this computer might be surprising, and the game becomes more difficult after that...\n\n```\n(after some failed logins)\nlogin incorrect\n>shake tree\nI don't see that here.\n>quit\n\nYou have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.\n```\n\nAnd we have not yet scored any points! Hopefully, though, this demonstration gave you some of idea of what a text adventure is like.\n\n## See also\n\n- *[What Fools These Mortals](/wiki/What_Fools_These_Mortals \"What Fools These Mortals\")* ([Home Page](http://www.crummy.com/software/WhatFools/)) is a parody text adventure based in the NetHack world — played as one of the gods.\n\n## References\n\n1.

(In more modern text adventures, instant deaths are less common.) Now the game has quit, and we have returned to the Unix shell prompt (here shown as <a href=\"/wiki/$\" title=\"$\">$</a>).\n</p><p>Note, if you type \"eat shovel\" that also works!\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Manipulating_the_inventory\">Manipulating the inventory</span></h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Inventory\" title=\"Inventory\">inventory</a> in a text adventure is analogous to the inventory in <i>NetHack</i>; you can pick up, carry, drop, and use items. Let us start the game again and interact with the shovel:\n</p>\n<pre>$ <b>emacs -batch -l dunnet</b>\n</pre>\n<p>We read about the dead end and the shovel again, then we try a command:\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>pick up shovel</b>\nI don't understand that.\n&gt;\n</pre>\n<p>That did not work. (In a more modern text adventure, \"pick up shovel\" would almost certainly work.) Though the <b>help</b> command has some hints, the <i>Dunnet</i> help does not explain much about the inventory. However, part of playing a text adventure is guessing some commands. Also, the inventory commands in <i>Dunnet</i> are similar to those in other text adventures.\n</p><p>We try a different command:\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>take shovel</b>\nTaken.\n</pre>\n<p>If we look at this dead end again:\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>look</b>\nDead end\nYou are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.\nIn the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The\ntrees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant\nfrom each other.\n</pre>\n<p>Note that \"There is a shovel here.\" is gone, because we took the shovel. However, if we look in the inventory:\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>inventory</b>\nYou currently have:\nA lamp\nA shovel\n</pre>\n<p>We have the shovel, and apparently we started the game with a lamp.\n</p><p>Now let us try moving around. The word \"east\" from the description gives a hint:\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>east</b>\nE/W Dirt road\nYou are on the continuation of a dirt road.  There are more trees on\nboth sides of you.  The road continues to the east and west.\nThere is a large boulder here.\n&gt;<b>east</b>\nFork\nYou are at a fork of two passages, one to the northeast, and one to the\nsoutheast.  The ground here seems very soft. You can also go back west.\n</pre>\n<p>\"The ground here seems very soft.\" is a hint; players often need to examine the text for these hints. In this case, maybe this would be a good spot to <a href=\"/wiki/Apply\" title=\"Apply\">apply</a> the shovel.\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>shovel</b>\nI don't understand that.\n&gt;<b>apply shovel</b>\nI don't understand that.\n&gt;<b>dig</b>\nI think you found something.\n</pre>\n<p>The first two commands did not work, but the third seems interesting. What did we find?\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>look</b>\nFork\nYou are at a fork of two passages, one to the northeast, and one to the\nsoutheast.  The ground here seems very soft. You can also go back west.\nThere is a CPU card here.\n&gt;<b>take cpu</b>\nTaken.\n</pre>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Entering_the_building\">Entering the building</span></h4>\n<p>At the spot where we took the CPU card, we had the option to go northeast or southeast. We go northeast (most text adventures accept the shortcut <b>ne</b>, equivalent to <span class=\"kbd\"><span class=\"kbdsym\"><a href=\"/wiki/U\" title=\"U\">u</a></span></span> in <i>NetHack</i>):\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;ne\nNE/SW road\nYou are on a northeast/southwest road.\n&gt;ne\nBuilding front\nYou are at the end of the road.  There is a building in front of you\nto the northeast, and the road leads back to the southwest.\n&gt;ne\nYou don't have a key that can open this door.\n</pre>\n<p>The need to find a <a href=\"/wiki/Key\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Key\">key</a> is a common theme in text adventure games. (Contrast <i>NetHack</i>, where you can just <a href=\"/wiki/Kick\" title=\"Kick\">kick</a> most of the doors down, but then the locked doors are only random.)\n</p><p>Maybe the key is on the other path?\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>sw</b>\nNE/SW road\n&gt;<b>sw</b>\nFork\n&gt;<b>se</b>\nSE/NW road\nYou are on a southeast/northwest road.\nThere is some food here.\n&gt;<b>take food</b>\nTaken.\n&gt;<b>se</b>\nBear hangout\nYou are standing at the end of a road.  A passage leads back to the\nnorthwest.\nThere is a ferocious bear here!\n&gt;<b>fight bear</b>\nI don't understand that.\n&gt;<b>attack bear</b>\nI don't understand that.\n</pre>\n<p>Luckily the game does not seem to understand our combat commands. This might have saved us, because fighting strong <a href=\"/wiki/Monster\" title=\"Monster\">monsters</a> is often an easy way to <a href=\"/wiki/Die\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Die\">die</a>.\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>feed bear</b>\nDone.\nThe bear takes the food and runs away with it. He left something behind.\n</pre>\n<p>We had to use the food for something. This game does not seem so hard...\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>look</b>\nBear hangout\nYou are standing at the end of a road.  A passage leads back to the\nnorthwest.\nThere is a shiny brass key here.\n</pre>\n<p>Yes, that is exactly what we need! (Unless, of course, it is the wrong key for our door...)\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>take key</b>\nTaken.\n&gt;<b>nw</b>\nSE/NW road\n&gt;<b>nw</b>\nFork\n&gt;<b>ne</b>\nNE/SW road\n&gt;<b>ne</b>\nBuilding front\n&gt;<b>look</b>\nBuilding front\nYou are at the end of the road.  There is a building in front of you\nto the northeast, and the road leads back to the southwest.\n</pre>\n<p>Let us check if this key works...\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>ne</b>\nOld Building hallway\nYou are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east\nand west, and doors leading out to the north and south.\n</pre>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Enabling_the_computer\">Enabling the computer</span></h4>\n<p>We are now in a building with rooms to the east and west. Let us try one of them:\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>west</b>\nComputer room\nYou are in a computer room.  It seems like most of the equipment has\nbeen removed.  There is a VAX 11/780 in front of you, however, with\none of the cabinets wide open.  A sign on the front of the machine\nsays: This VAX is named 'pokey'.  To type on the console, use the\n'type' command.  The exit is to the east.\nThe panel lights are steady and motionless.\n&gt;<b>type</b>\nYou type on the keyboard, but your characters do not even echo.\n</pre>\n<p>Wait, our inventory contains a CPU card:\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>inventory</b>\nYou currently have:\nA lamp\nA shovel\nA computer board\nA brass key\n</pre>\n<p>Maybe we need to use this board in this computer?\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>read board</b>\nThe CPU board has a VAX chip on it.  It seems to have\n2 Megabytes of RAM onboard.\n</pre>\n<p>Yes, the computer is a VAX, and this board is for a VAX, so maybe they match.\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>install board</b>\nI don't understand that.\n&gt;<b>put board in vax</b>\nAs you put the CPU board in the computer, it immediately springs to life.\nThe lights start flashing, and the fans seem to startup.\n</pre>\n<p>The command \"put <i>X</i> in <i>Y</i>\" is common in text adventures, and seemed to work here.\n</p>\n<pre>&gt;<b>type</b>\n \n\nUNIX System V, Release 2.2 (pokey)\n\nlogin:\n</pre>\n<p>We have the computer working, but we are not sure yet how to login. Computer use is peculiar to <i>Dunnet</i> and less common in other text adventures. (Back when <i>Dunnet</i> appeared, most Emacs users had significant <a href=\"/wiki/Unix\" title=\"Unix\">Unix</a> knowledge.) The results of using this computer might be surprising, and the game becomes more difficult after that...\n</p>\n<pre><i>(after some failed logins)</i>\nlogin incorrect\n&gt;<b>shake tree</b>\nI don't see that here.\n&gt;<b>quit</b>\n\nYou have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.\n</pre>\n<p>And we have not yet scored any points!

game}}\n{{tocright}}\n\nA '''text adventure''' (or \"interactive fiction\") is a type of game commonly found on computer servers before someone had the idea to draw a map in [[ASCII]] characters, thus creating the [[roguelike]] games including ''[[NetHack]]''.\n\nAs the NetHack [[Guidebook]] explains it:\n\n: ''When NetHack's ancestor [[rogue]] first appeared, its screen orientation was almost unique among computer fantasy games. Since then, screen orientation has become the norm rather than the exception; NetHack continues this fine tradition. Unlike text adventure games that accept commands in pseudo-English sentences and explain the results in words, NetHack commands are all one or two keystrokes and the results are displayed graphically on the screen.''\n\n[https://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page Interactive Fiction wiki] is devoted to text adventures/interactive fiction. As NetHack has changed since the days of Rogue, text adventures have changed since the olden days.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Colossal Cave Adventure ===\n\n[[wikipedia:Colossal Cave Adventure|Colossal Cave Adventure]], first released in 1976, was an early (probably the first) text adventure game; indeed, the name ''text adventure'' comes from this game.\n\nAn online version of Colossal Cave Adventure is available at https://rickadams.org/adventure/ .\n\nMichael C. Toy and Glenn Wichman, two of the authors of [[Rogue]], enjoyed playing Colossal Cave Adventure.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20050205155632/http://www.wichman.org/roguehistory.html</ref>\n\n=== NetHack reimagined as a text adventure ===\n\nFor a relatable example, see the [http://www.nicolaas.net/dudley/index.php?f=20050308 strip of 8 March 2005] in ''[[Dudley's dungeon]]''.\n\n=== Dunnet ===\nThe text editor ''[[Wikipedia:Emacs|GNU Emacs]]'' contains a text adventure called ''dunnet'', written by Ron Schnell. This section features a sample session of dunnet to see what a text adventure is like.\n\n'''[[spoiler|Spoiler warning]]:''' ''The following demonstration contains plot spoilers for the text adventure \"dunnet\". '''If you do not want \"dunnet\" spoiled, do not read below this point.'''''\n\nOkay, since you feel okay with having the beginning of \"dunnet\" spoiled, let us go to a [[Unix]] machine with \"emacs\" installed and run the usual command to start \"dunnet\":\n\n $ '''emacs -batch -l dunnet'''\n\nNow the game starts:\n\n Dead end\n You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.\n In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The\n trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant\n from each other.\n There is a shovel here.\n >\n\nOkay. It is a text adventure, so instead of having an ASCII map, you must read through the description of an area. The name of this place is \"Dead end\", while \"There is a shovel here.\" is the usual way to indicate the presence of some [[item]], and substitutes for the <tt>(</tt> symbol in NetHack.\n\nCommands in text adventures are similar to English; they usually consist of \"verb\" or \"verb noun\", though some can be more complex than that. Let us try something:\n\n >'''shake tree'''\n\nThe result of this is:\n\n You begin to shake a tree, and notice a coconut begin to fall from the air.\n As you try to get your hand up to block it, you feel the impact as it lands\n on your head.\n You are dead.\n You have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.\n $\n\nOops. Maybe you were surprised that the game even understands the command \"shake tree\", but it is easy to die in old-school text adventures. (In more modern text adventures, instant deaths are less common.) Now the game has quit, and we have returned to the Unix shell prompt (here shown as [[$]]).\n\nNote, if you type \"eat shovel\" that also works!\n\n==== Manipulating the inventory ====\nThe [[inventory]] in a text adventure is analogous to the inventory in ''NetHack''; you can pick up, carry, drop, and use items. Let us start the game again and interact with the shovel:\n\n $ '''emacs -batch -l dunnet'''\n\nWe read about the dead end and the shovel again, then we try a command:\n\n >'''pick up shovel'''\n I don't understand that.\n >\n\nThat did not work. (In a more modern text adventure, \"pick up shovel\" would almost certainly work.) Though the '''help''' command has some hints, the ''Dunnet'' help does not explain much about the inventory. However, part of playing a text adventure is guessing some commands. Also, the inventory commands in ''Dunnet'' are similar to those in other text adventures.\n\nWe try a different command:\n\n >'''take shovel'''\n Taken.\n\nIf we look at this dead end again:\n\n >'''look'''\n Dead end\n You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.\n In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The\n trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant\n from each other.\n\nNote that \"There is a shovel here.\" is gone, because we took the shovel. However, if we look in the inventory:\n\n >'''inventory'''\n You currently have:\n A lamp\n A shovel\n\nWe have the shovel, and apparently we started the game with a lamp.\n\nNow let us try moving around. The word \"east\" from the description gives a hint:\n\n >'''east'''\n E/W Dirt road\n You are on the continuation of a dirt road.  There are more trees on\n both sides of you.  The road continues to the east and west.\n There is a large boulder here.\n >'''east'''\n Fork\n You are at a fork of two passages, one to the northeast, and one to the\n southeast.  The ground here seems very soft. You can also go back west.\n\n\"The ground here seems very soft.\" is a hint; players often need to examine the text for these hints. In this case, maybe this would be a good spot to [[apply]] the shovel.\n\n >'''shovel'''\n I don't understand that.\n >'''apply shovel'''\n I don't understand that.\n >'''dig'''\n I think you found something.\n\nThe first two commands did not work, but the third seems interesting. What did we find?\n\n >'''look'''\n Fork\n You are at a fork of two passages, one to the northeast, and one to the\n southeast.  The ground here seems very soft. You can also go back west.\n There is a CPU card here.\n >'''take cpu'''\n Taken.\n\n==== Entering the building ====\nAt the spot where we took the CPU card, we had the option to go northeast or southeast. We go northeast (most text adventures accept the shortcut '''ne''', equivalent to {{kbd|u}} in ''NetHack''):\n\n >ne\n NE/SW road\n You are on a northeast/southwest road.\n >ne\n Building front\n You are at the end of the road.  There is a building in front of you\n to the northeast, and the road leads back to the southwest.\n >ne\n You don't have a key that can open this door.\n\nThe need to find a [[key]] is a common theme in text adventure games. (Contrast ''NetHack'', where you can just [[kick]] most of the doors down, but then the locked doors are only random.)\n\nMaybe the key is on the other path?\n\n >'''sw'''\n NE/SW road\n >'''sw'''\n Fork\n >'''se'''\n SE/NW road\n You are on a southeast/northwest road.\n There is some food here.\n >'''take food'''\n Taken.\n >'''se'''\n Bear hangout\n You are standing at the end of a road.  A passage leads back to the\n northwest.\n There is a ferocious bear here!\n >'''fight bear'''\n I don't understand that.\n >'''attack bear'''\n I don't understand that.\n\nLuckily the game does not seem to understand our combat commands. This might have saved us, because fighting strong [[monster]]s is often an easy way to [[die]].\n\n >'''feed bear'''\n Done.\n The bear takes the food and runs away with it. He left something behind.\n\nWe had to use the food for something. This game does not seem so hard...\n\n >'''look'''\n Bear hangout\n You are standing at the end of a road.  A passage leads back to the\n northwest.\n There is a shiny brass key here.\n\nYes, that is exactly what we need! (Unless, of course, it is the wrong key for our door...)\n\n >'''take key'''\n Taken.\n >'''nw'''\n SE/NW road\n >'''nw'''\n Fork\n >'''ne'''\n NE/SW road\n >'''ne'''\n Building front\n >'''look'''\n Building front\n You are at the end of the road.  There is a building in front of you\n to the northeast, and the road leads back to the southwest.\n\nLet us check if this key works...\n\n >'''ne'''\n Old Building hallway\n You are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east\n and west, and doors leading out to the north and south.\n\n==== Enabling the computer ====\nWe are now in a building with rooms to the east and west. Let us try one of them:\n\n >'''west'''\n Computer room\n You are in a computer room.  It seems like most of the equipment has\n been removed.  There is a VAX 11/780 in front of you, however, with\n one of the cabinets wide open.  A sign on the front of the machine\n says: This VAX is named 'pokey'.  To type on the console, use the\n 'type' command.  The exit is to the east.\n The panel lights are steady and motionless.\n >'''type'''\n You type on the keyboard, but your characters do not even echo.\n\nWait, our inventory contains a CPU card:\n\n >'''inventory'''\n You currently have:\n A lamp\n A shovel\n A computer board\n A brass key\n\nMaybe we need to use this board in this computer?\n\n >'''read board'''\n The CPU board has a VAX chip on it.  It seems to have\n 2 Megabytes of RAM onboard.\n\nYes, the computer is a VAX, and this board is for a VAX, so maybe they match.\n\n >'''install board'''\n I don't understand that.\n >'''put board in vax'''\n As you put the CPU board in the computer, it immediately springs to life.\n The lights start flashing, and the fans seem to startup.\n\nThe command \"put ''X'' in ''Y''\" is common in text adventures, and seemed to work here.\n\n >'''type'''\n  \n \n UNIX System V, Release 2.2 (pokey)\n \n login:\n\nWe have the computer working, but we are not sure yet how to login. Computer use is peculiar to ''Dunnet'' and less common in other text adventures. (Back when ''Dunnet'' appeared, most Emacs users had significant [[Unix]] knowledge.) The results of using this computer might be surprising, and the game becomes more difficult after that...\n\n ''(after some failed logins)''\n login incorrect\n >'''shake tree'''\n I don't see that here.\n >'''quit'''\n \n You have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.\n\nAnd we have not yet scored any points! Hopefully, though, this demonstration gave you some of idea of what a text adventure is like.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[What Fools These Mortals]]'' ([http://www.crummy.com/software/WhatFools/ Home Page]) is a parody text adventure based in the NetHack world &mdash; played as one of the gods.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{noversion}}\n[[Category:Games]]"}

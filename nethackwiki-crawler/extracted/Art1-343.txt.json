The name of each ARTIFACT may have been\nabbreviated to fit in the table above; see below for the official name.\nArtifacts are special instances of ordinary objects, and have all of the\nbehaviors and properties of the ordinary ITEM in addition to those\ngranted by the particular artifact; they are however considerably more\nvaluable, as indicated by the COST field.\n\nThe GENER field specifies all of the possible ways that a particular\nartifact may be generated.  Each artifact can only be generated _once_\nper game -- it cannot be generated again, even if the player never found\nthe artifact, if the artifact is stolen, or if the artifact is destroyed.\nNote that in some cases, an ordinary object may be converted into an\nartifact, but no artifact will be converted into another artifact.  The\nmeaning of the letters are as follows:\n a  Humanoid angelic species have a 5% chance of being generated with a\n    blessed, rustproof Demonbane or Sunsword; 100% for Archons.\n b  All artifacts on the current level are saved when a character dies\n    and creates a bones file.  If a new character visits the same level\n    and loads the bones file, the same artifacts will be created, except\n    under the following conditions.  If the artifact was already created\n    in the new player's game or is the new player's Quest Artifact, then\n    the artifact reverts to its ordinary object.  The Unique Items\n    (Bell of Opening, Candelabrum of Invocation, Book of the Dead, and\n    Amulet of Yendor) will revert into ordinary objects (cursed bell,\n    pile of used candles, cursed spellbook of blank paper, and cursed\n    fake amulet of Yendor, respectively).\n c  If you pray and your god is very pleased, you may be crowned and get\n    a good artifact, though Wizards and Monks may instead receive a\n    spellbook of finger of death or restore ability respectively.  If a\n    lawful character is wielding an ordinary long sword when crowned, it\n    becomes Excalibur.  Neutrals get Vorpal Blade, regardless of what they\n    are wielding (if already wielding it, it goes \"snicker-snack!\").\n    Chaotics get Stormbringer, regardless of what they are wielding.  You\n    can only be crowned once.  If you were restricted to unskilled in the\n    weapon class of your alignment's artifact, the restriction is removed\n    so you may advance to basic skill.\n d  If you #dip a single ordinary long sword in a fountain, are at least\n    experience level 5, and Excalibur doesn't already exist in your game,\n    then there is a 1/6 chance of something special happening to your\n    long sword.  If you are lawful, the long sword is converted into\n    the blessed, rustless, uncorroded, damageproof Excalibur and you\n    exercise your wisdom.  If you are neutral or chaotic, your long\n    sword is cursed, loses its rustproofing, may lose an enchantment,\n    and you abuse your wisdom.\n g  This Unique Item is an essential part of the game, and can only be\n    obtained by killing (or stealing it from) the appropriate Nemesis.\n    These items are specially protected from being destroyed.  They\n    also do not count toward the number of artifacts that have been\n    generated.\n n  An ordinary item can be converted into this artifact by #naming it.\n    The item must be singular, not already an artifact, of the same type\n    as the new artifact, and the new artifact must not already exist.\n    Answer that you want to #name a single item, and provide the short\n    name of the artifact (i.e. \"Sting\" instead of \"elven dagger named\n    Sting\").\n o  This item may be given (non-cursed, and erodeproof if applicable) as\n    a gift from your god when #offering corpses.  You must sacrifice a\n    fresh corpse at a co-aligned altar, be in good standing with your god,\n    have non-negative luck, and be at least experience level 3. You will\n    only get artifacts that are of your alignment or none, and some\n    classes get certain artifacts as their first gift (if available).\n    Your first gift will always be co-aligned.\n    Orcs will never receive elven weapons, or vice versa.\n    The chance that you will be given a gift depends on the number of\n    artifacts already created in the game and how many of them were\n    gifts; the chance is 1/(10+(2*artifacts*gifts)).\n    If you receive a weapon artifact this way and were restricted in\n    its weapon class to unskilled, the restriction is removed so you\n    may advance to basic skill.\n r  This artifact may be randomly generated in place of a regular item\n    (1/20 chance for each weapon).  In particular, antique weapons\n    outlets appear to frequently carry artifacts because a large number\n    of weapons are randomly generated there.  The player-monsters on the\n    Astral Plane also have a 50% chance that the weapon they are\n    generated will be upgraded to one of these random artifacts.\n q  This is a Quest Artifact.  If you are of the same class as the\n    artifact, you can only obtain it by completing your Quest.\n    Otherwise it can only be obtained by bones levels or wishing.\n    If you are neither the same class nor the same alignment, you cannot\n    pick it up, wield it, or wear it.\n w  This artifact can be wished for.  You may specify either the short\n    name of the artifact (e.g. \"Magicbane\") or the long name (\"athame\n    named Magicbane\"); capitalization does not matter.  You cannot wish\n    for Unique Items or your own Quest Artifact; there are also\n    limitations on wishing for other classes' Quest Artifacts based on\n    your class and alignment (see \"q\" above).  The chance of getting an\n    artifact from each wish depends on the number of artifacts already\n    created in the game:\n        ARTIFACTS   0     1     2     3    4    5    6      n\n        CHANCE     100%  100%  2/3   2/4  2/5  2/6  2/7  2/(n+1)\n\nThe first letter of the ALN column indicates the alignment of the artifact\n(Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic), if any.  When playing a class which can have\nmultiple alignments, the alignment of the Quest Artifact will be adjusted\nto match the character's starting alignment.  A second letter specifies\nthe class aligned to the artifact; alignments of these artifacts will also\nbe adjusted if necessary. It also indicates which Quest Artifact belongs\nto each class, and for artifacts available as sacrifice gifts denotes that\nthe artifact is the guaranteed first gift for that class.  Intelligent\nartifacts are indicated with a ! symbol.  All three conditions are\nconsidered each time you attempt to wish for, pick up, wield, wear,\ninvoke, apply, or steal an artifact:\n *  If the artifact is intelligent, then in order to touch the artifact\n    safely, you must have the same alignment as the artifact, must be of\n    the same class (or no class is specified), must have non-negative\n    alignment, and must not be in the form of something the artifact\n    specially attacks. Otherwise, you will be blasted by the artifact's\n    power, sustain 4d10 damage (2d10 if you have magic resistance), and\n    abuse your wisdom.\n    If you are of the wrong class and fail at least one of the other\n    conditions above, then the artifact will furthermore \"evade your\n    grasp!\" and you will not be able to use it at all.  \n *  If the artifact is not intelligent, then you have only a 1/4 chance\n    of being blasted if you have a different alignment from the artifact\n    or have negative alignment (these two criteria not applying for\n    unaligned artifacts), or are in the form of something the artifact\n    specially attacks; damage is 4d4 (2d4 if you have magic resistance).\n    In any case, you will be able to use the artifact.\n *  Orcrist and Sting will never blast non-orcs.\nIntelligent artifacts furthermore have an 80% chance of resisting being\ncursed by \"malignant aura\"-type curses.\n\nThe +HIT column specifies any bonuses when calculating to-hit, and +DAM\nlists any bonuses or multiplier to damage.  For some artifacts, these\nadjustments only apply when hitting a specific type of monster.  See\nweap-343.txt to find out how these values are used in weapons calculations.\nAdditional damage due to level drain, bisecting, or beheading are not\nincluded in the table above, but are listed in the weapon descriptions\nbelow.  Note that the chance of certain weapon artifact effects are\nbased on your to-hit die roll.  This means that if you always hit a\nmonster, the effect occurs with the published percentage; however, if\nyou only hit a monster 1 in 20, then every hit you make causes the effect.\n\nThe ATTACK and DEFEND fields list a brief summary of the offensive and\ndefensive effects of each artifact; see the sections below for full\ndescriptions of each artifact's abilities.  The effects of the Bell of\nOpening, Candelabrum of Invocation, and Book of the Dead are documented\nin tool-343.txt.  The powers of the Amulet of Yendor are listed in\namul-343.txt.\n\n\nLawful artifacts\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n[Adapted from the spoilers \"artifacts\" by Boudewijn Waijers and \"damages\"\nby Henri Block and Hisashi Yoshida.]\n\nDemonbane\n  (lawful long sword)\n  Carried\n    No effect.\n  Wielded\n    +d5 to hit and x2 damage only against demons (all & except Death,\n    Pestilence, Famine, the mail daemon, sandestins, and djinn).\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n\nExcalibur\n  (lawful long sword)\n  Carried\n    No effect.\n  Wielded\n    +d5 to hit and +d10 damage to all monsters.\n    Confers level drain resistance and automatic searching.\n    Manual and automatic searching is more likely to succeed.\n    Even eyeless monsters will be able to locate you.\n    Demon princes will be generated hostile.\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n\nGrayswandir\n  (lawful silver saber)\n  Carried\n    No effect.\n  Wielded\n    +d5 to hit and x2 damage to all monsters.\n    Confers hallucination resistance.\n    Silver damage against silver-hating creatures (a normal effect of\n    silver sabers).\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n\nSnickersnee\n  (lawful katana)\n  Carried\n    No effect.\n  Wielded\n    +d8 damage to all monsters.\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n  Note: Do not confuse this artifact with Vorpal Blade.\n\nSunsword\n  (lawful long sword)\n  Carried\n    No effect\n  Wielded\n    +d5 to hit and x2 damage only against undead (ghosts, shades, and\n    all LMVWZ).\n    Acts as a light source.\n    Prevents blinding from light-based sources.\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n\nThe Orb of Detection\n  (lawful* Archeologist crystal ball)\n  Carried\n    Confers magic resistance and telepathy.\n    Half damage when attacked by spells.\n  Invoked\n    Toggles invisibility on/off.\n\nThe Sceptre of Might\n  (lawful* Caveman mace)\n  Carried\n    Confers magic resistance.\n  Wielded\n    +d5 to hit and x2 damage only against monsters not of its alignment.\n  Invoked\n    Toggles conflict on/off.\n\nThe Magic Mirror of Merlin\n  (lawful Knight mirror)\n  Carried\n    Confers magic resistance and telepathy.\n    Knights get double damage when: turning undead in any way; using\n    a spell of force bolt, magic missile, unskilled/basic cone of\n    cold, or drain life; or using a wand of striking.\n  Applied or wielded\n    Speaks to you (gives random rumour, from the true file if blessed,\n    the false file if cursed, or either if uncursed).\n\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n\nThe Mitre of Holiness\n  (lawful* Priest helm of brilliance)\n  Carried\n    Confers fire resistance.\n  Worn\n    Priests take half damage from undead (ghosts, shades, and all LMVWZ)\n    and demons (all & except Death, Pestilence, Famine, the mail daemon,\n    djinn, and sandestins).\n    Increase in intelligence and wisdom (normal helm effects).\n  Invoked\n    Boost in spell energy.\n\nThe Tsurugi of Muramasa\n  (lawful Samurai tsurugi)\n  Carried\n    Acts as luckstone.\n  Wielded\n    +d8 damage to all monsters.\n    5% chance (based on your to-hit roll) of extra damage:\n      Monsters engulfing you are instantly killed.\n      Damage is doubled against big monsters.\n      All other monsters are instantly killed.\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n\n\nNeutral artifacts\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n[Adapted from the spoilers \"artifacts\" by Boudewijn Waijers and \"damages\"\nby Henri Block and Hisashi Yoshida.]\n\nCleaver\n  (neutral* battle axe)\n  Carried\n    No effect.\n  Wielded\n    +d3 to hit and +d6 damage to all monsters.\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n\nGiantslayer\n  (neutral long sword)\n  Carried\n    No effect.\n  Wielded\n    +d5 to hit and x2 damage only against giants, stone giants, hill\n    giants, fire giants, frost giants, storm giants, giant mummies,\n    giant zombies, Cyclops, and Lord Surtur.

The name of each ARTIFACT may have been\nabbreviated to fit in the table above; see below for the official name.\nArtifacts are special instances of ordinary objects, and have all of the\nbehaviors and properties of the ordinary ITEM in addition to those\ngranted by the particular artifact; they are however considerably more\nvaluable, as indicated by the COST field.\n\nThe GENER field specifies all of the possible ways that a particular\nartifact may be generated.  Each artifact can only be generated _once_\nper game -- it cannot be generated again, even if the player never found\nthe artifact, if the artifact is stolen, or if the artifact is destroyed.\nNote that in some cases, an ordinary object may be converted into an\nartifact, but no artifact will be converted into another artifact.  The\nmeaning of the letters are as follows:\n a  Humanoid angelic species have a 5% chance of being generated with a\n    blessed, rustproof Demonbane or Sunsword; 100% for Archons.\n b  All artifacts on the current level are saved when a character dies\n    and creates a bones file.  If a new character visits the same level\n    and loads the bones file, the same artifacts will be created, except\n    under the following conditions.  If the artifact was already created\n    in the new player's game or is the new player's Quest Artifact, then\n    the artifact reverts to its ordinary object.  The Unique Items\n    (Bell of Opening, Candelabrum of Invocation, Book of the Dead, and\n    Amulet of Yendor) will revert into ordinary objects (cursed bell,\n    pile of used candles, cursed spellbook of blank paper, and cursed\n    fake amulet of Yendor, respectively).\n c  If you pray and your god is very pleased, you may be crowned and get\n    a good artifact, though Wizards and Monks may instead receive a\n    spellbook of finger of death or restore ability respectively.  If a\n    lawful character is wielding an ordinary long sword when crowned, it\n    becomes Excalibur.  Neutrals get Vorpal Blade, regardless of what they\n    are wielding (if already wielding it, it goes \"snicker-snack!\").\n    Chaotics get Stormbringer, regardless of what they are wielding.  You\n    can only be crowned once.  If you were restricted to unskilled in the\n    weapon class of your alignment's artifact, the restriction is removed\n    so you may advance to basic skill.\n d  If you #dip a single ordinary long sword in a fountain, are at least\n    experience level 5, and Excalibur doesn't already exist in your game,\n    then there is a 1/6 chance of something special happening to your\n    long sword.  If you are lawful, the long sword is converted into\n    the blessed, rustless, uncorroded, damageproof Excalibur and you\n    exercise your wisdom.  If you are neutral or chaotic, your long\n    sword is cursed, loses its rustproofing, may lose an enchantment,\n    and you abuse your wisdom.\n g  This Unique Item is an essential part of the game, and can only be\n    obtained by killing (or stealing it from) the appropriate Nemesis.\n    These items are specially protected from being destroyed.  They\n    also do not count toward the number of artifacts that have been\n    generated.\n n  An ordinary item can be converted into this artifact by #naming it.\n    The item must be singular, not already an artifact, of the same type\n    as the new artifact, and the new artifact must not already exist.\n    Answer that you want to #name a single item, and provide the short\n    name of the artifact (i.e. \"Sting\" instead of \"elven dagger named\n    Sting\").\n o  This item may be given (non-cursed, and erodeproof if applicable) as\n    a gift from your god when #offering corpses.  You must sacrifice a\n    fresh corpse at a co-aligned altar, be in good standing with your god,\n    have non-negative luck, and be at least experience level 3. You will\n    only get artifacts that are of your alignment or none, and some\n    classes get certain artifacts as their first gift (if available).\n    Your first gift will always be co-aligned.\n    Orcs will never receive elven weapons, or vice versa.\n    The chance that you will be given a gift depends on the number of\n    artifacts already created in the game and how many of them were\n    gifts; the chance is 1/(10+(2*artifacts*gifts)).\n    If you receive a weapon artifact this way and were restricted in\n    its weapon class to unskilled, the restriction is removed so you\n    may advance to basic skill.\n r  This artifact may be randomly generated in place of a regular item\n    (1/20 chance for each weapon).  In particular, antique weapons\n    outlets appear to frequently carry artifacts because a large number\n    of weapons are randomly generated there.  The player-monsters on the\n    Astral Plane also have a 50% chance that the weapon they are\n    generated will be upgraded to one of these random artifacts.\n q  This is a Quest Artifact.  If you are of the same class as the\n    artifact, you can only obtain it by completing your Quest.\n    Otherwise it can only be obtained by bones levels or wishing.\n    If you are neither the same class nor the same alignment, you cannot\n    pick it up, wield it, or wear it.\n w  This artifact can be wished for.  You may specify either the short\n    name of the artifact (e.g. \"Magicbane\") or the long name (\"athame\n    named Magicbane\"); capitalization does not matter.  You cannot wish\n    for Unique Items or your own Quest Artifact; there are also\n    limitations on wishing for other classes' Quest Artifacts based on\n    your class and alignment (see \"q\" above).  The chance of getting an\n    artifact from each wish depends on the number of artifacts already\n    created in the game:\n        ARTIFACTS   0     1     2     3    4    5    6      n\n        CHANCE     100%  100%  2/3   2/4  2/5  2/6  2/7  2/(n+1)\n\nThe first letter of the ALN column indicates the alignment of the artifact\n(Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic), if any.  When playing a class which can have\nmultiple alignments, the alignment of the Quest Artifact will be adjusted\nto match the character's starting alignment.  A second letter specifies\nthe class aligned to the artifact; alignments of these artifacts will also\nbe adjusted if necessary. It also indicates which Quest Artifact belongs\nto each class, and for artifacts available as sacrifice gifts denotes that\nthe artifact is the guaranteed first gift for that class.  Intelligent\nartifacts are indicated with a&#160;! symbol.  All three conditions are\nconsidered each time you attempt to wish for, pick up, wield, wear,\ninvoke, apply, or steal an artifact:\n *  If the artifact is intelligent, then in order to touch the artifact\n    safely, you must have the same alignment as the artifact, must be of\n    the same class (or no class is specified), must have non-negative\n    alignment, and must not be in the form of something the artifact\n    specially attacks. Otherwise, you will be blasted by the artifact's\n    power, sustain 4d10 damage (2d10 if you have magic resistance), and\n    abuse your wisdom.\n    If you are of the wrong class and fail at least one of the other\n    conditions above, then the artifact will furthermore \"evade your\n    grasp!\" and you will not be able to use it at all.  \n *  If the artifact is not intelligent, then you have only a 1/4 chance\n    of being blasted if you have a different alignment from the artifact\n    or have negative alignment (these two criteria not applying for\n    unaligned artifacts), or are in the form of something the artifact\n    specially attacks; damage is 4d4 (2d4 if you have magic resistance).\n    In any case, you will be able to use the artifact.\n *  Orcrist and Sting will never blast non-orcs.\nIntelligent artifacts furthermore have an 80% chance of resisting being\ncursed by \"malignant aura\"-type curses.\n\nThe +HIT column specifies any bonuses when calculating to-hit, and +DAM\nlists any bonuses or multiplier to damage.  For some artifacts, these\nadjustments only apply when hitting a specific type of monster.  See\nweap-343.txt to find out how these values are used in weapons calculations.\nAdditional damage due to level drain, bisecting, or beheading are not\nincluded in the table above, but are listed in the weapon descriptions\nbelow.  Note that the chance of certain weapon artifact effects are\nbased on your to-hit die roll.  This means that if you always hit a\nmonster, the effect occurs with the published percentage; however, if\nyou only hit a monster 1 in 20, then every hit you make causes the effect.\n\nThe ATTACK and DEFEND fields list a brief summary of the offensive and\ndefensive effects of each artifact; see the sections below for full\ndescriptions of each artifact's abilities.  The effects of the Bell of\nOpening, Candelabrum of Invocation, and Book of the Dead are documented\nin tool-343.txt.  The powers of the Amulet of Yendor are listed in\namul-343.txt.\n\n\nLawful artifacts\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n[Adapted from the spoilers \"artifacts\" by Boudewijn Waijers and \"damages\"\nby Henri Block and Hisashi Yoshida.]\n\nDemonbane\n  (lawful long sword)\n  Carried\n    No effect.\n  Wielded\n    +d5 to hit and x2 damage only against demons (all &amp; except Death,\n    Pestilence, Famine, the mail daemon, sandestins, and djinn).\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n\nExcalibur\n  (lawful long sword)\n  Carried\n    No effect.\n  Wielded\n    +d5 to hit and +d10 damage to all monsters.\n    Confers level drain resistance and automatic searching.\n    Manual and automatic searching is more likely to succeed.\n    Even eyeless monsters will be able to locate you.\n    Demon princes will be generated hostile.\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n\nGrayswandir\n  (lawful silver saber)\n  Carried\n    No effect.\n  Wielded\n    +d5 to hit and x2 damage to all monsters.\n    Confers hallucination resistance.\n    Silver damage against silver-hating creatures (a normal effect of\n    silver sabers).\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n\nSnickersnee\n  (lawful katana)\n  Carried\n    No effect.\n  Wielded\n    +d8 damage to all monsters.\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n  Note: Do not confuse this artifact with Vorpal Blade.\n\nSunsword\n  (lawful long sword)\n  Carried\n    No effect\n  Wielded\n    +d5 to hit and x2 damage only against undead (ghosts, shades, and\n    all LMVWZ).\n    Acts as a light source.\n    Prevents blinding from light-based sources.\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n\nThe Orb of Detection\n  (lawful* Archeologist crystal ball)\n  Carried\n    Confers magic resistance and telepathy.\n    Half damage when attacked by spells.\n  Invoked\n    Toggles invisibility on/off.\n\nThe Sceptre of Might\n  (lawful* Caveman mace)\n  Carried\n    Confers magic resistance.\n  Wielded\n    +d5 to hit and x2 damage only against monsters not of its alignment.\n  Invoked\n    Toggles conflict on/off.\n\nThe Magic Mirror of Merlin\n  (lawful Knight mirror)\n  Carried\n    Confers magic resistance and telepathy.\n    Knights get double damage when: turning undead in any way; using\n    a spell of force bolt, magic missile, unskilled/basic cone of\n    cold, or drain life; or using a wand of striking.\n  Applied or wielded\n    Speaks to you (gives random rumour, from the true file if blessed,\n    the false file if cursed, or either if uncursed).\n\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n\nThe Mitre of Holiness\n  (lawful* Priest helm of brilliance)\n  Carried\n    Confers fire resistance.\n  Worn\n    Priests take half damage from undead (ghosts, shades, and all LMVWZ)\n    and demons (all &amp; except Death, Pestilence, Famine, the mail daemon,\n    djinn, and sandestins).\n    Increase in intelligence and wisdom (normal helm effects).\n  Invoked\n    Boost in spell energy.\n\nThe Tsurugi of Muramasa\n  (lawful Samurai tsurugi)\n  Carried\n    Acts as luckstone.\n  Wielded\n    +d8 damage to all monsters.\n    5% chance (based on your to-hit roll) of extra damage:\n      Monsters engulfing you are instantly killed.\n      Damage is doubled against big monsters.\n      All other monsters are instantly killed.\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n\n\nNeutral artifacts\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n[Adapted from the spoilers \"artifacts\" by Boudewijn Waijers and \"damages\"\nby Henri Block and Hisashi Yoshida.]\n\nCleaver\n  (neutral* battle axe)\n  Carried\n    No effect.\n  Wielded\n    +d3 to hit and +d6 damage to all monsters.\n  Invoked\n    No effect.\n\nGiantslayer\n  (neutral long sword)\n  Carried\n    No effect.\n  Wielded\n    +d5 to hit and x2 damage only against giants, stone giants, hill\n    giants, fire giants, frost giants, storm giants, giant mummies,\n    giant zombies, Cyclops, and Lord Surtur.

A cursed object will be uncursed, while an uncursed object will be blessed; dipping a blessed object into holy water will simply produce an \"Interesting...\" message, and the potion is not consumed.\n\nInhaling vapors from a potion of holy water reverts you to human form if you have lycanthropy, but does not cure it; monsters hit with [thrown](/wiki/Throw \"Throw\") or [wielded](/wiki/Wield \"Wield\") potion of holy water take 2d6 damage if they are a [demon](/wiki/M2_DEMON \"M2 DEMON\"), [undead](/wiki/Undead \"Undead\"), or lycanthrope, and lycanthropes are additionally shifted to their human form.\n\n## Strategy\n\nHoly water is one of the many methods of [curse removal](/wiki/Curse_removal \"Curse removal\") *and* one of the few means of blessing objects, so it is considered essential for almost any player to have. When blessing and/or uncursing objects, always be sure to #[adjust](/wiki/Adjust \"Adjust\") them into a single stack first. If necessary, use #[name](/wiki/Name \"Name\") to remove names from any named objects so that you can stack them for dipping.\n\n### Blessing and uncursing items\n\nFrom the mid-game on—especially if you are frequently using [two-handed](/wiki/Two-handed \"Two-handed\") weapons—consider keeping holy water and other forms of [curse removal](/wiki/Curse_removal \"Curse removal\") in small caches on the current level, or other levels, that you can easily access. If wielding a cursed two-handed weapon, you can retreat to a cache in order to get it uncursed. You can also dedicate a separate container, such as a [sack](/wiki/Sack \"Sack\"), to holding holy water and other curse-removing items; as of [3.6.0](/wiki/3.6.0 \"3.6.0\"), you can #[tip](/wiki/Tip \"Tip\") containers, allowing you to get holy water in order to uncurse the two-handed weapon.\n\nEven once your primary tools and kit are blessed, you will benefit from keeping a few potions of holy water on hand, often to bless any useful items found later on, and especially to deal with [curse-slinging](/wiki/Curse_items \"Curse items\") [spellcasters](/wiki/Monster_spell \"Monster spell\"). Even for items that would display little to no real difference in function (such as most [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\")), blessing them can still offer vital protection—blessed objects targeted by a cursing effect will only become uncursed.\n\n### Identification\n\nIn [shops](/wiki/Shop \"Shop\"), holy water can be easily [identified](/wiki/Price_ID \"Price ID\") since uncursed potions of water have a base price of 0, and holy/unholy water has a base price of 100; a [pet](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\") can easily reveal the beatitude of a 100zm clear potion.\n\nDip-testing can be used to informally identify the BUC of water, and is best done after [pet testing](/wiki/Pet_testing \"Pet testing\") for any unholy water. Use a blessed, non-[iron](/wiki/Iron \"Iron\") item to do so - holy water will only produce a message without consuming the potion, while uncursed water will wet the item without consuming it (which also rusts iron objects). In theory, potions can be dipped to test if they are blessed before quaffing them, but this risks diluting the potion(s) and using up the water in the process; this is also not practical for testing if other unidentified items are blessed, as such a blessed item is usually discovered this way by accident.\n\n### Obtaining water\n\nThere are multiple other ways to obtain or produce holy water, each of which require other potions of water on hand, and all are discussed in the sections below. Potions of water can be created by some of the following methods:\n\n- \\#[Dipping](/wiki/Dip \"Dip\") another potion(s) into a [fountain](/wiki/Fountain \"Fountain\") or [body of water](/wiki/Moat \"Moat\") twice will first dilute it, and then convert it to an uncursed bottle of water regardless of its original BUC.\n  - Dropping potions in your inventory into a pool of water or walking into one with potions in your inventory works the same way, though both actions are much riskier. You will need a way to retrieve the potions afterward or a way to prevent water damage to the rest of your inventory.\n- [Cancelling](/wiki/Cancel \"Cancel\") will turn many potions into uncursed water; some other potions, such as [potions of sickness](/wiki/Potion_of_sickness \"Potion of sickness\") [and booze](/wiki/Potion_of_booze \"Potion of booze\"), will instead become [fruit juice](/wiki/Fruit_juice \"Fruit juice\"). See that article for more details.\n- Dipping a [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\") into a [potion of blindness](/wiki/Potion_of_blindness \"Potion of blindness\"), [confusion](/wiki/Potion_of_confusion \"Potion of confusion\"), or [hallucination](/wiki/Potion_of_hallucination \"Potion of hallucination\") will turn them into potions of water.\n\n#### Prayer and altars\n\nBy standing on a co-aligned [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\"), placing nonblessed potions of water on it and #[praying](/wiki/Pray \"Pray\") (while it is safe to do so), all of those potions will be blessed in addition to the regular results of a successful prayer; doing this at a cross-aligned altar will create unholy water instead and [anger](/wiki/Anger \"Anger\") your god. While prayer is not always readily available, praying to make holy water has the benefit of immediately blessing unholy water without using up other resources.\n\n#### Dipping into holy water\n\nIf you have at least one potion of holy water, you can #adjust all your uncursed potions of water into a single stack, then dip them into the holy water to bless the entire stack. This can be used to produce holy water more quickly and reliably than prayer, especially for a [crowned](/wiki/Crowned \"Crowned\") player, at the slight cost of using up one of the potions; unholy water takes two such dips to unbless, and prayer is preferable for converting unholy water that you do not plan to use later.\n\n#### Confused scrolls of remove curse\n\nReading a blessed [scroll of remove curse](/wiki/Scroll_of_remove_curse \"Scroll of remove curse\") while confused has a chance of either blessing or cursing each uncursed item or stack of items in your main inventory. Each has an independently calculated chance of either being blessed (25%), cursed (25%), or left alone (50%); additionally, all uncursed items will lose formal BUC identification. For example, if you are carrying 10 non-stacked uncursed potions of water, reading a blessed [scroll of remove curse](/wiki/Scroll_of_remove_curse \"Scroll of remove curse\") while confused gives you a 94.3% chance of holy water.\n\nThis method is often used to create both holy and unholy water, and requires the player to drop and/or stash their uncursed inventory, including any [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\"), [weapons](/wiki/Weapons \"Weapons\"), [jewelry](/wiki/Jewelry \"Jewelry\") or leashes. Once done, you can use the #adjust command to stack each of the potions and re-identify their beatitude by using an altar, [pet testing](/wiki/Pet_testing \"Pet testing\") them and/or dip-testing using a blessed non-iron object as mentioned above. For [atheists](/wiki/Atheist \"Atheist\"), this is one of the most reliable ways to obtain holy water and bless other items; using an altar in any way will break the conduct.\n\n### Conserving holy water\n\nWhich items 'deserve' blessing the most depends heavily on the player and their approach; there are still certain items that serve a ubiquitous purpose, sometimes to the point of frequently appearing in [ascension kits](/wiki/Ascension_kit \"Ascension kit\"). It is often very important to establish what items you will bless ahead of time in order to conserve the amount of holy water used. The following items are among the most common targets for blessing:\n\n- A blessed [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\") will divide the effective weight of its contents by four, comparing to an uncursed bag halving its contents' weight; this confers a great advantage in how much you can carry, lifting upwards of 200 units of weight off your back.\n- A blessed [scroll of charging](/wiki/Scroll_of_charging \"Scroll of charging\") gives a recharged item more charges on average than an uncursed scroll, and thus has a better chance of restoring it to its maximum capacity of uses. This is most useful for saving a \"2 blessed scrolls of charging\" [wish](/wiki/Wish \"Wish\") from a [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\").\n- If you use [ranged weapons](/wiki/Ranged_weapon \"Ranged weapon\"), which have a chance of disappearing, blessing them drastically lowers the chances they will do so.\n- A blessed [horn of plenty](/wiki/Horn_of_plenty \"Horn of plenty\") will produce blessed food and potions, useful for [foodless](/wiki/Foodless \"Foodless\") conduct.\n- A blessed [scroll of identify](/wiki/Scroll_of_identify \"Scroll of identify\") will usually identify more than one item, sometimes even your entire inventory.\n- A blessed [potion of gain level](/wiki/Potion_of_gain_level \"Potion of gain level\") advances your level and puts you part way to the next level, while an uncursed one only advances you to the bottom of the next level. Early on, this can be quite useful. Later, the XP requirements for advancing a level become so steep it doesn't help much, as advancing a level naturally would still require considerable farming.\n- A blessed [scroll of genocide](/wiki/Scroll_of_genocide \"Scroll of genocide\") will wipe out an entire [monster class](/wiki/Monster_class \"Monster class\") as opposed to only one species. The more monsters in the class, and the more dangerous they are, the better; [Liches](/wiki/Lich \"Lich\") are an especially common target.\n\n### Conduct considerations\n\n| Violates   | Method                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Atheist    | [Water prayer](/wiki/Water_prayer \"Water prayer\")                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Pacifist   | [Death drop](/wiki/Death_drop \"Death drop\"), e. g.

Said water is typically used for cleansing prior to baptism and spiritual cleansing in several religions, from Christianity to Sikhism; the use of holy water as a sacramental for protection against evil is common among Lutherans, Anglicans, Roman Catholics, and Eastern Christians.\n\n## Variants\n\n### SLASH'EM\n\nIn [SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\"), there are additional methods to obtain holy water:\n\n- The [potion of amnesia](/wiki/Potion_of_amnesia \"Potion of amnesia\") dilutes into a potion of water immediately when dipped into any water source. Unlike normal dipping, this does not change the beatitude, and can be used to create (un)holy water.\n- Some shops offer an uncursing service with a base price of 150 zorkmids before modifiers. If you are [hallucinating](/wiki/Hallucinating \"Hallucinating\"), there is a 1/4 chance the [shopkeeper](/wiki/Shopkeeper \"Shopkeeper\") will be distracted and accidentally bless the item. This is best done with an on-demand source of hallucination (e.g. the potion or tins of [yellow mold](/wiki/Yellow_mold \"Yellow mold\") or [violet fungus](/wiki/Violet_fungus \"Violet fungus\")), a good deal of credit with the shopkeeper, an engraved or burnt [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") to avoid accidents, and a unicorn horn to cure the hallucination after. Remember that hallucination in [SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\") also messes with viewing your inventory 0 don't forget the inventory letter for your potions of water.\n- Occasionally upon [sacrifice](/wiki/Sacrifice \"Sacrifice\") at an [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\"), your god will bless the object in your primary or off-hand. This can be used with wielded potions of water; press [x](/wiki/X \"X\") to swap them, and sacrifice until they become holy.\n\n### dNetHack\n\nIn [dNetHack](/wiki/DNetHack \"DNetHack\"), you can also use shopkeeper services in the same way as SLASH'EM to create holy water. Additionally, a [Binder](/wiki/Binder \"Binder\") that binds [Marionette](/wiki/User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Roles/Binder/Marionette \"User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack Roles/Binder/Marionette\") is forbidden from drinking holy water.\n\n[The Windowless Tower](/wiki/User:Chris/dNetHack/Windowless_Tower \"User:Chris/dNetHack/Windowless Tower\") has a niche with four potions of holy water on its second floor.\n\n### EvilHack\n\nIn [EvilHack](/wiki/EvilHack \"EvilHack\"), [player monster](/wiki/Player_monster \"Player monster\") [priests](/wiki/Priest_\\(player_monster\\) \"Priest (player monster)\") and (less commonly) [wizards](/wiki/Wizard_\\(player_monster\\) \"Wizard (player monster)\") can be encountered carrying holy water.\n\n## Encyclopedia entry\n\n\"We want a word with you,\" said Ligur (in a tone of voice  \nintended to imply that \"word\" was synonymous with \"horrifically  \npainful eternity\"), and the squat demon pushed open the office  \ndoor.  \nThe bucket teetered, then fell neatly on Ligur's head.  \nDrop a lump of sodium in water. Watch it flame and burn and  \nspin around crazily, flaring and sputtering. This was like  \nthat, just nastier.  \nThe demon peeled and flared and flickered. Oily brown smoke  \noozed from it, and it screamed and it screamed and it screamed.  \nThen it crumpled, folded in on itself, and what was left lay  \nglistening on the burnt and blackened circle of carpet, looking  \nlike a handful of mashed slugs.  \n\"Hi,\" said Crowley to Hastur, who had been walking behind Ligur,  \nand had unfortunately not been so much as splashed.  \nThere are some things that are unthinkable; there are some  \ndepths that not even demons would believe other demons would  \nstoop to.  \n\". . . Holy water. You bastard,\" said Hastur. \"You complete  \n\\_bastard\\_. He hadn't never done nothing to \\_you\\_.\"  \n\"Yet,\" corrected Crowley.\n\n\\[ Good Omens, by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett ]\n\n## See also\n\n- [Unholy water](/wiki/Unholy_water \"Unholy water\")\n- [Potion of water](/wiki/Potion_of_water \"Potion of water\")\n\n[![This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.4.

When blessing and/or uncursing objects, always be sure to #<a href=\"/wiki/Adjust\" title=\"Adjust\">adjust</a> them into a single stack first. If necessary, use #<a href=\"/wiki/Name\" title=\"Name\">name</a> to remove names from any named objects so that you can stack them for dipping.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Blessing_and_uncursing_items\">Blessing and uncursing items</span></h3>\n<p>From the mid-game on&#8212;especially if you are frequently using <a href=\"/wiki/Two-handed\" title=\"Two-handed\">two-handed</a> weapons&#8212;consider keeping holy water and other forms of <a href=\"/wiki/Curse_removal\" title=\"Curse removal\">curse removal</a> in small caches on the current level, or other levels, that you can easily access. If wielding a cursed two-handed weapon, you can retreat to a cache in order to get it uncursed. You can also dedicate a separate container, such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Sack\" title=\"Sack\">sack</a>, to holding holy water and other curse-removing items; as of <a href=\"/wiki/3.6.0\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"3.6.0\">3.6.0</a>, you can #<a href=\"/wiki/Tip\" title=\"Tip\">tip</a> containers, allowing you to get holy water in order to uncurse the two-handed weapon.\n</p><p>Even once your primary tools and kit are blessed, you will benefit from keeping a few potions of holy water on hand, often to bless any useful items found later on, and especially to deal with <a href=\"/wiki/Curse_items\" title=\"Curse items\">curse-slinging</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Monster_spell\" title=\"Monster spell\">spellcasters</a>. Even for items that would display little to no real difference in function (such as most <a href=\"/wiki/Armor\" title=\"Armor\">armor</a>), blessing them can still offer vital protection&#8212;blessed objects targeted by a cursing effect will only become uncursed.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Identification\">Identification</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Shop\" title=\"Shop\">shops</a>, holy water can be easily <a href=\"/wiki/Price_ID\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Price ID\">identified</a> since uncursed potions of water have a base price of 0, and holy/unholy water has a base price of 100; a <a href=\"/wiki/Pet\" title=\"Pet\">pet</a> can easily reveal the beatitude of a 100zm clear potion.\n</p><p>Dip-testing can be used to informally identify the BUC of water, and is best done after <a href=\"/wiki/Pet_testing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pet testing\">pet testing</a> for any unholy water. Use a blessed, non-<a href=\"/wiki/Iron\" title=\"Iron\">iron</a> item to do so - holy water will only produce a message without consuming the potion, while uncursed water will wet the item without consuming it (which also rusts iron objects). In theory, potions can be dipped to test if they are blessed before quaffing them, but this risks diluting the potion(s) and using up the water in the process; this is also not practical for testing if other unidentified items are blessed, as such a blessed item is usually discovered this way by accident.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Obtaining_water\">Obtaining water</span></h3>\n<p>There are multiple other ways to obtain or produce holy water, each of which require other potions of water on hand, and all are discussed in the sections below. Potions of water can be created by some of the following methods:\n</p>\n<ul><li>#<a href=\"/wiki/Dip\" title=\"Dip\">Dipping</a> another potion(s) into a <a href=\"/wiki/Fountain\" title=\"Fountain\">fountain</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Moat\" title=\"Moat\">body of water</a> twice will first dilute it, and then convert it to an uncursed bottle of water regardless of its original BUC.\n<ul><li>Dropping potions in your inventory into a pool of water or walking into one with potions in your inventory works the same way, though both actions are much riskier. You will need a way to retrieve the potions afterward or a way to prevent water damage to the rest of your inventory.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Cancel\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cancel\">Cancelling</a> will turn many potions into uncursed water; some other potions, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_sickness\" title=\"Potion of sickness\">potions of sickness</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_booze\" title=\"Potion of booze\">and booze</a>, will instead become <a href=\"/wiki/Fruit_juice\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fruit juice\">fruit juice</a>. See that article for more details.</li>\n<li>Dipping a <a href=\"/wiki/Unicorn_horn\" title=\"Unicorn horn\">unicorn horn</a> into a <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_blindness\" title=\"Potion of blindness\">potion of blindness</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_confusion\" title=\"Potion of confusion\">confusion</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_hallucination\" title=\"Potion of hallucination\">hallucination</a> will turn them into potions of water.</li></ul>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Prayer_and_altars\">Prayer and altars</span></h4>\n<p>By standing on a co-aligned <a href=\"/wiki/Altar\" title=\"Altar\">altar</a>, placing nonblessed potions of water on it and #<a href=\"/wiki/Pray\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pray\">praying</a> (while it is safe to do so), all of those potions will be blessed in addition to the regular results of a successful prayer; doing this at a cross-aligned altar will create unholy water instead and <a href=\"/wiki/Anger\" title=\"Anger\">anger</a> your god. While prayer is not always readily available, praying to make holy water has the benefit of immediately blessing unholy water without using up other resources.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dipping_into_holy_water\">Dipping into holy water</span></h4>\n<p>If you have at least one potion of holy water, you can #adjust all your uncursed potions of water into a single stack, then dip them into the holy water to bless the entire stack. This can be used to produce holy water more quickly and reliably than prayer, especially for a <a href=\"/wiki/Crowned\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crowned\">crowned</a> player, at the slight cost of using up one of the potions; unholy water takes two such dips to unbless, and prayer is preferable for converting unholy water that you do not plan to use later.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Confused_scrolls_of_remove_curse\">Confused scrolls of remove curse</span></h4>\n<p>Reading a blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_remove_curse\" title=\"Scroll of remove curse\">scroll of remove curse</a> while confused has a chance of either blessing or cursing each uncursed item or stack of items in your main inventory. Each has an independently calculated chance of either being blessed (25%), cursed (25%), or left alone (50%); additionally, all uncursed items will lose formal BUC identification. For example, if you are carrying 10 non-stacked uncursed potions of water, reading a blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_remove_curse\" title=\"Scroll of remove curse\">scroll of remove curse</a> while confused gives you a 94.3% chance of holy water.\n</p><p>This method is often used to create both holy and unholy water, and requires the player to drop and/or stash their uncursed inventory, including any <a href=\"/wiki/Armor\" title=\"Armor\">armor</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Weapons\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Weapons\">weapons</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Jewelry\" title=\"Jewelry\">jewelry</a> or leashes. Once done, you can use the #adjust command to stack each of the potions and re-identify their beatitude by using an altar, <a href=\"/wiki/Pet_testing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pet testing\">pet testing</a> them and/or dip-testing using a blessed non-iron object as mentioned above. For <a href=\"/wiki/Atheist\" title=\"Atheist\">atheists</a>, this is one of the most reliable ways to obtain holy water and bless other items; using an altar in any way will break the conduct.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Conserving_holy_water\">Conserving holy water</span></h3>\n<p>Which items 'deserve' blessing the most depends heavily on the player and their approach; there are still certain items that serve a ubiquitous purpose, sometimes to the point of frequently appearing in <a href=\"/wiki/Ascension_kit\" title=\"Ascension kit\">ascension kits</a>. It is often very important to establish what items you will bless ahead of time in order to conserve the amount of holy water used. The following items are among the most common targets for blessing:\n</p>\n<ul><li>A blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Bag_of_holding\" title=\"Bag of holding\">bag of holding</a> will divide the effective weight of its contents by four, comparing to an uncursed bag halving its contents' weight; this confers a great advantage in how much you can carry, lifting upwards of 200 units of weight off your back.</li>\n<li>A blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_charging\" title=\"Scroll of charging\">scroll of charging</a> gives a recharged item more charges on average than an uncursed scroll, and thus has a better chance of restoring it to its maximum capacity of uses. This is most useful for saving a \"2 blessed scrolls of charging\" <a href=\"/wiki/Wish\" title=\"Wish\">wish</a> from a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_wishing\" title=\"Wand of wishing\">wand of wishing</a>.</li>\n<li>If you use <a href=\"/wiki/Ranged_weapon\" title=\"Ranged weapon\">ranged weapons</a>, which have a chance of disappearing, blessing them drastically lowers the chances they will do so.</li>\n<li>A blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Horn_of_plenty\" title=\"Horn of plenty\">horn of plenty</a> will produce blessed food and potions, useful for <a href=\"/wiki/Foodless\" title=\"Foodless\">foodless</a> conduct.</li>\n<li>A blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_identify\" title=\"Scroll of identify\">scroll of identify</a> will usually identify more than one item, sometimes even your entire inventory.</li>\n<li>A blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_gain_level\" title=\"Potion of gain level\">potion of gain level</a> advances your level and puts you part way to the next level, while an uncursed one only advances you to the bottom of the next level.

|color=cyan\n |tile=[[Image:Clear potion.png]]\n |name=holy water\n |appearance=blessed clear potion\n |cost=100\n}}\nThe '''potion of holy water''' is a [[blessed]] [[potion of water]], and appears as a \"blessed clear potion\" when unidentified.\n\n==Generation==\nAll [[Priest|Priest(esse)s]] start the game with 4 potions of holy water, and [[Wizard]]s have a chance of starting the game with holy water as one of their random potions.\n\nIn addition to random generation, Shops sell holy water in 14.4% of all non-[[Tourist]] dungeons. \n\nA [[horn of plenty]] may occasionally produce a potion of water when [[applied]], which will also be blessed if the horn is blessed.\n\n==Description==\n[[Quaff]]ing a potion of holy water cures [[lycanthropy]] and, for non-[[chaotic]]s, cures all [[illness]]es; chaotics will take 2d6 damage instead of having illnesses cured.\n\nYou can #[[dip]] an [[object]] (or stack of objects) into holy water to uncurse or bless them, using up one potion of holy water; objects dipped into holy water do not become [[wet]]. A cursed object will be uncursed, while an uncursed object will be blessed; dipping a blessed object into holy water will simply produce an \"Interesting...\" message, and the potion is not consumed.\n\nInhaling vapors from a potion of holy water reverts you to human form if you have lycanthropy, but does not cure it; monsters hit with [[throw]]n or [[wield]]ed potion of holy water take 2d6 damage if they are a [[M2_DEMON|demon]], [[undead]], or lycanthrope, and lycanthropes are additionally shifted to their human form.\n\n==Strategy==\nHoly water is one of the many methods of [[curse removal]] ''and'' one of the few means of blessing objects, so it is considered essential for almost any player to have. When blessing and/or uncursing objects, always be sure to #[[adjust]] them into a single stack first. If necessary, use #[[name]] to remove names from any named objects so that you can stack them for dipping.\n\n===Blessing and uncursing items===\nFrom the mid-game on&mdash;especially if you are frequently using [[two-handed]] weapons&mdash;consider keeping holy water and other forms of [[curse removal]] in small caches on the current level, or other levels, that you can easily access. If wielding a cursed two-handed weapon, you can retreat to a cache in order to get it uncursed. You can also dedicate a separate container, such as a [[sack]], to holding holy water and other curse-removing items; as of [[3.6.0]], you can #[[tip]] containers, allowing you to get holy water in order to uncurse the two-handed weapon.\n\nEven once your primary tools and kit are blessed, you will benefit from keeping a few potions of holy water on hand, often to bless any useful items found later on, and especially to deal with [[curse items|curse-slinging]] [[monster spell|spellcasters]]. Even for items that would display little to no real difference in function (such as most [[armor]]), blessing them can still offer vital protection&mdash;blessed objects targeted by a cursing effect will only become uncursed.\n\n===Identification===\nIn [[shop]]s, holy water can be easily [[Price ID|identified]] since uncursed potions of water have a base price of 0, and holy/unholy water has a base price of 100; a [[pet]] can easily reveal the beatitude of a 100zm clear potion.\n\nDip-testing can be used to informally identify the BUC of water, and is best done after [[pet testing]] for any unholy water. Use a blessed, non-[[iron]] item to do so - holy water will only produce a message without consuming the potion, while uncursed water will wet the item without consuming it (which also rusts iron objects). In theory, potions can be dipped to test if they are blessed before quaffing them, but this risks diluting the potion(s) and using up the water in the process; this is also not practical for testing if other unidentified items are blessed, as such a blessed item is usually discovered this way by accident.\n\n===Obtaining water===\nThere are multiple other ways to obtain or produce holy water, each of which require other potions of water on hand, and all are discussed in the sections below. Potions of water can be created by some of the following methods:\n\n* #[[Dip]]ping another potion(s) into a [[fountain]] or [[moat|body of water]] twice will first dilute it, and then convert it to an uncursed bottle of water regardless of its original BUC.\n** Dropping potions in your inventory into a pool of water or walking into one with potions in your inventory works the same way, though both actions are much riskier. You will need a way to retrieve the potions afterward or a way to prevent water damage to the rest of your inventory.\n* [[Cancel]]ling will turn many potions into uncursed water; some other potions, such as [[potion of sickness|potions of sickness]] [[potion of booze|and booze]], will instead become [[fruit juice]]. See that article for more details.\n* Dipping a [[unicorn horn]] into a [[potion of blindness]], [[potion of confusion|confusion]], or [[potion of hallucination|hallucination]] will turn them into potions of water.\n\n====Prayer and altars====\nBy standing on a co-aligned [[altar]], placing nonblessed potions of water on it and #[[pray]]ing (while it is safe to do so), all of those potions will be blessed in addition to the regular results of a successful prayer; doing this at a cross-aligned altar will create unholy water instead and [[anger]] your god. While prayer is not always readily available, praying to make holy water has the benefit of immediately blessing unholy water without using up other resources.\n\n====Dipping into holy water====\nIf you have at least one potion of holy water, you can #adjust all your uncursed potions of water into a single stack, then dip them into the holy water to bless the entire stack. This can be used to produce holy water more quickly and reliably than prayer, especially for a [[crowned]] player, at the slight cost of using up one of the potions; unholy water takes two such dips to unbless, and prayer is preferable for converting unholy water that you do not plan to use later.\n\n====Confused scrolls of remove curse====\nReading a blessed [[scroll of remove curse]] while confused has a chance of either blessing or cursing each uncursed item or stack of items in your main inventory. Each has an independently calculated chance of either being blessed (25%), cursed (25%), or left alone (50%); additionally, all uncursed items will lose formal BUC identification. For example, if you are carrying 10 non-stacked uncursed potions of water, reading a blessed [[scroll of remove curse]] while confused gives you a 94.3% chance of holy water.\n\nThis method is often used to create both holy and unholy water, and requires the player to drop and/or stash their uncursed inventory, including any [[armor]], [[weapons]], [[jewelry]] or leashes. Once done, you can use the #adjust command to stack each of the potions and re-identify their beatitude by using an altar, [[pet testing]] them and/or dip-testing using a blessed non-iron object as mentioned above. For [[atheist]]s, this is one of the most reliable ways to obtain holy water and bless other items; using an altar in any way will break the conduct.\n\n===Conserving holy water===\nWhich items 'deserve' blessing the most depends heavily on the player and their approach; there are still certain items that serve a ubiquitous purpose, sometimes to the point of frequently appearing in [[ascension kit]]s. It is often very important to establish what items you will bless ahead of time in order to conserve the amount of holy water used. The following items are among the most common targets for blessing:\n\n* A blessed [[bag of holding]] will divide the effective weight of its contents by four, comparing to an uncursed bag halving its contents' weight; this confers a great advantage in how much you can carry, lifting upwards of 200 units of weight off your back.\n* A blessed [[scroll of charging]] gives a recharged item more charges on average than an uncursed scroll, and thus has a better chance of restoring it to its maximum capacity of uses. This is most useful for saving a \"2 blessed scrolls of charging\" [[wish]] from a [[wand of wishing]].\n* If you use [[ranged weapon]]s, which have a chance of disappearing, blessing them drastically lowers the chances they will do so.\n* A blessed [[horn of plenty]] will produce blessed food and potions, useful for [[foodless]] conduct.\n* A blessed [[scroll of identify]] will usually identify more than one item, sometimes even your entire inventory.\n* A blessed [[potion of gain level]] advances your level and puts you part way to the next level, while an uncursed one only advances you to the bottom of the next level.  Early on, this can be quite useful.  Later, the XP requirements for advancing a level become so steep it doesn't help much, as advancing a level naturally would still require considerable farming.\n* A blessed [[scroll of genocide]] will wipe out an entire [[monster class]] as opposed to only one species. The more monsters in the class, and the more dangerous they are, the better; [[Lich]]es are an especially common target.\n\n===Conduct considerations===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Violates!!Method\n|-\n|Atheist||[[Water prayer]]\n|-\n|Pacifist||[[Death drop]], e. g. [[pudding farming]]\n|-\n|Illiterate||[[Confused]] [[scroll of remove curse]] technique\n|-\n|Polypile||[[polypile|Polymorph]] [[blessed]] [[potion]]s (e. g. from [[throne farming]]) (to accomplish this without breaking any other conducts, identify blessed potions by comparing the sizes of your potion stacks and making use of the fact that uncursed potions are 6 times as likely as blessed ones.)\n|-\n|Wishless||[[Wish]] for it directly (or for a blessed horn of plenty)\n|-\n|\"Scumming\"||Find it, e.g. in starting inventory ([[wizard]] 3.6% chance, [[priest]] 100%), in [[shop]]s, or in [[bones]] files.\n|}\n\nThis is an exhaustive list of ways to make holy water; 53% of all games randomly generate holy water in the [[Mines]] or the [[Dungeons of Doom|main dungeons]] down to [[Medusa's Island]].\n\n==History==\nAll potions of water were introduced in [[NetHack 1.3d]].\n\n==Messages==\n{{message|You feel full of awe.|You quaffed a potion of holy water, and are lawful or neutral.}}\n{{message|This burns like acid!|As above, but you are chaotic.}}\n{{message|<[[foo]]> glows amber.|You dipped a cursed object into a potion of holy water, and it is now uncursed.}}\n{{message|<[[foo]]> glows light blue.|You dipped an uncursed object into a potion of holy water, and it is now blessed.}}\n\nAfter receiving any of the above message, you will be prompted to type-name the potion if you had not already identified it.\n\n==Origin==\n{{wikipedia|Holy water}}\nThe religion-related functions of holy water, and the fact that Priests start the game with some, are derived from the religious practices of water being blessed by a member of the clergy or other significant figure (or conversely, derived from a well or spring that considered holy). Said water is typically used for cleansing prior to baptism and spiritual cleansing in several religions, from Christianity to Sikhism; the use of holy water as a sacramental for protection against evil is common among Lutherans, Anglicans, Roman Catholics, and Eastern Christians.\n\n==Variants==\n===SLASH'EM===\nIn [[SLASH'EM]], there are additional methods to obtain holy water:\n\n* The [[potion of amnesia]] dilutes into a potion of water immediately when dipped into any water source. Unlike normal dipping, this does not change the beatitude, and can be used to create (un)holy water.\n* Some shops offer an uncursing service with a base price of 150 zorkmids before modifiers. If you are [[hallucinating]], there is a 1/4 chance the [[shopkeeper]] will be distracted and accidentally bless the item. This is best done with an on-demand source of hallucination (e.g. the potion or tins of [[yellow mold]] or [[violet fungus]]), a good deal of credit with the shopkeeper, an engraved or burnt [[Elbereth]] to avoid accidents, and a unicorn horn to cure the hallucination after. Remember that hallucination in [[SLASH'EM]] also messes with viewing your inventory 0 don't forget the inventory letter for your potions of water.\n* Occasionally upon [[sacrifice]] at an [[altar]], your god will bless the object in your primary or off-hand. This can be used with wielded potions of water; press {{kbd|x}} to swap them, and sacrifice until they become holy.\n\n===dNetHack===\nIn [[dNetHack]], you can also use shopkeeper services in the same way as SLASH'EM to create holy water. Additionally, a [[Binder]] that binds [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack Roles/Binder/Marionette|Marionette]] is forbidden from drinking holy water.\n\n[[User:Chris/dNetHack/Windowless Tower|The Windowless Tower]] has a niche with four potions of holy water on its second floor.\n\n===EvilHack===\nIn [[EvilHack]], [[player monster]] [[Priest (player monster)|priests]] and (less commonly) [[Wizard (player monster)|wizards]] can be encountered carrying holy water.\n\n==Encyclopedia entry==\n{{encyclopedia|\n\"We want a word with you,\" said Ligur (in a tone of voice\nintended to imply that \"word\" was synonymous with \"horrifically\npainful eternity\"), and the squat demon pushed open the office\ndoor.\nThe bucket teetered, then fell neatly on Ligur's head.\nDrop a lump of sodium in water.  Watch it flame and burn and\nspin around crazily, flaring and sputtering.  This was like\nthat, just nastier.\nThe demon peeled and flared and flickered.  Oily brown smoke\noozed from it, and it screamed and it screamed and it screamed.\nThen it crumpled, folded in on itself, and what was left lay\nglistening on the burnt and blackened circle of carpet, looking\nlike a handful of mashed slugs.\n\"Hi,\" said Crowley to Hastur, who had been walking behind Ligur,\nand had unfortunately not been so much as splashed.\nThere are some things that are unthinkable; there are some\ndepths that not even demons would believe other demons would\nstoop to.\n\". . . Holy water.  You bastard,\" said Hastur.  \"You complete\n_bastard_.  He hadn't never done nothing to _you_.\"\n\"Yet,\" corrected Crowley.\n|[ Good Omens, by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett ]\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Unholy water]]\n* [[Potion of water]]\n{{nethack-364|offset=1}}\n{{featured}}\n[[Category:Potions|Holy water]]"}

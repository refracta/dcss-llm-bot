This gives the resulting character all the abilities of a mind flayer combined with those of the selected race, but they are **not** immune to brain-sucking attacks themselves.\n\n## EvilHack\n\nFirst introduced in version 0.4.0, EvilHack portrays illithids as an ancient race with psychic abilities and natural spellcasting ability, but they are physically weak compared to other beings.[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1)\n\nIllithids are a [chaotic](/wiki/Chaotic \"Chaotic\") race, and can be played as a [Convict](/wiki/Convict \"Convict\"), [Infidel](/wiki/Infidel \"Infidel\"), [Priest](/wiki/Priest \"Priest\"), or [Wizard](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\").\n\n### Racial benefits and restrictions\n\nPlayer illithids have [infravision](/wiki/Infravision \"Infravision\"), and gain more power generation per level than even [elven](/wiki/Elf_\\(starting_race\\) \"Elf (starting race)\") characters. They possess a natural [psionic wave](/index.php?title=Psionic_wave\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Psionic wave (page does not exist)\") attack that can confuse and kill monsters: the ability uses spell [power](/wiki/Power \"Power\"), but is not considered a spell for the purposes of spell hunger, failure due to metallic armor, and interactions with the [Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor \"Amulet of Yendor\"); [metallic](/wiki/Metallic \"Metallic\") [helms](/wiki/Helm \"Helm\") that are not [mithril](/wiki/Mithril \"Mithril\") block the ability to use the psionic wave, and illithids that have their race changed lose the ability until they return to normal (i.e., in the case of crowning as an Infidel, it is lost indefinitely). Illithids that use their psionic wave while wearing a mithril or non-metallic [helm of telepathy](/wiki/Helm_of_telepathy \"Helm of telepathy\") have a 1⁄4 chance of the helm focusing the attack and increasing its damage by d6+2.\n\nIllithids start out with intrinsic [psychic resistance](/index.php?title=Psychic_resistance\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Psychic resistance (page does not exist)\") and [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\"), and gain [flight](/wiki/Flight \"Flight\") at level 12 like other mind flayers.\n\nIllithids have a single extra tentacle attack that behaves exactly like the tentacle attack from a mind flayer, but will not be used if attacking something the character should not touch unprotected (e.g., [cockatrices](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\")). Mind flayers and other monsters with psychic resistance are immune to intelligence drain from brain-eating attacks, and a player illithid is likewise immune to having their own brain eaten (but not to any other effects, such as possibly-fatal [illness](/wiki/Illness \"Illness\") from a zombie bite).\n\n#### Attribute caps\n\n| Character [Race](/wiki/Race \"Race\") | [Strength](/wiki/Strength \"Strength\") | [Dexterity](/wiki/Dexterity \"Dexterity\") | [Constitution](/wiki/Constitution \"Constitution\") | [Intelligence](/wiki/Intelligence \"Intelligence\") | [Wisdom](/wiki/Wisdom \"Wisdom\") | [Charisma](/wiki/Charisma \"Charisma\") |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| Illithid                            | 10                                    | 20                                       | 12                                                | 22                                                | 22                              | 16                                    |\n\nIllithids have exceptional agility and mental prowess that surpass even elves, but are the weakest among playable races in terms of physical strength.\n\n#### Price adjustments\n\nThe following price adjustments are used for illithid interactions with [racial](/wiki/Racial_monster \"Racial monster\") [shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper \"Shopkeeper\"):\n\n|          | Shopkeeper's race |     |       |     |                                                            |          |         |                                                          |       |\n| -------- | ----------------- | --- | ----- | --- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |\n|          | Human/Other       | Elf | Dwarf | Orc | Gnome                                                      | Illithid | Centaur | Nymph                                                    | Giant |\n| Illithid | ×1                | ×2  | ×2    | ×1  | ×3⁄2 if [INT](/wiki/Int \"Int\") is ≤14 ×4⁄3 if INT is 15-17 | ×1       | ×3⁄2    | ×4⁄3 if [CHA](/wiki/Cha \"Cha\") is ≥15 ×5⁄3 if CHA is <15 | ×4⁄3  |\n\nOf note is that player illithids are the only race not subjected to a 1000% markup from illithid shopkeepers.\n\n### Starting equipment\n\nIn addition to normal starting equipment for their role, illithids always start with the [psionic wave](/index.php?title=Psionic_wave\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Psionic wave (page does not exist)\") ability; in previous versions, a \"spellbook\" of the ability would be included in the initial inventory of any non-Convict illithid.\n\n### Strategy\n\nThe illithid's psychic resistance makes them immune to zombification, providing insulation against one of the biggest early-game threats in EvilHack's revamped zombies. However, they can still die as a result of the bites being poisoned, and their low strength and constitution caps make them incredibly frail. Their carrying capacity is also quite low, making a [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\") an even more vital resource for them due to the weight reduction.\n\nEarly [wishes](/wiki/Wish \"Wish\") for illithids often include [gauntlets of power](/wiki/Gauntlets_of_power \"Gauntlets of power\") to offset their low strength and carrying capacity, with [bone](/wiki/Bone \"Bone\") and [wood](/wiki/Wood \"Wood\") as popular [choices of material](/wiki/Object_materials_\\(EvilHack\\) \"Object materials (EvilHack)\") due to being lighter and spellcaster-friendly. [Stone](/wiki/Stone \"Stone\") is also viable in this regard and even provides an extra point of base [AC](/wiki/AC \"AC\"), though it is heavier compared to other materials; this is somewhat offset by keeping them worn where possible.\n\n## SlashTHEM\n\nIn [SlashTHEM](/wiki/SlashTHEM \"SlashTHEM\"), illithids are always chaotic and can be [Acid Mages](/wiki/Acid_Mage \"Acid Mage\"), [Convicts](/wiki/Convict \"Convict\"), [Electric Mages](/wiki/Electric_Mage \"Electric Mage\"), [Flame Mages](/wiki/Flame_Mage \"Flame Mage\"), [Ice Mages](/wiki/Ice_Mage \"Ice Mage\"), [Necromancers](/wiki/Necromancer \"Necromancer\"), [Undead Slayers](/wiki/Undead_Slayer \"Undead Slayer\"), or [Wizards](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\").\n\nA user has suggested improving this page or section as follows:\n\n*\"Double check if the following is retained from [Slash'EM Extended](/wiki/Slash%27EM_Extended \"Slash'EM Extended\"): their brain-sucking attack will quickly kill monsters that have brains, plus illithids also start with [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\") ([extrinsic](/wiki/Extrinsic \"Extrinsic\") at [XL](/wiki/XL \"XL\")5, but they have a much lower chance of getting intrinsics from eating corpses.\"*\n\nThey can reach at least Skilled in [divination](/wiki/Divination \"Divination\") and [enchantment](/wiki/Enchantment \"Enchantment\") spells, and Expert in [attack](/wiki/Attack \"Attack\") and [matter](/wiki/Matter \"Matter\").\n\n## Origin\n\n[![Wikipedia](/images/thumb/f/f8/Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png/50px-Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png)](/wiki/File:Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png \"Wikipedia\")\n\n[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page \"wikipedia:Main Page\") has an article about:\n\n***[Illithid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illithid \"wikipedia:Illithid\")***\n\nIllithids, also known as mind flayers, are derived from *[Dungeons & Dragons](/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons \"Dungeons & Dragons\")*, where they appear in all editions - the illithid is considered \"Product Identity\" by Wizards of the Coast. Co-creator Gary Gygax stated that one of his inspirations for the monster was the cover painting of the Titus Crow book *The Burrowers Beneath* by Brian Lumley.\n\nIllithids are introduced in the very first 1975 issue of TSR Games' official newsletter, *The Strategic Review*; they were also included in the *Eldritch Wizardry* supplement for the original white box edition of *Dungeons & Dragons*, and further appear in the first edition's Monster Manual. The 3rd and 3.5 editions additionally introduce playable illithids. The various *Dungeons & Dragons* settings and many other works featuring them present many conflicting stories about their origins: one common thread is that illithid society seeks to rebuild their former empires, wherein all other species were their slaves. As a result, they view any sentient creature as worthy only of being either slaves or food; despite this, they are pragmatic, and will trade with other races who are too strong to be conquered. Illithids also fear undead, as they are immune to telepathic detection and manipulation while lacking brains to consume.\n\nIllithid dwellings are structured around an \"[Elder Brain](/wiki/Elder_brain \"Elder brain\")\", which lives in a pool of cerebral fluid in the center of a city; this pool is also host to the illithid's [larvae](/wiki/Mind_flayer_larva \"Mind flayer larva\"), which they each spawn *en masse* two or three times during their lifespan; these illithid larvae resemble four-tentacled tadpoles. Illithid tadpoles that survive 10 years of development are then inserted into the brain of a sapient creature through any cranial orifice; humanoid creatures between 5'4\" and 6'2\" are preferred as hosts, with the most desirable host races including humans, drow, elves, orcs, gnolls, and goblinoids.\n\nUpon being implanted, the larva undergoes \"ceremorphosis\", growing and consuming the host's brain before absorbing and restructuring the host's physical form, and becomes a physically mature (but mentally young) illithid over the course of a week - this process is irreversible unless the larva is detected and removed within about thirty minutes of injection. Illithids \"born\" from ceremorphosis can occasionally take on some mannerisms and other elements of the absorbed host creature's former mind. The elder brain typically consumes larva that fail to undergo this process; if it does not, or else is not present to, the larva will cannibalize each other in order to survive, and the survivor may become a potential [neothelid](/wiki/Neothelid \"Neothelid\"), a brain-eating worm-like beast considered to be an abomination by illithids.\n\nPsionic potential is integral to illithid identity: they typically communicate through psychic means, projecting thoughts and feelings to each other in a way non-illithids can scarcely comprehend. All illithids also have their brain extracted upon death and taken to the Elder Brain's pool to be added to the collective that the Brain represents, which they believe to be a form of immortality - this also makes the Elder Brain a vast library of knowledge that other illithids can call upon. Illithids who study wizardry often risk becoming outcasts (somewhat unlike EvilHack illithids), as magical power cannot be absorbed into the Brain, though a limited study is tolerated insofar as it allows illithid society to better understand their enemies; illithids outcast for going too far with these studies often seek another form of immortality through undeath, becoming [alhoons](/wiki/Alhoon \"Alhoon\").\n\nThe rare illithid forays into written language are known as \"qualith\", a series of marks consisting of four broken lines that functions like an extremely complex braille; illithids read this by using each tentacle to feel the breaks in the lines and comprehend all four of them simultaneously. In EvilHack, the spellbook of psionic wave is written in a language that only player illithids can comprehend, and other races cannot read the book.\n\n## References\n\n1.

Co-creator Gary Gygax stated that one of his inspirations for the monster was the cover painting of the Titus Crow book <i>The Burrowers Beneath</i> by Brian Lumley. \n</p><p>Illithids are introduced in the very first 1975 issue of TSR Games' official newsletter, <i>The Strategic Review</i>; they were also included in the <i>Eldritch Wizardry</i> supplement for the original white box edition of <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>, and further appear in the first edition's Monster Manual. The 3rd and 3.5 editions additionally introduce playable illithids. The various <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> settings and many other works featuring them present many conflicting stories about their origins: one common thread is that illithid society seeks to rebuild their former empires, wherein all other species were their slaves. As a result, they view any sentient creature as worthy only of being either slaves or food; despite this, they are pragmatic, and will trade with other races who are too strong to be conquered. Illithids also fear undead, as they are immune to telepathic detection and manipulation while lacking brains to consume.\n</p><p>Illithid dwellings are structured around an \"<a href=\"/wiki/Elder_brain\" title=\"Elder brain\">Elder Brain</a>\", which lives in a pool of cerebral fluid in the center of a city; this pool is also host to the illithid's <a href=\"/wiki/Mind_flayer_larva\" title=\"Mind flayer larva\">larvae</a>, which they each spawn <i>en masse</i> two or three times during their lifespan; these illithid larvae resemble four-tentacled tadpoles. Illithid tadpoles that survive 10 years of development are then inserted into the brain of a sapient creature through any cranial orifice; humanoid creatures between 5'4\" and 6'2\" are preferred as hosts, with the most desirable host races including humans, drow, elves, orcs, gnolls, and goblinoids.\n</p><p>Upon being implanted, the larva undergoes \"ceremorphosis\", growing and consuming the host's brain before absorbing and restructuring the host's physical form, and becomes a physically mature (but mentally young) illithid over the course of a week - this process is irreversible unless the larva is detected and removed within about thirty minutes of injection. Illithids \"born\" from ceremorphosis can occasionally take on some mannerisms and other elements of the absorbed host creature's former mind. The elder brain typically consumes larva that fail to undergo this process; if it does not, or else is not present to, the larva will cannibalize each other in order to survive, and the survivor may become a potential <a href=\"/wiki/Neothelid\" title=\"Neothelid\">neothelid</a>, a brain-eating worm-like beast considered to be an abomination by illithids.\n</p><p>Psionic potential is integral to illithid identity: they typically communicate through psychic means, projecting thoughts and feelings to each other in a way non-illithids can scarcely comprehend. All illithids also have their brain extracted upon death and taken to the Elder Brain's pool to be added to the collective that the Brain represents, which they believe to be a form of immortality - this also makes the Elder Brain a vast library of knowledge that other illithids can call upon. Illithids who study wizardry often risk becoming outcasts (somewhat unlike EvilHack illithids), as magical power cannot be absorbed into the Brain, though a limited study is tolerated insofar as it allows illithid society to better understand their enemies; illithids outcast for going too far with these studies often seek another form of immortality through undeath, becoming <a href=\"/wiki/Alhoon\" title=\"Alhoon\">alhoons</a>.\n</p><p>The rare illithid forays into written language are known as \"qualith\", a series of marks consisting of four broken lines that functions like an extremely complex braille; illithids read this by using each tentacle to feel the breaks in the lines and comprehend all four of them simultaneously. In EvilHack, the spellbook of psionic wave is written in a language that only player illithids can comprehend, and other races cannot read the book.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/master/doc/evilhack-changelog.md#version-040\">EvilHack changelog</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<div style=\"display:none; right:10px; padding-bottom: 17px\" class=\"metadata topicon nopopups\"><div style=\"margin-top: -10px\"><a href=\"/wiki/NetHackWiki:Next_version\" title=\"This article describes a 3.4.3-based variant of NetHack.

monster also known as an illithid|mind flayer}}\nThe '''illithid''' (also known as a [[mind flayer]]) is a playable race of monster that appears in [[notdNetHack]], [[EvilHack]], [[SlashTHEM]], and [[Hack'EM]].\n\n==notdNetHack==\nIn [[notdNetHack]], the [[Illithanachronounbinder]] is a role flavored as an illithid born from a larva taking over a suitable host of the selected starting race. This gives the resulting character all the abilities of a mind flayer combined with those of the selected race, but they are '''not''' immune to brain-sucking attacks themselves.\n\n==EvilHack==\nFirst introduced in version 0.4.0, EvilHack portrays illithids as an ancient race with psychic abilities and natural spellcasting ability, but they are physically weak compared to other beings.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/master/doc/evilhack-changelog.md#version-040 EvilHack changelog]</ref> \n\nIllithids are a [[chaotic]] race, and can be played as a [[Convict]], [[Infidel]], [[Priest]], or [[Wizard]].\n\n===Racial benefits and restrictions===\nPlayer illithids have [[infravision]], and gain more power generation per level than even [[Elf (starting race)|elven]] characters. They possess a natural [[psionic wave]] attack that can confuse and kill monsters: the ability uses spell [[power]], but is not considered a spell for the purposes of spell hunger, failure due to metallic armor, and interactions with the [[Amulet of Yendor]]; [[metallic]] [[helm]]s that are not [[mithril]] block the ability to use the psionic wave, and illithids that have their race changed lose the ability until they return to normal (i.e., in the case of crowning as an Infidel, it is lost indefinitely). Illithids that use their psionic wave while wearing a mithril or non-metallic [[helm of telepathy]] have a {{frac|4}} chance of the helm focusing the attack and increasing its damage by d6+2.\n\nIllithids start out with intrinsic [[psychic resistance]] and [[telepathy]], and gain [[flight]] at level 12 like other mind flayers.\n\nIllithids have a single extra tentacle attack that behaves exactly like the tentacle attack from a mind flayer, but will not be used if attacking something the character should not touch unprotected (e.g., [[cockatrice]]s). Mind flayers and other monsters with psychic resistance are immune to intelligence drain from brain-eating attacks, and a player illithid is likewise immune to having their own brain eaten (but not to any other effects, such as possibly-fatal [[illness]] from a zombie bite).\n\n====Attribute caps====\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n!| Character<br>[[Race]]\n!| [[Strength]]\n!| [[Dexterity]]\n!| [[Constitution]]\n!| [[Intelligence]]\n!| [[Wisdom]]\n!| [[Charisma]]\n|-\n|| Illithid || 10 || 20 || 12 || 22 || 22 || 16\n|}\n\nIllithids have exceptional agility and mental prowess that surpass even elves, but are the weakest among playable races in terms of physical strength.\n\n====Price adjustments====\nThe following price adjustments are used for illithid interactions with [[Racial monster|racial]] [[shopkeeper]]s:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\"| !! colspan=\"9\"|Shopkeeper's race\n|-\n!

However, they can still die as a result of the bites being poisoned, and their low strength and constitution caps make them incredibly frail. Their carrying capacity is also quite low, making a [[bag of holding]] an even more vital resource for them due to the weight reduction.\n\nEarly [[wish]]es for illithids often include [[gauntlets of power]] to offset their low strength and carrying capacity, with [[bone]] and [[wood]] as popular [[Object materials (EvilHack)|choices of material]] due to being lighter and spellcaster-friendly. [[Stone]] is also viable in this regard and even provides an extra point of base [[AC]], though it is heavier compared to other materials; this is somewhat offset by keeping them worn where possible.\n\n==SlashTHEM==\nIn [[SlashTHEM]], illithids are always chaotic and can be [[Acid Mage]]s, [[Convict]]s, [[Electric Mage]]s, [[Flame Mage]]s, [[Ice Mage]]s, [[Necromancer]]s, [[Undead Slayer]]s, or [[Wizard]]s.\n{{todo|Double check if the following is retained from [[Slash'EM Extended]]: their brain-sucking attack will quickly kill monsters that have brains, plus illithids also start with [[telepathy]] ([[extrinsic]] at [[XL]]5, but they have a much lower chance of getting intrinsics from eating corpses.}}\n\nThey can reach at least Skilled in [[divination]] and [[enchantment]] spells, and Expert in [[attack]] and [[matter]].\n\n==Origin==\n{{Wikipedia|Illithid}}\nIllithids, also known as mind flayers, are derived from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', where they appear in all editions - the illithid is considered \"Product Identity\" by Wizards of the Coast. Co-creator Gary Gygax stated that one of his inspirations for the monster was the cover painting of the Titus Crow book ''The Burrowers Beneath'' by Brian Lumley. \n\nIllithids are introduced in the very first 1975 issue of TSR Games' official newsletter, ''The Strategic Review''; they were also included in the ''Eldritch Wizardry'' supplement for the original white box edition of ''Dungeons & Dragons'', and further appear in the first edition's Monster Manual. The 3rd and 3.5 editions additionally introduce playable illithids. The various ''Dungeons & Dragons'' settings and many other works featuring them present many conflicting stories about their origins: one common thread is that illithid society seeks to rebuild their former empires, wherein all other species were their slaves. As a result, they view any sentient creature as worthy only of being either slaves or food; despite this, they are pragmatic, and will trade with other races who are too strong to be conquered. Illithids also fear undead, as they are immune to telepathic detection and manipulation while lacking brains to consume.\n\nIllithid dwellings are structured around an \"[[elder brain|Elder Brain]]\", which lives in a pool of cerebral fluid in the center of a city; this pool is also host to the illithid's [[Mind flayer larva|larvae]], which they each spawn ''en masse'' two or three times during their lifespan; these illithid larvae resemble four-tentacled tadpoles. Illithid tadpoles that survive 10 years of development are then inserted into the brain of a sapient creature through any cranial orifice; humanoid creatures between 5'4\" and 6'2\" are preferred as hosts, with the most desirable host races including humans, drow, elves, orcs, gnolls, and goblinoids.\n\nUpon being implanted, the larva undergoes \"ceremorphosis\", growing and consuming the host's brain before absorbing and restructuring the host's physical form, and becomes a physically mature (but mentally young) illithid over the course of a week - this process is irreversible unless the larva is detected and removed within about thirty minutes of injection. Illithids \"born\" from ceremorphosis can occasionally take on some mannerisms and other elements of the absorbed host creature's former mind. The elder brain typically consumes larva that fail to undergo this process; if it does not, or else is not present to, the larva will cannibalize each other in order to survive, and the survivor may become a potential [[neothelid]], a brain-eating worm-like beast considered to be an abomination by illithids.\n\nPsionic potential is integral to illithid identity: they typically communicate through psychic means, projecting thoughts and feelings to each other in a way non-illithids can scarcely comprehend. All illithids also have their brain extracted upon death and taken to the Elder Brain's pool to be added to the collective that the Brain represents, which they believe to be a form of immortality - this also makes the Elder Brain a vast library of knowledge that other illithids can call upon. Illithids who study wizardry often risk becoming outcasts (somewhat unlike EvilHack illithids), as magical power cannot be absorbed into the Brain, though a limited study is tolerated insofar as it allows illithid society to better understand their enemies; illithids outcast for going too far with these studies often seek another form of immortality through undeath, becoming [[alhoon]]s.\n\nThe rare illithid forays into written language are known as \"qualith\", a series of marks consisting of four broken lines that functions like an extremely complex braille; illithids read this by using each tentacle to feel the breaks in the lines and comprehend all four of them simultaneously. In EvilHack, the spellbook of psionic wave is written in a language that only player illithids can comprehend, and other races cannot read the book.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{variant-343}}<!--{{variant-36x}}-->\n[[Category:EvilHack races]]\n[[Category:notdNetHack races]]\n[[Category:SlashTHEM races]]"}

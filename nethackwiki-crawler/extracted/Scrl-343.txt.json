The\nCOST field denotes the base price of each item.  WGT specifies the\nweight (100 zorkmids weighs 1).\n\nScrolls comprise 16% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,\n18% in containers, 22% on the Rogue level, and 1% in hell.  PROB is\nthe relative probability of each subtype.  Scrolls appear 1/8 cursed,\n3/4 uncursed, and 1/8 blessed.\n\nScrolls of mail exist only if this ability was compiled into your\ncopy of the game, and if you have the \"mail\" option enabled.  When\nnew email arrives (or every 1999+d(3000) turns if playing on an\nAmiga or DOS platform), the \"mail daemon\" will deliver a scroll of mail.\nAll of these scrolls are considered uncursed, and they cannot be changed\ninto another object in any way.\n\nMRKR specifies the value used to determine the number of magic marker\ncharges needed to write a scroll of that type, or zero if it cannot be\nwritten.  The actual number of charges used will be a random amount\nfrom MRKR/2 to MRKR-1; if your marker has fewer than MRKR/2 charges,\nyou will be unable to attempt to write the scroll.\n\nWizards have a base 1/3 chance of writing an unknown scroll, and all other\nclasses have a base 1/15 chance; your chance generally improves with\nhigher luck, to a maximum of about 98% for Wizards and 32% for other\nclasses.  You can only write scrolls on blank paper, which can be made by\ngetting any scroll wet (except mail) or cancelling any scroll (except\nmail).  Failure to write the scroll will cause the blank scroll to be used\nup.  You can select non-blank scrolls to write on, but this will abuse\nyour wisdom and you will be told, \"That scroll is not blank!\"\n\nSome types of scrolls have the same APPEARANCE when unidentified.  The\nappearance of the remaining scrolls are are randomized from the following\ndescriptions:\n    ZELGO MER       JUYED AWK YACC  NR 9             XIXAXA XOXAXA XUXAXA\n    PRATYAVAYAH     DAIYEN FOOELS   LEP GEX VEN ZEA  PRIRUTSENIE\n    ELBIB YLOH      VERR YED HORRE  VENZAR BORGAVVE  THARR\n    YUM YUM         KERNOD WEL      ELAM EBOW        DUAM XNAHT\n    ANDOVA BEGARIN  KIRJE           VE FORBRYDERNE   HACKEM MUCHE\n    VELOX NEB       FOOBIE BLETCH   TEMOV            GARVEN DEH\n    READ ME\n\n\nScroll messages and effects\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from the spoiler \"scrolls\", by Ian Burrell.)\n\nIn order to read a scroll, you must either be unblind or know the\nAPPEARANCE of the scroll.  When a scroll is read, it will be used up\nand disappear (except blank paper).  The effects depend on the blessing\nof the scroll.  Non-cursed means either blessed or uncursed.  If you\nare confused while reading the scroll, \"you mispronounce the magic\nwords\" and may obtain a different effect. Some scrolls have a different\nmessage for \"beginners\"; a character is considered a beginner until\naccumulating 2000 score points (1000 for Wizards).\n\namnesia\n  All Sokoban maps are immune from the effects of amnesia.\n  cursed or you are NOT confused\n    You forget all of the current level.\n  non-cursed and confused\n    You forget 6/7 of the current level.\n  In addition, if uncursed or cursed\n    You forget any number of spells.\n  In every case,\n    You have a 1/3 chance of forgetting up to 25% of all known level\n    maps and a separate 1/3 chance of forgetting up to 25% of object\n    identities.\n    You forget all traps on your current level, forget whether you are\n    punished, and abuse your wisdom.\n      \"Your mind releases itself from mundane concerns.\"  (hallucinating)\n      \"As your mind turns inward on itself, you forget everything else.\"\n        (your character's name is Maud);\n      \"Who was that Maud person anyway?\"  (otherwise, 50%)\n      \"Thinking of Maud you forget everything else.\"  (otherwise, 50%)\n    The scroll is (re-)identified.\n\nblank paper\n  You identify the scroll; it will not be used up.\n    \"This scroll seems to be blank.\"  (unblind)\n    \"You don't remember there being any magic words on this scroll.\"\n    (blind)\n\ncharging\n  blessed\n    You identify the scroll and select an item.\n      \"This is a charging scroll.\"\n    If the item can't be charged, no effect.\n      \"You have a feeling of loss.\"\n    Otherwise, the item is charged by a larger amount (see wan1-343.txt,\n    tool-343.txt, or ring-343.txt for specifics).

The\nCOST field denotes the base price of each item.  WGT specifies the\nweight (100 zorkmids weighs 1).\n\nScrolls comprise 16% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,\n18% in containers, 22% on the Rogue level, and 1% in hell.  PROB is\nthe relative probability of each subtype.  Scrolls appear 1/8 cursed,\n3/4 uncursed, and 1/8 blessed.\n\nScrolls of mail exist only if this ability was compiled into your\ncopy of the game, and if you have the \"mail\" option enabled.  When\nnew email arrives (or every 1999+d(3000) turns if playing on an\nAmiga or DOS platform), the \"mail daemon\" will deliver a scroll of mail.\nAll of these scrolls are considered uncursed, and they cannot be changed\ninto another object in any way.\n\nMRKR specifies the value used to determine the number of magic marker\ncharges needed to write a scroll of that type, or zero if it cannot be\nwritten.  The actual number of charges used will be a random amount\nfrom MRKR/2 to MRKR-1; if your marker has fewer than MRKR/2 charges,\nyou will be unable to attempt to write the scroll.\n\nWizards have a base 1/3 chance of writing an unknown scroll, and all other\nclasses have a base 1/15 chance; your chance generally improves with\nhigher luck, to a maximum of about 98% for Wizards and 32% for other\nclasses.  You can only write scrolls on blank paper, which can be made by\ngetting any scroll wet (except mail) or cancelling any scroll (except\nmail).  Failure to write the scroll will cause the blank scroll to be used\nup.  You can select non-blank scrolls to write on, but this will abuse\nyour wisdom and you will be told, \"That scroll is not blank!\"\n\nSome types of scrolls have the same APPEARANCE when unidentified.  The\nappearance of the remaining scrolls are are randomized from the following\ndescriptions:\n    ZELGO MER       JUYED AWK YACC  NR 9             XIXAXA XOXAXA XUXAXA\n    PRATYAVAYAH     DAIYEN FOOELS   LEP GEX VEN ZEA  PRIRUTSENIE\n    ELBIB YLOH      VERR YED HORRE  VENZAR BORGAVVE  THARR\n    YUM YUM         KERNOD WEL      ELAM EBOW        DUAM XNAHT\n    ANDOVA BEGARIN  KIRJE           VE FORBRYDERNE   HACKEM MUCHE\n    VELOX NEB       FOOBIE BLETCH   TEMOV            GARVEN DEH\n    READ ME\n\n\nScroll messages and effects\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from the spoiler \"scrolls\", by Ian Burrell.)\n\nIn order to read a scroll, you must either be unblind or know the\nAPPEARANCE of the scroll.  When a scroll is read, it will be used up\nand disappear (except blank paper).  The effects depend on the blessing\nof the scroll.  Non-cursed means either blessed or uncursed.  If you\nare confused while reading the scroll, \"you mispronounce the magic\nwords\" and may obtain a different effect. Some scrolls have a different\nmessage for \"beginners\"; a character is considered a beginner until\naccumulating 2000 score points (1000 for Wizards).\n\namnesia\n  All Sokoban maps are immune from the effects of amnesia.\n  cursed or you are NOT confused\n    You forget all of the current level.\n  non-cursed and confused\n    You forget 6/7 of the current level.\n  In addition, if uncursed or cursed\n    You forget any number of spells.\n  In every case,\n    You have a 1/3 chance of forgetting up to 25% of all known level\n    maps and a separate 1/3 chance of forgetting up to 25% of object\n    identities.\n    You forget all traps on your current level, forget whether you are\n    punished, and abuse your wisdom.\n      \"Your mind releases itself from mundane concerns.\"  (hallucinating)\n      \"As your mind turns inward on itself, you forget everything else.\"\n        (your character's name is Maud);\n      \"Who was that Maud person anyway?\"  (otherwise, 50%)\n      \"Thinking of Maud you forget everything else.\"  (otherwise, 50%)\n    The scroll is (re-)identified.\n\nblank paper\n  You identify the scroll; it will not be used up.\n    \"This scroll seems to be blank.\"  (unblind)\n    \"You don't remember there being any magic words on this scroll.\"\n    (blind)\n\ncharging\n  blessed\n    You identify the scroll and select an item.\n      \"This is a charging scroll.\"\n    If the item can't be charged, no effect.\n      \"You have a feeling of loss.\"\n    Otherwise, the item is charged by a larger amount (see wan1-343.txt,\n    tool-343.txt, or ring-343.txt for specifics).

Wands may explode (see below).\n      \"Your &lt;item&gt; vibrates briefly.\"\n  confused\n    If your energy is at maximum, you gain 5d4 maximum energy.\n    Your energy is increased to maximum.\n      \"You feel charged up!\"\n\n  Previously-recharged wands have a chance of exploding if you attempt to\n  charge them further; wands of wishing will always explode, others\n  have a chance depending on the number of times (x) recharged: \n  (x^3)/(7^3).\n  PREV RCHG    %EXPLODE   %CUMULATIVE\n  ~~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~~\n      0           0           0\n      1           0.29        0.29\n      2           2.33        2.62\n      3           7.87       10.28\n      4          18.66       27.02\n      5          36.44       53.62\n      6          62.97       82.83\n      7         100         100\n  When a ring with a positive enchantment is charged, it has an\n  (enchantment before) in 7 chance of exploding.

The COST field\ndenotes the base price of each weapon.  WGT specifies the weight (100\nzorkmids weighs 1); an asterisk (*) signifies that the weapon requires\ntwo hands to wield.\n\nWeapons comprise 10% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,\n0% in containers, 12% on the Rogue level, and 20% in hell.  PROB is the\nrelative probability of each subtype.  If an object is mergable, then\n6d6 (6 to 36) quantity is generated.  Weapons have a roughly 10% chance\nof being blessed, roughly 10% of being cursed, and roughly 10% chance of\na non-zero enchantment (exponentially distributed).  Poisonable weapons\n(all arrows, crossbow bolts, darts, and shuriken) have a 1% chance of\nbeing generated poisoned.  Pick axes, unicorn horns, grappling hooks,\ngems, glass, rocks, two-weapon combat, riding, bare-handed combat, and\nmartial arts are also listed here for their weapon skills and damage,\neven though they are not technically weapons.\n\nThe MATL column describes the material of the weapon.

Weapons whose identity has not yet been established\nwill have the APPEARANCE listed.\n\nEach character class has a limit to the amount of skill that can be\nobtained in each weapon class.  The maximum skill level is noted under\nthe ABCH KMPRaRo STVW columns: - for restricted (cannot advance beyond\nunskilled), b for basic skill, s for skilled, E for expert, M for master,\nand G for grand master.  Weapon skills are explained further below.\n\nFinally, information about each weapon's ability to hit and cause damage\nis listed.  A few weapons have an additional bonus to hit, listed in the\n+HIT column.  The base amount of damage to small (\"tiny\", \"small\", and\n\"medium\") and large (\"large\", \"huge\", and \"gigantic\") monsters is given\nin the SDAM and LDAM fields, and is expressed in terms of die rolls.\nFor example, 2d6 means 2 dice which can each range from 1 to 6, for a\ntotal from 2 to 12.  The average amount of damage (useful for comparing\nweapons) against small and large monsters is given under SAVG and LAVG.\n\n\nWeapon skills\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    \"First lesson,\" Jon said. \"Stick them with the pointy end.\"\n        -- George R.R. Martin, \"A Game of Thrones\"\n\nThe table of weapons above is organized by \"skill classes\".  Continued\nuse of a weapon gives you practice in its skill class.  With enough\npractice in a skill class and experience levels, you may have the\nopportunity to advance your skill level in that skill class.  This will\nin turn lead to an improvement in your chance to hit and the damage\nproduced by weapons in that class.\n\n               NEEDED        WEAPON       2-WEAP   \nSKILL LEVEL   HITS  EXP    +HIT +DAM    +HIT +DAM  \n~~~~~~~~~~~   ~~~~  ~~~    ~~~~ ~~~~    ~~~~ ~~~~  \nUnskilled       0    0      -4   -2      -9   -3   \nBasic          20    1       0    0      -7   -1   \nSkilled        80    2      +2   +1      -5    0   \nExpert        180    3      +3   +2      -3   +1   \n\n               NEEDED        RIDING     BARE-HAND   MARTIAL\nSKILL LEVEL   HITS  EXP    +HIT +DAM      +DAM       +DAM\n~~~~~~~~~~~   ~~~~  ~~~    ~~~~ ~~~~    ~~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~\nUnskilled       0    0      -2    0         0         +1 \nBasic          20    1      -1    0        +1         +3 \nSkilled        80    1       0   +1        +1         +4 \nExpert        180    2       0   +2        +2         +6 \nMaster        320    2      --   --        +2         +7 \nGrand master  500    3      --   --        +3         +9 \n\nThere are specifically two requirements needed to advance a skill class:\na number of successful hits by any weapon in the skill class and a\nnumber of experience levels.  A hit is considered successful if it\ncauses more than one point of damage to a monster, regardless if the\nweapon is wielded or thrown.  The particular damage value used for this\ndetermination is described in \"Calculating damage\" below.\n\nThe number of HITS needed to advance to a particular SKILL LEVEL is shown\nin the tables above; this is cumulative from the beginning of the game\n(although if you start at basic level in a skill you will be pre-credited\nwith the 20 hits needed to achieve it). For advancing riding skill, 100\nturns spent moving is equivalent to one hit.\n\nThe other criterion used to advance skill levels is experience levels.\nEach time you gain an experience level, you earn a \"skill slot\" that is\nused up when you an advance a skill.  Thus you can earn a maximum of 29\nskill slots, by advancing from level 1 to level 30.  If you lose an\nexperience level, you lose the associated skill slot; if that skill slot\nwas used to enhance a skill, you will lose the most recently earned skill\nand are refunded the remaining skill slots from that skill level. \n\nThe tables above also lists the number of additional EXPerience levels\n(skill slots) needed to advance to that skill level (note the difference\nbetween the two tables).  Unlike the number of hits, this number is not\ncumulative.  Thus, it takes 2 skill slots to advance a weapon from basic\nto skilled, no matter if you started with it as basic or unskilled.  Note\nthat these slots are shared with spell skills.\n\nWhen you start the game, you will have basic skill for the weapons and\nweapon-tools in your initial inventory, have basic skill in bare-handed\ncombat if you can advance it beyond expert, basic skill in riding if a \nKnight, and will be unskilled in all other weapon categories.  When you\nreach the point when you can advance a skill category, you will see the\nmessage, \"You feel more confident in your (weapon/fighting) skills.\"\nYou can then advance the skill using the #enhance command (alt-e on some\nsystems).  You may choose to not advance a skill level if you want to\nreserve the skill slots for a different skill. After advancing a skill,\nif you are ready to advance another skill (possibly the same one), you\nwill get the message \"You feel you could be more dangerous!\"  The\n#enhance command can also be used at any time to check your current skill\nlevels.\n\nOf course, there are limits to how much you can advance a particular\nskill category.  Each character class has different maximum levels for\neach skill category, as can be seen in weapons table 2 above.  These\ndifferences help to distinguish the various character classes late in\nthe game.  For example, note that many of the fighter classes have skill\nwith swords, whereas Priests are restricted from edged weapons but are\ngood with bludgeons and missiles.  Note that you can usually advance your\nstarting weapons and your Quest Artifact (if it is a weapon) to expert\nskill.\n\nThe term \"restricted\" is used to describe skill categories that are\npermanently unskilled.  They do not appear in the #enhance menu, although\nyou will see skills that are unskilled and can be advanced.  If you\nreceive an artifact weapon from crowning or sacrificing, and the\nartifact's skill category is restricted, then the restriction will be\nremoved and you will be able to advance that skill to basic level; only\nhits made after the unrestriction count towards this advancement.\n\nNote that only character classes who are unrestricted in two-weapon\nskill are able to use the #twoweapon command in their unpolymorphed\nform.\n\nWeapon skills affect your game by adding a bonus to your chance to hit\nand your damage.  The WEAPON +HIT and +DAM columns in the table above\nshows the amount of this bonus for each skill level. \n\nIf you attack a monster while not wielding any weapon, you will cause\neither bare-handed damage (d2) or martial arts (d4) damage.  You only\ncause one or the other, depending on your character class.  These skills\ncan be enhanced just like weapon skills -- even to levels beyond those\nof weapons (master and grand master) -- and have their own +DAMage bonuses.\nThe martial arts bonus also applies when attacking a monster by kicking it.\n\n\nCalculating the chance to hit\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from the spoiler \"weapons\", by Robert DeLoura and\nBoudewijn Waijers.)\n\nThere are four ways to attack a monster with a weapon.  You can hit the\nmonster directly by wielding the weapon and stepping into that monster's\nsquare.  If no weapon is wielded, you use your bare-handed or martial\narts skill.  Second, you can use the throw command to throw a weapon or\nany other object (just type the object's inventory letter), or the fire\ncommand to throw the object currently in your quiver.  Missiles (such as\narrows) are fired from launchers (such as bows) by wielding the launcher\nand throwing the missile.  Third, you can kick an object at a monster, or\njust kick a monster in an adjacent square. Finally, you can apply a\nwielded polearm (lances are, for combat purposes, considered polearms) at\na monster at a distance: if your skill in that weapon is basic or worse,\nthe monster must be exactly two squares away orthogonally; if skilled, it\nmay also be a knight's-move away; if expert (can only apply to lances),\nanywhere at two moves' distance.\n\nIt is possible that you may hit with more than one weapon in a turn:\n* If you are using two-weapon combat, then if your primary weapon hits and\n  is not destroyed in the process, and the monster is not dislodged from its\n  position, your secondary weapon also automatically hits. \n* When firing any arrows from any bow, bolts from a crossbow, stones from a\n  sling, or throwing daggers, darts or shuriken, there may be a chance that\n  several get shot in one turn. The maximum number starts at 1, and receives\n  the following additions:\n  +   1 if you are skilled in the weapon.\n  +   2 if you are expert in the weapon.\n  +   1 if you are a Ranger, a Rogue throwing daggers, or a Samurai firing\n      ya from a yumi.\n  +   1 if you are an elf firing elven arrows from an elven bow.\n  +   1 if you are an orc firing orcish arrows from an orcish bow.\n  +   If this results in a maximum higher than the number of missiles you\n      have, the maximum is reduced to that number.\n  The number actually fired on any given turn is d(maximum). This can be\n  capped by giving a numerical prefix to the fire or throw command; doing\n  so will only decrease, never increase the number you fire.\n\nYour chance to hit is based on the sum of the following items.  The larger\nthe number, the better your chance to hit.\n\nThe following are added to all attacks:\n+   The target monster's armor class.\n+   Your experience level, or your hit dice if you are polymorphed.\n+   Your total numerical luck, which can range from -13 to +13.\n+   A bonus based on your dexterity (see DEXT +HIT in the table below).\n+   Your increase accuracy bonus (such as from rings).\n+   1 if you are in elven form and are attacking an orc (any o or orcish\n    undead).\n+   2 if the target monster was asleep.  It will awaken, whether you hit\n    or miss it.\n+   4 if the target monster was paralyzed.  There is a 10% chance that\n    the monster will be unfrozen.\n\nThe following are added only when attacking a monster directly with\na wielded weapon or bare-handed (melee attacks):\n+   1 bonus for attacking directly.\n+   A bonus based on your strength (see STRENGTH +HIT in the table\n    below).\n+   1 if you are XL 1 or 2 (game-balancing beginner's luck).\n+   -1 if you are burdened, -3 if stressed, -5 if strained.  You cannot\n    attack in any way if you are overtaxed or overloaded.\n+   -3 if you are trapped.\n+   2 if the target monster was stunned.\n+   2 if the target monster was fleeing.\n+   -20 if you are a Monk wearing body armour.\n+   If you are a barehanded Monk not wearing body armour or a shield, 2\n    plus your experience level divided by three.\n\nThe following are added only when attacking by throwing, firing or\nkicking a weapon, or applying a polearm (long- and medium-range attacks):\n+   -1 penalty for attacking from a distance.\n+   +2 to -4, depending on your distance to the target monster.\n+   -2 to +5, depending on the size of the target monster.\n+   2 with a heavy iron ball.\n+   4 with a boomerang.\n+   2 with throwing weapons (daggers (except athames), knives (except\n    scalpels and worm teeth), spears, javelins, war hammers, aklys, darts,\n    shuriken).\n+   -2 with non-throwing weapons.\n+   6 with a boulder.\n+   1 if you are an elf or Samurai wielding any bow and shooting any arrow.\n    This bonus is 2 when an elf uses an elven bow or a Samurai uses a yumi.\n+   Some gloves are a hindrance if you wield any bow class.  Gauntlets of\n    power are -2, and gauntlets of fumbling are -3.\n+   -4 if you throw or kick a missile without wielding a matching\n    launcher:\n        LAUNCHER(S)                  MISSILE(S)\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        orcish bow, bow, elven bow,  orcish arrow, arrow, silver arrow,\n          yumi                         elven arrow, ya\n        sling                        gems and stones\n        crossbow                     crossbow bolt\n+   Enchantment of the launcher you are wielding, if you threw or kicked\n    a matching missile.\n+   -1 if your launcher is damaged, -2 if it is very damaged, or -3 if\n    it is thoroughly damaged.  This only applies when you kick or throw\n    a matching missile.\n+   An artifact launcher +HIT bonus, if any applies.\n\nIf the target monster is being attacked with a weapon or weapon-tool --\nyour (primary) wielded one when attacking directly or with a polearm, or\nthe missile if thrown or kicked -- there are additional bonuses based on\nthat object:\n+   The object's enchantment.\n+   The object type's to-hit bonus.  See +HIT in weapons table 2.\n+   A weapon skill +HIT bonus if not using two weapons; see WEAPON +HIT\n    in the weapon skills table above, for the current skill level of\n    that weapon.\n+   A penalty if using two weapons and/or riding while poorly skilled;\n    see 2-WEAP +HIT and RIDING +HIT in the weapon skills table above.\n    (For the former purpose, your skill is considered to be the lower of\n    your actual two-weapon skill and your skill in your primary weapon.)\n+   An additional -2 if using two weapons while riding, regardless of skill.\n+   2 for blessed weapon(-tool) against a demon or undead monster.\n+   2 for weapons in spear class against X, D, J, N, or H.\n+   2 for a trident against snakes or sea monsters out of water.\n+   4 for a trident against any swimmer in water.\n+   2 for weapons in pick-axe class against xorns and earth elementals.\n+   An artifact +HIT bonus, if any applies.\n\nA die from 1 to 20 is rolled and compared to the to-hit total.  If the\ndie roll is less than the to-hit total (or equal when throwing or\nkicking), you hit the monster and inflict damage as described below;\notherwise, you miss the monster.  The die roll is also used in determining\nif certain \"chance\" artifact effects occur (e.g., beheading or Magicbane's\nspecial attacks).\n\nThere are also some special cases.  If you are swallowed or engulfed by\na monster, then direct or thrown attacks always succeed, although you\nwill be unable to kick or apply polearms.  Unicorns will always catch\ngems and glass that is thrown or kicked at them, causing no damage.

No base damage\noccurs against shades. If the base damage is more than one point, you\nexercise that weapon skill.  Added to this is a d4 bonus if wearing\nblessed gloves while fighting undead or demons, or d20 if wearing a silver\nring(s) and no gloves while fighting a silver-hating monster.  There is\nalso a small chance of stunning your opponent and causing it to stagger\nback a space (if it can); this will only happen if you are wearing neither\nbody armour nor shield and are in your natural form.\n\nDamage from weapons, weapon-tools, gems, stones, ball, or chain is the\ntotal of the following:\n+   Impacting object's base damage (SDAM or LDAM above, accordingly)\n+   Impacting object's enchantment (weapon and weapon-tool only)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n=   Subtotal A\n#   Subtotal A is set to zero if attacking thick-skinned creature with\n    item made of venom, wax, food, paper, cloth, or leather (namely, a\n    bullwhip).  Thick-skinned creatures include: gargoyle, winged gargoyle,\n    all mimics, mumak, titanothere, baluchitherium, mastodon, all baby and\n    adult dragons (D), earth elemental, all baby and adult nagas (N), xorn,\n    skeleton, gold golem, wood golem, clay golem, stone golem, glass golem,\n    iron golem, horned devil, barbed devil, shark, crocodile, salamander,\n    Chromatic Dragon, and Ixoth.\n#   Subtotal A is set to zero if attacking a shade without silver.\n#   Heavy iron ball sets subtotal A to 1-25, depending on weight.\n+   d4 if using a blessed item against undead or demon.  Undead include\n    all liches (L), all mummies (M), all vampires (V), all wraiths/wights\n    (W), all zombies (Z), ghosts, and shades.  Demons are all & except\n    Death, Pestilence, Famine, the mail daemon, djinn, and sandestins.\n    This bonus can't be doubled.\n+   d4 if using an axe or battle axe against a wooden creature (namely,\n    wood golems).  This bonus can't be doubled.\n+   d20 if silver weapon against silver-hating creature.  These include\n    all were-creatures (in both human and creature form); all vampires\n    (V); all demons (&) except Death, Pestilence, Famine, the mail\n    daemon, djinn, and sandestins; shades; and all imps (i) except \n    tengu.  This bonus can't be doubled.\n+   erosion penalty from whichever of rust/fire damage or rot/corrosion\n    damage is greater (-1 = damaged, -2 = very damaged, -3 = thoroughly \n    damaged). This won't reduce subtotal B beyond 1.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n=   Subtotal B.  This is the value that must be greater than one for the\n    hit to be counted toward a weapon skill.\n+   If you are a Rogue in natural form hitting a fleeing monster, aren't\n    stuck or using two weapons, and subtotal B is more than one point,\n    you strike from behind with an additional random damage from 1 to\n    your experience level.\n+   2d10 for a successful joust (2d2 if with a secondary weapon). This\n    bonus can't be doubled. To joust successfully, you need to hit with a\n    lance in melee while riding (and not fumbling or stunned), and the\n    chance is dependent on your skill in lance (or, if two-weaponing, the\n    lower of your skill in two-weapon combat and in lance): 20% at\n    unskilled, 40% at basic, 60% at skilled, 80% at expert. The monster\n    will be stunned for a turn and thrown back a square (if possible).\n    There is a small chance that the lance will break (dependent on your\n    Luck). Successfully jousting will always exercise your weapon skill.\n+   1 if you're a Samurai using ya with a yumi, or are an elf using elven\n    arrows with an elven bow. Polymorph doesn't count.\n+   Artifact damage bonus, doubling, and/or special attacks.  This may\n    apply only against certain creatures.  See art1-343.txt.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n=   Total damage\nHitting directly with a launcher, hitting directly with a missile, using\nthe wrong missile with a launcher, or using a polearm at close range\n(unless mounted) causes only d2 damage (zero against shades) and does not\nexercise your weapon skill. If you attack directly with a boomerang,\nthere's a chance (decreasing with higher Luck) that the boomerang\nbreaks, causing another 1 point of damage (no damage to shades).\n\nDamage from other objects are as follows.  No weapon skills are exercised.\n  OBJECT            DAMAGE\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  corpses           2 to 8, depending on size.  Cockatrice/chickatrice\n                    corpses (nicknamed \"rubber chickens\") turn monsters\n                    to stone, or do no damage if monster is stoning-\n                    resistant.\n  eggs              1, penalize luck if you laid it, and no increase\n                    damage bonus.\n                    Cockatrice/chickatrice eggs (nicknamed \"stoning\n                    grenades\") turn monsters to stone, or do no damage\n                    if monster is stoning-resistant.\n  clove of garlic   1, makes undead (but NOT demons) flee for 2d4 (more)\n                    turns.\n  cream pie,        0, blinds target; no increase damage bonus.\n    blinding venom  \n  acid venom        2d6 to monsters not acid resistant; no increase\n                    damage bonus.\n  potions           See pot1-343.txt.\n  expensive camera  0, breaks camera, no increase damage bonus.\n  mirror            1, breaks mirror (even on shades) with a -2 penalty\n                    to your luck.\n  boulder           d20.\n  heavy iron ball   1 to 25, depending on weight and subject to rusting.\n  iron chain        d4+1, subject to rusting.\n  other objects     1 to 6, depending on weight. Silver objects receive\n                    a +d20 bonus against a silver-hating creature (see\n                    above for list).\n\nAdditional damage can occur to all of the above attacks (even against\nshades; however, the first two bonuses are not applied if your current\ndamage total is less than one):\n+   Your increase damage bonus (such as from rings), unless if noted\n    above.\n+   The STRENGTH +DAM bonus from the attributes adjustment table above.\n    This won't occur if you aren't allowed the increase damage bonus, or\n    if you're firing a missile from a launcher.\n+   If you scored a hit that exercises a weapon skill, the +DAM bonus\n    for that weapon skill or for two-weapon combat skill (and for\n    riding skill if applicable, unless using two weapons). If fighting\n    with two weapons, your skill for this purpose is considered to be the\n    lower of your actual two-weapon skill and your skill in the single\n    weapon scoring the hit.\n+   If you hit a non-poison-resistant monster with a fired poisoned\n    missile, there's a 10% chance of an instant kill, else you inflict d6\n    more damage.\nYour total damage is limited from being negative.  If you are allowed an\nincrease damage bonus, you will score at least 1 point of damage.\n\nWhen you attack a monster and are polymorphed into a creature, you usually\nuse the attacks of your polymorphed form.  However, if you are in a form\nthat can use a weapon, are wielding something, and attempt a weapon,\nclaw, kick, bite, sting, touch, butt, or tentacle attack, then you will\nattack with the wielded object instead.\n\nYou may sometimes shatter your opponent's weapon if you are wielding a\ntwo-handed weapon, or are a Samurai wielding a katana with nothing in your\noff-hand. Your skill with your weapon must be skilled or better.  The chance\ndepends upon your weapon's erosion and the ability of your opponent's weapon\nto resist; it is about 2.5% under the best circumstances.  This attack also\ncauses the monster to flee for 2d3 (more) turns.\n\nSome monsters fight back passively when attacked.  Also, when a black or\nbrown pudding is hit directly with an iron weapon, it will be cloned\nafter taking damage.\n\n\nWhat's the relationship between launcher and missile modifiers?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA very brief summary (for the full details, see the above two sections) of\nwhich effects enchantments, erosions, and artifact combat bonuses will have\nwhen using a launcher and missile in the correct combination:\n\nMODIFIER                           TO HIT    DAMAGE\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nLauncher enchantment            :   YES        NO    \nLauncher erosion                :   YES        NO\nLauncher artifact to-hit bonus  :   YES        NO\nLauncher artifact damage bonus  :   N/A       N/A\nMissile enchantment             :   YES       YES\nMissile erosion                 :    NO       YES\nMissile artifact to-hit bonus   :   YES        NO\nMissile artifact damage bonus   :    NO       YES\n\n\nChoosing an early weapon\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMost players know that the best weapons in NetHack are artifacts (see\nart1-343.txt and art2-343.txt).  However, you usually won't find a good\nartifact weapon until you are well into a game.  Which weapons should you\nuse until then?\n\nThe best general advice is to use the same weapon preferences that\nmonsters use.  Their choices of wielded weapons for hand-to-hand combat,\nfrom most to least preferred, are as follows:\n  cockatrice/chickatrice corpse, tsurugi, runesword, dwarvish mattock,\n  two-handed sword, battle-axe, katana, unicorn horn, crysknife, trident,\n  long sword, elven broadsword, broadsword, scimitar, silver saber, morning\n  star, elven short sword, dwarvish short sword, short sword, orcish short\n  sword, mace, axe, dwarvish spear, silver spear, elven spear, spear,\n  orcish spear, flail, bullwhip, quarterstaff, javelin, aklys, club,\n  pick-axe, rubber hose, war hammer, silver dagger, elven dagger, dagger,\n  orcish dagger, athame, scalpel, knife, worm tooth.\n\nIf monsters can attack you from a distance with a ranged weapon or\npolearm, they will use them in the following order:\n  halberd, bardiche, spetum, bill-guisarme, voulge, ranseur, guisarme,\n  glaive, lucern hammer, bec-de-corbin, fauchard, partisan, lance,\n  dwarvish spear, silver spear, elven spear, spear, orcish spear, javelin,\n  shuriken, ya, silver arrow, elven arrow, arrow, orcish arrow, crossbow\n  bolt, silver dagger, elven dagger, dagger, orcish dagger, knife, flint\n  stone, rock, loadstone, luckstone, dart, boomerang (not yet implemented),\n  cream pie.\n\nClasses that are good fighters usually start with good weapons (for\nexample, BKRaSV), but other classes may want to switch to a different\ntype of weapon as soon as possible.  During the first few levels of the\ngame, you can #untrap dart and arrow traps to get some ranged weapons to\nthrow.  Daggers (especially elven) are often left by monsters in the\nfirst few levels and in the mines, and have a +2 to-hit bonus.  Pick-axes\n(good to practice skill for dwarvish mattock), unicorn horns, and\nquarterstaffs (from wood golems) appear somewhat later in the game and\nare good choices for certain classes.\n\nNote that you will start out unskilled in weapon categories other than\nyour starting weapons, which makes fighting with other weapons difficult\nuntil you can advance them to basic.  Using petrifying corpses requires\ngloves and has other risks.  Naturally, there are other ways to fight\nand defend yourself as well.\n\n\nWeapon enchantment and erosion\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from the spoiler \"enchant.lim\" by Peter Snelling and\nBoudewijn Waijers.)\n\nYour weapon's enchantment (e.g., -1, +0, +2) affects both your chance to\nhit monsters and the amount of damage produced.  However, damage is\nreduced if your weapon has been eroded by rust/fire or corrosion/rotting.\n\nSome weapons are made of materials that do not erode (see weapons table 1),\nbut others must be specially protected to prevent erosion.  This section\nexplains how to enchant your weapon and protect it from erosion.\n\nAll of the weapons and tools listed above can only be enchanted by reading\nscrolls of enchant weapon.  You must wield the weapon first.  The effect\nis dependent upon the blessed status of the scroll and the weapon's\nenchantment before reading the scroll.  A blessed scroll adds 1 or more\nenchantments, based on the current enchantment (see table below).  An\nuncursed scroll adds only one enchantment.  Cursed scrolls remove one\nenchantment; however, artifacts other than Sting or Orcrist are not\naffected by cursed scrolls of enchant weapon.\n  Current enchantment  -3 to -1  +0 to +2  +3 to +5  +6 to +8  +9 or more\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~\n  Additional possible   1 to 4    1 to 3    1 to 2       1       0 to 1\n\nA blessed or uncursed scroll will further make a cursed weapon uncursed,\nand will convert a worm tooth into a crysknife.  Cursed scrolls will\nconvert a crysknife into a worm tooth.  There is also a 2/3 chance of\nyour weapon being destroyed if it was more than +5 (less than -5) before\nreading a non-cursed (cursed) scroll.\n\nThus, the maximum safe enchantment for a weapon is +7.  This is obtained\nby reading uncursed or blessed scrolls until +5 is reached, and then\nreading a blessed scroll.  If by chance this results in +6, you should\nbring the enchantment back down to +5 -- by engraving one letter with\nthe weapon or by reading a cursed scroll of enchant weapon -- before\ntrying again.  Note: Engraving works only for weapons with edges, and for\nathames only when they are cursed.  Weapons may also lose enchantments\nwhen zapped with a spell of drain life or used to hit a disenchanter, but\nmay resist; artifacts will resist more than ordinary weapons.\n\nThe artifact Magicbane has special attack effects that decrease in\nfrequency as the enchantment is increased.  See art2-343.txt for a\ndiscussion on why enchantment to +2 is the optimal point to maximise\nthese.\n\nA special case occurs if you are confused while reading a scroll of\nenchant weapon.  Blessed or uncursed scrolls of enchant weapon while\nconfused will remove any rust, fire, corrosion or rot damage and\nerodeproof your weapon.  The weapon's current enchantment does not matter.\nIn the special case of crysknives, they become \"fixed\"; unfixed crysknives\nhave a 100% chance of reverting to a worm tooth when they cease to be\ncarried (possibly within a container) by you or a monster, fixed only 10%.\n\nReading a cursed scroll of enchant weapon while confused removes any\nerodeproofing but will not otherwise damage your weapon.  You can also\nchoose a weapon that doesn't damage (such as one made of silver),\ntemporarily protect your weapon by applying a layer of grease from a\ncan of grease, or #dip a damaged metallic weapon into a non-cursed\npotion of oil to remove one level of each type of damage.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCorrections and clarifications provided by Joe Bednorz, Aaron Bell,\nMark Bever, Patrick Clot, David Corbett, Kieron Dunbar, David Grabiner,\nTroy Holly, Ivan, Eva Myers, nyra, Janis Papanagnou, Pat Rankin,\nDavid Richerby, and Shaman.\n```\n\n*This page is based on a spoiler by [Dylan O'Donnell](https://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.spod-central.org/%257Epsmith/).

The COST field\ndenotes the base price of each weapon.  WGT specifies the weight (100\nzorkmids weighs 1); an asterisk (*) signifies that the weapon requires\ntwo hands to wield.\n\nWeapons comprise 10% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,\n0% in containers, 12% on the Rogue level, and 20% in hell.  PROB is the\nrelative probability of each subtype.  If an object is mergable, then\n6d6 (6 to 36) quantity is generated.  Weapons have a roughly 10% chance\nof being blessed, roughly 10% of being cursed, and roughly 10% chance of\na non-zero enchantment (exponentially distributed).

Pick axes, unicorn horns, grappling hooks,\ngems, glass, rocks, two-weapon combat, riding, bare-handed combat, and\nmartial arts are also listed here for their weapon skills and damage,\neven though they are not technically weapons.\n\nThe MATL column describes the material of the weapon.

Weapons whose identity has not yet been established\nwill have the APPEARANCE listed.\n\nEach character class has a limit to the amount of skill that can be\nobtained in each weapon class.  The maximum skill level is noted under\nthe ABCH KMPRaRo STVW columns: - for restricted (cannot advance beyond\nunskilled), b for basic skill, s for skilled, E for expert, M for master,\nand G for grand master.  Weapon skills are explained further below.\n\nFinally, information about each weapon's ability to hit and cause damage\nis listed.  A few weapons have an additional bonus to hit, listed in the\n+HIT column.  The base amount of damage to small (\"tiny\", \"small\", and\n\"medium\") and large (\"large\", \"huge\", and \"gigantic\") monsters is given\nin the SDAM and LDAM fields, and is expressed in terms of die rolls.\nFor example, 2d6 means 2 dice which can each range from 1 to 6, for a\ntotal from 2 to 12.  The average amount of damage (useful for comparing\nweapons) against small and large monsters is given under SAVG and LAVG.\n\n\nWeapon skills\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    \"First lesson,\" Jon said. \"Stick them with the pointy end.\"\n        -- George R.R. Martin, \"A Game of Thrones\"\n\nThe table of weapons above is organized by \"skill classes\".  Continued\nuse of a weapon gives you practice in its skill class.  With enough\npractice in a skill class and experience levels, you may have the\nopportunity to advance your skill level in that skill class.  This will\nin turn lead to an improvement in your chance to hit and the damage\nproduced by weapons in that class.\n\n               NEEDED        WEAPON       2-WEAP   \nSKILL LEVEL   HITS  EXP    +HIT +DAM    +HIT +DAM  \n~~~~~~~~~~~   ~~~~  ~~~    ~~~~ ~~~~    ~~~~ ~~~~  \nUnskilled       0    0      -4   -2      -9   -3   \nBasic          20    1       0    0      -7   -1   \nSkilled        80    2      +2   +1      -5    0   \nExpert        180    3      +3   +2      -3   +1   \n\n               NEEDED        RIDING     BARE-HAND   MARTIAL\nSKILL LEVEL   HITS  EXP    +HIT +DAM      +DAM       +DAM\n~~~~~~~~~~~   ~~~~  ~~~    ~~~~ ~~~~    ~~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~\nUnskilled       0    0      -2    0         0         +1 \nBasic          20    1      -1    0        +1         +3 \nSkilled        80    1       0   +1        +1         +4 \nExpert        180    2       0   +2        +2         +6 \nMaster        320    2      --   --        +2         +7 \nGrand master  500    3      --   --        +3         +9 \n\nThere are specifically two requirements needed to advance a skill class:\na number of successful hits by any weapon in the skill class and a\nnumber of experience levels.  A hit is considered successful if it\ncauses more than one point of damage to a monster, regardless if the\nweapon is wielded or thrown.  The particular damage value used for this\ndetermination is described in \"Calculating damage\" below.\n\nThe number of HITS needed to advance to a particular SKILL LEVEL is shown\nin the tables above; this is cumulative from the beginning of the game\n(although if you start at basic level in a skill you will be pre-credited\nwith the 20 hits needed to achieve it). For advancing riding skill, 100\nturns spent moving is equivalent to one hit.\n\nThe other criterion used to advance skill levels is experience levels.\nEach time you gain an experience level, you earn a \"skill slot\" that is\nused up when you an advance a skill.  Thus you can earn a maximum of 29\nskill slots, by advancing from level 1 to level 30.  If you lose an\nexperience level, you lose the associated skill slot; if that skill slot\nwas used to enhance a skill, you will lose the most recently earned skill\nand are refunded the remaining skill slots from that skill level. \n\nThe tables above also lists the number of additional EXPerience levels\n(skill slots) needed to advance to that skill level (note the difference\nbetween the two tables).  Unlike the number of hits, this number is not\ncumulative.  Thus, it takes 2 skill slots to advance a weapon from basic\nto skilled, no matter if you started with it as basic or unskilled.  Note\nthat these slots are shared with spell skills.\n\nWhen you start the game, you will have basic skill for the weapons and\nweapon-tools in your initial inventory, have basic skill in bare-handed\ncombat if you can advance it beyond expert, basic skill in riding if a \nKnight, and will be unskilled in all other weapon categories.  When you\nreach the point when you can advance a skill category, you will see the\nmessage, \"You feel more confident in your (weapon/fighting) skills.\"\nYou can then advance the skill using the #enhance command (alt-e on some\nsystems).  You may choose to not advance a skill level if you want to\nreserve the skill slots for a different skill. After advancing a skill,\nif you are ready to advance another skill (possibly the same one), you\nwill get the message \"You feel you could be more dangerous!\"  The\n#enhance command can also be used at any time to check your current skill\nlevels.\n\nOf course, there are limits to how much you can advance a particular\nskill category.  Each character class has different maximum levels for\neach skill category, as can be seen in weapons table 2 above.  These\ndifferences help to distinguish the various character classes late in\nthe game.  For example, note that many of the fighter classes have skill\nwith swords, whereas Priests are restricted from edged weapons but are\ngood with bludgeons and missiles.  Note that you can usually advance your\nstarting weapons and your Quest Artifact (if it is a weapon) to expert\nskill.\n\nThe term \"restricted\" is used to describe skill categories that are\npermanently unskilled.  They do not appear in the #enhance menu, although\nyou will see skills that are unskilled and can be advanced.  If you\nreceive an artifact weapon from crowning or sacrificing, and the\nartifact's skill category is restricted, then the restriction will be\nremoved and you will be able to advance that skill to basic level; only\nhits made after the unrestriction count towards this advancement.\n\nNote that only character classes who are unrestricted in two-weapon\nskill are able to use the #twoweapon command in their unpolymorphed\nform.\n\nWeapon skills affect your game by adding a bonus to your chance to hit\nand your damage.  The WEAPON +HIT and +DAM columns in the table above\nshows the amount of this bonus for each skill level. \n\nIf you attack a monster while not wielding any weapon, you will cause\neither bare-handed damage (d2) or martial arts (d4) damage.  You only\ncause one or the other, depending on your character class.  These skills\ncan be enhanced just like weapon skills -- even to levels beyond those\nof weapons (master and grand master) -- and have their own +DAMage bonuses.\nThe martial arts bonus also applies when attacking a monster by kicking it.\n\n\nCalculating the chance to hit\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from the spoiler \"weapons\", by Robert DeLoura and\nBoudewijn Waijers.)\n\nThere are four ways to attack a monster with a weapon.  You can hit the\nmonster directly by wielding the weapon and stepping into that monster's\nsquare.  If no weapon is wielded, you use your bare-handed or martial\narts skill.  Second, you can use the throw command to throw a weapon or\nany other object (just type the object's inventory letter), or the fire\ncommand to throw the object currently in your quiver.  Missiles (such as\narrows) are fired from launchers (such as bows) by wielding the launcher\nand throwing the missile.  Third, you can kick an object at a monster, or\njust kick a monster in an adjacent square. Finally, you can apply a\nwielded polearm (lances are, for combat purposes, considered polearms) at\na monster at a distance: if your skill in that weapon is basic or worse,\nthe monster must be exactly two squares away orthogonally; if skilled, it\nmay also be a knight's-move away; if expert (can only apply to lances),\nanywhere at two moves' distance.\n\nIt is possible that you may hit with more than one weapon in a turn:\n* If you are using two-weapon combat, then if your primary weapon hits and\n  is not destroyed in the process, and the monster is not dislodged from its\n  position, your secondary weapon also automatically hits. \n* When firing any arrows from any bow, bolts from a crossbow, stones from a\n  sling, or throwing daggers, darts or shuriken, there may be a chance that\n  several get shot in one turn. The maximum number starts at 1, and receives\n  the following additions:\n  +   1 if you are skilled in the weapon.\n  +   2 if you are expert in the weapon.\n  +   1 if you are a Ranger, a Rogue throwing daggers, or a Samurai firing\n      ya from a yumi.\n  +   1 if you are an elf firing elven arrows from an elven bow.\n  +   1 if you are an orc firing orcish arrows from an orcish bow.\n  +   If this results in a maximum higher than the number of missiles you\n      have, the maximum is reduced to that number.\n  The number actually fired on any given turn is d(maximum). This can be\n  capped by giving a numerical prefix to the fire or throw command; doing\n  so will only decrease, never increase the number you fire.\n\nYour chance to hit is based on the sum of the following items.  The larger\nthe number, the better your chance to hit.\n\nThe following are added to all attacks:\n+   The target monster's armor class.\n+   Your experience level, or your hit dice if you are polymorphed.\n+   Your total numerical luck, which can range from -13 to +13.\n+   A bonus based on your dexterity (see DEXT +HIT in the table below).\n+   Your increase accuracy bonus (such as from rings).\n+   1 if you are in elven form and are attacking an orc (any o or orcish\n    undead).\n+   2 if the target monster was asleep.  It will awaken, whether you hit\n    or miss it.\n+   4 if the target monster was paralyzed.  There is a 10% chance that\n    the monster will be unfrozen.\n\nThe following are added only when attacking a monster directly with\na wielded weapon or bare-handed (melee attacks):\n+   1 bonus for attacking directly.\n+   A bonus based on your strength (see STRENGTH +HIT in the table\n    below).\n+   1 if you are XL 1 or 2 (game-balancing beginner's luck).\n+   -1 if you are burdened, -3 if stressed, -5 if strained.  You cannot\n    attack in any way if you are overtaxed or overloaded.\n+   -3 if you are trapped.\n+   2 if the target monster was stunned.\n+   2 if the target monster was fleeing.\n+   -20 if you are a Monk wearing body armour.\n+   If you are a barehanded Monk not wearing body armour or a shield, 2\n    plus your experience level divided by three.\n\nThe following are added only when attacking by throwing, firing or\nkicking a weapon, or applying a polearm (long- and medium-range attacks):\n+   -1 penalty for attacking from a distance.\n+   +2 to -4, depending on your distance to the target monster.\n+   -2 to +5, depending on the size of the target monster.\n+   2 with a heavy iron ball.\n+   4 with a boomerang.\n+   2 with throwing weapons (daggers (except athames), knives (except\n    scalpels and worm teeth), spears, javelins, war hammers, aklys, darts,\n    shuriken).\n+   -2 with non-throwing weapons.\n+   6 with a boulder.\n+   1 if you are an elf or Samurai wielding any bow and shooting any arrow.\n    This bonus is 2 when an elf uses an elven bow or a Samurai uses a yumi.\n+   Some gloves are a hindrance if you wield any bow class.  Gauntlets of\n    power are -2, and gauntlets of fumbling are -3.\n+   -4 if you throw or kick a missile without wielding a matching\n    launcher:\n        LAUNCHER(S)                  MISSILE(S)\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        orcish bow, bow, elven bow,  orcish arrow, arrow, silver arrow,\n          yumi                         elven arrow, ya\n        sling                        gems and stones\n        crossbow                     crossbow bolt\n+   Enchantment of the launcher you are wielding, if you threw or kicked\n    a matching missile.\n+   -1 if your launcher is damaged, -2 if it is very damaged, or -3 if\n    it is thoroughly damaged.  This only applies when you kick or throw\n    a matching missile.\n+   An artifact launcher +HIT bonus, if any applies.\n\nIf the target monster is being attacked with a weapon or weapon-tool --\nyour (primary) wielded one when attacking directly or with a polearm, or\nthe missile if thrown or kicked -- there are additional bonuses based on\nthat object:\n+   The object's enchantment.\n+   The object type's to-hit bonus.  See +HIT in weapons table 2.\n+   A weapon skill +HIT bonus if not using two weapons; see WEAPON +HIT\n    in the weapon skills table above, for the current skill level of\n    that weapon.\n+   A penalty if using two weapons and/or riding while poorly skilled;\n    see 2-WEAP +HIT and RIDING +HIT in the weapon skills table above.\n    (For the former purpose, your skill is considered to be the lower of\n    your actual two-weapon skill and your skill in your primary weapon.)\n+   An additional -2 if using two weapons while riding, regardless of skill.\n+   2 for blessed weapon(-tool) against a demon or undead monster.\n+   2 for weapons in spear class against X, D, J, N, or H.\n+   2 for a trident against snakes or sea monsters out of water.\n+   4 for a trident against any swimmer in water.\n+   2 for weapons in pick-axe class against xorns and earth elementals.\n+   An artifact +HIT bonus, if any applies.\n\nA die from 1 to 20 is rolled and compared to the to-hit total.  If the\ndie roll is less than the to-hit total (or equal when throwing or\nkicking), you hit the monster and inflict damage as described below;\notherwise, you miss the monster.  The die roll is also used in determining\nif certain \"chance\" artifact effects occur (e.g., beheading or Magicbane's\nspecial attacks).\n\nThere are also some special cases.  If you are swallowed or engulfed by\na monster, then direct or thrown attacks always succeed, although you\nwill be unable to kick or apply polearms.  Unicorns will always catch\ngems and glass that is thrown or kicked at them, causing no damage.

No base damage\noccurs against shades. If the base damage is more than one point, you\nexercise that weapon skill.  Added to this is a d4 bonus if wearing\nblessed gloves while fighting undead or demons, or d20 if wearing a silver\nring(s) and no gloves while fighting a silver-hating monster.  There is\nalso a small chance of stunning your opponent and causing it to stagger\nback a space (if it can); this will only happen if you are wearing neither\nbody armour nor shield and are in your natural form.\n\nDamage from weapons, weapon-tools, gems, stones, ball, or chain is the\ntotal of the following:\n+   Impacting object's base damage (SDAM or LDAM above, accordingly)\n+   Impacting object's enchantment (weapon and weapon-tool only)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n=   Subtotal A\n#   Subtotal A is set to zero if attacking thick-skinned creature with\n    item made of venom, wax, food, paper, cloth, or leather (namely, a\n    bullwhip).  Thick-skinned creatures include: gargoyle, winged gargoyle,\n    all mimics, mumak, titanothere, baluchitherium, mastodon, all baby and\n    adult dragons (D), earth elemental, all baby and adult nagas (N), xorn,\n    skeleton, gold golem, wood golem, clay golem, stone golem, glass golem,\n    iron golem, horned devil, barbed devil, shark, crocodile, salamander,\n    Chromatic Dragon, and Ixoth.\n#   Subtotal A is set to zero if attacking a shade without silver.\n#   Heavy iron ball sets subtotal A to 1-25, depending on weight.\n+   d4 if using a blessed item against undead or demon.  Undead include\n    all liches (L), all mummies (M), all vampires (V), all wraiths/wights\n    (W), all zombies (Z), ghosts, and shades.  Demons are all &amp; except\n    Death, Pestilence, Famine, the mail daemon, djinn, and sandestins.\n    This bonus can't be doubled.\n+   d4 if using an axe or battle axe against a wooden creature (namely,\n    wood golems).  This bonus can't be doubled.\n+   d20 if silver weapon against silver-hating creature.  These include\n    all were-creatures (in both human and creature form); all vampires\n    (V); all demons (&amp;) except Death, Pestilence, Famine, the mail\n    daemon, djinn, and sandestins; shades; and all imps (i) except \n    tengu.  This bonus can't be doubled.\n+   erosion penalty from whichever of rust/fire damage or rot/corrosion\n    damage is greater (-1 = damaged, -2 = very damaged, -3 = thoroughly \n    damaged). This won't reduce subtotal B beyond 1.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n=   Subtotal B.  This is the value that must be greater than one for the\n    hit to be counted toward a weapon skill.\n+   If you are a Rogue in natural form hitting a fleeing monster, aren't\n    stuck or using two weapons, and subtotal B is more than one point,\n    you strike from behind with an additional random damage from 1 to\n    your experience level.\n+   2d10 for a successful joust (2d2 if with a secondary weapon). This\n    bonus can't be doubled. To joust successfully, you need to hit with a\n    lance in melee while riding (and not fumbling or stunned), and the\n    chance is dependent on your skill in lance (or, if two-weaponing, the\n    lower of your skill in two-weapon combat and in lance): 20% at\n    unskilled, 40% at basic, 60% at skilled, 80% at expert. The monster\n    will be stunned for a turn and thrown back a square (if possible).\n    There is a small chance that the lance will break (dependent on your\n    Luck). Successfully jousting will always exercise your weapon skill.\n+   1 if you're a Samurai using ya with a yumi, or are an elf using elven\n    arrows with an elven bow. Polymorph doesn't count.\n+   Artifact damage bonus, doubling, and/or special attacks.  This may\n    apply only against certain creatures.  See art1-343.txt.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n=   Total damage\nHitting directly with a launcher, hitting directly with a missile, using\nthe wrong missile with a launcher, or using a polearm at close range\n(unless mounted) causes only d2 damage (zero against shades) and does not\nexercise your weapon skill. If you attack directly with a boomerang,\nthere's a chance (decreasing with higher Luck) that the boomerang\nbreaks, causing another 1 point of damage (no damage to shades).\n\nDamage from other objects are as follows.  No weapon skills are exercised.\n  OBJECT            DAMAGE\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  corpses           2 to 8, depending on size.  Cockatrice/chickatrice\n                    corpses (nicknamed \"rubber chickens\") turn monsters\n                    to stone, or do no damage if monster is stoning-\n                    resistant.\n  eggs              1, penalize luck if you laid it, and no increase\n                    damage bonus.\n                    Cockatrice/chickatrice eggs (nicknamed \"stoning\n                    grenades\") turn monsters to stone, or do no damage\n                    if monster is stoning-resistant.\n  clove of garlic   1, makes undead (but NOT demons) flee for 2d4 (more)\n                    turns.\n  cream pie,        0, blinds target; no increase damage bonus.\n    blinding venom  \n  acid venom        2d6 to monsters not acid resistant; no increase\n                    damage bonus.\n  potions           See pot1-343.txt.\n  expensive camera  0, breaks camera, no increase damage bonus.\n  mirror            1, breaks mirror (even on shades) with a -2 penalty\n                    to your luck.\n  boulder           d20.\n  heavy iron ball   1 to 25, depending on weight and subject to rusting.\n  iron chain        d4+1, subject to rusting.\n  other objects     1 to 6, depending on weight. Silver objects receive\n                    a +d20 bonus against a silver-hating creature (see\n                    above for list).\n\nAdditional damage can occur to all of the above attacks (even against\nshades; however, the first two bonuses are not applied if your current\ndamage total is less than one):\n+   Your increase damage bonus (such as from rings), unless if noted\n    above.\n+   The STRENGTH +DAM bonus from the attributes adjustment table above.\n    This won't occur if you aren't allowed the increase damage bonus, or\n    if you're firing a missile from a launcher.\n+   If you scored a hit that exercises a weapon skill, the +DAM bonus\n    for that weapon skill or for two-weapon combat skill (and for\n    riding skill if applicable, unless using two weapons). If fighting\n    with two weapons, your skill for this purpose is considered to be the\n    lower of your actual two-weapon skill and your skill in the single\n    weapon scoring the hit.\n+   If you hit a non-poison-resistant monster with a fired poisoned\n    missile, there's a 10% chance of an instant kill, else you inflict d6\n    more damage.\nYour total damage is limited from being negative.  If you are allowed an\nincrease damage bonus, you will score at least 1 point of damage.\n\nWhen you attack a monster and are polymorphed into a creature, you usually\nuse the attacks of your polymorphed form.  However, if you are in a form\nthat can use a weapon, are wielding something, and attempt a weapon,\nclaw, kick, bite, sting, touch, butt, or tentacle attack, then you will\nattack with the wielded object instead.\n\nYou may sometimes shatter your opponent's weapon if you are wielding a\ntwo-handed weapon, or are a Samurai wielding a katana with nothing in your\noff-hand. Your skill with your weapon must be skilled or better.  The chance\ndepends upon your weapon's erosion and the ability of your opponent's weapon\nto resist; it is about 2.5% under the best circumstances.  This attack also\ncauses the monster to flee for 2d3 (more) turns.\n\nSome monsters fight back passively when attacked.  Also, when a black or\nbrown pudding is hit directly with an iron weapon, it will be cloned\nafter taking damage.\n\n\nWhat's the relationship between launcher and missile modifiers?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA very brief summary (for the full details, see the above two sections) of\nwhich effects enchantments, erosions, and artifact combat bonuses will have\nwhen using a launcher and missile in the correct combination:\n\nMODIFIER                           TO HIT    DAMAGE\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nLauncher enchantment            :   YES        NO    \nLauncher erosion                :   YES        NO\nLauncher artifact to-hit bonus  :   YES        NO\nLauncher artifact damage bonus  :   N/A       N/A\nMissile enchantment             :   YES       YES\nMissile erosion                 :    NO       YES\nMissile artifact to-hit bonus   :   YES        NO\nMissile artifact damage bonus   :    NO       YES\n\n\nChoosing an early weapon\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMost players know that the best weapons in NetHack are artifacts (see\nart1-343.txt and art2-343.txt).  However, you usually won't find a good\nartifact weapon until you are well into a game.  Which weapons should you\nuse until then?\n\nThe best general advice is to use the same weapon preferences that\nmonsters use.  Their choices of wielded weapons for hand-to-hand combat,\nfrom most to least preferred, are as follows:\n  cockatrice/chickatrice corpse, tsurugi, runesword, dwarvish mattock,\n  two-handed sword, battle-axe, katana, unicorn horn, crysknife, trident,\n  long sword, elven broadsword, broadsword, scimitar, silver saber, morning\n  star, elven short sword, dwarvish short sword, short sword, orcish short\n  sword, mace, axe, dwarvish spear, silver spear, elven spear, spear,\n  orcish spear, flail, bullwhip, quarterstaff, javelin, aklys, club,\n  pick-axe, rubber hose, war hammer, silver dagger, elven dagger, dagger,\n  orcish dagger, athame, scalpel, knife, worm tooth.\n\nIf monsters can attack you from a distance with a ranged weapon or\npolearm, they will use them in the following order:\n  halberd, bardiche, spetum, bill-guisarme, voulge, ranseur, guisarme,\n  glaive, lucern hammer, bec-de-corbin, fauchard, partisan, lance,\n  dwarvish spear, silver spear, elven spear, spear, orcish spear, javelin,\n  shuriken, ya, silver arrow, elven arrow, arrow, orcish arrow, crossbow\n  bolt, silver dagger, elven dagger, dagger, orcish dagger, knife, flint\n  stone, rock, loadstone, luckstone, dart, boomerang (not yet implemented),\n  cream pie.\n\nClasses that are good fighters usually start with good weapons (for\nexample, BKRaSV), but other classes may want to switch to a different\ntype of weapon as soon as possible.  During the first few levels of the\ngame, you can #untrap dart and arrow traps to get some ranged weapons to\nthrow.  Daggers (especially elven) are often left by monsters in the\nfirst few levels and in the mines, and have a +2 to-hit bonus.  Pick-axes\n(good to practice skill for dwarvish mattock), unicorn horns, and\nquarterstaffs (from wood golems) appear somewhat later in the game and\nare good choices for certain classes.\n\nNote that you will start out unskilled in weapon categories other than\nyour starting weapons, which makes fighting with other weapons difficult\nuntil you can advance them to basic.  Using petrifying corpses requires\ngloves and has other risks.  Naturally, there are other ways to fight\nand defend yourself as well.\n\n\nWeapon enchantment and erosion\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from the spoiler \"enchant.lim\" by Peter Snelling and\nBoudewijn Waijers.)\n\nYour weapon's enchantment (e.g., -1, +0, +2) affects both your chance to\nhit monsters and the amount of damage produced.  However, damage is\nreduced if your weapon has been eroded by rust/fire or corrosion/rotting.\n\nSome weapons are made of materials that do not erode (see weapons table 1),\nbut others must be specially protected to prevent erosion.  This section\nexplains how to enchant your weapon and protect it from erosion.\n\nAll of the weapons and tools listed above can only be enchanted by reading\nscrolls of enchant weapon.  You must wield the weapon first.  The effect\nis dependent upon the blessed status of the scroll and the weapon's\nenchantment before reading the scroll.  A blessed scroll adds 1 or more\nenchantments, based on the current enchantment (see table below).  An\nuncursed scroll adds only one enchantment.  Cursed scrolls remove one\nenchantment; however, artifacts other than Sting or Orcrist are not\naffected by cursed scrolls of enchant weapon.\n  Current enchantment  -3 to -1  +0 to +2  +3 to +5  +6 to +8  +9 or more\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~\n  Additional possible   1 to 4    1 to 3    1 to 2       1       0 to 1\n\nA blessed or uncursed scroll will further make a cursed weapon uncursed,\nand will convert a worm tooth into a crysknife.  Cursed scrolls will\nconvert a crysknife into a worm tooth.  There is also a 2/3 chance of\nyour weapon being destroyed if it was more than +5 (less than -5) before\nreading a non-cursed (cursed) scroll.\n\nThus, the maximum safe enchantment for a weapon is +7.  This is obtained\nby reading uncursed or blessed scrolls until +5 is reached, and then\nreading a blessed scroll.  If by chance this results in +6, you should\nbring the enchantment back down to +5 -- by engraving one letter with\nthe weapon or by reading a cursed scroll of enchant weapon -- before\ntrying again.  Note: Engraving works only for weapons with edges, and for\nathames only when they are cursed.  Weapons may also lose enchantments\nwhen zapped with a spell of drain life or used to hit a disenchanter, but\nmay resist; artifacts will resist more than ordinary weapons.\n\nThe artifact Magicbane has special attack effects that decrease in\nfrequency as the enchantment is increased.  See art2-343.txt for a\ndiscussion on why enchantment to +2 is the optimal point to maximise\nthese.\n\nA special case occurs if you are confused while reading a scroll of\nenchant weapon.  Blessed or uncursed scrolls of enchant weapon while\nconfused will remove any rust, fire, corrosion or rot damage and\nerodeproof your weapon.  The weapon's current enchantment does not matter.\nIn the special case of crysknives, they become \"fixed\"; unfixed crysknives\nhave a 100% chance of reverting to a worm tooth when they cease to be\ncarried (possibly within a container) by you or a monster, fixed only 10%.\n\nReading a cursed scroll of enchant weapon while confused removes any\nerodeproofing but will not otherwise damage your weapon.  You can also\nchoose a weapon that doesn't damage (such as one made of silver),\ntemporarily protect your weapon by applying a layer of grease from a\ncan of grease, or #dip a damaged metallic weapon into a non-cursed\npotion of oil to remove one level of each type of damage.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCorrections and clarifications provided by Joe Bednorz, Aaron Bell,\nMark Bever, Patrick Clot, David Corbett, Kieron Dunbar, David Grabiner,\nTroy Holly, Ivan, Eva Myers, nyra, Janis Papanagnou, Pat Rankin,\nDavid Richerby, and Shaman.\n</pre>\n<div class=\"license_dod\">\n<p><i>This page is based on a spoiler by <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.spod-central.org/%257Epsmith/\">Dylan O'Donnell</a>.

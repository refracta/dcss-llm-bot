NODIR spells do not\nask for a direction.  BEAM spells ask for a direction, but do not show a\nvisibly animated effect when cast.  RAY spells produce a ray which is\nanimated on the screen.  DISTANT spells ask for a position at which to\ncast the spell.  BEAM and RAY spells cannot be aborted; if you try to\ncancel them at the direction prompt, \"The magical energy is released!\" in\nthe direction in which you last took an action (possibly towards yourself).\n\nMonsters are not angered by spells of dig, knock, (extra) healing, stone to\nflesh (except stone golems), turn undead (if not undead and none of their\ninventory was affected), or wizard lock; being zapped (or missed by) other\nspells will cause peaceful monsters to become hostile.\n\ncancellation (matter, BEAM)\n  Same effect as a wand of cancellation.\n  zap monster\n    Some monsters may resist.\n    Clay golems are killed\n      \"Some writing vanishes from <monster's> head!\"\n    Weremonsters return to human form.\n    The monster is cancelled.\n  zap downwards\n    Any engraving at the location is removed.\n  zap object\n    Object is cancelled.\n  zap self\n    All items in your inventory are cancelled.\n    If you are polymorphed into a clay golem, you revert to your normal\n    form.\n      \"Some writing vanishes from your head!\" (if not blind)\n\ncause fear (enchantment, NODIR)\n  Same effect as reading an uncursed scroll of scare monster.\n  You will cause monsters within your visual range to flee.

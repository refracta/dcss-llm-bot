The very mission of the game is to recover [The Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/The_Amulet_of_Yendor \"The Amulet of Yendor\") for your god. This article is a portal to detailed articles about the religious aspects of the game which affect gameplay.\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 General description](#General_description)\n\n  - [1.1 Rituals](#Rituals)\n  - [1.2 Parameters](#Parameters)\n\n- [2 Altars and priests](#Altars_and_priests)\n\n  - [2.1 Altars](#Altars)\n\n  - [2.2 Priests and temples](#Priests_and_temples)\n\n  - [2.3 Distribution of altars, priests and temples](#Distribution_of_altars.2C_priests_and_temples)\n\n    - [2.3.1 Main Dungeon](#Main_Dungeon)\n    - [2.3.2 Gehennom and Dungeon Branches](#Gehennom_and_Dungeon_Branches)\n    - [2.3.3 Above the first level](#Above_the_first_level)\n\n- [3 Other issues](#Other_issues)\n\n  - [3.1 Gods](#Gods)\n  - [3.2 Atheism](#Atheism)\n\n- [4 References](#References)\n\n## General description\n\n### Rituals\n\nIn NetHack, there are four religious rituals: [prayer](/wiki/Prayer \"Prayer\"), [sacrificing](/wiki/Sacrificing \"Sacrificing\"), [turn undead](/wiki/Turn_undead \"Turn undead\"), and donating money to a priest. Dropping items on an [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\") while not blind also counts for the purposes of the atheist [conduct](/wiki/Conduct \"Conduct\").\n\n[Prayer](/wiki/Prayer \"Prayer\") (#pray) may cause beneficial outcomes, from restoring your [HP](/wiki/Hit_points \"Hit points\") to uncursing your item or making water holy. However, prayer never improves your relationships with your god. For example, if your god is angry with you, you cannot mollify him or her by prayers. There are several conditions that must be met for prayer to be safe.\n\n[Sacrificing](/wiki/Sacrificing \"Sacrificing\") (#offer) a corpse on a [coaligned](/wiki/Alignment \"Alignment\") altar (e.g. lawful altar if you are lawful) can improve your relationships with your god, including your luck. It can also grant you an artifact weapon. Sacrificing on a coaligned altar is always safe, provided that you are not sacrificing a coaligned unicorn (white for lawful, gray for neutral, black for chaotic), a former pet of yours, or a member of your own (starting) race. (The last is safe for chaotic players, but the other two are not.) Sacrificing on an altar that is not coaligned may convert it (if your alignment is positive and you are not in [Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\")) or may instead lower your luck; if your alignment is not positive it may instead convert [you](/wiki/You \"You\"). (Converting before the [Quest](/wiki/Quest \"Quest\") makes it [impossible to win](/wiki/Unwinnable \"Unwinnable\") the game.) Finally, sacrificing the [Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor \"Amulet of Yendor\") on the coaligned altar on the [Astral Plane](/wiki/Astral_Plane \"Astral Plane\") wins the game.\n\n[Turn undead](/wiki/Turn_undead \"Turn undead\") (#turn) allows [Knights](/wiki/Knight \"Knight\") and [Priests](/wiki/Priest \"Priest\") to frighten or even destroy (if they are lawful or neutral) or pacify (if they are chaotic) nearby undead creatures by calling upon the power of their deity. It should not be confused with [the spell of turn undead](/wiki/Spellbook_of_turn_undead \"Spellbook of turn undead\"), which causes only minor damage to undead creatures. Like prayer, turning works only under specific conditions.\n\nTo [donate](/wiki/Donate \"Donate\") money (#chat), you must stand in the square adjacent to a peaceful priest in a temple. His alignment is not important. Donating 400 times your experience level (or more, but less than 600 times your experience level) grants or improves [intrinsic protection](/wiki/Intrinsic_protection \"Intrinsic protection\"). Other sums of money may grant temporary clairvoyance, improve your [alignment record](/wiki/Alignment_record \"Alignment record\"), or exercise your wisdom. Donating $0 or less to a coaligned priest is a [Bad Idea](/wiki/Bad_Idea \"Bad Idea\"). For more information, see the chatting section in the [Aligned priest](/wiki/Aligned_priest \"Aligned priest\") article.\n\nMonsters cannot pray, sacrifice, turn undead, or donate money. (Players can still do these things while polymorphed, however.)\n\n### Parameters\n\nThere are several parameters which determine your relationships with your god.\n\n| Parameter        | Range                               | Initially                      | Normally              | Ideally             | Safe pray interval                                           |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Alignment        | Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic         | May be any                     | Same as initial value | No \"best\" alignment | any                                                          |\n| Alignment record | negative infinity to 10+(Turns/200) | 0 or 10, depending on the role | near the maximum      | maximum             | zero or positive                                             |\n| Anger            | 0 to infinity                       | 0                              | 0                     | 0                   | 0                                                            |\n| Prayer timeout   | 0 to 23500                          | 300                            | often 0               | 0                   | at most 0/100/200 if you have (only) no/minor/major problems |\n| Luck             | -13 to 13                           | 0                              | zero or positive      | 13\\*                | zero or positive                                             |\n\n*\\* There is an obscure bug where certain favorable events occur most likely if your Luck is 7.*\n\n[Alignment](/wiki/Alignment \"Alignment\") determines to which of three gods you serve. There are three alignments: lawful, neutral, and chaotic. Monsters, artifacts, altars and even the dungeon itself can have an alignment as well. Some entities loyal to [Moloch](/wiki/Moloch \"Moloch\") are unaligned. You choose (or let the game pick) your starting alignment, however, not all [roles](/wiki/Role \"Role\") can serve all gods. You can change it temporarily by wearing a [helm of opposite alignment](/wiki/Helm_of_opposite_alignment \"Helm of opposite alignment\"), or permanently only once by sacrificing on a non-coaligned altar when your [alignment record](/wiki/Alignment_record \"Alignment record\") is negative. The [helm](/wiki/Helm_of_opposite_alignment \"Helm of opposite alignment\") removes any intrinsic protection, and permanent change of your alignment additionally sets your alignment record to zero. If you permanently change your alignment before starting your quest, your quest leader will never send you to the quest, therefore you cannot win.\n\nYour [alignment record](/wiki/Alignment_record \"Alignment record\") is a number which affects your chance of praying successfully (the higher the better he responds to your prayers; if negative, he only smites you) and your ability to enter the [quest](/wiki/Quest \"Quest\") (you cannot if it is under 20). Its maximum is initially 10 and increases by 1 every 200 turns. It has no lower bound. Initially your alignment record is 0 or 10, depending on your role. There are many actions which affect it positively or negatively. Since killing hostile monsters usually improves your alignment record, it is normally near the maximum. If you \"feel guilty\", \"are feeling like an empty coward\" etc., this means you violated your role conduct and got an alignment penalty. You can approximately determine your alignment with [enlightenment](/wiki/Enlightenment \"Enlightenment\") or a [stethoscope](/wiki/Stethoscope \"Stethoscope\"). If your alignment is negative, you can improve it by sacrifices (see [Altar#Ordinary sacrifice](/wiki/Altar#Ordinary_sacrifice \"Altar\")).\n\n[Anger](/wiki/Anger \"Anger\") is a number which measures how angry your god is with you. Positive anger causes several bad effects. Most notably, your prayers become useless and only cause your god to smite you, and [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") times out twice as fast. Anger is from 0 to infinity, initially 0. It is normally 0. You can anger your god by \"wrong\" praying or sacrificing (most notably praying too often), or displacing your pet into a damaging trap, killing it. There are only two ways to mollify your god: sacrificing sufficiently powerful monsters at a coaligned altar (see [Altar#Ordinary sacrifice](/wiki/Altar#Ordinary_sacrifice \"Altar\")), or finding a non-coaligned altar and sacrificing either a unicorn of the same alignment or your former pet. The cross-aligned unicorn sacrifice also causes the altar's god to smite you. You can approximately determine anger by [enlightenment](/wiki/Enlightenment \"Enlightenment\").\n\nThe [prayer timeout](/wiki/Prayer_timeout \"Prayer timeout\") refers to how much time you need to wait before your god will accept another prayer. You can safely pray if it is at most 0, 100, or 200, depending on which problems you have (see [prayer](/wiki/Prayer \"Prayer\")). Initially set to 300, it decreases each game turn by one until it becomes zero, and increases when you pray, typically by several hundred turns. The exact [prayer timeout](/wiki/Prayer_timeout \"Prayer timeout\") increase is random each time; if 1) you had been crowned and/or 2) have killed the [Wizard of Yendor](/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor \"Wizard of Yendor\") or done the [Invocation ritual](/wiki/Invocation_ritual \"Invocation ritual\"), significantly larger values will be more likely. Getting an [artifact](/wiki/Artifact \"Artifact\") by [sacrificing](/wiki/Sacrifice \"Sacrifice\") or being granted a [wish](/wiki/Wish \"Wish\") also increases the prayer timeout as if you had prayed. You can decrease it or get a clue about it by sacrificing on a co-aligned altar (see [Altar#Ordinary sacrifice](/wiki/Altar#Ordinary_sacrifice \"Altar\")): a \"hopeful feeling\" means it is still positive, \"reconciliation\" means you just made it zero.\n\n[Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") is always between -13 and +13. Initially it is zero. To safely pray, your Luck must be zero or positive; otherwise prayers only cause your god to smite you. Luck has too many other effects to enumerate. Unless you have a [luck item](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") in your main inventory, your positive or negative luck times out at a rate of one point per 600 moves (300 if you are wearing the Amulet of Yendor, or if your God is angry). With luckstone, your positive/any/negative/ Luck never times out if the luckstone is blessed/uncursed/cursed. Sacrificing at a coaligned altar may increase your luck, depending on the corpse's difficulty, in which case you \"see a four-leaf clover\".\n\n## Altars and priests\n\n### Altars\n\n- *Main article: [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\")*\n\nAltars are high-bandwidth connections directly to your god. They are either aligned or unaligned. Aligned altars are either lawful, or neutral, or chaotic.\n\nThere are three uses of altars:\n\n- If you drop items onto an altar while not blind, you will know their [beatitude](/wiki/Beatitude \"Beatitude\"). Any altar can be used for this purpose. Note however that if you drop a fragile item (e. g. potion, mirror, crystal ball...) while levitating, it will break.\n- [Sacrificing](/wiki/Sacrifice \"Sacrifice\"). There is no way to sacrifice unless you stay over an altar.\n- Prayer. While you certainly can try to pray everywhere, prayers while standing on altar cause better or different outcomes.\n\n### Priests and temples\n\n- *Main article: [aligned priest](/wiki/Aligned_priest \"Aligned priest\")*\n\n* *Main article: [Special room#Temples](/wiki/Special_room#Temples \"Special room\")*\n\nA temple is a room with an altar and a [priest](/wiki/Aligned_priest \"Aligned priest\"). Not to be confused with the player role, priests are generated peaceful and will stay at the temple (unless angry), most of the time at or near the altar. Altars in temples can have any alignment or be unaligned. The tending priest has same alignment (or lack of it) as the altar.\n\nIn a temple, you can donate money to its priest, provided he or she is peaceful, and the altar had not been converted/destroyed/desecrated. His alignment is not important in most cases.\n\nIf you try to convert an altar in a temple, the priest will get angry and will not accept donations anymore.\n\n### Distribution of altars, priests and temples\n\n#### Main Dungeon\n\nEach non-maze, non-[special level](/wiki/Special_level \"Special level\") in the [Dungeons of Doom](/wiki/Dungeons_of_Doom \"Dungeons of Doom\") above the [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\") has a chance of including off-temple [altars](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\") or at most one [temple](/wiki/Temple \"Temple\"). Their [alignment](/wiki/Alignment \"Alignment\") is independently distributed with equal chances of being lawful, neutral, and chaotic. There are no altars in special rooms other than temples (shops, beehives, zoos etc.), or at special levels (Oracle, big room, rogue).\n\nContrary to popular belief, a rooms-and-corridor type filler level can feature altars or a temple between Medusa's lair and the Castle.\n\n#### Gehennom and Dungeon Branches\n\nThere is one temple in [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\") with equal chances of the three main religions, and no other temples, priests, or altars in [Gnomish Mines](/wiki/Gnomish_Mines \"Gnomish Mines\").\n\nThere are no temples, priests, or altars in [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\"), [Fort Ludios](/wiki/Fort_Ludios \"Fort Ludios\"), or [Vlad's Tower](/wiki/Vlad%27s_Tower \"Vlad's Tower\").\n\nThere are temples or off-temples altars on fixed-layout levels in some quests.\n\nThere are exactly three altars in [Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\"):\n\n- Unaligned temple with peaceful priest at the [Valley of the Dead](/wiki/Valley_of_the_Dead \"Valley of the Dead\") (1st level of Gehennom),\n- Unaligned non-temple altar at [Orcus-town](/wiki/Orcus-town \"Orcus-town\") (approximately middle of the Gehennom),\n- Unaligned temple with hostile[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1) high-priest in [Moloch's Sanctum](/wiki/Moloch%27s_Sanctum \"Moloch's Sanctum\") (bottom level of the Gehennom).\n\n#### Above the first level\n\nAt the Astral Plane, there are three temples which are randomly assigned to lawful, neutral and chaotic alignments (one of each), and many off-temple aligned priests, some of which are hostile.\n\nOtherwise, there are no altars, priests, or temples.\n\n## Other issues\n\n### Gods\n\n- *Main article: [god](/wiki/God \"God\")*\n\nEach [role](/wiki/Role \"Role\") has its own pantheon of gods - one for each alignment. Priests are assigned the pantheon of another role at random.\n\n### Atheism\n\n- *Main article: [atheist](/wiki/Atheist \"Atheist\")*\n\nPlayers may choose to forego all of the above religious activities, with the exception of sacrificing the Amulet of Yendor on the co-aligned altar on the Astral Plane. This is a voluntary conduct.\n\n## References\n\n1. [↑](#cite_ref-1) created peaceful, but grows hostile once you enter\n\n[![This article may require revision for the next version of NetHack.

Dropping items on an <a href=\"/wiki/Altar\" title=\"Altar\">altar</a> while not blind also counts for the purposes of the atheist <a href=\"/wiki/Conduct\" title=\"Conduct\">conduct</a>.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Prayer\" title=\"Prayer\">Prayer</a> (#pray) may cause beneficial outcomes, from restoring your <a href=\"/wiki/Hit_points\" title=\"Hit points\">HP</a> to uncursing your item or making water holy. However, prayer never improves your relationships with your god. For example, if your god is angry with you, you cannot mollify him or her by prayers. There are several conditions that must be met for prayer to be safe.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Sacrificing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sacrificing\">Sacrificing</a> (#offer) a corpse on a <a href=\"/wiki/Alignment\" title=\"Alignment\">coaligned</a> altar (e.g. lawful altar if you are lawful) can improve your relationships with your god, including your luck. It can also grant you an artifact weapon. Sacrificing on a coaligned altar is always safe, provided that you are not sacrificing a coaligned unicorn (white for lawful, gray for neutral, black for chaotic), a former pet of yours, or a member of your own (starting) race. (The last is safe for chaotic players, but the other two are not.) Sacrificing on an altar that is not coaligned may convert it (if your alignment is positive and you are not in <a href=\"/wiki/Gehennom\" title=\"Gehennom\">Gehennom</a>) or may instead lower your luck; if your alignment is not positive it may instead convert <a href=\"/wiki/You\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"You\">you</a>. (Converting before the <a href=\"/wiki/Quest\" title=\"Quest\">Quest</a> makes it <a href=\"/wiki/Unwinnable\" title=\"Unwinnable\">impossible to win</a> the game.) Finally, sacrificing the <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor\" title=\"Amulet of Yendor\">Amulet of Yendor</a> on the coaligned altar on the <a href=\"/wiki/Astral_Plane\" title=\"Astral Plane\">Astral Plane</a> wins the game.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Turn_undead\" title=\"Turn undead\">Turn undead</a> (#turn) allows <a href=\"/wiki/Knight\" title=\"Knight\">Knights</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Priest\" title=\"Priest\">Priests</a> to frighten or even destroy (if they are lawful or neutral) or pacify (if they are chaotic) nearby undead creatures by calling upon the power of their deity. It should not be confused with <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_turn_undead\" title=\"Spellbook of turn undead\">the spell of turn undead</a>, which causes only minor damage to undead creatures. Like prayer, turning works only under specific conditions.\n</p><p>To <a href=\"/wiki/Donate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Donate\">donate</a> money (#chat), you must stand in the square adjacent to a peaceful priest in a temple. His alignment is not important. Donating 400 times your experience level (or more, but less than 600 times your experience level) grants or improves <a href=\"/wiki/Intrinsic_protection\" title=\"Intrinsic protection\">intrinsic protection</a>. Other sums of money may grant temporary clairvoyance, improve your <a href=\"/wiki/Alignment_record\" title=\"Alignment record\">alignment record</a>, or exercise your wisdom. Donating $0 or less to a coaligned priest is a <a href=\"/wiki/Bad_Idea\" title=\"Bad Idea\">Bad Idea</a>. For more information, see the chatting section in the <a href=\"/wiki/Aligned_priest\" title=\"Aligned priest\">Aligned priest</a> article.\n</p><p>Monsters cannot pray, sacrifice, turn undead, or donate money. (Players can still do these things while polymorphed, however.)\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Parameters\">Parameters</span></h3>\n<p>There are several parameters which determine your relationships with your god.\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Parameter\n</th>\n<th>Range\n</th>\n<th>Initially\n</th>\n<th>Normally\n</th>\n<th>Ideally\n</th>\n<th>Safe pray interval\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alignment\n</td>\n<td>Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic\n</td>\n<td>May be any\n</td>\n<td>Same as initial value\n</td>\n<td>No \"best\" alignment\n</td>\n<td>any\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alignment record\n</td>\n<td>negative infinity to 10+(Turns/200)\n</td>\n<td>0 or 10, depending on the role\n</td>\n<td>near the maximum\n</td>\n<td>maximum\n</td>\n<td>zero or positive\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anger\n</td>\n<td>0 to infinity\n</td>\n<td>0\n</td>\n<td>0\n</td>\n<td>0\n</td>\n<td>0\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prayer timeout\n</td>\n<td>0 to 23500\n</td>\n<td>300\n</td>\n<td>often 0\n</td>\n<td>0\n</td>\n<td>at most 0/100/200 if you have (only) no/minor/major problems\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Luck\n</td>\n<td>-13 to 13\n</td>\n<td>0\n</td>\n<td>zero or positive\n</td>\n<td>13*\n</td>\n<td>zero or positive\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><i>* There is an obscure bug where certain favorable events occur most likely if your Luck is 7.</i>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Alignment\" title=\"Alignment\">Alignment</a> determines to which of three gods you serve. There are three alignments: lawful, neutral, and chaotic. Monsters, artifacts, altars and even the dungeon itself can have an alignment as well. Some entities loyal to <a href=\"/wiki/Moloch\" title=\"Moloch\">Moloch</a> are unaligned. You choose (or let the game pick) your starting alignment, however, not all <a href=\"/wiki/Role\" title=\"Role\">roles</a> can serve all gods. You can change it temporarily by wearing a <a href=\"/wiki/Helm_of_opposite_alignment\" title=\"Helm of opposite alignment\">helm of opposite alignment</a>, or permanently only once by sacrificing on a non-coaligned altar when your <a href=\"/wiki/Alignment_record\" title=\"Alignment record\">alignment record</a> is negative. The <a href=\"/wiki/Helm_of_opposite_alignment\" title=\"Helm of opposite alignment\">helm</a> removes any intrinsic protection, and permanent change of your alignment additionally sets your alignment record to zero. If you permanently change your alignment before starting your quest, your quest leader will never send you to the quest, therefore you cannot win.\n</p><p>Your <a href=\"/wiki/Alignment_record\" title=\"Alignment record\">alignment record</a> is a number which affects your chance of praying successfully (the higher the better he responds to your prayers; if negative, he only smites you) and your ability to enter the <a href=\"/wiki/Quest\" title=\"Quest\">quest</a> (you cannot if it is under 20). Its maximum is initially 10 and increases by 1 every 200 turns. It has no lower bound. Initially your alignment record is 0 or 10, depending on your role. There are many actions which affect it positively or negatively. Since killing hostile monsters usually improves your alignment record, it is normally near the maximum. If you \"feel guilty\", \"are feeling like an empty coward\" etc., this means you violated your role conduct and got an alignment penalty. You can approximately determine your alignment with <a href=\"/wiki/Enlightenment\" title=\"Enlightenment\">enlightenment</a> or a <a href=\"/wiki/Stethoscope\" title=\"Stethoscope\">stethoscope</a>. If your alignment is negative, you can improve it by sacrifices (see <a href=\"/wiki/Altar#Ordinary_sacrifice\" title=\"Altar\">Altar#Ordinary sacrifice</a>).\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Anger\" title=\"Anger\">Anger</a> is a number which measures how angry your god is with you. Positive anger causes several bad effects. Most notably, your prayers become useless and only cause your god to smite you, and <a href=\"/wiki/Luck\" title=\"Luck\">Luck</a> times out twice as fast. Anger is from 0 to infinity, initially 0. It is normally 0. You can anger your god by \"wrong\" praying or sacrificing (most notably praying too often), or displacing your pet into a damaging trap, killing it. There are only two ways to mollify your god: sacrificing sufficiently powerful monsters at a coaligned altar (see <a href=\"/wiki/Altar#Ordinary_sacrifice\" title=\"Altar\">Altar#Ordinary sacrifice</a>), or finding a non-coaligned altar and sacrificing either a unicorn of the same alignment or your former pet. The cross-aligned unicorn sacrifice also causes the altar's god to smite you. You can approximately determine anger by <a href=\"/wiki/Enlightenment\" title=\"Enlightenment\">enlightenment</a>.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Prayer_timeout\" title=\"Prayer timeout\">prayer timeout</a> refers to how much time you need to wait before your god will accept another prayer. You can safely pray if it is at most 0, 100, or 200, depending on which problems you have (see <a href=\"/wiki/Prayer\" title=\"Prayer\">prayer</a>). Initially set to 300, it decreases each game turn by one until it becomes zero, and increases when you pray, typically by several hundred turns. The exact <a href=\"/wiki/Prayer_timeout\" title=\"Prayer timeout\">prayer timeout</a> increase is random each time; if 1) you had been crowned and/or 2) have killed the <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor\" title=\"Wizard of Yendor\">Wizard of Yendor</a> or done the <a href=\"/wiki/Invocation_ritual\" title=\"Invocation ritual\">Invocation ritual</a>, significantly larger values will be more likely. Getting an <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact\" title=\"Artifact\">artifact</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Sacrifice\" title=\"Sacrifice\">sacrificing</a> or being granted a <a href=\"/wiki/Wish\" title=\"Wish\">wish</a> also increases the prayer timeout as if you had prayed. You can decrease it or get a clue about it by sacrificing on a co-aligned altar (see <a href=\"/wiki/Altar#Ordinary_sacrifice\" title=\"Altar\">Altar#Ordinary sacrifice</a>): a \"hopeful feeling\" means it is still positive, \"reconciliation\" means you just made it zero.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Luck\" title=\"Luck\">Luck</a> is always between -13 and +13. Initially it is zero. To safely pray, your Luck must be zero or positive; otherwise prayers only cause your god to smite you. Luck has too many other effects to enumerate. Unless you have a <a href=\"/wiki/Luck\" title=\"Luck\">luck item</a> in your main inventory, your positive or negative luck times out at a rate of one point per 600 moves (300 if you are wearing the Amulet of Yendor, or if your God is angry). With luckstone, your positive/any/negative/ Luck never times out if the luckstone is blessed/uncursed/cursed. Sacrificing at a coaligned altar may increase your luck, depending on the corpse's difficulty, in which case you \"see a four-leaf clover\".\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Altars_and_priests\">Altars and priests</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Altars\">Altars</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><div class=\"noprint relarticle mainarticle\"><i>Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Altar\" title=\"Altar\">altar</a></i></div></dd></dl>\n<p>Altars are high-bandwidth connections directly to your god.

[[NetHack]] is a fantasy adventure game, '''religion''' ties in closely with its mythological themes. The very mission of the game is to recover [[The Amulet of Yendor]] for your god. This article is a portal to detailed articles about the religious aspects of the game which affect gameplay.\n\n==General description==\n\n=== Rituals ===\n\nIn NetHack, there are four religious rituals: [[prayer]], [[sacrificing]], [[turn undead]], and donating money to a priest. Dropping items on an [[altar]] while not blind also counts for the purposes of the atheist [[conduct]].\n\n[[Prayer]] (#pray) may cause beneficial outcomes, from restoring your [[hit points|HP]] to uncursing your item or making water holy. However, prayer never improves your relationships with your god. For example, if your god is angry with you, you cannot mollify him or her by prayers. There are several conditions that must be met for prayer to be safe.\n\n[[Sacrificing]] (#offer) a corpse on a [[alignment|coaligned]] altar (e.g. lawful altar if you are lawful) can improve your relationships with your god, including your luck. It can also grant you an artifact weapon. Sacrificing on a coaligned altar is always safe, provided that you are not sacrificing a coaligned unicorn (white for lawful, gray for neutral, black for chaotic), a former pet of yours, or a member of your own (starting) race. (The last is safe for chaotic players, but the other two are not.) Sacrificing on an altar that is not coaligned may convert it (if your alignment is positive and you are not in [[Gehennom]]) or may instead lower your luck; if your alignment is not positive it may instead convert [[you]]. (Converting before the [[Quest]] makes it [[unwinnable|impossible to win]] the game.) Finally, sacrificing the [[Amulet of Yendor]] on the coaligned altar on the [[Astral Plane]] wins the game.\n\n[[Turn undead]] (#turn) allows [[Knight]]s and [[Priest]]s to frighten or even destroy (if they are lawful or neutral) or pacify (if they are chaotic) nearby undead creatures by calling upon the power of their deity. It should not be confused with [[Spellbook of turn undead|the spell of turn undead]], which causes only minor damage to undead creatures. Like prayer, turning works only under specific conditions.\n\nTo [[donate]] money (#chat), you must stand in the square adjacent to a peaceful priest in a temple. His alignment is not important. Donating 400 times your experience level (or more, but less than 600 times your experience level) grants or improves [[intrinsic protection]]. Other sums of money may grant temporary clairvoyance, improve your [[alignment record]], or exercise your wisdom. Donating $0 or less to a coaligned priest is a [[Bad Idea]]. For more information, see the chatting section in the [[Aligned priest]] article.\n\nMonsters cannot pray, sacrifice, turn undead, or donate money. (Players can still do these things while polymorphed, however.)\n\n=== Parameters ===\n\nThere are several parameters which determine your relationships with your god.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Parameter\n!Range\n!Initially\n!Normally\n!Ideally\n!Safe pray interval\n|-\n|Alignment\n|Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic\n|May be any\n|Same as initial value\n|No \"best\" alignment\n|any\n|-\n|Alignment record\n|negative infinity to 10+(Turns/200)\n|0 or 10, depending on the role\n|near the maximum\n|maximum\n|zero or positive\n|-\n|Anger\n|0 to infinity\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|Prayer timeout\n|0 to 23500\n|300\n|often 0\n|0\n|at most 0/100/200 if you have (only) no/minor/major problems\n|-\n|Luck\n| -13 to 13\n|0\n|zero or positive\n|13*\n|zero or positive\n|}\n''* There is an obscure bug where certain favorable events occur most likely if your Luck is 7.''\n\n[[Alignment]] determines to which of three gods you serve. There are three alignments: lawful, neutral, and chaotic. Monsters, artifacts, altars and even the dungeon itself can have an alignment as well. Some entities loyal to [[Moloch]] are unaligned. You choose (or let the game pick) your starting alignment, however, not all [[role]]s can serve all gods. You can change it temporarily by wearing a [[helm of opposite alignment]], or permanently only once by sacrificing on a non-coaligned altar when your [[alignment record]] is negative. The [[Helm of opposite alignment|helm]] removes any intrinsic protection, and permanent change of your alignment additionally sets your alignment record to zero. If you permanently change your alignment before starting your quest, your quest leader will never send you to the quest, therefore you cannot win.\n\nYour [[alignment record]] is a number which affects your chance of praying successfully (the higher the better he responds to your prayers; if negative, he only smites you) and your ability to enter the [[quest]] (you cannot if it is under 20). Its maximum is initially 10 and increases by 1 every 200 turns. It has no lower bound. Initially your alignment record is 0 or 10, depending on your role. There are many actions which affect it positively or negatively. Since killing hostile monsters usually improves your alignment record, it is normally near the maximum. If you \"feel guilty\", \"are feeling like an empty coward\" etc., this means you violated your role conduct and got an alignment penalty. You can approximately determine your alignment with [[enlightenment]] or a [[stethoscope]]. If your alignment is negative, you can improve it by sacrifices (see [[Altar#Ordinary sacrifice]]).\n\n[[Anger]] is a number which measures how angry your god is with you. Positive anger causes several bad effects. Most notably, your prayers become useless and only cause your god to smite you, and [[Luck]] times out twice as fast. Anger is from 0 to infinity, initially 0. It is normally 0. You can anger your god by \"wrong\" praying or sacrificing (most notably praying too often), or displacing your pet into a damaging trap, killing it. There are only two ways to mollify your god: sacrificing sufficiently powerful monsters at a coaligned altar (see [[Altar#Ordinary sacrifice]]), or finding a non-coaligned altar and sacrificing either a unicorn of the same alignment or your former pet. The cross-aligned unicorn sacrifice also causes the altar's god to smite you. You can approximately determine anger by [[enlightenment]].\n\nThe [[prayer timeout]] refers to how much time you need to wait before your god will accept another prayer. You can safely pray if it is at most 0, 100, or 200, depending on which problems you have (see [[prayer]]). Initially set to 300, it decreases each game turn by one until it becomes zero, and increases when you pray, typically by several hundred turns. The exact [[prayer timeout]] increase is random each time; if 1) you had been crowned and/or 2) have killed the [[Wizard of Yendor]] or done the [[Invocation ritual]], significantly larger values will be more likely. Getting an [[artifact]] by [[sacrifice|sacrificing]] or being granted a [[wish]] also increases the prayer timeout as if you had prayed. You can decrease it or get a clue about it by sacrificing on a co-aligned altar (see [[Altar#Ordinary sacrifice]]): a \"hopeful feeling\" means it is still positive, \"reconciliation\" means you just made it zero.\n\n[[Luck]] is always between -13 and +13. Initially it is zero. To safely pray, your Luck must be zero or positive; otherwise prayers only cause your god to smite you. Luck has too many other effects to enumerate. Unless you have a [[luck|luck item]] in your main inventory, your positive or negative luck times out at a rate of one point per 600 moves (300 if you are wearing the Amulet of Yendor, or if your God is angry). With luckstone, your positive/any/negative/ Luck never times out if the luckstone is blessed/uncursed/cursed. Sacrificing at a coaligned altar may increase your luck, depending on the corpse's difficulty, in which case you \"see a four-leaf clover\".\n\n== Altars and priests ==\n\n===Altars ===\n\n{{main|altar}}\n\nAltars are high-bandwidth connections directly to your god. They are either aligned or unaligned. Aligned altars are either lawful, or neutral, or chaotic.\n\nThere are three uses of altars:\n* If you drop items onto an altar while not blind, you will know their [[beatitude]]. Any altar can be used for this purpose. Note however that if you drop a fragile item (e. g. potion, mirror, crystal ball...) while levitating, it will break.\n* [[Sacrifice|Sacrificing]]. There is no way to sacrifice unless you stay over an altar.\n* Prayer. While you certainly can try to pray everywhere, prayers while standing on altar cause better or different outcomes.\n\n===Priests and temples===\n\n{{main|aligned priest}}\n\n{{main|Special room#Temples}}\n\nA temple is a room with an altar and a [[aligned priest|priest]]. Not to be confused with the player role, priests are generated peaceful and will stay at the temple (unless angry), most of the time at or near the altar. Altars in temples can have any alignment or be unaligned. The tending priest has same alignment (or lack of it) as the altar.\n\nIn a temple, you can donate money to its priest, provided he or she is peaceful, and the altar had not been converted/destroyed/desecrated. His alignment is not important in most cases.\n\nIf you try to convert an altar in a temple, the priest will get angry and will not accept donations anymore.\n\n=== Distribution of altars, priests and temples ===\n\n==== Main Dungeon ====\n\nEach non-maze, non-[[special level]] in the [[Dungeons of Doom]] above the [[Castle]] has a chance of including off-temple [[altar]]s or at most one [[temple]]. Their [[alignment]] is independently distributed with equal chances of being lawful, neutral, and chaotic. There are no altars in special rooms other than temples (shops, beehives, zoos etc.), or at special levels (Oracle, big room, rogue).\n\nContrary to popular belief, a rooms-and-corridor type filler level can feature altars or a temple between Medusa's lair and the Castle.\n\n==== Gehennom and Dungeon Branches ====\n\nThere is one temple in [[Minetown]] with equal chances of the three main religions, and no other temples, priests, or altars in [[Gnomish Mines]].\n\nThere are no temples, priests, or altars in [[Sokoban]], [[Fort Ludios]], or [[Vlad's Tower]].\n\nThere are temples or off-temples altars on fixed-layout levels in some quests.\n\n\nThere are exactly three altars in [[Gehennom]]:\n* Unaligned temple with peaceful priest at the [[Valley of the Dead]] (1st level of Gehennom),\n* Unaligned non-temple altar at [[Orcus-town]] (approximately middle of the Gehennom),\n* Unaligned temple with hostile<ref>created peaceful, but grows hostile once you enter</ref> high-priest in [[Moloch's Sanctum]] (bottom level of the Gehennom).\n\n==== Above the first level ====\n\nAt the Astral Plane, there are three temples which are randomly assigned to lawful, neutral and chaotic alignments (one of each), and many off-temple aligned priests, some of which are hostile.\n\nOtherwise, there are no altars, priests, or temples.\n\n== Other issues ==\n\n=== Gods ===\n\n{{main|god}}\n\nEach [[role]] has its own pantheon of gods - one for each alignment. Priests are assigned the pantheon of another role at random.\n\n===Atheism===\n\n{{main|atheist}}\n\nPlayers may choose to forego all of the above religious activities, with the exception of sacrificing the Amulet of Yendor on the co-aligned altar on the Astral Plane.  This is a voluntary conduct.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{nethack-343}}\n[[Category:Religion| ]]"}

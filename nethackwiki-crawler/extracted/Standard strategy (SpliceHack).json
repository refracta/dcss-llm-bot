It is entirely possible to ascend without using any sort of alternate strategy. That being said, the endgame in SpliceHack is dangerous, and there are a number of things you can do to make your journey to ascension that much easier! This guide covers the main differences between the strategy for NetHack ascension and SpliceHack ascension.\n\n## Early game\n\nThe early game in SpliceHack is extremely similar to vanilla NetHack. The biggest things to watch out for are a few very weak new monsters, such as lemurs and death maggots. Also, try to keep your pets away from porcupines, as this is a good way to lose a companion very early.\n\nThe object materials patch means that you can generally assemble a fairly strong set of equipment. Try to get at least one silver item early on, since it can help you against demons later. Additionally, floating eyes are rarer than in vanilla, so keep an *eye* out for one in order to obtain blind telepathy.\n\n## Midgame\n\nSpliceHack's midgame is where the differences from vanilla are most apparent. Numerous branches are available to the player, as described in a section below. Many of the new monsters will be encountered in this portion of the game, some of which are very threatening. Make sure to look up the stats of unfamiliar monsters using the colon key to avoid dying to something preventable. Although by no means necessary, it may be a good idea to find some sort of source of sonic resistance (earmuffs from the [icy wastes](/wiki/SpliceHack/Special_levels#New_branches \"SpliceHack/Special levels\"), resonating shields, purple dragon scale mail, Sonicboom) and possibly psychic resistance ([helm of mindarmor](/wiki/Item_\\(SpliceHack\\)#Armor \"Item (SpliceHack)\"), way to become mindless).\n\nSpliceHack has a much larger selection of artifacts, more details about which can be found on the [SpliceHack artifacts](/wiki/Artifact_\\(SpliceHack\\) \"Artifact (SpliceHack)\") page. Offering at altars can therefore grant you one of many items. Keep in mind that the success of wishing for artifacts in SpliceHack is based on how many artifacts you have been granted or wished for, and does not include those that were randomly generated.\n\nGehennom is structured slightly differently than vanilla, and you will likely encounter the lairs of at least a few unique demons. When they ask for a bribe, they may ask you for an artifact or offer to play a game of chance with you. Thus, it is a very good idea to keep any spare artifacts or decks of cards in your inventory to ward off potentially deadly encounters.\n\n## Endgame\n\nThe endgame of SpliceHack is simultaneously calmer and more hectic than vanilla. On one hand, the mysterious force is gone. On the other, performing the ascension ritual spawns all nonexistent major demons on random levels. Warning and telepathy can be invaluable during the ascension run in order to avoid running into any of them around a corner. Move as quickly as possible to minimize your chances of an encounter. If you do run into a major demon, you may be able to use your high speed and that they are not covetous in order to run away.\n\nThe Elemental Planes are largely the same as vanilla, although the Plane of Water has a few guaranteed monsters and is slightly harder than in vanilla. The Astral Plane, however, is extremely hectic. A greater number of player monsters spawn here than in vanilla, and unlike vanilla they are capable of stealing the Amulet from you and fleeing. Should any of them manage to make it to a coaligned altar, that's game over. Be very careful around player monsters and kill them from a distance if necessary.\n\nThe final difference to be aware of is the Riders. Although their stats are unchanged, each of them rides a unique, high-level horse. While the horses present little threat on their own, they take a few turns to kill, which could be enough time for the Rider to resurrect.\n\n## Pets\n\nPets in SpliceHack are much more valuable than in vanilla, and an effort should be made to keep your pet alive as long as possible. In the early game, pets function largely the same as in vanilla, but can become very powerful in the midgame and late game. Because pets can gain intrinsic resistances from corpses and cast spells, it is very viable to take a pet with you from the start of the dungeon into Gehennom.\n\nAdditionally, the intelligent pets patch and addition of new monsters makes the selection of desirable pets much larger. Here are a few of the best monsters to tame:\n\n- **All useful vanilla pets:** All pets that were good in vanilla are good choices in SpliceHack.\n- **Archons and other spellcasters:** Just like in vanilla, Archons are some of the best pets around. Since monsters in SpliceHack can cast spells at one another, they are even more powerful here.\n- **Black dragons:** Although dragons make for decent pets in vanilla, they are a much more powerful choice in SpliceHack due to pets being able to use breath weapons. Additionally, SpliceHack dragons can drink potions and zap themselves with wands, making them even stronger. Black dragons are especially notable due to their love of disintegrating monsters.\n- **Elder dragons:** Any of the new dragons introduced in SpliceHack will make an excellent pet. They are very high level, deal large amounts of damage, and have powerful breath weapons and special abilities.\n- **Amalgamations and bad clones:** Although only a small fraction of amalgamations and bad clones will have a useful selection of attacks, you might find an especially powerful one, such as a \"cockatriceblack dragon.\"\n- **Gnolls:** Powerful attacks and able to use weapons, these humanoids make great pets, particularly gnoll chieftains.\n- **Hundred handed ones:** These giants get six weapon attacks per round and have an enormous multishot bonus. Although not terribly useful for most characters, if you have a lot of powerful projectiles to give them they can become absolute powerhouses.\n\n## Wishing\n\n- **All good vanilla [wish](/wiki/Wish \"Wish\") targets:** These are all still excellent choices.\n- **Masks:** Masks allow for permanent polymorph into a specific form for as long as they are worn, although their BUC status degrades each time they are put on until they crumble. Thus, something such as \"blessed mask of a master mind flayer\" or \"blessed mask of an ooze dragon\" can be a great late-game wish.\n- **Scrolls of time:** Scrolls of time are some of the most valuable items in SpliceHack, and can be used to waltz through parts of the Astral Plane, easily win fights, and escape dangerous situations. Wishing for scrolls of time is a solid choice. A magic marker can also work, but these scrolls have recently been nerfed in both power level and marker ink cost.\n- **Gae Bulg:** If you can throw and hit an enemy with this artifact, it will deal enough damage to nearly always instantly slay it. This makes it a great artifact to wish for, especially if you have extra wishes and already have an amulet of life saving. Additionally, it is a decent weapon on its own; however, it is destroyed when it is used for its killing throw.\n- **The Holographic Void Lily:** The [Cartomancer](/wiki/Cartomancer \"Cartomancer\") quest artifact yields half spell damage, energy regeneration, and slotless reflection when carried.\n- **Acidfall and Sonicboom:** These artifacts grant acid and sonic resistance respectively, and both deal damage of the given type. Since these are difficult resistances to obtain normally and few monsters resist them, these artifacts make for extremely powerful weapons, along the lines of Frost Brand.\n\n## Branches\n\nAll new branches in SpliceHack are completely optional, but a few can be very useful.\n\n- **[One-eyed Sam's Market](/wiki/Black_market_\\(SLASH%27EM\\) \"Black market (SLASH'EM)\"):** Just like in SLASH'EM and UnNetHack, the black market is a great way to fill out your ascension kit.\n- **Icy Wastes:** This branch has a relatively easy boss, particularly if you are cold resistant. In addition, it contains a pair of earmuffs so that you can get sonic resistance, and a powerful single-use attack item.\n- **Mysterious Laboratory:** This branch is very useful for spellcasters, since eating the Ancient Brain will grant a bonus to intelligence and wisdom, and the level contains a number of spellbooks. The enemies here are very tough, however, so exercise caution.\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\"/>\n<title>Standard strategy (SpliceHack) - NetHack Wiki</title>\n<script>document.documentElement.className = document.documentElement.className.replace( /(^|\\s)client-nojs(\\s|$)/, \"$1client-js$2\" );</script>\n<script>(window.RLQ=window.RLQ||[]).push(function(){mw.config.set({\"wgCanonicalNamespace\":\"\",\"wgCanonicalSpecialPageName\":false,\"wgNamespaceNumber\":0,\"wgPageName\":\"Standard_strategy_(SpliceHack)\",\"wgTitle\":\"Standard strategy (SpliceHack)\",\"wgCurRevisionId\":136541,\"wgRevisionId\":136541,\"wgArticleId\":36239,\"wgIsArticle\":true,\"wgIsRedirect\":false,\"wgAction\":\"view\",\"wgUserName\":null,\"wgUserGroups\":[\"*\"],\"wgCategories\":[\"SpliceHack\"],\"wgBreakFrames\":false,\"wgPageContentLanguage\":\"en\",\"wgPageContentModel\":\"wikitext\",\"wgSeparatorTransformTable\":[\"\",\"\"],\"wgDigitTransformTable\":[\"\",\"\"],\"wgDefaultDateFormat\":\"dmy\",\"wgMonthNames\":[\"\",\"January\",\"February\",\"March\",\"April\",\"May\",\"June\",\"July\",\"August\",\"September\",\"October\",\"November\",\"December\"],\"wgMonthNamesShort\":[\"\",\"Jan\",\"Feb\",\"Mar\",\"Apr\",\"May\",\"Jun\",\"Jul\",\"Aug\",\"Sep\",\"Oct\",\"Nov\",\"Dec\"],\"wgRelevantPageName\":\"Standard_strategy_(SpliceHack)\",\"wgRelevantArticleId\":36239,\"wgRequestId\":\"c23f8d024d59e34a0da848aa\",\"wgCSPNonce\":false,\"wgIsProbablyEditable\":false,\"wgRelevantPageIsProbablyEditable\":false,\"wgRestrictionEdit\":[],\"wgRestrictionMove\":[],\"wgWikiEditorEnabledModules\":[],\"wgCategoryTreePageCategoryOptions\":\"{\\\"mode\\\":0,\\\"hideprefix\\\":20,\\\"showcount\\\":true,\\\"namespaces\\\":false}\"});mw.loader.state({\"site.styles\":\"ready\",\"noscript\":\"ready\",\"user.styles\":\"ready\",\"user\":\"ready\",\"user.options\":\"ready\",\"user.tokens\":\"loading\",\"mediawiki.legacy.shared\":\"ready\",\"mediawiki.legacy.commonPrint\":\"ready\",\"mediawiki.toc.styles\":\"ready\",\"mediawiki.skinning.interface\":\"ready\",\"skins.vector.styles\":\"ready\"});mw.loader.implement(\"user.tokens@0tffind\",function($,jQuery,require,module){/*@nomin*/mw.user.tokens.set({\"editToken\":\"+\\\\\",\"patrolToken\":\"+\\\\\",\"watchToken\":\"+\\\\\",\"csrfToken\":\"+\\\\\"});\n});RLPAGEMODULES=[\"site\",\"mediawiki.page.startup\",\"mediawiki.user\",\"mediawiki.page.ready\",\"mediawiki.toc\",\"mediawiki.searchSuggest\",\"skins.vector.js\"];mw.loader.load(RLPAGEMODULES);});</script>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/load.php?debug=false&amp;lang=en&amp;modules=mediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmediawiki.skinning.interface%7Cmediawiki.toc.styles%7Cskins.vector.styles&amp;only=styles&amp;skin=vector\"/>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"/load.php?debug=false&amp;lang=en&amp;modules=startup&amp;only=scripts&amp;skin=vector\"></script>\n<meta name=\"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\" content=\"\"/>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/load.php?debug=false&amp;lang=en&amp;modules=site.styles&amp;only=styles&amp;skin=vector\"/>\n<meta name=\"generator\" content=\"MediaWiki 1.32.5\"/>\n<link rel=\"image_src\" href=\"/images/6/65/Nethackwiki-logo.png\"/>\n<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"/images/6/64/Favicon.ico\"/>\n<link rel=\"search\" type=\"application/opensearchdescription+xml\" href=\"/opensearch_desc.php\" title=\"NetHackWiki\"/>\n<link rel=\"EditURI\" type=\"application/rsd+xml\" href=\"https://nethackwiki.com/api.php?action=rsd\"/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"/wiki/Standard_strategy_(SpliceHack)\"/>\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script src=\"/load.php?debug=false&amp;lang=en&amp;modules=html5shiv&amp;only=scripts&amp;skin=vector&amp;sync=1\"></script><![endif]-->\n</head>\n<body class=\"mediawiki ltr sitedir-ltr mw-hide-empty-elt ns-0 ns-subject page-Standard_strategy_SpliceHack rootpage-Standard_strategy_SpliceHack skin-vector action-view\">\t\t<div id=\"mw-page-base\" class=\"noprint\"></div>\n\t\t<div id=\"mw-head-base\" class=\"noprint\"></div>\n\t\t<div id=\"content\" class=\"mw-body\" role=\"main\">\n\t\t\t<a id=\"top\"></a>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"mw-indicators mw-body-content\">\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"firstHeading\" class=\"firstHeading\" lang=\"en\">Standard strategy (SpliceHack)</h1>\t\t\t<div id=\"bodyContent\" class=\"mw-body-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"siteSub\" class=\"noprint\">From NetHackWiki</div>\t\t\t\t<div id=\"contentSub\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"jump-to-nav\"></div>\t\t\t\t<a class=\"mw-jump-link\" href=\"#mw-head\">Jump to navigation</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"mw-jump-link\" href=\"#p-search\">Jump to search</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"mw-content-text\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"mw-content-ltr\"><div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"clear: right;

standard strategy for SpliceHack is very similar to the [[standard strategy]] for playing vanilla NetHack. It is entirely possible to ascend without using any sort of alternate strategy. That being said, the endgame in SpliceHack is dangerous, and there are a number of things you can do to make your journey to ascension that much easier! This guide covers the main differences between the strategy for NetHack ascension and SpliceHack ascension.\n\n== Early game ==\nThe early game in SpliceHack is extremely similar to vanilla NetHack. The biggest things to watch out for are a few very weak new monsters, such as lemurs and death maggots. Also, try to keep your pets away from porcupines, as this is a good way to lose a companion very early. \n\nThe object materials patch means that you can generally assemble a fairly strong set of equipment. Try to get at least one silver item early on, since it can help you against demons later. Additionally, floating eyes are rarer than in vanilla, so keep an ''eye'' out for one in order to obtain blind telepathy.\n\n== Midgame ==\nSpliceHack's midgame is where the differences from vanilla are most apparent. Numerous branches are available to the player, as described in a section below. Many of the new monsters will be encountered in this portion of the game, some of which are very threatening. Make sure to look up the stats of unfamiliar monsters using the colon key to avoid dying to something preventable. Although by no means necessary, it may be a good idea to find some sort of source of sonic resistance (earmuffs from the [[SpliceHack/Special_levels#New_branches|icy wastes]], resonating shields, purple dragon scale mail, Sonicboom) and possibly psychic resistance ([[Item_(SpliceHack)#Armor|helm of mindarmor]], way to become mindless).\n\nSpliceHack has a much larger selection of artifacts, more details about which can be found on the [[Artifact (SpliceHack)|SpliceHack artifacts]] page. Offering at altars can therefore grant you one of many items. Keep in mind that the success of wishing for artifacts in SpliceHack is based on how many artifacts you have been granted or wished for, and does not include those that were randomly generated.\n\nGehennom is structured slightly differently than vanilla, and you will likely encounter the lairs of at least a few unique demons. When they ask for a bribe, they may ask you for an artifact or offer to play a game of chance with you. Thus, it is a very good idea to keep any spare artifacts or decks of cards in your inventory to ward off potentially deadly encounters.\n\n== Endgame ==\nThe endgame of SpliceHack is simultaneously calmer and more hectic than vanilla. On one hand, the mysterious force is gone. On the other, performing the ascension ritual spawns all nonexistent major demons on random levels. Warning and telepathy can be invaluable during the ascension run in order to avoid running into any of them around a corner. Move as quickly as possible to minimize your chances of an encounter. If you do run into a major demon, you may be able to use your high speed and that they are not covetous in order to run away.\n\nThe Elemental Planes are largely the same as vanilla, although the Plane of Water has a few guaranteed monsters and is slightly harder than in vanilla. The Astral Plane, however, is extremely hectic. A greater number of player monsters spawn here than in vanilla, and unlike vanilla they are capable of stealing the Amulet from you and fleeing. Should any of them manage to make it to a coaligned altar, that's game over. Be very careful around player monsters and kill them from a distance if necessary.\n\nThe final difference to be aware of is the Riders. Although their stats are unchanged, each of them rides a unique, high-level horse. While the horses present little threat on their own, they take a few turns to kill, which could be enough time for the Rider to resurrect.\n\n== Pets ==\nPets in SpliceHack are much more valuable than in vanilla, and an effort should be made to keep your pet alive as long as possible. In the early game, pets function largely the same as in vanilla, but can become very powerful in the midgame and late game. Because pets can gain intrinsic resistances from corpses and cast spells, it is very viable to take a pet with you from the start of the dungeon into Gehennom.\n\nAdditionally, the intelligent pets patch and addition of new monsters makes the selection of desirable pets much larger. Here are a few of the best monsters to tame:\n* '''All useful vanilla pets:''' All pets that were good in vanilla are good choices in SpliceHack.\n* '''Archons and other spellcasters:''' Just like in vanilla, Archons are some of the best pets around. Since monsters in SpliceHack can cast spells at one another, they are even more powerful here.\n* '''Black dragons:''' Although dragons make for decent pets in vanilla, they are a much more powerful choice in SpliceHack due to pets being able to use breath weapons. Additionally, SpliceHack dragons can drink potions and zap themselves with wands, making them even stronger. Black dragons are especially notable due to their love of disintegrating monsters.\n* '''Elder dragons:''' Any of the new dragons introduced in SpliceHack will make an excellent pet. They are very high level, deal large amounts of damage, and have powerful breath weapons and special abilities.\n* '''Amalgamations and bad clones:''' Although only a small fraction of amalgamations and bad clones will have a useful selection of attacks, you might find an especially powerful one, such as a \"cockatriceblack dragon.\"\n* '''Gnolls:''' Powerful attacks and able to use weapons, these humanoids make great pets, particularly gnoll chieftains.\n* '''Hundred handed ones:''' These giants get six weapon attacks per round and have an enormous multishot bonus. Although not terribly useful for most characters, if you have a lot of powerful projectiles to give them they can become absolute powerhouses.\n\n== Wishing ==\n* '''All good vanilla [[wish]] targets:''' These are all still excellent choices.\n* '''Masks:''' Masks allow for permanent polymorph into a specific form for as long as they are worn, although their BUC status degrades each time they are put on until they crumble. Thus, something such as \"blessed mask of a master mind flayer\" or \"blessed mask of an ooze dragon\" can be a great late-game wish.\n* '''Scrolls of time:''' Scrolls of time are some of the most valuable items in SpliceHack, and can be used to waltz through parts of the Astral Plane, easily win fights, and escape dangerous situations. Wishing for scrolls of time is a solid choice. A magic marker can also work, but these scrolls have recently been nerfed in both power level and marker ink cost.\n* '''Gae Bulg:''' If you can throw and hit an enemy with this artifact, it will deal enough damage to nearly always instantly slay it. This makes it a great artifact to wish for, especially if you have extra wishes and already have an amulet of life saving. Additionally, it is a decent weapon on its own; however, it is destroyed when it is used for its killing throw.\n* '''The Holographic Void Lily:''' The [[Cartomancer]] quest artifact yields half spell damage, energy regeneration, and slotless reflection when carried.\n* '''Acidfall and Sonicboom:''' These artifacts grant acid and sonic resistance respectively, and both deal damage of the given type. Since these are difficult resistances to obtain normally and few monsters resist them, these artifacts make for extremely powerful weapons, along the lines of Frost Brand.\n\n== Branches ==\nAll new branches in SpliceHack are completely optional, but a few can be very useful.\n* '''[[Black market (SLASH'EM)|One-eyed Sam's Market]]:''' Just like in SLASH'EM and UnNetHack, the black market is a great way to fill out your ascension kit.\n* '''Icy Wastes:''' This branch has a relatively easy boss, particularly if you are cold resistant. In addition, it contains a pair of earmuffs so that you can get sonic resistance, and a powerful single-use attack item.\n* '''Mysterious Laboratory:''' This branch is very useful for spellcasters, since eating the Ancient Brain will grant a bonus to intelligence and wisdom, and the level contains a number of spellbooks. The enemies here are very tough, however, so exercise caution.\n\n[[Category: SpliceHack]]"}

In fact, after signing up, any games that you played on a participating server entirely during June will retroactively become eligible for the tournament, so you can start playing now and decide whether or not to join later.\n\n### How do I play?\n\nYou play your games on one of the participating [public servers](https://junethack.net/servers). You can use your existing accounts if you like, or create a new one. Junethack then captures those games, and checks if you are eligible for trophies.\n\n### I'm not a good player\n\nJunethack is informally known as \"the tournament for players who suck at NetHack\".\n\nConsider joining a clan as all clan trophies are designed such that even a new player of NetHack is never detrimental to the clan and might even be able to contribute towards the clan score.\n\n### When does the tournament start and end?\n\nThe tournament starts at June 1st 00:00 UTC and ends on June 30th right before midnight UTC.\n\nRegistration opens usually on Monday before June 1st.\n\nAll dates in Junethack are in UTC.\n\n### What games are eligible for the tournament?\n\nGames of NetHack and variants played on the participating [public servers](https://junethack.net/servers) during June are eligible.\n\nA game needs to have started and ended in June to be eligible.\n\nA game will be excluded and ignored for the tournament if one of the following conditions apply:\n\n```\n- it's a special game mode like e.g. explore mode, wizard mode, etc. \n- it's a startscummed game (currently defined as escaping or quitting within the first 10 turns)\n- it's an elven Anachrononaut (because they can kill Medusa trivially, getting that trophy)\n- it's a GnollHack game on difficulty lower than Expert, if played on mobile (games played on public servers are currently not filtered by difficulty)\n```\n\n### Why aren't the achievements from my game showing up on the scoreboard or being announced in IRC?\n\nTypically, this is because your game hasn't ended yet, or has ended very recently. Junethack operates by reading games' [xlogfiles](/wiki/Xlogfile \"Xlogfile\"), which only record a game after it is complete. Additionally, it only checks periodically for new data, rather than constantly, so there may be a lag of several minutes before a completed game is registered.\n\n### My login from last year doesn't work\n\nJunethack starts each year with a clean setup. You need to re-register your login every year.\n\n## Achievements / Trophies\n\n### Medusa kills\n\nOnly one kill per game counts towards the \"Medusa kill\" clan trophy\n\n### Most variant/trophy or ascended variant/role/race/alignment/gender combinations\n\nIf two clan members both get the same sets of trophies in the same variants, the trophies only count once towards the clan trophies.\n\nBut as a clan member can at any time leave and join a different clan, it's not necessarily redundant to have several clan members claiming the same trophies.\n\n### Conducts\n\nDue to the significant variation across different variants in the types of conducts tracked and the technical methods used for tracking them, Junethack only monitors the 12 \"classical\" conducts.\n\nWhenever the general term \"conducts\" is used in relation to Junethack, it specifically refers to these conducts:\n\n- [Foodless](/wiki/Foodless \"Foodless\")\n- [Vegan](/wiki/Conduct#Vegan \"Conduct\")\n- [Vegetarian](/wiki/Conduct#Vegetarian \"Conduct\")\n- [Atheist](/wiki/Atheist \"Atheist\")\n- [Weaponless](/wiki/Never_hit_with_a_wielded_weapon \"Never hit with a wielded weapon\")\n- [Pacifist](/wiki/Pacifist \"Pacifist\")\n- [Illiterate](/wiki/Illiterate \"Illiterate\")\n- [Polypileless](/wiki/Conduct#Never_polymorph_an_object \"Conduct\")\n- [Polyselfless](/wiki/Conduct#Never_change_form \"Conduct\")\n- [Wishless](/wiki/Wishless \"Wishless\")\n- [Artifact wishless](/wiki/Wishless \"Wishless\")\n- [Genocideless](/wiki/Conduct#Genocideless \"Conduct\")\n\n## Clans\n\n### How do I join a clan?\n\nYou need to be invited by a clan admin. You see clan invitations at the bottom of your administration page after you login.\n\nThe clan admin is listed on the [Junethack clan page](https://junethack.net/clans).\n\n### Where can I find other players?\n\nYou could either check out the [NetHack subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/nethack), the #junethack channel on the [Libera](/wiki/Libera \"Libera\") IRC network, or the [Roguelikes discord channel](https://discord.gg/mFNbXGy).\n\n## Variant developer information\n\n### What is needed for my variant to be included in Junethack?\n\nYou need to have a public server on which your variant is installed and can be played online.\n\nThe public server needs to have a [xlogfile](/wiki/Xlogfile \"Xlogfile\") (included and enabled by default in NetHack since 3.6.0) that is accessible from the web.\n\nThe user configs needs to be accessible from the web as well for verification purposes.\n\nNot required but nice to have is if the URL of the dumplogs on your public server can be deduced from the xlogfile data so that they can be linked from the Junethack site. Most public servers use a combination of game starting time in unix epoch time and the player name.\n\n### New trophies and achievements\n\nA trophy or achievement in Junethack needs a winning condition, a small image (54 by 54 pixels), a name, and a description. Your variant needs to encode the winning condition unambiguously in the xlogfile.\n\nThe 12 classic xlogfile conditions (ascended, entered Astral Plane, entered Elemental Planes, obtained the Amulet of Yendor, performed the Invocation Ritual, obtained the Book of the Dead, obtained the Bell of Opening, obtained the Candelabrum of Invocation, entered Gehennom, defeated Medusa, obtained the luckstone from the Mines, obtained the Sokoban Prize) are already encoded in the standard xlogfile and need no extra code.\\`\n\nHistorically, achievements were encoded in bitfields in the xlogfile patch. This is rather cumbersome and errorprone to decode, even more so if you consider the different variants that might use the same bits for different conditions. Look at [achieveX or conductX in NetHack 3.7](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/0e4ff07cef), or [the various extended fields in UnNetHack](https://github.com/UnNetHack/UnNetHack/commit/2cda06425f).\n\nThere are colored blank templates of the right size [for the achievement images in the repository](https://github.com/junethack/Junethack/tree/master/icons/templates). The achievement images don't need to be artistically fancy or even great (just look how some of the existing ones look like). If your skills fail you completely, you can add a request like \"make it a yellow &\". Simple images can be done programmatically from the Ruby scripts in the icons directory. The colors can be anything although most images follow the 16 standard terminal colors and the symbol can be almost anything due to Unicode.\n\nFor an example which makes adding new achievements very easy, look at [this CSV for dNetHack specific achievements](https://github.com/Chris-plus-alphanumericgibberish/dNAO/blob/compat-3.21.4/junethack_trophies/trophy_descriptions.csv) which contains everything needed. Adding support for trophies documented this is quite easy, as shown in [this commit](https://github.com/junethack/Junethack/commit/55f7064c4d).\n\nIf possible, [open up a GitHub issue](https://github.com/junethack/Junethack/issues/new) and attach your files there.\n\nRemember, the easier it is to add your achievements, the more likely they will actually be added.\n","html":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\"/>\n<title>Junethack/FAQ - NetHack

Most public servers use a combination of game starting time in unix epoch time and the player name.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"New_trophies_and_achievements\">New trophies and achievements</span></h3>\n<p>A trophy or achievement in Junethack needs a winning condition, a small image (54 by 54 pixels), a name, and a description.  Your variant needs to encode the winning condition unambiguously in the xlogfile.\n</p><p>The 12 classic xlogfile conditions (ascended, entered Astral Plane, entered Elemental Planes, obtained the Amulet of Yendor, performed the Invocation Ritual, obtained the Book of the Dead, obtained the Bell of Opening, obtained the Candelabrum of Invocation, entered Gehennom, defeated Medusa, obtained the luckstone from the Mines, obtained the Sokoban Prize) are already encoded in the standard xlogfile and need no extra code.`\n</p><p>Historically, achievements were encoded in bitfields in the xlogfile patch. This is rather cumbersome and errorprone to decode, even more so if you consider the different variants that might use the same bits for different conditions. Look at <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/0e4ff07cef\">achieveX or conductX in NetHack 3.7</a>, or <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/UnNetHack/UnNetHack/commit/2cda06425f\">the various extended fields in UnNetHack</a>.\n</p><p>There are colored blank templates of the right size <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/junethack/Junethack/tree/master/icons/templates\">for the achievement images in the repository</a>. The achievement images don't need to be artistically fancy or even great (just look how some of the existing ones look like). If your skills fail you completely, you can add a request like \"make it a yellow &amp;\". Simple images can be done programmatically from the Ruby scripts in the icons directory. The colors can be anything although most images follow the 16 standard terminal colors and the symbol can be almost anything due to Unicode.  \n</p><p>For an example which makes adding new achievements very easy, look at <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/Chris-plus-alphanumericgibberish/dNAO/blob/compat-3.21.4/junethack_trophies/trophy_descriptions.csv\">this CSV for dNetHack specific achievements</a> which contains everything needed. Adding support for trophies documented this is quite easy, as shown in <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/junethack/Junethack/commit/55f7064c4d\">this commit</a>.\n</p><p>If possible, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/junethack/Junethack/issues/new\">open up a GitHub issue</a> and attach your files there.\n</p><p>Remember, the easier it is to add your achievements, the more likely they will actually be added.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20240926184228\nCache expiry: 604800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.009

is the official FAQ for the [[Junethack]] tournament.\n\nFeel free to add questions and answers to this document.\n\n== General ==\n\n=== Contact ===\nYou can reach the organizers and other players in various ways.\n\nOn the NetHack subreddit is a [https://www.reddit.com/r/nethack/comments/bvellj/junethack_2019_the_9th_nethack_crossvariant/ Junethack thread] throughout the month.\n\nThere's a dedicated discord channel [https://discord.gg/AKUy6RG #nethack-junethack] on the Roguelikes discord channel.\n\nOn the [[Libera]] IRC network, is a [irc://irc.libera.chat/junethack #junethack] channel.\n\nLast but not least there's the newsgroup [[rec.games.roguelike.nethack]].\n\n=== What's new in 2024? ===\n\n[[NotnotdNetHack]] on the [[hardfought]] public servers is a new variant of notdNetHack which is a variant of dNetHack.\n\nThe mobile versions of [[GnollHack]] are able to participate via its Android and iOS clients in the tournament.\n\nPrevious year's news are [[Junethack/FAQ/Archive|archived on this page]].\n\n=== I missed the start of the tournament, can I still play? ===\n\nYou can join the tournament right up until it ends; even if you miss the very start, there's still plenty of time to play. In fact, after signing up, any games that you played on a participating server entirely during June will retroactively become eligible for the tournament, so you can start playing now and decide whether or not to join later.\n\n=== How do I play? ===\n\nYou play your games on one of the participating [https://junethack.net/servers public servers].\nYou can use your existing accounts if you like, or create a new one.\nJunethack then captures those games, and checks if you are eligible for trophies.\n\n=== I'm not a good player ===\n\nJunethack is informally known as \"the tournament for players who suck at NetHack\". \n\nConsider joining a clan as all clan trophies are designed such that even a new player of NetHack is never detrimental to the clan and might even be able to contribute towards the clan score.\n\n=== When does the tournament start and end? ===\nThe tournament starts at June 1st 00:00 UTC and ends on June 30th right before midnight UTC.\n\nRegistration opens usually on Monday before June 1st.\n\nAll dates in Junethack are in UTC.\n\n=== What games are eligible for the tournament? ===\nGames of NetHack and variants played on the participating [https://junethack.net/servers public servers] during June are eligible.\n\nA game needs to have started and ended in June to be eligible.\n\nA game will be excluded and ignored for the tournament if one of the following conditions apply:\n - it's a special game mode like e.g. [[explore mode]], [[wizard mode]], etc. \n - it's a [[start_scumming|startscummed]] game (currently defined as escaping or quitting within the first 10 turns)\n - it's an elven [[Anachrononaut]] (because they can kill [[Medusa]] trivially, getting that trophy)\n - it's a [[GnollHack]] game on difficulty lower than Expert, if played on mobile (games played on public servers are currently not filtered by difficulty)\n\n=== Why aren't the achievements from my game showing up on the scoreboard or being announced in IRC? ===\nTypically, this is because your game hasn't ended yet, or has ended very recently. Junethack operates by reading games' [[xlogfile]]s, which only record a game after it is complete. Additionally, it only checks periodically for new data, rather than constantly, so there may be a lag of several minutes before a completed game is registered.\n\n=== My login from last year doesn't work ===\n\nJunethack starts each year with a clean setup. You need to re-register your login every year.\n\n== Achievements / Trophies ==\n\n=== Medusa kills ===\n\nOnly one kill per game counts towards the \"Medusa kill\" clan trophy \n\n=== Most variant/trophy or ascended variant/role/race/alignment/gender combinations ===\n\nIf two clan members both get the same sets of trophies in the same variants, the trophies only count once towards the clan trophies.\n\nBut as a clan member can at any time leave and join a different clan, it's not necessarily redundant to have several clan members claiming the same trophies.\n\n=== Conducts ===\n\nDue to the significant variation across different variants in the types of conducts tracked and the technical methods used for tracking them, Junethack only monitors the 12 \"classical\" conducts.\n\nWhenever the general term \"conducts\" is used in relation to Junethack, it specifically refers to these  conducts:\n\n* [[Foodless]]\n* [[Conduct#Vegan|Vegan]]\n* [[Conduct#Vegetarian|Vegetarian]]\n* [[Atheist]]\n* [[Never hit with a wielded weapon|Weaponless]]\n* [[Pacifist]]\n* [[Illiterate]]\n* [[Conduct#Never_polymorph_an_object|Polypileless]]\n* [[Conduct#Never change form|Polyselfless]]\n* [[Wishless]]\n* [[Wishless|Artifact wishless]]\n* [[Conduct#Genocideless|Genocideless]]\n\n== Clans ==\n\n=== How do I join a clan? ===\n\nYou need to be invited by a clan admin. You see clan invitations at the bottom of your administration page after you login.\n\nThe clan admin is listed on the [https://junethack.net/clans  Junethack clan page].\n\n=== Where can I find other players? ===\n\nYou could either check out the [https://reddit.com/r/nethack  NetHack subreddit], the #junethack channel on the [[Libera]] IRC network, or the [https://discord.gg/mFNbXGy  Roguelikes discord channel].\n\n== Variant developer information ==\n\n=== What is needed for my variant to be included in Junethack? ===\n\nYou need to have a public server on which your variant is installed and can be played online.\n\nThe public server needs to have a [[xlogfile]] (included and enabled by default in NetHack since 3.6.0) that is accessible from the web.\n\nThe user configs needs to be accessible from the web as well for verification purposes.\n\nNot required but nice to have is if the URL of the dumplogs on your public server can be deduced from the xlogfile data so that they can be linked from the Junethack site. Most public servers use a combination of game starting time in unix epoch time and the player name.\n\n=== New trophies and achievements ===\n\nA trophy or achievement in Junethack needs a winning condition, a small image (54 by 54 pixels), a name, and a description.  Your variant needs to encode the winning condition unambiguously in the xlogfile.\n\nThe 12 classic xlogfile conditions (ascended, entered Astral Plane, entered Elemental Planes, obtained the Amulet of Yendor, performed the Invocation Ritual, obtained the Book of the Dead, obtained the Bell of Opening, obtained the Candelabrum of Invocation, entered Gehennom, defeated Medusa, obtained the luckstone from the Mines, obtained the Sokoban Prize) are already encoded in the standard xlogfile and need no extra code.`\n\nHistorically, achievements were encoded in bitfields in the xlogfile patch. This is rather cumbersome and errorprone to decode, even more so if you consider the different variants that might use the same bits for different conditions. Look at [https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/0e4ff07cef achieveX or conductX in NetHack 3.7], or [https://github.com/UnNetHack/UnNetHack/commit/2cda06425f the various extended fields in UnNetHack].\n\nThere are colored blank templates of the right size [https://github.com/junethack/Junethack/tree/master/icons/templates for the achievement images in the repository]. The achievement images don't need to be artistically fancy or even great (just look how some of the existing ones look like). If your skills fail you completely, you can add a request like \"make it a yellow &\". Simple images can be done programmatically from the Ruby scripts in the icons directory. The colors can be anything although most images follow the 16 standard terminal colors and the symbol can be almost anything due to Unicode.  \n\nFor an example which makes adding new achievements very easy, look at [https://github.com/Chris-plus-alphanumericgibberish/dNAO/blob/compat-3.21.4/junethack_trophies/trophy_descriptions.csv this CSV for dNetHack specific achievements] which contains everything needed. Adding support for trophies documented this is quite easy, as shown in [https://github.com/junethack/Junethack/commit/55f7064c4d this commit].\n\nIf possible, [https://github.com/junethack/Junethack/issues/new open up a GitHub issue] and attach your files there.\n\nRemember, the easier it is to add your achievements, the more likely they will actually be added.\n\n[[Category:Tournaments]]"}

{"title":"Wands Balance Patch","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Wands_Balance_Patch","type":"markdown","data":"The **Wands Balance Patch** is based on an essay by [NetHack4](/wiki/NetHack4 \"NetHack4\") developer Alex Smith, [\"Wand balance in NetHack\"](http://nethack4.org/blog/wand-balance.html). The proposal outlined therein was implemented by [FIQHack](/wiki/User:FIQ/FIQhack \"User:FIQ/FIQhack\"), and was later merged into [NetHack Fourk](/wiki/NetHack_Fourk \"NetHack Fourk\") as well. Note that the two implementations have slight, generally minor differences.\n\nIn addition to the changes to wands, the wand rebalance made monsters zap each other with helpful wands (polymorph sometimes, invisibility and speed monster), and made monsters zap enemies with slow monster and undead turning. FIQHack has further changes to monster AI in general.\n\nThe purpose of the patch is to make wands more useful later on and avoid [GWTWOD](/wiki/GWTWOD \"GWTWOD\") cases (which is an issue with a lot of wands, not just death). In addition, most of the wands in NetHack cease to be very useful as the game progresses: Attack wands have fixed damage that might be effective in the early game, but later on the damage is so small that zapping them might be a waste of turns. Utility wands remain a bit more useful, but even they have fixed, quite boring behaviour, often supplanted by spells.\n\nTo improve wands in NetHack, this patch makes wands scale. The effects are no longer fixed, but become more powerful with the newly introduced **wands skill**. Players gain this skill by using wands. Additionally, the effective skill can be affected by the wand's [beatitude](/wiki/BUC \"BUC\"):\n\n- Cursed wands lower effective skill by one, blessed wands increase it.\n- Zapping a cursed wand while being unskilled will cause the wand to explode - this has similar effects to [breaking wands](/wiki/Breaking_wands \"Breaking wands\").\n\nMonsters are also affected by this change, and for this purpose have a fixed wand skill based on monster type.\n\nA user has suggested improving this page or section as follows:\n\n*\"Please give more information about monster wand skills.\"*\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Skill Caps](#Skill_Caps)\n- [2 Wand Power](#Wand_Power)\n- [3 Ray Effects](#Ray_Effects)\n- [4 Wand Effects Scaling](#Wand_Effects_Scaling)\n\n## Skill Caps\n\nLike most skills in Nethack, different roles can reach varying amounts of proficiency with wands. Starting after June 2023, FIQHack swapped the wand skill abilities of Barbarian and Cavemen (the former now topping at Basic, and cavemen being restricted).\n\n|                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **restricted** | Barbarians, due to their distrust of magic, are unable to train in wand skills.                                                                                                                                         |\n| **basic**      | Cavemen are capable of only basic wand proficiency.                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| **skilled**    | Archeologists, knights, rangers, rogues, samurai, and valkyries may reach the skilled level of proficiency.                                                                                                             |\n| **expert**     | Healers, monks, priests, tourists, and wizards may reach expert level wand proficiency.                                                                                                                                 |\n| **master**     | No role can truly master wand usage innately.

The proposal outlined therein was implemented by <a href=\"/wiki/User:FIQ/FIQhack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"User:FIQ/FIQhack\">FIQHack</a>, and was later merged into <a href=\"/wiki/NetHack_Fourk\" title=\"NetHack Fourk\">NetHack Fourk</a> as well. Note that the two implementations have slight, generally minor differences.\n</p><p>In addition to the changes to wands, the wand rebalance made monsters zap each other with helpful wands (polymorph sometimes, invisibility and speed monster), and made monsters zap enemies with slow monster and undead turning. FIQHack has further changes to monster AI in general.\n</p><p>The purpose of the patch is to make wands more useful later on and avoid <a href=\"/wiki/GWTWOD\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"GWTWOD\">GWTWOD</a> cases (which is an issue with a lot of wands, not just death). In addition, most of the wands in NetHack cease to be very useful as the game progresses: Attack wands have fixed damage that might be effective in the early game, but later on the damage is so small that zapping them might be a waste of turns. Utility wands remain a bit more useful, but even they have fixed, quite boring behaviour, often supplanted by spells.\n</p><p>To improve wands in NetHack, this patch makes wands scale. The effects are no longer fixed, but become more powerful with the newly introduced <b>wands skill</b>. Players gain this skill by using wands. Additionally, the effective skill can be affected by the wand's <a href=\"/wiki/BUC\" title=\"BUC\">beatitude</a>: \n</p>\n<ul><li>Cursed wands lower effective skill by one, blessed wands increase it.</li>\n<li>Zapping a cursed wand while being unskilled will cause the wand to explode - this has similar effects to <a href=\"/wiki/Breaking_wands\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Breaking wands\">breaking wands</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>Monsters are also affected by this change, and for this purpose have a fixed wand skill based on monster type.\n</p>\n<div class=\"todo\">\n<p>A user has suggested improving this page or section as follows:\n</p><p><i>\"Please give more information about monster wand skills.\"</i>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Skill_Caps\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Skill Caps</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Wand_Power\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Wand Power</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Ray_Effects\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Ray Effects</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Wand_Effects_Scaling\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Wand Effects Scaling</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Skill_Caps\">Skill Caps</span></h2>\n<p>Like most skills in Nethack, different roles can reach varying amounts of proficiency with wands.

'''Wands Balance Patch''' is based on an essay by [[NetHack4]] developer Alex Smith, [http://nethack4.org/blog/wand-balance.html \"Wand balance in NetHack\"]. The proposal outlined therein was implemented by [[User:FIQ/FIQhack|FIQHack]], and was later merged into [[NetHack Fourk]] as well. Note that the two implementations have slight, generally minor differences.\n\nIn addition to the changes to wands, the wand rebalance made monsters zap each other with helpful wands (polymorph sometimes, invisibility and speed monster), and made monsters zap enemies with slow monster and undead turning. FIQHack has further changes to monster AI in general.\n\nThe purpose of the patch is to make wands more useful later on and avoid [[GWTWOD]] cases (which is an issue with a lot of wands, not just death). In addition, most of the wands in NetHack cease to be very useful as the game progresses: Attack wands have fixed damage that might be effective in the early game, but later on the damage is so small that zapping them might be a waste of turns. Utility wands remain a bit more useful, but even they have fixed, quite boring behaviour, often supplanted by spells.\n\nTo improve wands in NetHack, this patch makes wands scale. The effects are no longer fixed, but become more powerful with the newly introduced '''wands skill'''. Players gain this skill by using wands. Additionally, the effective skill can be affected by the wand's [[BUC|beatitude]]: \n\n* Cursed wands lower effective skill by one, blessed wands increase it.\n* Zapping a cursed wand while being unskilled will cause the wand to explode - this has similar effects to [[breaking wands]]. \n\nMonsters are also affected by this change, and for this purpose have a fixed wand skill based on monster type.\n\n{{todo|Please give more information about monster wand skills.}}\n\n==Skill Caps==\nLike most skills in Nethack, different roles can reach varying amounts of proficiency with wands. Starting after June 2023, FIQHack swapped the wand skill abilities of Barbarian and Cavemen (the former now topping at Basic, and cavemen being restricted).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''restricted'''\n|Barbarians, due to their distrust of magic, are unable to train in wand skills.\n|-\n|'''basic'''\n|Cavemen are capable of only basic wand proficiency.\n|-\n|'''skilled'''\n|Archeologists, knights, rangers, rogues, samurai, and valkyries may reach the skilled level of proficiency.\n|-\n|'''expert'''\n|Healers, monks, priests, tourists, and wizards may reach expert level wand proficiency.\n|-\n|'''master'''\n|No role can truly master wand usage innately.  However, because having the wand blessed raises the effective skill level by one, an expert user with a blessed wand can get the master-level effect on a particular zap.\n|}\n\n==Wand Power==\n\nFor purposes of overcoming monster MR, the wands use the following power values in FIQHack (Fourk still works like vanilla in this regard):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''unskilled'''\n|5\n|-\n|'''basic'''\n|10\n|-\n|'''skilled'''\n|20\n|-\n|'''expert'''\n|30\n|-\n|'''master'''\n|50\n|}\n\n==Ray Effects==\n\nRays (excluding digging, which never reflected in the first place) work like this:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''unskilled'''\n|No potential item destruction (nor blinding, in the case of lightning).\n|-\n|'''basic'''\n|Same as current.\n|-\n|'''skilled'''\n|If a target (but not a wall) is reflecting, abort the ray and create an explosion centered on the target.

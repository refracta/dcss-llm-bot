They are typically enforced by the [players](/wiki/Player \"Player\") themselves only, though some [variants](/wiki/Variant \"Variant\") track various unofficial conducts.\n\nPlaying on a [public server](/wiki/Public_server \"Public server\") that records [ttyrecs](/wiki/Ttyrec \"Ttyrec\") of your games is a good way to prove that you did an unofficial conduct.\n\n## Popular conducts\n\nOf the unofficial conducts, these tend to get attempted most often, usually in vanilla games.\n\n### Survivor\n\nNever have your life saved by an [amulet of life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\"). It's okay to wear one, so long as you never trigger it by dying. It's also okay to die in a polymorphed form and return to your normal form; this doesn't count as being killed. Choosing not to die in [explore](/wiki/Explore \"Explore\") or [wizard mode](/wiki/Wizard_mode \"Wizard mode\") also breaks this conduct.\n\nVanilla NetHack actually tracks this, but not as a formal conduct. If you manage to [ascend](/wiki/Ascension \"Ascension\") without being lifesaved, you get \"You survived\" in the attributes list; otherwise it states how many times you have been killed.\n\n### Petless\n\nNever have a [pet](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\") of any sort. The starting pet can be turned off from the [options](/wiki/Options \"Options\") file, and most other ways of obtaining pets are very deliberate and easy to avoid. The one exception is the charming effect of a [magic trap](/wiki/Magic_trap \"Magic trap\"), which is possible to trigger without any warning and will instantly tame adjacent monsters.\n\n### Polymorphed\n\nGo through the entire game and ascend while polymorphed. Popular choices include baby dragons, lizards, chickatrices, kittens, little dogs, and rats. Bonus points if you have no hands. More amazing the weaker your polymorphed form is. Every variant which currently offers polyinit mode starts you out with permanent intrinsic unchanging, so you will not be able to repolymorph or revert to your base race, which would be considered breaking the conduct.\n\n### Elberethless\n\nNever engrave [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\"). A stricter version of this conduct would also mean never using the word to scare off monsters in places like Sokoban or the Castle where it's already engraved, but most of the variants that track this conduct only track when you engrave it. This conduct doesn't restrict you from other methods of scaring monsters, such as [instruments](/wiki/Instrument \"Instrument\"), coaligned [temples](/wiki/Temple \"Temple\"), or the [scroll of scare monster](/wiki/Scroll_of_scare_monster \"Scroll of scare monster\").\n\n### Extinctionism\n\n- *Main article: [Extinctionism](/wiki/Extinctionism \"Extinctionism\")*\n\nKill every monster in all the levels until none spawn any more. This is more about patience and dedication than it is about avoiding any specific behavior. It can be done to varying degrees: some extinctionists only kill everything that can be naturally generated with [create monster](/wiki/Create_monster \"Create monster\"); others will repeatedly stone and unstone [statues](/wiki/Statue \"Statue\") of various rare or unique monster types in order to have them treated as extinct. Versions of NetHack that produce [dumplogs](/wiki/Dumplog \"Dumplog\") will show extincted species in the dumplog.\n\n### Minimum score\n\n- *Main article: [Score#How to minimize score](/wiki/Score#How_to_minimize_score \"Score\")*\n\nYou may not gain [score](/wiki/Score \"Score\") in any way. This precludes killing monsters, using scrolls, wands, and potions before formally identifying them, and a few other activities. Unfortunately, you also get points for the depth of the [Sanctum](/wiki/Sanctum \"Sanctum\"), so not every game can attain the theoretical minimum.\n\n### Bonesless\n\nNever load a [bones file](/wiki/Bones_file \"Bones file\"). While many bones files are from relatively early in the game and don't contain much that's particularly useful, they might contain large piles of powerful items, artifacts, or other loot which make the game significantly easier for an adventurer who finds and collects them. Therefore, an ascension that never loaded a bones file couldn't have been able to take advantage of such windfalls. You can force the game not to load bones files by turning the [bones](/wiki/Options#bones \"Options\") option off in your configuration file.\n\nVanilla NetHack does track whether you have loaded any bones files, but similar to Survivor this is not listed in-game as a conduct or reported in the logfile as one.\n\n## Conducts in variants\n\n### Celibate\n\nNever have sex with an [incubus](/wiki/Incubus \"Incubus\") or [succubus](/wiki/Succubus \"Succubus\"), which may give you positive effects such as gaining levels.\n\n### Toolless\n\nOne may not pick up or use any [tools](/wiki/Tool \"Tool\"), with the exception of one's [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\") (if applicable) and the [Bell of Opening](/wiki/Bell_of_Opening \"Bell of Opening\"). At the beginning, one should drop all of one's tools on the starting square before proceeding.\n\nThis restriction has many consequences:\n\n- You cannot use bags or containers. Multiple [stashes](/wiki/Stash \"Stash\") scattered throughout the dungeon will probably be necessary.\n- You cannot use [unicorn horns](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\"), so you need a different source of curing and cannot dip-test.\n- You will have a hard time keeping more than one or two [pets](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\"), since you cannot use [whistles](/wiki/Whistle \"Whistle\") or [leashes](/wiki/Leash \"Leash\").\n- You will be forced to stumble around in the dark unless you manage to obtain a [Sunsword](/wiki/Sunsword \"Sunsword\") or spend a lot of time casting [light spells](/wiki/Spellbook_of_light \"Spellbook of light\"). This can be alleviated through [monster detection](/wiki/Monster_detection \"Monster detection\") and [magic mapping](/wiki/Magic_mapping \"Magic mapping\").\n- You cannot [write](/wiki/Magic_marker \"Magic marker\") extra scrolls or spellbooks.\n- You will not be able to easily [blind](/wiki/Blind \"Blind\") yourself for [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\") purposes, because you cannot use [towels](/wiki/Towel \"Towel\") or [blindfolds](/wiki/Blindfold \"Blindfold\").\n- You will not be able to [ride](/wiki/Ride \"Ride\"), except on your starting [horse](/wiki/Horse \"Horse\") or [pony](/wiki/Pony \"Pony\") if you have one.\n- You will also have to make do without many moderately useful items like [grease](/wiki/Grease \"Grease\"), a [tinning kit](/wiki/Tinning_kit \"Tinning kit\"), a [stethoscope](/wiki/Stethoscope \"Stethoscope\"), [figurines](/wiki/Figurine \"Figurine\"), a [camera](/wiki/Camera \"Camera\") or all varieties of [instrument](/wiki/Instrument \"Instrument\") (which in turn means that you cannot control the [drawbridge](/wiki/Drawbridge \"Drawbridge\") at the [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\")).\n\n### Identifyless\n\nYou may not read a [scroll of identify](/wiki/Scroll_of_identify \"Scroll of identify\"), cast the spell, or take advantage of an insight granted by a throne (which may require avoiding thrones altogether, as their insight has a 20% chance of identifying your entire inventory *without prompting for confirmation*). More specific methods, such as [price identification](/wiki/Price_identification \"Price identification\") or [enlightenment](/wiki/Enlightenment \"Enlightenment\") techniques are acceptable.\n\n###

post their own conducts. You must give some description to the ways the conduct makes NetHack harder, as well as your signature without a timestamp(\\~\\~\\~).\n\n### AC10\n\nThe goal of this conduct is to maintain an [AC](/wiki/AC \"AC\") of 10 for the entire game. This doesn't mean you must be armorless however. A mummy wrapping is the only potentially useful [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\") with 0 AC when unenchanted. Others can have their innate AC lowered by as much as 3 with various forms of [erosion](/wiki/Erosion \"Erosion\") (that [brown pudding](/wiki/Brown_pudding \"Brown pudding\") could be your friend). Some useful 0 AC items might be a rusty helm to protect from falling rock traps, burned or rotted magical cloaks, a rusted helm of telepathy or opposite alignment, rusty gauntlets of power and all manner of degraded magical footwear. Pesky enchantments can be removed with [cancellation](/wiki/Cancellation \"Cancellation\") or by the friendly neighborhood [disenchanter](/wiki/Disenchanter \"Disenchanter\"). [Protection](/wiki/Protection \"Protection\"), whether purchased, worn on your finger, from casting or even [prayer with high luck](/wiki/Prayer#Favors_and_gifts \"Prayer\") breaks the conduct. [Half physical damage](/wiki/Half_physical_damage \"Half physical damage\") artifacts are permissible however. Erode-proof armors such as dragon scales (mail is rather pointless) and silver shields can be offset with a sufficient number of [cursed scrolls of enchant armor](/wiki/Scroll_of_enchant_armor#Cursed \"Scroll of enchant armor\"). A variety of styles, roles and strategies suggest themselves, with only a heavy reliance on melee being a probable non-starter...\n\n[--every](/wiki/User:Jimeikner \"User:Jimeikner\")\n\n### Artifactless\n\nAscend the game without any artifacts beyond the ones necessary for the Invocation ritual (the [Bell of Opening](/wiki/Bell_of_Opening \"Bell of Opening\"), the [Book of the Dead](/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead \"Book of the Dead\") and the [Candelabrum of Invocation](/wiki/Candelabrum_of_Invocation \"Candelabrum of Invocation\")).\n\n### Barter\n\n[You](/wiki/You \"You\") reject the bourgeois Yendorian economy. This forbids the carrying of gold in open inventory.\n\n1. All gold must be dropped on turn 1.\n2. No gold may be picked up, or taken out of a container.\n3. No gold may be carried into a new level (follows from rule \\[1]).\n4. It is permitted to shop with gems.\n5. The probity of coin consumption was for a while disputed. It was decided in the end that this might be one of the most definitive ways to destroy the Yendorian economy. Therefore, floor-based coin consumption as a [metallivore](/wiki/Metallivore \"Metallivore\") is actively encouraged. In fact, floor-based consumption of [Fort Ludios](/wiki/Fort_Ludios \"Fort Ludios\") earns the title *Barter Hero*, and if you achieve a floor-based consumption of every single coin in the game, then don't even bother [ascending](/wiki/Ascend \"Ascend\"), you made it to *Barter Marshal*.\n6. (Some [Vancian](/wiki/Forum:Jack_Vance \"Forum:Jack Vance\") mental gymnastics may be required here) It is permitted to shop by barter of containers that already contain gold.\n\nBarter has some features of [SaintD's](/wiki/User:SaintD \"User:SaintD\") [Moneyless](/wiki/Unofficial_conduct#Moneyless \"Unofficial conduct\") conduct, but is a bit more liberal as it allows shopping.\n\n### Carnivore\n\nBasically, the opposite of [vegan](/wiki/Conduct#Vegan \"Conduct\"): you must only eat corpses that come from animals. This excludes eating food rations, fruit and tins of spinach.\n\nProbably, the easiest role/race for this will be [Cavemen](/wiki/Caveman \"Caveman\") and [orcs](/wiki/Orc_\\(starting_race\\) \"Orc (starting race)\") (no penalty for cannibalism or eating the corpses of domestic animals), but downright impossible, or ill-advised, for [Monks](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\"). --[nabru](/wiki/User:Nabru \"User:Nabru\")\n\n### Cartographer\n\nYou must discover every single square of dungeon on every map and leave all doors open. The idea is that the entire world is now accessible to any future travelers. This adds a lot of time, and there is no closed door protection. Some people do this already on accident, and of course, once you have mapping spells it is trivial. For added headache, also make sure all dungeon tiles are physically connected. -- Funkopedia\n\n### Grid bug\n\nYou can't move diagonally, but you can [jump](/wiki/Jump \"Jump\"). This is challenging because you will need to spend in most cases two turns to perform a movement. Another, more difficult version is that you can't even perform directional actions diagonally, such as [kick](/wiki/Kick \"Kick\"), [fight](/wiki/Fight \"Fight\"), zap [wands](/wiki/Wands \"Wands\") or [spells](/wiki/Spells \"Spells\"), [throw](/wiki/Throw \"Throw\") ecc. --Orl\n\n### Inventoryless\n\nYou must drop your entire starting inventory within the first few turns, and cannot pick up anything except invocation artifacts, the Amulet of Yendor and whatever other items are absolutely necessary to win the game. Bonus conduct: no using items (scrolls, spellbooks, corpses etc.) lying on the floor either. Probably easiest for monk and wizard. [Bluescreenofdeath](/wiki/User:Bluescreenofdeath \"User:Bluescreenofdeath\") ([talk](/wiki/User_talk:Bluescreenofdeath \"User talk:Bluescreenofdeath\"))\n\n### Ironless Elf\n\nApparently elves are allergic to iron. To keep this conduct simple in vanilla, no weapons or armor made of iron may be wielded or worn. This includes Stormbringer, Magicbane and GoP. Tools and projectiles (either thrown or launched) are exempt however. Amulets, being made of iron (with the exceptions of the Amulet of Yendor and its cheap plastic imitations), are prohibited as is any ring randomly labeled as \"iron\". Elf rangers would seem to be the best adapted to this conduct although wizards are also a possibility. A priest's starting mace could be quite a handicap though...\n\n[--every](/wiki/User:Jimeikner \"User:Jimeikner\")\n\n### Moneyless\n\n- You must drop all your starting gold on turn 1.\n- You may not pick up gold.\n- You may not pick up gems besides gray stones.\n- Bonus conduct: No gold rings.\n- You may not sell items in shops. (Price-ID OK.)\n- You may eat coins as a [Metallivore](/wiki/Metallivore \"Metallivore\") if standing on them.\n\n\\--[SaintD](/wiki/User:SaintD \"User:SaintD\")\n\n### Parochial\n\nAscend without ever once entering any of the option dungeon branches (the Gnomish Mines, Sokoban, or Fort Ludios). Most characters will have a 50% chance of accidentally choosing the down stairs to the Mines, but an Archaeologist can avoid this by digging down and then coming back up and noting which stairs are safe. Archaeologists are also advantaged in making up for the loss of the guaranteed luckstone in the Mines, since they can dig for and readily identify luckstones in the regular dungeon. [Fyr](/wiki/User:Fyr \"User:Fyr\") ([talk](/wiki/User_talk:Fyr \"User talk:Fyr\"))\n\n### Punished\n\nPlay the entire game punished. For getting punishment at the start of the game, either play as a [Convict](/wiki/Convict \"Convict\") in a [variant](/wiki/Variant \"Variant\") that has that role, start-scum for a [scroll of punishment](/wiki/Scroll_of_punishment \"Scroll of punishment\") or pray several times and hopefully don't get killed. There is a known punished atheist ascension on [RGRN](/wiki/RGRN \"RGRN\"): [SATAP Punished Atheist](http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_frm/thread/b4bf330c6aacc136)\n\n### Racer\n\nIf you see downward stairs, you must take them.\n\n### Racial\n\nRacial ascensions require the player to make use of [weapons and armor appropriate for the character's race](/wiki/Racial_equipment \"Racial equipment\"). \"Soft\" racial conducts require the player to use racial armor and weapons whenever possible (thus allowing any race to use a T-shirt or Hawaiian shirt, because there are no race-specific items for the [shirt](/wiki/Shirt \"Shirt\") slot). \"Hard\" racial conducts require that the player **only** use race-specific items in the weapon and armor slots (thus making shirts and [gloves](/wiki/Glove \"Glove\") completely unavailable). It is generally acceptable to use items that are not technically race-specific, but have a strong association with that race (such as the [aklys](/wiki/Aklys \"Aklys\") for gnomes).\n\nThe acceptable items for each race are as follows:\n\n- **[Dwarf](/wiki/Dwarf_\\(starting_race\\) \"Dwarf (starting race)\"):** [Dwarvish mattock](/wiki/Dwarvish_mattock \"Dwarvish mattock\"), [dwarvish short sword](/wiki/Dwarvish_short_sword \"Dwarvish short sword\"), [dwarvish spear](/wiki/Dwarvish_spear \"Dwarvish spear\"), [dwarvish cloak](/wiki/Dwarvish_cloak \"Dwarvish cloak\"), [dwarvish iron helm](/wiki/Dwarvish_iron_helm \"Dwarvish iron helm\"), [dwarvish mithril-coat](/wiki/Dwarvish_mithril-coat \"Dwarvish mithril-coat\"), [dwarvish roundshield](/wiki/Dwarvish_roundshield \"Dwarvish roundshield\"), [iron shoes](/wiki/Iron_shoes \"Iron shoes\").\n- **[Elf](/wiki/Elf_\\(starting_race\\) \"Elf (starting race)\"):** [Elven dagger](/wiki/Elven_dagger \"Elven dagger\"), [elven short sword](/wiki/Elven_short_sword \"Elven short sword\"), [elven spear](/wiki/Elven_spear \"Elven spear\"), [elven broadsword](/wiki/Elven_broadsword \"Elven broadsword\"), [elven bow](/wiki/Elven_bow \"Elven bow\"), [elven arrow](/wiki/Elven_arrow \"Elven arrow\"), [elven mithril-coat](/wiki/Elven_mithril-coat \"Elven mithril-coat\"), [elven cloak](/wiki/Elven_cloak \"Elven cloak\"), [elven boots](/wiki/Elven_boots \"Elven boots\"), [elven shield](/wiki/Elven_shield \"Elven shield\"), [elven leather helm](/wiki/Elven_leather_helm \"Elven leather helm\").\n- **[Gnome](/wiki/Gnome_\\(starting_race\\) \"Gnome (starting race)\"):** [Aklys](/wiki/Aklys \"Aklys\"), [crossbow](/wiki/Crossbow \"Crossbow\"), [crossbow bolt](/wiki/Crossbow_bolt \"Crossbow bolt\").\n- **[Orc](/wiki/Orc_\\(starting_race\\) \"Orc (starting race)\"):** [Orcish dagger](/wiki/Orcish_dagger \"Orcish dagger\"), [orcish short sword](/wiki/Orcish_short_sword \"Orcish short sword\"), [orcish spear](/wiki/Orcish_spear \"Orcish spear\"), [orcish bow](/wiki/Orcish_bow \"Orcish bow\"), [orcish arrow](/wiki/Orcish_arrow \"Orcish arrow\"), [orcish chain mail](/wiki/Orcish_chain_mail \"Orcish chain mail\"), [orcish ring mail](/wiki/Orcish_ring_mail \"Orcish ring mail\"), [orcish cloak](/wiki/Orcish_cloak \"Orcish cloak\"), [orcish helm](/wiki/Orcish_helm \"Orcish helm\"), [orcish shield](/wiki/Orcish_shield \"Orcish shield\"), [Uruk-hai shield](/wiki/Uruk-hai_shield \"Uruk-hai shield\").\n- **[Human](/wiki/Human_\\(starting_race\\) \"Human (starting race)\"):** [chain mail](/wiki/Chain_mail \"Chain mail\"), [dagger](/wiki/Dagger \"Dagger\"), [high boots](/wiki/High_boots \"High boots\"), [knife](/wiki/Knife \"Knife\"), [large shield](/wiki/Large_shield \"Large shield\"), [leather cloak](/wiki/Leather_cloak \"Leather cloak\"), [leather gloves](/wiki/Leather_gloves \"Leather gloves\"), [long sword](/wiki/Long_sword \"Long sword\"), [low boots](/wiki/Low_boots \"Low boots\"), [plate mail](/wiki/Plate_mail \"Plate mail\"), [ring mail](/wiki/Ring_mail \"Ring mail\"), [short sword](/wiki/Short_sword \"Short sword\"), [silver saber](/wiki/Silver_saber \"Silver saber\"), [small shield](/wiki/Small_shield \"Small shield\"), [spear](/wiki/Spear \"Spear\")\n\nThere are no restrictions on items that are neither weapons nor armor.\n\nRacial ascensions obviously vary in difficulty depending on the race. A hard racial elf suffers from little more than a lack of access to dragon mail or powerful artifacts, while a hard racial gnome is playing a nude conduct with a substandard weapon.\n\n- A page of racial ascensions can be found here: [\\[1\\]](http://groups.google.ca/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/45f835e3a077cec8/a5ec41d2593ec24e?)\n- A racial orc, combined with the illiterate conduct: [\\[2\\]](http://groups.google.ca/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/a942fef4197d9033/5a956e85015c2aae?)\n\nMany variants give bonuses to certain monsters wearing appropriate racial equipment, and often expand on the amount of racial equipment available.\n\nHumans are generally not used for racial ascensions. --[Snikers](/index.php?title=User:Snikers\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"User:Snikers (page does not exist)\")\n\n(Some people play Humans counting the equipment from Keystone Kops and Minetown Guards as racial) -LL\n\n### Stick user\n\nYou may only use wands to cause damage and otherwise affect the dungeon. No use of weapons is allowed to #force locks or attack. You should rely on powerful pets. The [wizard](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\"), a role with some of the best damage potential from spells, is one of the best roles for this conduct. -- [Kalon](/wiki/User:Kalon \"User:Kalon\") 01:34, 7 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n### Stubborn\n\nGo through the entire game with your starting equipment. This is a difficult task, because you cannot use any rings, amulets, weapons, spellbooks, or items other than the ones with which you started. This is nearly impossible for the Tourist role, which is designed to buy necessary items.\n\nExceptions are allowed for the [Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor \"Amulet of Yendor\"), the [Bell of Opening](/wiki/Bell_of_Opening \"Bell of Opening\"), and any of the items absolutely necessary to retrieve the [Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor \"Amulet of Yendor\") or the [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\") that you earn through the [quest](/wiki/Quest \"Quest\"). --[Edrobot](/index.php?title=User:Edrobot\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"User:Edrobot (page does not exist)\")\n\n### Taciturn\n\nDon't use #[chat](/wiki/Chat \"Chat\"). As a result, you cannot talk to your pet (you'll need a [stethoscope](/wiki/Stethoscope \"Stethoscope\") for that), and you cannot buy protection from priests.\n\nA more difficult version would be to avoid any commands that might involve talking, such as #[pray](/wiki/Pray \"Pray\"), #[offer](/wiki/Offer \"Offer\"), or [pay](/wiki/P \"P\").

by the vanilla version of <a href=\"/wiki/NetHack\" title=\"NetHack\">NetHack</a>. They are typically enforced by the <a href=\"/wiki/Player\" title=\"Player\">players</a> themselves only, though some <a href=\"/wiki/Variant\" title=\"Variant\">variants</a> track various unofficial conducts.\n</p><p>Playing on a <a href=\"/wiki/Public_server\" title=\"Public server\">public server</a> that records <a href=\"/wiki/Ttyrec\" title=\"Ttyrec\">ttyrecs</a> of your games is a good way to prove that you did an unofficial conduct.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Popular_conducts\">Popular conducts</span></h2>\n<p>Of the unofficial conducts, these tend to get attempted most often, usually in vanilla games.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Survivor\">Survivor</span></h3>\n<p>Never have your life saved by an <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving\" title=\"Amulet of life saving\">amulet of life saving</a>. It's okay to wear one, so long as you never trigger it by dying. It's also okay to die in a polymorphed form and return to your normal form; this doesn't count as being killed. Choosing not to die in <a href=\"/wiki/Explore\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Explore\">explore</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard_mode\" title=\"Wizard mode\">wizard mode</a> also breaks this conduct.\n</p><p>Vanilla NetHack actually tracks this, but not as a formal conduct. If you manage to <a href=\"/wiki/Ascension\" title=\"Ascension\">ascend</a> without being lifesaved, you get \"You survived\" in the attributes list; otherwise it states how many times you have been killed.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Petless\">Petless</span></h3>\n<p>Never have a <a href=\"/wiki/Pet\" title=\"Pet\">pet</a> of any sort. The starting pet can be turned off from the <a href=\"/wiki/Options\" title=\"Options\">options</a> file, and most other ways of obtaining pets are very deliberate and easy to avoid. The one exception is the charming effect of a <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_trap\" title=\"Magic trap\">magic trap</a>, which is possible to trigger without any warning and will instantly tame adjacent monsters.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Polymorphed\">Polymorphed</span></h3>\n<p>Go through the entire game and ascend while polymorphed. Popular choices include baby dragons, lizards, chickatrices, kittens, little dogs, and rats. Bonus points if you have no hands. More amazing the weaker your polymorphed form is. Every variant which currently offers polyinit mode starts you out with permanent intrinsic unchanging, so you will not be able to repolymorph or revert to your base race, which would be considered breaking the conduct.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Elberethless\">Elberethless</span></h3>\n<p>Never engrave <a href=\"/wiki/Elbereth\" title=\"Elbereth\">Elbereth</a>. A stricter version of this conduct would also mean never using the word to scare off monsters in places like Sokoban or the Castle where it's already engraved, but most of the variants that track this conduct only track when you engrave it. This conduct doesn't restrict you from other methods of scaring monsters, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Instrument\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Instrument\">instruments</a>, coaligned <a href=\"/wiki/Temple\" title=\"Temple\">temples</a>, or the <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_scare_monster\" title=\"Scroll of scare monster\">scroll of scare monster</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Extinctionism\">Extinctionism</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><div class=\"noprint relarticle mainarticle\"><i>Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Extinctionism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Extinctionism\">Extinctionism</a></i></div></dd></dl>\n<p>Kill every monster in all the levels until none spawn any more. This is more about patience and dedication than it is about avoiding any specific behavior. It can be done to varying degrees: some extinctionists only kill everything that can be naturally generated with <a href=\"/wiki/Create_monster\" title=\"Create monster\">create monster</a>; others will repeatedly stone and unstone <a href=\"/wiki/Statue\" title=\"Statue\">statues</a> of various rare or unique monster types in order to have them treated as extinct.

While many bones files are from relatively early in the game and don't contain much that's particularly useful, they might contain large piles of powerful items, artifacts, or other loot which make the game significantly easier for an adventurer who finds and collects them. Therefore, an ascension that never loaded a bones file couldn't have been able to take advantage of such windfalls. You can force the game not to load bones files by turning the <a href=\"/wiki/Options#bones\" title=\"Options\">bones</a> option off in your configuration file.\n</p><p>Vanilla NetHack does track whether you have loaded any bones files, but similar to Survivor this is not listed in-game as a conduct or reported in the logfile as one.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Conducts_in_variants\">Conducts in variants</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Celibate\">Celibate</span></h3>\n<p>Never have sex with an <a href=\"/wiki/Incubus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Incubus\">incubus</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Succubus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Succubus\">succubus</a>, which may give you positive effects such as gaining levels.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Toolless\">Toolless</span></h3>\n<p>One may not pick up or use any <a href=\"/wiki/Tool\" title=\"Tool\">tools</a>, with the exception of one's <a href=\"/wiki/Quest_artifact\" title=\"Quest artifact\">quest artifact</a> (if applicable) and the <a href=\"/wiki/Bell_of_Opening\" title=\"Bell of Opening\">Bell of Opening</a>.

conducts''' are [[conduct]]s that are not tracked by the vanilla version of [[NetHack]]. They are typically enforced by the [[player]]s themselves only, though some [[variant]]s track various unofficial conducts.\n\nPlaying on a [[public server]] that records [[ttyrec]]s of your games is a good way to prove that you did an unofficial conduct.\n\n==Popular conducts==\nOf the unofficial conducts, these tend to get attempted most often, usually in vanilla games.\n\n===Survivor===\nNever have your life saved by an [[amulet of life saving]]. It's okay to wear one, so long as you never trigger it by dying. It's also okay to die in a polymorphed form and return to your normal form; this doesn't count as being killed. Choosing not to die in [[explore]] or [[wizard mode]] also breaks this conduct.\n\nVanilla NetHack actually tracks this, but not as a formal conduct. If you manage to [[ascension|ascend]] without being lifesaved, you get \"You survived\" in the attributes list; otherwise it states how many times you have been killed.\n\n===Petless===\nNever have a [[pet]] of any sort. The starting pet can be turned off from the [[options]] file, and most other ways of obtaining pets are very deliberate and easy to avoid. The one exception is the charming effect of a [[magic trap]], which is possible to trigger without any warning and will instantly tame adjacent monsters.\n\n===Polymorphed===\nGo through the entire game and ascend while polymorphed. Popular choices include baby dragons, lizards, chickatrices, kittens, little dogs, and rats. Bonus points if you have no hands. More amazing the weaker your polymorphed form is. Every variant which currently offers polyinit mode starts you out with permanent intrinsic unchanging, so you will not be able to repolymorph or revert to your base race, which would be considered breaking the conduct.\n\n===Elberethless===\nNever engrave [[Elbereth]]. A stricter version of this conduct would also mean never using the word to scare off monsters in places like Sokoban or the Castle where it's already engraved, but most of the variants that track this conduct only track when you engrave it. This conduct doesn't restrict you from other methods of scaring monsters, such as [[instrument]]s, coaligned [[temple]]s, or the [[scroll of scare monster]].\n\n=== Extinctionism ===\n{{main|Extinctionism}}\nKill every monster in all the levels until none spawn any more. This is more about patience and dedication than it is about avoiding any specific behavior. It can be done to varying degrees: some extinctionists only kill everything that can be naturally generated with [[create monster]]; others will repeatedly stone and unstone [[statue]]s of various rare or unique monster types in order to have them treated as extinct. Versions of NetHack that produce [[dumplog]]s will show extincted species in the dumplog.\n\n===Minimum score===\n{{main|Score#How to minimize score}}\nYou may not gain [[score]] in any way. This precludes killing monsters, using scrolls, wands, and potions before formally identifying them, and a few other activities. Unfortunately, you also get points for the depth of the [[Sanctum]], so not every game can attain the theoretical minimum.\n\n=== Bonesless ===\nNever load a [[bones file]]. While many bones files are from relatively early in the game and don't contain much that's particularly useful, they might contain large piles of powerful items, artifacts, or other loot which make the game significantly easier for an adventurer who finds and collects them. Therefore, an ascension that never loaded a bones file couldn't have been able to take advantage of such windfalls. You can force the game not to load bones files by turning the [[Options#bones|bones]] option off in your configuration file.\n\nVanilla NetHack does track whether you have loaded any bones files, but similar to Survivor this is not listed in-game as a conduct or reported in the logfile as one.\n\n== Conducts in variants ==\n\n===Celibate===\nNever have sex with an [[incubus]] or [[succubus]], which may give you positive effects such as gaining levels.\n\n===Toolless===\nOne may not pick up or use any [[tool]]s, with the exception of one's [[quest artifact]] (if applicable) and the [[Bell of Opening]]. At the beginning, one should drop all of one's tools on the starting square before proceeding.\n\nThis restriction has many consequences:\n* You cannot use bags or containers. Multiple [[stash]]es scattered throughout the dungeon will probably be necessary.\n* You cannot use [[unicorn horn]]s, so you need a different source of curing and cannot dip-test.\n* You will have a hard time keeping more than one or two [[pet]]s, since you cannot use [[whistle]]s or [[leash]]es.\n* You will be forced to stumble around in the dark unless you manage to obtain a [[Sunsword]] or spend a lot of time casting [[spellbook of light|light spells]]. This can be alleviated through [[monster detection]] and [[magic mapping]].\n* You cannot [[magic marker|write]] extra scrolls or spellbooks.\n* You will not be able to easily [[blind]] yourself for [[telepathy]] purposes, because you cannot use [[towel]]s or [[blindfold]]s.\n* You will not be able to [[ride]], except on your starting [[horse]] or [[pony]] if you have one.\n* You will also have to make do without many moderately useful items like [[grease]], a [[tinning kit]], a [[stethoscope]], [[figurine]]s, a [[camera]] or all varieties of [[instrument]] (which in turn means that you cannot control the [[drawbridge]] at the [[Castle]]).\n\n=== Identifyless ===\nYou may not read a [[scroll of identify]], cast the spell, or take advantage of an insight granted by a throne (which may require avoiding thrones altogether, as their insight has a 20% chance of identifying your entire inventory ''without prompting for confirmation''). More specific methods, such as [[price identification]] or [[enlightenment]] techniques are acceptable.\n\n=== Table of variant tracked conducts ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Conduct !!

You must give some description to the ways the conduct makes NetHack harder, as well as your signature without a timestamp(<nowiki>~~~</nowiki>).\n\n===AC10===\n\nThe goal of this conduct is to maintain an [[AC]] of 10 for the entire game. This doesn't mean you must be armorless however. A mummy wrapping is the only potentially useful [[armor]] with 0 AC when unenchanted. Others can have their innate AC lowered by as much as 3 with various forms of [[erosion]] (that [[brown pudding]] could be your friend). Some useful 0 AC items might be a rusty helm to protect from falling rock traps, burned or rotted magical cloaks, a rusted helm of telepathy or opposite alignment, rusty gauntlets of power and all manner of degraded magical footwear. Pesky enchantments can be removed with [[cancellation]] or by the friendly neighborhood [[disenchanter]]. [[Protection]], whether purchased, worn on your finger, from casting or even [[Prayer#Favors_and_gifts|prayer with high luck]] breaks the conduct. [[Half physical damage]] artifacts are permissible however. Erode-proof armors such as dragon scales (mail is rather pointless) and silver shields can be offset with a sufficient number of  [[Scroll_of_enchant_armor#Cursed|cursed scrolls of enchant armor]]. A variety of styles, roles and strategies suggest themselves, with only a heavy reliance on melee being a probable non-starter... \n\n[[User:Jimeikner|--every]]\n\n===Artifactless===\nAscend the game without any artifacts beyond the ones necessary for the Invocation ritual (the [[Bell of Opening]], the [[Book of the Dead]] and the [[Candelabrum of Invocation]]).\n\n===Barter===\n[[You]] reject the bourgeois Yendorian economy.  This forbids the carrying of gold in open inventory.  \n# All gold must be dropped on turn 1.  \n# No gold may be picked up, or taken out of a container.  \n# No gold may be carried into a new level (follows from rule [1]).\n# It is permitted to shop with gems.\n# The probity of coin consumption was for a while disputed.  It was decided in the end that this might be one of the most definitive ways to destroy the Yendorian economy.  Therefore, floor-based coin consumption as a [[metallivore]] is actively encouraged.  In fact, floor-based consumption of [[Fort Ludios]] earns the title ''Barter Hero'', and if you achieve a floor-based consumption of every single coin in the game, then don't even bother [[ascend|ascending]], you made it to ''Barter Marshal''.   \n# (Some [[Forum:Jack Vance|Vancian]] mental gymnastics may be required here) It is permitted to shop by barter of containers that already contain gold.\nBarter has some features of [[User:SaintD|SaintD's]] [[Unofficial_conduct#Moneyless|Moneyless]] conduct, but is a bit more liberal as it allows shopping.\n\n=== Carnivore ===\nBasically, the opposite of [[Conduct#Vegan|vegan]]: you must only eat corpses that come from animals. This excludes eating food rations, fruit and tins of spinach. \n\nProbably, the easiest role/race for this will be [[Caveman|Cavemen]] and [[Orc (starting race)|orcs]] (no penalty for cannibalism or eating the corpses of domestic animals), but downright impossible, or ill-advised, for [[Monk]]s. --[[User:Nabru|nabru]]\n\n=== Cartographer ===\nYou must discover every single square of dungeon on every map and leave all doors open. The idea is that the entire world is now accessible to any future travelers. This adds a lot of time, and there is no closed door protection. Some people do this already on accident, and of course, once you have mapping spells it is trivial. For added headache, also make sure all dungeon tiles are physically connected. -- Funkopedia\n\n=== Grid bug ===\nYou can't move diagonally, but you can [[jump]]. This is challenging because you will need to spend in most cases two turns to perform a movement. Another, more difficult version is that you can't even perform directional actions diagonally, such as [[kick]], [[fight]], zap [[wands]] or [[spells]], [[throw]] ecc. --Orl\n\n===Inventoryless===\nYou must drop your entire starting inventory within the first few turns, and cannot pick up anything except invocation artifacts, the Amulet of Yendor and whatever other items are absolutely necessary to win the game. Bonus conduct: no using items (scrolls, spellbooks, corpses etc.) lying on the floor either. Probably easiest for monk and wizard. [[User:Bluescreenofdeath|Bluescreenofdeath]] ([[User talk:Bluescreenofdeath|talk]])\n\n===Ironless Elf===\nApparently elves are allergic to iron. To keep this conduct simple in vanilla, no weapons or armor made of iron may be wielded or worn. This includes Stormbringer, Magicbane and GoP. Tools and projectiles (either thrown or launched) are exempt however. Amulets, being made of iron (with the exceptions of the Amulet of Yendor and its cheap plastic imitations), are prohibited as is any ring randomly labeled as \"iron\". Elf rangers would seem to be the best adapted to this conduct although wizards are also a possibility. A priest's starting mace could be quite a handicap though... \n\n[[User:Jimeikner|--every]]\n\n===Moneyless===\n\n* You must drop all your starting gold on turn 1.\n* You may not pick up gold.\n* You may not pick up gems besides gray stones.\n* Bonus conduct: No gold rings.\n* You may not sell items in shops. (Price-ID OK.)\n* You may eat coins as a [[Metallivore]] if standing on them.\n\n--[[User:SaintD|SaintD]]\n\n===Parochial===\nAscend without ever once entering any of the option dungeon branches (the Gnomish Mines, Sokoban, or Fort Ludios). Most characters will have a 50% chance of accidentally choosing the down stairs to the Mines, but an Archaeologist can avoid this by digging down and then coming back up and noting which stairs are safe. Archaeologists are also advantaged in making up for the loss of the guaranteed luckstone in the Mines, since they can dig for and readily identify luckstones in the regular dungeon.\n[[User:Fyr|Fyr]] ([[User talk:Fyr|talk]])\n\n===Punished===\nPlay the entire game punished. For getting punishment at the start of the game, either play as a [[Convict]] in a [[variant]] that has that role, start-scum for a [[scroll of punishment]] or pray several times and hopefully don't get killed. There is a known punished atheist ascension on [[RGRN]]: [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_frm/thread/b4bf330c6aacc136 SATAP Punished Atheist]\n\n===Racer===\nIf you see downward stairs, you must take them.\n\n===Racial===\nRacial ascensions require the player to make use of [[Racial equipment|weapons and armor appropriate for the character's race]]. \"Soft\" racial conducts require the player to use racial armor and weapons whenever possible (thus allowing any race to use a T-shirt or Hawaiian shirt, because there are no race-specific items for the [[shirt]] slot). \"Hard\" racial conducts require that the player '''only''' use race-specific items in the weapon and armor slots (thus making shirts and [[glove]]s completely unavailable). It is generally acceptable to use items that are not technically race-specific, but have a strong association with that race (such as the [[aklys]] for gnomes).\n\nThe acceptable items for each race are as follows:\n\n*'''[[Dwarf (starting race)|Dwarf]]:''' [[Dwarvish mattock]], [[dwarvish short sword]], [[dwarvish spear]], [[dwarvish cloak]], [[dwarvish iron helm]], [[dwarvish mithril-coat]], [[dwarvish roundshield]], [[iron shoes]].\n*'''[[Elf (starting race)|Elf]]:''' [[Elven dagger]], [[elven short sword]], [[elven spear]], [[elven broadsword]], [[elven bow]], [[elven arrow]], [[elven mithril-coat]], [[elven cloak]], [[elven boots]], [[elven shield]], [[elven leather helm]].\n*'''[[Gnome (starting race)|Gnome]]:''' [[Aklys]], [[crossbow]], [[crossbow bolt]].\n*'''[[Orc (starting race)|Orc]]:''' [[Orcish dagger]], [[orcish short sword]], [[orcish spear]], [[orcish bow]], [[orcish arrow]], [[orcish chain mail]], [[orcish ring mail]], [[orcish cloak]], [[orcish helm]], [[orcish shield]], [[Uruk-hai shield]].\n*'''[[Human (starting race)|Human]]:''' [[chain mail]], [[dagger]], [[high boots]], [[knife]], [[large shield]], [[leather cloak]], [[leather gloves]], [[long sword]], [[low boots]], [[plate mail]], [[ring mail]], [[short sword]], [[silver saber]], [[small shield]], [[spear]]<!--non-exhaustive, fill in any that might've been missed-->\n\nThere are no restrictions on items that are neither weapons nor armor.\n\nRacial ascensions obviously vary in difficulty depending on the race. A hard racial elf suffers from little more than a lack of access to dragon mail or powerful artifacts, while a hard racial gnome is playing a nude conduct with a substandard weapon.\n\n*A page of racial ascensions can be found here: [http://groups.google.ca/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/45f835e3a077cec8/a5ec41d2593ec24e?]\n*A racial orc, combined with the illiterate conduct: [http://groups.google.ca/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/a942fef4197d9033/5a956e85015c2aae?]\n\nMany variants give bonuses to certain monsters wearing appropriate racial equipment, and often expand on the amount of racial equipment available.\n\nHumans are generally not used for racial ascensions. --[[User:Snikers|Snikers]]\n\n(Some people play Humans counting the equipment from Keystone Kops and Minetown Guards as racial) -LL\n\n=== Stick user ===\nYou may only use wands to cause damage and otherwise affect the dungeon. No use of weapons is allowed to #force locks or attack. You should rely on powerful pets. The [[wizard]], a role with some of the best damage potential from spells, is one of the best roles for this conduct. -- [[User:Kalon|Kalon]] 01:34, 7 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n===Stubborn===\nGo through the entire game with your starting equipment. This is a difficult task, because you cannot use any rings, amulets, weapons, spellbooks, or items other than the ones with which you started. This is nearly impossible for the Tourist role, which is designed to buy necessary items.\n\nExceptions are allowed for the [[Amulet of Yendor]], the [[Bell of Opening]], and any of the items absolutely necessary to retrieve the [[Amulet of Yendor]] or the [[quest artifact]] that you earn through the [[quest]]. --[[User:Edrobot|Edrobot]]\n\n===Taciturn===\nDon't use #[[chat]]. As a result, you cannot talk to your pet (you'll need a [[stethoscope]] for that), and you cannot buy protection from priests.\n\nA more difficult version would be to avoid any commands that might involve talking, such as #[[pray]], #[[offer]], or [[p]]ay.

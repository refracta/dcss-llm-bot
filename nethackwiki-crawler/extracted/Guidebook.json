{"title":"Guidebook","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Guidebook","type":"markdown","data":"The **NetHack Guidebook**, formally **A Guide to the Mazes of Menace: Guidebook for NetHack**, documents the basic gameplay and [options](/wiki/Options \"Options\") of the *[NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\")* game. This is the most important documentation included in *NetHack* itself. Though NetHack also includes help files to describe the map symbols, keyboard controls and options, the Guidebook introduces those things in more detail.\n\nFor most players, the Guidebook, or rather a certain portion of it, is a very important read. The Guidebook introduces the various [item](/wiki/Item \"Item\") types, like armor and scrolls. The Guidebook is also the place to learn about [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\").\n\nNote that \"[Mazes of Menace](/wiki/Mazes_of_Menace \"Mazes of Menace\")\" refers to the entire [dungeon](/wiki/Dungeon \"Dungeon\"), and is no synonym for \"[Dungeons of Doom](/wiki/Dungeons_of_Doom \"Dungeons of Doom\")\" or \"[Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\")\". \"[Dungeons of Doom](/wiki/Dungeons_of_Doom \"Dungeons of Doom\")\" refers to the [dungeon branch](/wiki/Dungeon_branch \"Dungeon branch\") where you start the game; \"Gehennom\" is the dungeon branch that contains the [Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor \"Amulet of Yendor\").\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Access](#Access)\n\n- [2 History of the Guidebook](#History_of_the_Guidebook)\n\n- [3 Chapters](#Chapters)\n\n  - [3.1 Introduction](#Introduction)\n\n  - [3.2 What is going on here?](#What_is_going_on_here.3F)\n\n  - [3.3 What do all these things on the screen mean?](#What_do_all_these_things_on_the_screen_mean.3F)\n\n  - [3.4 Commands](#Commands)\n\n  - [3.5 Rooms and Corridors](#Rooms_and_Corridors)\n    - [3.5.1 Shops and shopping](#Shops_and_shopping)\n\n  - [3.6 Monsters](#Monsters)\n\n  - [3.7 Objects](#Objects)\n\n    - [3.7.1 Weapons](#Weapons)\n    - [3.7.2 Armor](#Armor)\n\n  - [3.8 Conducts](#Conducts)\n\n  - [3.9 Options](#Options)\n\n  - [3.10 Scoring](#Scoring)\n\n  - [3.11 Explore mode](#Explore_mode)\n\n  - [3.12 Credits](#Credits)\n\n- [4 Variants](#Variants)\n  - [4.1 SLASH'EM](#SLASH.27EM)\n\n- [5 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Access\n\nIf [you](/wiki/You \"You\") have NetHack on your computer, then the installation should include a copy of the Guidebook; you can also visit the official website and view an online copy.\n\nWhen building and installing NetHack from [source code](/wiki/Source_code \"Source code\"), the [makefiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/makefile \"wikipedia:makefile\") typically do not install the Guidebook. Thus, you may find a NetHack installation with no Guidebook. You might also be unaware if your [Unix](/wiki/Unix \"Unix\") clone distro stashed the Guidebook in `/usr/local/share/doc/nethack/Guidebook.txt` or some such place.\n\n## History of the Guidebook\n\n[Eric S. Raymond](/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond \"Eric S. Raymond\") was the original author of the Guidebook. [NetHack 2.2a](/wiki/NetHack_2.2a \"NetHack 2.2a\") seems to be the first version to include the Guidebook; the [DevTeam](/wiki/DevTeam \"DevTeam\") extensively edited and updated the Guidebook for later versions. For previous versions, players had to rely on the in-game [help](/wiki/Help_\\(in-game\\) \"Help (in-game)\"), which existed since the very first versions of *[Hack](/wiki/Hack \"Hack\")* in the form of a 'long' help and a 'short' help; the long help introduces NetHack as a \"[Dungeons and Dragons](/wiki/Dungeons_and_Dragons \"Dungeons and Dragons\") like game\", describes the map symbols and introduces the keyboard controls, while the short help only reviews the controls. Unlike the Guidebook, the in-game help does not describe the game's roles and races, nor does it detail the basic purpose of each type of item.\n\nThe Guidebook does acknowledge a predecessor document, *A Guide to the Dungeons of Doom*, the guide for [Rogue](/wiki/Rogue_\\(game\\) \"Rogue (game)\"). Rogue's guide is the 30th paper of the *UNIX User's Supplementary Documents* on some [BSD](/wiki/BSD \"BSD\") systems.\n\n## Chapters\n\nThe Guidebook consists of twelve chapters. The 3.6.0 Guidebook also contains a preface, dedicating this version of the game to author [Terry Pratchett](/wiki/Terry_Pratchett \"Terry Pratchett\").\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe first chapter, \"Introduction\", sets the mood of the game. Many players only remember the in-game [introduction](/wiki/Introduction \"Introduction\"), which proclaims your destiny \"heralded from birth\" to obtain the Amulet of Yendor for your god. The Guidebook provides a different and lengthier introduction.\n\nDreams of dungeon exploration enter your sleep, and bring your desire to become an adventurer. *\"Eventually you can resist the yearning to seek out the fantastic place in your dreams no longer.\"* Then you hear rumours of the lost Amulet of Yendor, that will bring wealth to the one who finds it. *\"Upon hearing the legends, you immediately realize that there is some profound and undiscovered reason that you are to descend into the caverns and seek out that amulet of which they spoke.\"* You journey for days until you reach the Mazes of Menace, and sleep at the entrance. *\"In the morning, you gather your gear, eat what may be your last meal outside, and enter the dungeon...\"*\n\nThe [Vulture's](/wiki/Vulture%27s \"Vulture's\") interface adapts the Guidebook's introduction into an illustrated in-game sequence, with its own background music. This sequence automatically plays after you select a new character in Vulture's.\n\n### What is going on here?\n\nThe Guidebook uses its second chapter, \"What is going on here?\", to enumerate the [roles](/wiki/Role \"Role\") and [races](/wiki/Race \"Race\") of NetHack. These are the first of the long lists within the Guidebook. The descriptions only set the mood and provide a few hints, but remain so useful to a new NetHack player. Before the Guidebook, the in-game [help](/wiki/Help_\\(in-game\\) \"Help (in-game)\") did not mention roles.\n\n- *Roles*: [Archeologist](/wiki/Archeologist \"Archeologist\"), [Barbarian](/wiki/Barbarian \"Barbarian\"), [Caveman](/wiki/Caveman \"Caveman\") and [Cavewoman](/wiki/Cavewoman \"Cavewoman\"), [Healer](/wiki/Healer \"Healer\"), [Knight](/wiki/Knight \"Knight\"), [Monk](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\"), [Priest](/wiki/Priest \"Priest\") and [Priestess](/wiki/Priestess \"Priestess\"), [Ranger](/wiki/Ranger \"Ranger\"), [Rogue](/wiki/Rogue \"Rogue\"), [Samurai](/wiki/Samurai \"Samurai\"), [Tourist](/wiki/Tourist \"Tourist\"), [Valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\"), [Wizard](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\").\n- *Races*: [Dwarf](/wiki/Dwarf_\\(starting_race\\) \"Dwarf (starting race)\"), [Elf](/wiki/Elf_\\(starting_race\\) \"Elf (starting race)\"), [Gnome](/wiki/Gnome_\\(starting_race\\) \"Gnome (starting race)\"), [Human](/wiki/Human_\\(starting_race\\) \"Human (starting race)\"), [Orc](/wiki/Orc_\\(starting_race\\) \"Orc (starting race)\").\n\n### What do all these things on the screen mean?\n\nThe third chapter explains the screen. First, it contrasts NetHack (and other [roguelike](/wiki/Roguelike \"Roguelike\") games) with [text adventure](/wiki/Text_adventure \"Text adventure\") games. *\"Unlike text adventure games that accept commands in pseudo-English sentences and explain the results in words, NetHack commands are all one or two keystrokes and the results are displayed graphically on the screen.\"* It soon becomes apparent that the Guidebook uses the word \"graphically\" to refer to either [ASCII](/wiki/ASCII \"ASCII\") graphics or [tiles](/wiki/Tiles \"Tiles\").\n\nSection 3.1 describes the [status line](/wiki/Status_line \"Status line\"). Unlike the in-game [help](/wiki/Help_\\(in-game\\) \"Help (in-game)\") that only provides a one-paragraph summary of the status line, the Guidebook introduces each element of the status line.\n\n- *Parts of the status line:* [Rank](/wiki/Rank \"Rank\"), [Strength](/wiki/Strength \"Strength\"), [Dexterity](/wiki/Dexterity \"Dexterity\"), [Constitution](/wiki/Constitution \"Constitution\"), [Intelligence](/wiki/Intelligence \"Intelligence\"), [Wisdom](/wiki/Wisdom \"Wisdom\"), [Charisma](/wiki/Charisma \"Charisma\"), [Alignment](/wiki/Alignment \"Alignment\"), [Dungeon Level](/wiki/Dungeon_level \"Dungeon level\"), [Gold](/wiki/Gold \"Gold\"), [Hit Points](/wiki/Hit_points \"Hit points\"), [Power](/wiki/Power \"Power\"), [Armor Class](/wiki/Armor_Class \"Armor Class\"), [Experience](/wiki/Experience \"Experience\"), [Time](/wiki/Time \"Time\"), and [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger \"Hunger\") status.\n\nSection 3.1 introduces strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma as the \"six basic [attributes](/wiki/Attribute \"Attribute\")\" of your character. (Thus [we](/wiki/We \"We\") often say \"attribute\", not \"ability\" or \"stat\".) It is possible to read this section and not understand the importance of raising these six attributes to high values. The Guidebook does not mention [exercise](/wiki/Exercise \"Exercise\") or any other way to increase these attributes, except to say that \"magic can also cause attributes to exceed the normal limits\".\n\nPlayers of other games may want to read the Guidebook to learn that \"[power](/wiki/Power \"Power\")\" is a synonym for \"spell points\" or \"mana\", and may want to give their attention to the description of [AC](/wiki/AC \"AC\"): *\"The lower this number is, the more effective the armor; it is quite possible to have negative armor class.\"*\n\nSection 3.2 mentions the [message](/wiki/Message \"Message\") line; section 3.3 enumerates the various [ASCII](/wiki/ASCII \"ASCII\") characters that you may find on the map, and gives a sentence description of each.\n\n- *ASCII characters:* [-](/wiki/- \"-\") and [|](/wiki/Pipe \"Pipe\"), [.](/wiki/Dot \"Dot\"), [#](/wiki/Hash_mark \"Hash mark\"), [>](/wiki/Angle_bracket \"Angle bracket\") and [<](/wiki/Angle_bracket \"Angle bracket\"), [+](/wiki/Plus_sign \"Plus sign\"), [@](/wiki/@ \"@\"), [$](/wiki/$ \"$\"), [^](/wiki/%5E \"^\"), [)](/wiki/\\) \")\"), [\\[](/wiki/Square_bracket \"Square bracket\"), [%](/wiki/%25 \"%\"), [?](/wiki/%3F \"?\"), [/](/wiki/Slash \"Slash\"), [=](/wiki/%3D \"=\"), [!](/wiki/! \"!\"), [(](/wiki/\\( \"(\"), [\"](/wiki/%22 \"\\\"\"), [\\*](/wiki/* \"*\"), [\\`](/wiki/%60 \"`\"), [0](/wiki/0 \"0\"), [\\_](/wiki/Underscore \"Underscore\"), [{](/wiki/Left_curly_bracket \"Left curly bracket\"), [}](/wiki/Right_curly_bracket \"Right curly bracket\"), [\\\\](/wiki/%5C \"\\\\\"), [I](/wiki/I \"I\").\n\n### Commands\n\nThe fourth chapter enumerates the commands of the game. This can overwhelm the new player. The chapter provides most commands in alphabetical order, and does not group related commands, except to place [help](/wiki/Help_\\(in-game\\) \"Help (in-game)\") commands and movement commands at the start of the list.\n\nA new player might want to skim or skip the alphabetical part of the list, and go forward to later chapters of Guidebook, which suggest commands for specific situations. For example, section 5.1 which discusses doors, also explains how to use the door commands ([c](/wiki/C \"C\"), [o](/wiki/O \"O\"), [^D](/wiki/%5ED \"^D\") and sometimes [a](/wiki/A \"A\")). Note that organizing commands into groups can mislead; if you think that [q](/wiki/Q \"Q\") is the [potion](/wiki/Potion \"Potion\") command, then you might never try to quaff from a [fountain](/wiki/Fountain \"Fountain\").\n\n- *Commands*: [?](/wiki/%3F \"?\"), [/](/wiki/Slash \"Slash\"), [&](/wiki/%26 \"&\"), [<](/wiki/Angle_bracket \"Angle bracket\"), [>](/wiki/Angle_bracket \"Angle bracket\"), [yuhjklbn](/wiki/Yuhjklbn \"Yuhjklbn\"), [m](/wiki/M \"M\"), [F](/wiki/F \"F\"), [M](/wiki/M \"M\"), [g](/wiki/G \"G\"), [G](/wiki/G \"G\"), [\\_](/wiki/Underscore \"Underscore\"), [.](/wiki/Dot \"Dot\"), [a](/wiki/A \"A\"), [A](/wiki/A \"A\"), [^A](/wiki/%5EA \"^A\"), [c](/wiki/C \"C\"), [C](/wiki/C \"C\"), [^C](/index.php?title=%5EC\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"^C (page does not exist)\"), [d](/wiki/D \"D\"), [D](/wiki/D \"D\"), [^D](/wiki/%5ED \"^D\"), [e](/wiki/E \"E\"), [E](/wiki/E \"E\"), [f](/wiki/F \"F\"), [i](/wiki/I \"I\"), [I](/wiki/I \"I\"), [o](/wiki/O \"O\"), [O](/wiki/O \"O\"), [p](/wiki/P \"P\"), [P](/wiki/P \"P\"), [^P](/wiki/%5EP \"^P\"), [q](/wiki/Q \"Q\"), [Q](/wiki/Q \"Q\"), [r](/wiki/R \"R\"), [R](/wiki/R \"R\"), [^R](/wiki/%5ER \"^R\"), [s](/wiki/S \"S\"), [S](/wiki/S \"S\"), [t](/wiki/T \"T\"), [T](/wiki/T \"T\"), [^T](/wiki/%5ET \"^T\"), [v](/wiki/V \"V\"), [V](/wiki/V \"V\"), [w](/wiki/W \"W\"), [W](/wiki/W \"W\"), [x](/wiki/X \"X\"), [X](/wiki/X \"X\"), [^X](/wiki/%5EX \"^X\"), [z](/wiki/Z \"Z\"), [Z](/wiki/Z \"Z\"), [^Z](/wiki/%5EZ \"^Z\"), [:](/wiki/Colon \"Colon\"), [;](/wiki/; \";\"), [,](/wiki/Pick_up \"Pick up\"), [@](/wiki/Autopickup \"Autopickup\"), [^](/wiki/Trap_id \"Trap id\"), [)](/wiki/\\) \")\"), [\\[](/wiki/Left_square_bracket \"Left square bracket\"), [=](/wiki/%3D \"=\"), [\"](/wiki/%22 \"\\\"\"), [(](/wiki/\\( \"(\"), [\\*](/wiki/* \"*\"), [$](/wiki/$ \"$\"), [+](/wiki/%2B \"+\"), [\\\\](/wiki/%5C \"\\\\\"), [!](/wiki/Shell_escape \"Shell escape\"), [#](/wiki/Hash_mark \"Hash mark\"), #[adjust](/wiki/Adjust \"Adjust\"), #[annotate](/wiki/Annotate \"Annotate\"), #[chat](/wiki/Chat \"Chat\"), #[conduct](/wiki/Conduct \"Conduct\"), #[dip](/wiki/Dip \"Dip\"), #[enhance](/wiki/Enhance \"Enhance\"), #[force](/wiki/Force \"Force\"), #[invoke](/wiki/Invoke \"Invoke\"), #[jump](/wiki/Jump \"Jump\"), #[loot](/wiki/Loot \"Loot\"), #[monster](/wiki/Monster_\\(command\\) \"Monster (command)\"), #[name](/wiki/Name \"Name\"), #[offer](/wiki/Offer \"Offer\"), #[overview](/wiki/Overview \"Overview\"), #[pray](/wiki/Pray \"Pray\"), #[quit](/wiki/Quit \"Quit\"), #[ride](/wiki/Ride \"Ride\"), #[rub](/wiki/Rub \"Rub\"), #[sit](/wiki/Sit \"Sit\"), #[terrain](/wiki/Terrain \"Terrain\"), #[tip](/wiki/Tip \"Tip\"), #[turn](/wiki/Turn \"Turn\"), #[twoweapon](/wiki/Twoweapon \"Twoweapon\"), #[untrap](/wiki/Untrap \"Untrap\"), #[version](/wiki/Version \"Version\"), #[wipe](/wiki/Wipe \"Wipe\"), #[?](/wiki/%3F \"?\"), and in [number\\_pad](/wiki/Number_pad \"Number pad\") mode, [h](/wiki/H \"H\"), [j](/wiki/J \"J\"), [k](/wiki/K \"K\"), [l](/wiki/L \"L\"), [N](/wiki/N \"N\"), [u](/wiki/U \"U\").\n\nThere is something important in the description of the \"E\" command: *\"Engraving the word '[Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\")' will cause most monsters to not attack you hand-to-hand (but if you attack, you will rub it out); this is often useful to give yourself a breather.\"*\n\nUnfortunately, the Guidebook's description for some commands remains less verbose than it should be. For example, the description for #turn says only, \"[Turn undead](/wiki/Turn_undead \"Turn undead\").\" It should explain that #turn would scare undead monsters, so that players do not try to use the command to become an undead creature.\n\nTo avoid [spoilers](/wiki/Spoiler \"Spoiler\"), the Guidebook does not explain how to #jump, what to #invoke or where to #sit.\n\n### Rooms and Corridors\n\nThe fifth chapter, \"Rooms and Corridors\", introduces a few of the basic [dungeon features](/wiki/Dungeon_feature \"Dungeon feature\"). Section 3.3 already gave the characters for each feature, but did not provide detail.\n\n- *Dungeon features:* [room](/wiki/Room \"Room\"), [corridor](/wiki/Corridor \"Corridor\"), [doorway](/wiki/Doorway \"Doorway\") and [door](/wiki/Door \"Door\"), [trap](/wiki/Trap \"Trap\"), [stair](/wiki/Stair \"Stair\"), [ladder](/wiki/Ladder \"Ladder\"), [shop](/wiki/Shop \"Shop\").\n\nThis chapter is not a [spoiler](/wiki/Spoiler \"Spoiler\"). It does not mention other features such as [fountains](/wiki/Fountain \"Fountain\") and [thrones](/wiki/Throne \"Throne\"). The Guidebook only provides in section 3.3 that { is fountain and \\ is throne. It never explains that one may quaff from fountains or sit on thrones.\n\nHowever the chapter does include a few hints. It makes explicit that one may not travel diagonally through an open door (though many players would soon observe so), discloses the existence of both the [Gnomish Mines](/wiki/Gnomish_Mines \"Gnomish Mines\") and [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\"), and provies a hint about stairs. *\"However, pets (see below) and some other monsters will follow along if they're close enough when you travel up or down stairs, and occasionally one of these creatures will displace you during the climb. When that occurs, the pet or other monster will arrive on the staircase and you will end up nearby.\"* So if you do not arrive at a staircase, then the staircase must be nearby.\n\n- (Actually, that is not always true. If you take the up staircase from the level below the [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\"), then you will arrive at the Castle's level, which does not have a down staircase.)\n\n#### Shops and shopping\n\nImportantly, the fifth chapter explains shops. An encounter with a shop in *Hack* or *NetHack* was much less intuitive before the Guidebook added section 5.5 about how to use shops. A clever player might combine two of the hints in \"Shop idiosyncracies\" to create a [shoplifting](/wiki/Shoplifting \"Shoplifting\") strategy.\n\nThe Guidebook never mentions that [pet displacement](/wiki/Pet#Speed \"Pet\") never works in shops; but the Guidebook never mentions pet displacement.\n\n### Monsters\n\nThe sixth chapter opens with another hint, that one may want to #chat with the Oracle of Delphi. It also discusses how to [melee](/wiki/Melee \"Melee\") monsters, and provides sections about [pets](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\"), [steeds](/wiki/Steed \"Steed\"), and [ghosts](/wiki/Ghost \"Ghost\") from [bones levels](/wiki/Bones_level \"Bones level\").\n\nExamples of what one can learn:\n\n- Adjacent pets follow you through staircases and pets.\n- You can train pets by throwing food (but the Guidebook does not explain that the food must be a [treat](/wiki/Treat \"Treat\"), nor does it explain that trained pets bring objects closer to you).\n- When you [ride](/wiki/Ride \"Ride\") a steed, the steed appears on the map.\n- *\"Ghosts are hard to kill, but easy to avoid, since they're slow and do little damage.\"*\n\n### Objects\n\nThe seventh chapter is one of the most useful in the Guidebook, especially for those players who never played other \"[Dungeons and Dragons](/wiki/Dungeons_and_Dragons \"Dungeons and Dragons\") like games\".\n\nExamples of what one can learn:\n\n- Given to the #[name](/wiki/Name \"Name\") command, a single space removes the name from an object.\n- After you read a [scroll](/wiki/Scroll \"Scroll\"), it disappears.\n- The game has a \"[scroll of identify](/wiki/Scroll_of_identify \"Scroll of identify\")\".\n- An identified [wand](/wiki/Wand \"Wand\") shows the number of times recharged, then the number of charges.\n- [Rings](/wiki/Ring \"Ring\") and [amulets](/wiki/Amulet \"Amulet\") provide magic when worn.\n- Several commands interact with [containers](/wiki/Container \"Container\").\n\nPlayers who became stuck to [cursed](/wiki/Cursed \"Cursed\") item might want to read section 7.1, about curses and blessings.\n\n#### Weapons\n\nSection 7.2 on [weapons](/wiki/Weapon \"Weapon\") refers players to the game of AD\\&D (\"Advanced [Dungeons and Dragons](/wiki/Dungeons_and_Dragons \"Dungeons and Dragons\")\"): *\"Those of you in the audience who are AD\\&D players, be aware that each weapon which existed in AD\\&D does roughly the same damage to monsters in NetHack. Some of the more obscure weapons (such as the *aklys*, *lucern hammer*, and *bec-de-corbin*) are defined in an appendix to *Unearthed Arcana*, an AD\\&D supplement.\"* The relevant AD\\&D specifications have now entered *The d20 System Reference Document* (d20 SRD), which is freely available in many places, for example as [*The Hypertext d20 SRD*](https://www.d20srd.org/index.htm). The d20 system is based on edition 3.5 of Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nOnly editions 1 and 2 bore the adjective *Advanced*, and it is presumably one of these editions the Guidebook refers to. Substantial changes have been made to (Advanced) Dungeons and Dragons since then, so any comparison of weapon tables in NetHack and the d20 system is meaningless.\n\nSection 7.2 also contains subsections relating to [throwing](/wiki/Throw \"Throw\") and [shooting](/wiki/Projectile \"Projectile\"), [weapon proficiency](/wiki/Skill \"Skill\"), and [two-weapon combat](/wiki/Twoweapon \"Twoweapon\").\n\n#### Armor\n\nSection 7.3 on [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\") also refers to AD\\&D, but the Guidebook lists AC values of most types of body armor, so that players need not consult the AD\\&D definitions. (Indeed, the modern d20 system now does AC differently from NetHack, so the [AC values in d20](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/armor.htm#tableArmorandShields) do not match the AC values in NetHack. NetHack AC counts down from 10; d20 AC counts *up* from 10. Ignoring other bonuses, the [d20 formula for AC](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#armorClass) is 10 plus the armor bonus. So a scale mail provides AC 6 in NetHack but AC 14 in d20.)\n\nThe authority on weapons and armor in NetHack is not the AD\\&D spec, but the NetHack [source code](/wiki/Source_code \"Source code\") or a [spoiler](/wiki/Spoiler \"Spoiler\") such as this [wiki](/wiki/Wiki \"Wiki\").\n\n- *Armor in order of AC:* [dragon scale mail](/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail \"Dragon scale mail\"), [plate mail](/wiki/Plate_mail \"Plate mail\"), [crystal plate mail](/wiki/Crystal_plate_mail \"Crystal plate mail\"), [bronze plate mail](/wiki/Bronze_plate_mail \"Bronze plate mail\"), [splint mail](/wiki/Splint_mail \"Splint mail\"), [banded mail](/wiki/Banded_mail \"Banded mail\"), [dwarvish mithril-coat](/wiki/Dwarvish_mithril-coat \"Dwarvish mithril-coat\"), [elven mithril-coat](/wiki/Elven_mithril-coat \"Elven mithril-coat\"), [chain mail](/wiki/Chain_mail \"Chain mail\"), [orcish chain mail](/wiki/Orcish_chain_mail \"Orcish chain mail\"), [scale mail](/wiki/Scale_mail \"Scale mail\"), [studded leather armor](/wiki/Studded_leather_armor \"Studded leather armor\"), [ring mail](/wiki/Ring_mail \"Ring mail\"), [orcish ring mail](/wiki/Orcish_ring_mail \"Orcish ring mail\"), [leather armor](/wiki/Leather_armor \"Leather armor\"), [leather jacket](/wiki/Leather_jacket \"Leather jacket\"), and no armor.\n\n### Conducts\n\nThe eighth chapter of the Guidebook documents [conducts](/wiki/Conduct \"Conduct\").\n\nEven for a player who never [ascended](/wiki/Ascension \"Ascension\") and who does not intend to follow any conducts, this chapter contains a few subtle hints. *\"Calling upon your god for help with starvation does not violate any food challenges either.\"* So, gods can help with starvation. You might recall from the chapter 4 that the #[pray](/wiki/Pray \"Pray\") command does *\"Pray to the gods for help.\"* You might correctly conclude that prayer may help with starvation.\n\nThis section also documents which food qualifies as [vegan](/wiki/Vegan \"Vegan\") or [vegetarian](/wiki/Vegetarian \"Vegetarian\"); this might also help unspoiled players who need food for their vegetarian pet (sections 6.2 and 7.4). It also notes that [liquids](/wiki/Potion_of_water \"Potion of water\") [that](/wiki/Potion_of_fruit_juice \"Potion of fruit juice\") [provide nutrition](/wiki/Potion_of_booze \"Potion of booze\") do not count against foodless conduct, citing \"a physiological need for water\" as a justification.\n\n### Options\n\nThe ninth chapter of the Guidebook is a comprehensive description of all of the game options, and how to set them. Section 9.4 enumerates the customization options in alphabetical order, and does not attempt to group the options into categories (such as options for character generation).\n\nThis wiki provides more information about some options, but perhaps the Guidebook is the better source of information for many of them. Most of the below links redirect to a section on our [option](/wiki/Option \"Option\") page, but some (like [Autopickup](/wiki/Autopickup \"Autopickup\")) have their own page.\n\n- *Options:*

In nearly all cases, players will try to survive (by [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\"), by the mercy of [Random Number God](/wiki/Random_Number_God \"Random Number God\"), or by some other [strategy](/wiki/Strategy \"Strategy\")) instead of quitting.\n\n### Explore mode\n\nThe eleventh chapter of the Guidebook documents [explore mode](/wiki/Explore_mode \"Explore mode\"). Also mentioned is debug mode, known as [wizard mode](/wiki/Wizard_mode \"Wizard mode\"), but it is stressed that this is for debugging rather than to give the player god-like powers within the game.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe twelfth and final chapter of the Guidebook contains one paragraph of credits for the Guidebook itself, followed by the [game history](/wiki/Game_history \"Game history\") text (which is the same as the text from the in-game help). The game history is a long list of contributors to *NetHack*, including the original *[Hack](/wiki/Hack \"Hack\")* developers and the persons who did various [ports](/wiki/Port \"Port\").\n\n## Variants\n\n### SLASH'EM\n\n*[SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\")* players may access the Guidebook during the game, by pressing \\[?] and selecting \"The SLASH'EM Guidebook.\" This displays the Guidebook in the [pager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_pager \"wikipedia:Terminal pager\") of your [user interface](/wiki/User_interface \"User interface\"). You may find that this is too inconvenient, especially if you are using the [tty](/wiki/Tty \"Tty\") interface and cannot scroll upward. You may prefer to use an external page to load the Guidebook.txt file in the [playground](/wiki/Playground \"Playground\") directory.\n\nSLASH'EM modifies the Guidebook to introduce the new role and race selections and explain the new configurable options and multiple [tilesets](/wiki/Tileset \"Tileset\").\n\n## External links\n\n- [The Guidebook for NetHack 3.6.7.](https://www.nethack.org/v367/Guidebook.html)\n- [The Guidebook and other documentation for previous versions.](https://www.nethack.org/common/info.html#Old)\n\n[![This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.7.

Raymond\">Eric S. Raymond</a> was the original author of the Guidebook. <a href=\"/wiki/NetHack_2.2a\" title=\"NetHack 2.2a\">NetHack 2.2a</a> seems to be the first version to include the Guidebook; the <a href=\"/wiki/DevTeam\" title=\"DevTeam\">DevTeam</a> extensively edited and updated the Guidebook for later versions. For previous versions, players had to rely on the in-game <a href=\"/wiki/Help_(in-game)\" title=\"Help (in-game)\">help</a>, which existed since the very first versions of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hack\" title=\"Hack\">Hack</a></i> in the form of a 'long' help and a 'short' help; the long help introduces NetHack as a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Dungeons_and_Dragons\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dungeons and Dragons\">Dungeons and Dragons</a> like game\", describes the map symbols and introduces the keyboard controls, while the short help only reviews the controls. Unlike the Guidebook, the in-game help does not describe the game's roles and races, nor does it detail the basic purpose of each type of item.\n</p><p>The Guidebook does acknowledge a predecessor document, <i>A Guide to the Dungeons of Doom</i>, the guide for <a href=\"/wiki/Rogue_(game)\" title=\"Rogue (game)\">Rogue</a>. Rogue's guide is the 30th paper of the <i>UNIX User's Supplementary Documents</i> on some <a href=\"/wiki/BSD\" title=\"BSD\">BSD</a> systems.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapters\">Chapters</span></h2>\n<p>The Guidebook consists of twelve chapters. The 3.6.0 Guidebook also contains a preface, dedicating this version of the game to author <a href=\"/wiki/Terry_Pratchett\" title=\"Terry Pratchett\">Terry Pratchett</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</span></h3>\n<p>The first chapter, \"Introduction\", sets the mood of the game. Many players only remember the in-game <a href=\"/wiki/Introduction\" title=\"Introduction\">introduction</a>, which proclaims your destiny \"heralded from birth\" to obtain the Amulet of Yendor for your god. The Guidebook provides a different and lengthier introduction.\n</p><p>Dreams of dungeon exploration enter your sleep, and bring your desire to become an adventurer. <i>\"Eventually you can resist the yearning to seek out the fantastic place in your dreams no longer.\"</i> Then you hear rumours of the lost Amulet of Yendor, that will bring wealth to the one who finds it. <i>\"Upon hearing the legends, you immediately realize that there is some profound and undiscovered reason that you are to descend into the caverns and seek out that amulet of which they spoke.\"</i> You journey for days until you reach the Mazes of Menace, and sleep at the entrance. <i>\"In the morning, you gather your gear, eat what may be your last meal outside, and enter the dungeon...\"</i>\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Vulture%27s\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vulture&#39;s\">Vulture's</a> interface adapts the Guidebook's introduction into an illustrated in-game sequence, with its own background music. This sequence automatically plays after you select a new character in Vulture's.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"What_is_going_on_here?\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What_is_going_on_here.3F\">What is going on here?</span></h3>\n<p>The Guidebook uses its second chapter, \"What is going on here?\", to enumerate the <a href=\"/wiki/Role\" title=\"Role\">roles</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Race\" title=\"Race\">races</a> of NetHack. These are the first of the long lists within the Guidebook. The descriptions only set the mood and provide a few hints, but remain so useful to a new NetHack player.

First, it contrasts NetHack (and other <a href=\"/wiki/Roguelike\" title=\"Roguelike\">roguelike</a> games) with <a href=\"/wiki/Text_adventure\" title=\"Text adventure\">text adventure</a> games. <i>\"Unlike text adventure games that accept commands in pseudo-English sentences and explain the results in words, NetHack commands are all one or two keystrokes and the results are displayed graphically on the screen.\"</i> It soon becomes apparent that the Guidebook uses the word \"graphically\" to refer to either <a href=\"/wiki/ASCII\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ASCII\">ASCII</a> graphics or <a href=\"/wiki/Tiles\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tiles\">tiles</a>.\n</p><p>Section 3.1 describes the <a href=\"/wiki/Status_line\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Status line\">status line</a>. Unlike the in-game <a href=\"/wiki/Help_(in-game)\" title=\"Help (in-game)\">help</a> that only provides a one-paragraph summary of the status line, the Guidebook introduces each element of the status line.\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>Parts of the status line:</i> <a href=\"/wiki/Rank\" title=\"Rank\">Rank</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Strength\" title=\"Strength\">Strength</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Dexterity\" title=\"Dexterity\">Dexterity</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Constitution\" title=\"Constitution\">Constitution</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Intelligence\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intelligence\">Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Wisdom\" title=\"Wisdom\">Wisdom</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Charisma\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Charisma\">Charisma</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Alignment\" title=\"Alignment\">Alignment</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Dungeon_level\" title=\"Dungeon level\">Dungeon Level</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Gold\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gold\">Gold</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Hit_points\" title=\"Hit points\">Hit Points</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Power\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Power\">Power</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Armor_Class\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Armor Class\">Armor Class</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Experience\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Experience\">Experience</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Time\" title=\"Time\">Time</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Hunger\" title=\"Hunger\">Hunger</a> status.</li></ul>\n<p>Section 3.1 introduces strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma as the \"six basic <a href=\"/wiki/Attribute\" title=\"Attribute\">attributes</a>\" of your character. (Thus <a href=\"/wiki/We\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"We\">we</a> often say \"attribute\", not \"ability\" or \"stat\".) It is possible to read this section and not understand the importance of raising these six attributes to high values. The Guidebook does not mention <a href=\"/wiki/Exercise\" title=\"Exercise\">exercise</a> or any other way to increase these attributes, except to say that \"magic can also cause attributes to exceed the normal limits\".\n</p><p>Players of other games may want to read the Guidebook to learn that \"<a href=\"/wiki/Power\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Power\">power</a>\" is a synonym for \"spell points\" or \"mana\", and may want to give their attention to the description of <a href=\"/wiki/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a>: <i>\"The lower this number is, the more effective the armor; it is quite possible to have negative armor class.\"</i>\n</p><p>Section 3.2 mentions the <a href=\"/wiki/Message\" title=\"Message\">message</a> line; section 3.3 enumerates the various <a href=\"/wiki/ASCII\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ASCII\">ASCII</a> characters that you may find on the map, and gives a sentence description of each.\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>ASCII characters:</i> <a href=\"/wiki/-\" title=\"-\">-</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Pipe\" title=\"Pipe\">|</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Dot\" title=\"Dot\">.</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Hash_mark\" title=\"Hash mark\">#</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Angle_bracket\" title=\"Angle bracket\">&gt;</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Angle_bracket\" title=\"Angle bracket\">&lt;</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Plus_sign\" title=\"Plus sign\">+</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/@\" title=\"@\">@</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/$\" title=\"$\">$</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/%5E\" title=\"^\">^</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/)\" title=\")\">)</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Square_bracket\" title=\"Square bracket\">[</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/%25\" title=\"%\">%</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/%3F\" title=\"?\">?</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Slash\" title=\"Slash\">/</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/%3D\" title=\"=\">=</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/!\" title=\"!\">!</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/(\" title=\"(\">(</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/%22\" title=\"&quot;\">\"</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/*\" title=\"*\">*</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/%60\" title=\"`\">`</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/0\" title=\"0\">0</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Underscore\" title=\"Underscore\">_</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Left_curly_bracket\" title=\"Left curly bracket\">{</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Right_curly_bracket\" title=\"Right curly bracket\">}</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/%5C\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\\\">\\</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/I\" title=\"I\">I</a>.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Commands\">Commands</span></h3>\n<p>The fourth chapter enumerates the commands of the game. This can overwhelm the new player. The chapter provides most commands in alphabetical order, and does not group related commands, except to place <a href=\"/wiki/Help_(in-game)\" title=\"Help (in-game)\">help</a> commands and movement commands at the start of the list.\n</p><p>A new player might want to skim or skip the alphabetical part of the list, and go forward to later chapters of Guidebook, which suggest commands for specific situations. For example, section 5.1 which discusses doors, also explains how to use the door commands (<a href=\"/wiki/C\" title=\"C\">c</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/O\" title=\"O\">o</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/%5ED\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"^D\">^D</a> and sometimes <a href=\"/wiki/A\" title=\"A\">a</a>). Note that organizing commands into groups can mislead; if you think that <a href=\"/wiki/Q\" title=\"Q\">q</a> is the <a href=\"/wiki/Potion\" title=\"Potion\">potion</a> command, then you might never try to quaff from a <a href=\"/wiki/Fountain\" title=\"Fountain\">fountain</a>.\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>Commands</i>: <a href=\"/wiki/%3F\" title=\"?\">?</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Slash\" title=\"Slash\">/</a>,

most monsters to not attack you hand-to-hand (but if you attack, you will rub it out); this is often useful to give yourself a breather.\"</i>\n</p><p>Unfortunately, the Guidebook's description for some commands remains less verbose than it should be. For example, the description for #turn says only, \"<a href=\"/wiki/Turn_undead\" title=\"Turn undead\">Turn undead</a>.\" It should explain that #turn would scare undead monsters, so that players do not try to use the command to become an undead creature.\n</p><p>To avoid <a href=\"/wiki/Spoiler\" title=\"Spoiler\">spoilers</a>, the Guidebook does not explain how to #jump, what to #invoke or where to #sit.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rooms_and_Corridors\">Rooms and Corridors</span></h3>\n<p>The fifth chapter, \"Rooms and Corridors\", introduces a few of the basic <a href=\"/wiki/Dungeon_feature\" title=\"Dungeon feature\">dungeon features</a>. Section 3.3 already gave the characters for each feature, but did not provide detail.\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>Dungeon features:</i> <a href=\"/wiki/Room\" title=\"Room\">room</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Corridor\" title=\"Corridor\">corridor</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Doorway\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Doorway\">doorway</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Door\" title=\"Door\">door</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Trap\" title=\"Trap\">trap</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Stair\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stair\">stair</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Ladder\" title=\"Ladder\">ladder</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Shop\" title=\"Shop\">shop</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>This chapter is not a <a href=\"/wiki/Spoiler\" title=\"Spoiler\">spoiler</a>. It does not mention other features such as <a href=\"/wiki/Fountain\" title=\"Fountain\">fountains</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Throne\" title=\"Throne\">thrones</a>. The Guidebook only provides in section 3.3 that { is fountain and \\ is throne. It never explains that one may quaff from fountains or sit on thrones.\n</p><p>However the chapter does include a few hints. It makes explicit that one may not travel diagonally through an open door (though many players would soon observe so), discloses the existence of both the <a href=\"/wiki/Gnomish_Mines\" title=\"Gnomish Mines\">Gnomish Mines</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Sokoban\" title=\"Sokoban\">Sokoban</a>, and provies a hint about stairs. <i>\"However, pets (see below) and some other monsters will follow along if they're close enough when you travel up or down stairs, and occasionally one of these creatures will displace you during the climb. When that occurs, the pet or other monster will arrive on the staircase and you will end up nearby.\"</i> So if you do not arrive at a staircase, then the staircase must be nearby.\n</p>\n<dl><dd>(Actually, that is not always true. If you take the up staircase from the level below the <a href=\"/wiki/Castle\" title=\"Castle\">Castle</a>, then you will arrive at the Castle's level, which does not have a down staircase.)</dd></dl>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Shops_and_shopping\">Shops and shopping</span></h4>\n<p>Importantly, the fifth chapter explains shops. An encounter with a shop in <i>Hack</i> or <i>NetHack</i> was much less intuitive before the Guidebook added section 5.5 about how to use shops. A clever player might combine two of the hints in \"Shop idiosyncracies\" to create a <a href=\"/wiki/Shoplifting\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shoplifting\">shoplifting</a> strategy.\n</p><p>The Guidebook never mentions that <a href=\"/wiki/Pet#Speed\" title=\"Pet\">pet displacement</a> never works in shops; but the Guidebook never mentions pet displacement.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Monsters\">Monsters</span></h3>\n<p>The sixth chapter opens with another hint, that one may want to #chat with the Oracle of Delphi. It also discusses how to <a href=\"/wiki/Melee\" title=\"Melee\">melee</a> monsters, and provides sections about <a href=\"/wiki/Pet\" title=\"Pet\">pets</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Steed\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Steed\">steeds</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Ghost\" title=\"Ghost\">ghosts</a> from <a href=\"/wiki/Bones_level\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bones level\">bones levels</a>.\n</p><p>Examples of what one can learn:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Adjacent pets follow you through staircases and pets.</li>\n<li>You can train pets by throwing food (but the Guidebook does not explain that the food must be a <a href=\"/wiki/Treat\" title=\"Treat\">treat</a>, nor does it explain that trained pets bring objects closer to you).</li>\n<li>When you <a href=\"/wiki/Ride\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ride\">ride</a> a steed, the steed appears on the map.</li>\n<li><i>\"Ghosts are hard to kill, but easy to avoid, since they're slow and do little damage.\"</i></li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objects\">Objects</span></h3>\n<p>The seventh chapter is one of the most useful in the Guidebook, especially for those players who never played other \"<a href=\"/wiki/Dungeons_and_Dragons\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dungeons and Dragons\">Dungeons and Dragons</a> like games\".\n</p><p>Examples of what one can learn:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Given to the #<a href=\"/wiki/Name\" title=\"Name\">name</a> command, a single space removes the name from an object.</li>\n<li>After you read a <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll\" title=\"Scroll\">scroll</a>, it disappears.</li>\n<li>The game has a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_identify\" title=\"Scroll of identify\">scroll of identify</a>\".</li>\n<li>An identified <a href=\"/wiki/Wand\" title=\"Wand\">wand</a> shows the number of times recharged, then the number of charges.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Ring\" title=\"Ring\">Rings</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet\" title=\"Amulet\">amulets</a> provide magic when worn.</li>\n<li>Several commands interact with <a href=\"/wiki/Container\" title=\"Container\">containers</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>Players who became stuck to <a href=\"/wiki/Cursed\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cursed\">cursed</a> item might want to read section 7.1, about curses and blessings.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapons\">Weapons</span></h4>\n<p>Section 7.2 on <a href=\"/wiki/Weapon\" title=\"Weapon\">weapons</a> refers players to the game of AD&amp;D (\"Advanced <a href=\"/wiki/Dungeons_and_Dragons\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dungeons and Dragons\">Dungeons and Dragons</a>\"): <i>\"Those of you in the audience who are AD&amp;D players, be aware that each weapon which existed in AD&amp;D does roughly the same damage to monsters in NetHack. Some of the more obscure weapons (such as the </i>aklys<i>, </i>lucern hammer<i>, and </i>bec-de-corbin<i>) are defined in an appendix to </i>Unearthed Arcana<i>, an AD&amp;D supplement.\"</i> The relevant AD&amp;D specifications have now entered <i>The d20 System Reference Document</i> (d20 SRD), which is freely available in many places, for example as <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.d20srd.org/index.htm\"><i>The Hypertext d20 SRD</i></a>. The d20 system is based on edition 3.5 of Dungeons and Dragons.\n</p><p>Only editions 1 and 2 bore the adjective <i>Advanced</i>, and it is presumably one of these editions the Guidebook refers to. Substantial changes have been made to (Advanced) Dungeons and Dragons since then, so any comparison of weapon tables in NetHack and the d20 system is meaningless.\n</p><p>Section 7.2 also contains subsections relating to <a href=\"/wiki/Throw\" title=\"Throw\">throwing</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Projectile\" title=\"Projectile\">shooting</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Skill\" title=\"Skill\">weapon proficiency</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Twoweapon\" title=\"Twoweapon\">two-weapon combat</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Armor\">Armor</span></h4>\n<p>Section 7.3 on <a href=\"/wiki/Armor\" title=\"Armor\">armor</a> also refers to AD&amp;D, but the Guidebook lists AC values of most types of body armor, so that players need not consult the AD&amp;D definitions. (Indeed, the modern d20 system now does AC differently from NetHack, so the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/armor.htm#tableArmorandShields\">AC values in d20</a> do not match the AC values in NetHack. NetHack AC counts down from 10; d20 AC counts <i>up</i> from 10. Ignoring other bonuses, the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#armorClass\">d20 formula for AC</a> is 10 plus the armor bonus. So a scale mail provides AC 6 in NetHack but AC 14 in d20.)\n</p><p>The authority on weapons and armor in NetHack is not the AD&amp;D spec, but the NetHack <a href=\"/wiki/Source_code\" title=\"Source code\">source code</a> or a <a href=\"/wiki/Spoiler\" title=\"Spoiler\">spoiler</a> such as this <a href=\"/wiki/Wiki\" title=\"Wiki\">wiki</a>.\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>Armor in order of AC:</i> <a href=\"/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail\" title=\"Dragon scale mail\">dragon scale mail</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Plate_mail\" title=\"Plate mail\">plate mail</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Crystal_plate_mail\" title=\"Crystal plate mail\">crystal plate mail</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Bronze_plate_mail\" title=\"Bronze plate mail\">bronze plate mail</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Splint_mail\" title=\"Splint mail\">splint mail</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Banded_mail\" title=\"Banded mail\">banded mail</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Dwarvish_mithril-coat\" title=\"Dwarvish mithril-coat\">dwarvish mithril-coat</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Elven_mithril-coat\" title=\"Elven mithril-coat\">elven mithril-coat</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Chain_mail\" title=\"Chain mail\">chain mail</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Orcish_chain_mail\" title=\"Orcish chain mail\">orcish chain mail</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Scale_mail\" title=\"Scale mail\">scale mail</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Studded_leather_armor\" title=\"Studded leather armor\">studded leather armor</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Ring_mail\" title=\"Ring mail\">ring mail</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Orcish_ring_mail\" title=\"Orcish ring mail\">orcish ring mail</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Leather_armor\" title=\"Leather armor\">leather armor</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Leather_jacket\" title=\"Leather jacket\">leather jacket</a>, and no armor.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Conducts\">Conducts</span></h3>\n<p>The eighth chapter of the Guidebook documents <a href=\"/wiki/Conduct\" title=\"Conduct\">conducts</a>.\n</p><p>Even for a player who never <a href=\"/wiki/Ascension\" title=\"Ascension\">ascended</a> and who does not intend to follow any conducts, this chapter contains a few subtle hints. <i>\"Calling upon your god for help with starvation does not violate any food challenges either.\"</i> So, gods can help with starvation. You might recall from the chapter 4 that the #<a href=\"/wiki/Pray\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pray\">pray</a> command does <i>\"Pray to the gods for help.\"</i> You might correctly conclude that prayer may help with starvation.\n</p><p>This section also documents which food qualifies as <a href=\"/wiki/Vegan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vegan\">vegan</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Vegetarian\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vegetarian\">vegetarian</a>; this might also help unspoiled players who need food for their vegetarian pet (sections 6.2 and 7.4). It also notes that <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_water\" title=\"Potion of water\">liquids</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_fruit_juice\" title=\"Potion of fruit juice\">that</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_booze\" title=\"Potion of booze\">provide nutrition</a> do not count against foodless conduct, citing \"a physiological need for water\" as a justification.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Options\">Options</span></h3>\n<p>The ninth chapter of the Guidebook is a comprehensive description of all of the game options, and how to set them.

In nearly all cases, players will try to survive (by <a href=\"/wiki/Elbereth\" title=\"Elbereth\">Elbereth</a>, by the mercy of <a href=\"/wiki/Random_Number_God\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Random Number God\">Random Number God</a>, or by some other <a href=\"/wiki/Strategy\" title=\"Strategy\">strategy</a>) instead of quitting.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Explore_mode\">Explore mode</span></h3>\n<p>The eleventh chapter of the Guidebook documents <a href=\"/wiki/Explore_mode\" title=\"Explore mode\">explore mode</a>. Also mentioned is debug mode, known as <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard_mode\" title=\"Wizard mode\">wizard mode</a>, but it is stressed that this is for debugging rather than to give the player god-like powers within the game.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Credits\">Credits</span></h3>\n<p>The twelfth and final chapter of the Guidebook contains one paragraph of credits for the Guidebook itself, followed by the <a href=\"/wiki/Game_history\" title=\"Game history\">game history</a> text (which is the same as the text from the in-game help). The game history is a long list of contributors to <i>NetHack</i>, including the original <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hack\" title=\"Hack\">Hack</a></i> developers and the persons who did various <a href=\"/wiki/Port\" title=\"Port\">ports</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Variants\">Variants</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"SLASH'EM\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"SLASH.27EM\">SLASH'EM</span></h3>\n<p><i><a href=\"/wiki/SLASH%27EM\" title=\"SLASH&#39;EM\">SLASH'EM</a></i> players may access the Guidebook during the game, by pressing [?] and selecting \"The SLASH'EM Guidebook.\" This displays the Guidebook in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_pager\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Terminal pager\">pager</a> of your <a href=\"/wiki/User_interface\" title=\"User interface\">user interface</a>.

'''NetHack Guidebook''', formally '''A Guide to the Mazes of Menace: Guidebook for NetHack''', documents the basic gameplay and [[options]] of the ''[[NetHack]]'' game. This is the most important documentation included in ''NetHack'' itself. Though NetHack also includes help files to describe the map symbols, keyboard controls and options, the Guidebook introduces those things in more detail.\n\nFor most players, the Guidebook, or rather a certain portion of it, is a very important read. The Guidebook introduces the various [[item]] types, like armor and scrolls. The Guidebook is also the place to learn about [[Elbereth]].\n\nNote that \"[[Mazes of Menace]]\" refers to the entire [[dungeon]], and is no synonym for \"[[Dungeons of Doom]]\" or \"[[Gehennom]]\". \"[[Dungeons of Doom]]\" refers to the [[dungeon branch]] where you start the game; \"Gehennom\" is the dungeon branch that contains the [[Amulet of Yendor]].\n\n== Access ==\nIf [[you]] have NetHack on your computer, then the installation should include a copy of the Guidebook; you can also visit the official website and view an online copy.\n\nWhen building and installing NetHack from [[source code]], the [[wikipedia:makefile|makefile]]s typically do not install the Guidebook. Thus, you may find a NetHack installation with no Guidebook. You might also be unaware if your [[Unix]] clone distro stashed the Guidebook in <tt>/usr/local/share/doc/nethack/Guidebook.txt</tt> or some such place.\n\n== History of the Guidebook ==\n[[Eric S. Raymond]] was the original author of the Guidebook. [[NetHack 2.2a]] seems to be the first version to include the Guidebook; the [[DevTeam]] extensively edited and updated the Guidebook for later versions. For previous versions, players had to rely on the in-game [[help (in-game)|help]], which existed since the very first versions of ''[[Hack]]'' in the form of a 'long' help and a 'short' help; the long help introduces NetHack as a \"[[Dungeons and Dragons]] like game\", describes the map symbols and introduces the keyboard controls, while the short help only reviews the controls. Unlike the Guidebook, the in-game help does not describe the game's roles and races, nor does it detail the basic purpose of each type of item.\n\nThe Guidebook does acknowledge a predecessor document, ''A Guide to the Dungeons of Doom'', the guide for [[Rogue (game)|Rogue]]. Rogue's guide is the 30th paper of the ''UNIX User's Supplementary Documents'' on some [[BSD]] systems.\n\n== Chapters ==\nThe Guidebook consists of twelve chapters. The 3.6.0 Guidebook also contains a preface, dedicating this version of the game to author [[Terry Pratchett]].\n\n=== Introduction ===\nThe first chapter, \"Introduction\", sets the mood of the game. Many players only remember the in-game [[introduction]], which proclaims your destiny \"heralded from birth\" to obtain the Amulet of Yendor for your god. The Guidebook provides a different and lengthier introduction.\n\nDreams of dungeon exploration enter your sleep, and bring your desire to become an adventurer. ''\"Eventually you can resist the yearning to seek out the fantastic place in your dreams no longer.\"'' Then you hear rumours of the lost Amulet of Yendor, that will bring wealth to the one who finds it. ''\"Upon hearing the legends, you immediately realize that there is some profound and undiscovered reason that you are to descend into the caverns and seek out that amulet of which they spoke.\"'' You journey for days until you reach the Mazes of Menace, and sleep at the entrance. ''\"In the morning, you gather your gear, eat what may be your last meal outside, and enter the dungeon...\"''\n\nThe [[Vulture's]] interface adapts the Guidebook's introduction into an illustrated in-game sequence, with its own background music. This sequence automatically plays after you select a new character in Vulture's.\n\n=== What is going on here? ===\nThe Guidebook uses its second chapter, \"What is going on here?\", to enumerate the [[role]]s and [[race]]s of NetHack. These are the first of the long lists within the Guidebook. The descriptions only set the mood and provide a few hints, but remain so useful to a new NetHack player. Before the Guidebook, the in-game [[help (in-game)|help]] did not mention roles.\n\n* ''Roles'': [[Archeologist]], [[Barbarian]], [[Caveman]] and [[Cavewoman]], [[Healer]], [[Knight]], [[Monk]], [[Priest]] and [[Priestess]], [[Ranger]], [[Rogue]], [[Samurai]], [[Tourist]], [[Valkyrie]], [[Wizard]].\n* ''Races'': [[Dwarf (starting race)|Dwarf]], [[Elf (starting race)|Elf]], [[Gnome (starting race)|Gnome]], [[Human (starting race)|Human]], [[Orc (starting race)|Orc]].\n\n=== What do all these things on the screen mean? ===\nThe third chapter explains the screen. First, it contrasts NetHack (and other [[roguelike]] games) with [[text adventure]] games. ''\"Unlike text adventure games that accept commands in pseudo-English sentences and explain the results in words, NetHack commands are all one or two keystrokes and the results are displayed graphically on the screen.\"'' It soon becomes apparent that the Guidebook uses the word \"graphically\" to refer to either [[ASCII]] graphics or [[tiles]].\n\nSection 3.1 describes the [[status line]]. Unlike the in-game [[help (in-game)|help]] that only provides a one-paragraph summary of the status line, the Guidebook introduces each element of the status line.\n\n* ''Parts of the status line:'' [[Rank]], [[Strength]], [[Dexterity]], [[Constitution]], [[Intelligence]], [[Wisdom]], [[Charisma]], [[Alignment]], [[Dungeon level|Dungeon Level]], [[Gold]], [[Hit points|Hit Points]], [[Power]], [[Armor Class]], [[Experience]], [[Time]], and [[Hunger]] status.\n\nSection 3.1 introduces strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma as the \"six basic [[attribute]]s\" of your character. (Thus [[we]] often say \"attribute\", not \"ability\" or \"stat\".) It is possible to read this section and not understand the importance of raising these six attributes to high values. The Guidebook does not mention [[exercise]] or any other way to increase these attributes, except to say that \"magic can also cause attributes to exceed the normal limits\".\n\nPlayers of other games may want to read the Guidebook to learn that \"[[power]]\" is a synonym for \"spell points\" or \"mana\", and may want to give their attention to the description of [[AC]]: ''\"The lower this number is, the more effective the armor; it is quite possible to have negative armor class.\"''\n\nSection 3.2 mentions the [[message]] line; section 3.3 enumerates the various [[ASCII]] characters that you may find on the map, and gives a sentence description of each.\n\n* ''ASCII characters:'' [[-]] and [[pipe||]], [[dot|.]], [[hash mark|#]], [[angle bracket|>]] and [[angle bracket|<]], [[plus sign|+]], [[@]], [[$]], [[^]], [[)]], [[square bracket|[]], [[%]], [[?]], [[slash|/]], [[=]], [[!]], [[(]], [[\"]], [[*]], [[`]], [[0]], [[underscore|_]], [[left curly bracket|{]], [[right curly bracket|}]], [[\\]], [[I]].\n\n=== Commands ===\nThe fourth chapter enumerates the commands of the game. This can overwhelm the new player. The chapter provides most commands in alphabetical order, and does not group related commands, except to place [[help (in-game)|help]] commands and movement commands at the start of the list.\n\nA new player might want to skim or skip the alphabetical part of the list, and go forward to later chapters of Guidebook, which suggest commands for specific situations. For example, section 5.1 which discusses doors, also explains how to use the door commands ([[c]], [[o]], [[^D]] and sometimes [[a]]). Note that organizing commands into groups can mislead; if you think that [[q]] is the [[potion]] command, then you might never try to quaff from a [[fountain]].\n\n* ''Commands'': [[?]], [[slash|/]], [[&]], [[angle bracket|<]], [[angle bracket|>]], [[yuhjklbn]], [[m]], [[F]], [[M]], [[g]], [[G]], [[underscore|_]], [[dot|.]], [[a]], [[A]], [[^A]], [[c]], [[C]], [[^C]], [[d]], [[D]], [[^D]], [[e]], [[E]], [[f]], [[i]], [[I]], [[o]], [[O]], [[p]], [[P]], [[^P]], [[q]], [[Q]], [[r]], [[R]], [[^R]], [[s]], [[S]], [[t]], [[T]], [[^T]], [[v]], [[V]], [[w]], [[W]], [[x]], [[X]], [[^X]], [[z]], [[Z]], [[^Z]], [[colon|:]], [[;]], [[pick up|,]], [[autopickup|@]], [[trap id|^]], [[)]], [[left square bracket|[]], [[=]], [[\"]], [[(]], [[*]], [[$]], [[+]], [[\\]], [[shell escape|!]], [[hash mark|#]], #[[adjust]], #[[annotate]], #[[chat]], #[[conduct]], #[[dip]], #[[enhance]], #[[force]], #[[invoke]], #[[jump]], #[[loot]], #[[monster (command)|monster]], #[[name]], #[[offer]], #[[overview]], #[[pray]], #[[quit]], #[[ride]], #[[rub]], #[[sit]], #[[terrain]], #[[tip]], #[[turn]], #[[twoweapon]], #[[untrap]], #[[version]], #[[wipe]], #[[?]], and in [[number_pad]] mode, [[h]], [[j]], [[k]], [[l]], [[N]], [[u]].\n\nThere is something important in the description of the \"E\" command: ''\"Engraving the word '[[Elbereth]]' will cause most monsters to not attack you hand-to-hand (but if you attack, you will rub it out); this is often useful to give yourself a breather.\"''\n\nUnfortunately, the Guidebook's description for some commands remains less verbose than it should be. For example, the description for #turn says only, \"[[Turn undead]].\" It should explain that #turn would scare undead monsters, so that players do not try to use the command to become an undead creature.\n\nTo avoid [[spoiler]]s, the Guidebook does not explain how to #jump, what to #invoke or where to #sit.\n\n=== Rooms and Corridors ===\nThe fifth chapter, \"Rooms and Corridors\", introduces a few of the basic [[dungeon feature]]s. Section 3.3 already gave the characters for each feature, but did not provide detail.\n\n* ''Dungeon features:'' [[room]], [[corridor]], [[doorway]] and [[door]], [[trap]], [[stair]], [[ladder]], [[shop]].\n\nThis chapter is not a [[spoiler]]. It does not mention other features such as [[fountain]]s and [[throne]]s. The Guidebook only provides in section 3.3 that { is fountain and \\ is throne. It never explains that one may quaff from fountains or sit on thrones.\n\nHowever the chapter does include a few hints. It makes explicit that one may not travel diagonally through an open door (though many players would soon observe so), discloses the existence of both the [[Gnomish Mines]] and [[Sokoban]], and provies a hint about stairs. ''\"However, pets (see below) and some other monsters will follow along if they're close enough when you travel up or down stairs, and occasionally one of these creatures will displace you during the climb. When that occurs, the pet or other monster will arrive on the staircase and you will end up nearby.\"'' So if you do not arrive at a staircase, then the staircase must be nearby.\n\n: (Actually, that is not always true. If you take the up staircase from the level below the [[Castle]], then you will arrive at the Castle's level, which does not have a down staircase.)\n\n==== Shops and shopping ====\nImportantly, the fifth chapter explains shops. An encounter with a shop in ''Hack'' or ''NetHack'' was much less intuitive before the Guidebook added section 5.5 about how to use shops. A clever player might combine two of the hints in \"Shop idiosyncracies\" to create a [[shoplifting]] strategy.\n\nThe Guidebook never mentions that [[Pet#Speed|pet displacement]] never works in shops; but the Guidebook never mentions pet displacement.\n\n=== Monsters ===\nThe sixth chapter opens with another hint, that one may want to #chat with the Oracle of Delphi. It also discusses how to [[melee]] monsters, and provides sections about [[pet]]s, [[steed]]s, and [[ghost]]s from [[bones level]]s.\n\nExamples of what one can learn:\n* Adjacent pets follow you through staircases and pets.\n* You can train pets by throwing food (but the Guidebook does not explain that the food must be a [[treat]], nor does it explain that trained pets bring objects closer to you).\n* When you [[ride]] a steed, the steed appears on the map.\n* ''\"Ghosts are hard to kill, but easy to avoid, since they're slow and do little damage.\"''\n\n=== Objects ===\nThe seventh chapter is one of the most useful in the Guidebook, especially for those players who never played other \"[[Dungeons and Dragons]] like games\".\n\nExamples of what one can learn:\n* Given to the #[[name]] command, a single space removes the name from an object.\n* After you read a [[scroll]], it disappears.\n* The game has a \"[[scroll of identify]]\".\n* An identified [[wand]] shows the number of times recharged, then the number of charges.\n* [[Ring]]s and [[amulet]]s provide magic when worn.\n* Several commands interact with [[container]]s.\n\nPlayers who became stuck to [[cursed]] item might want to read section 7.1, about curses and blessings.\n\n==== Weapons ====\nSection 7.2 on [[weapon]]s refers players to the game of AD&D (\"Advanced [[Dungeons and Dragons]]\"): ''\"Those of you in the audience who are AD&D players, be aware that each weapon which existed in AD&D does roughly the same damage to monsters in NetHack. Some of the more obscure weapons (such as the ''aklys'', ''lucern hammer'', and ''bec-de-corbin'') are defined in an appendix to ''Unearthed Arcana'', an AD&D supplement.\"'' The relevant AD&D specifications have now entered ''The d20 System Reference Document'' (d20 SRD), which is freely available in many places, for example as [https://www.d20srd.org/index.htm ''The Hypertext d20 SRD'']. The d20 system is based on edition 3.5 of Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nOnly editions 1 and 2 bore the adjective ''Advanced'', and it is presumably one of these editions the Guidebook refers to. Substantial changes have been made to (Advanced) Dungeons and Dragons since then, so any comparison of weapon tables in NetHack and the d20 system is meaningless.\n\nSection 7.2 also contains subsections relating to [[throw|throwing]] and [[projectile|shooting]], [[Skill|weapon proficiency]], and [[Twoweapon|two-weapon combat]].\n\n==== Armor ====\nSection 7.3 on [[armor]] also refers to AD&D, but the Guidebook lists AC values of most types of body armor, so that players need not consult the AD&D definitions. (Indeed, the modern d20 system now does AC differently from NetHack, so the [https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/armor.htm#tableArmorandShields AC values in d20] do not match the AC values in NetHack. NetHack AC counts down from 10; d20 AC counts ''up'' from 10. Ignoring other bonuses, the [https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#armorClass d20 formula for AC] is 10 plus the armor bonus. So a scale mail provides AC 6 in NetHack but AC 14 in d20.)\n\nThe authority on weapons and armor in NetHack is not the AD&D spec, but the NetHack [[source code]] or a [[spoiler]] such as this [[wiki]].\n\n* ''Armor in order of AC:'' [[dragon scale mail]], [[plate mail]], [[crystal plate mail]], [[bronze plate mail]], [[splint mail]], [[banded mail]], [[dwarvish mithril-coat]], [[elven mithril-coat]], [[chain mail]], [[orcish chain mail]], [[scale mail]], [[studded leather armor]], [[ring mail]], [[orcish ring mail]], [[leather armor]], [[leather jacket]], and no armor.\n\n=== Conducts ===\nThe eighth chapter of the Guidebook documents [[conduct]]s.\n\nEven for a player who never [[ascension|ascended]] and who does not intend to follow any conducts, this chapter contains a few subtle hints. ''\"Calling upon your god for help with starvation does not violate any food challenges either.\"'' So, gods can help with starvation. You might recall from the chapter 4 that the #[[pray]] command does ''\"Pray to the gods for help.\"'' You might correctly conclude that prayer may help with starvation.\n\nThis section also documents which food qualifies as [[vegan]] or [[vegetarian]]; this might also help unspoiled players who need food for their vegetarian pet (sections 6.2 and 7.4). It also notes that [[Potion of water|liquids]] [[Potion of fruit juice|that]] [[Potion of booze|provide nutrition]] do not count against foodless conduct, citing \"a physiological need for water\" as a justification.\n\n=== Options ===\nThe ninth chapter of the Guidebook is a comprehensive description of all of the game options, and how to set them. Section 9.4 enumerates the customization options in alphabetical order, and does not attempt to group the options into categories (such as options for character generation).\n\nThis wiki provides more information about some options, but perhaps the Guidebook is the better source of information for many of them. Most of the below links redirect to a section on our [[option]] page, but some (like [[Autopickup]]) have their own page.\n\n* ''Options:'' [[acoustics]], [[align]], [[autodig]], [[autoopen]], [[autopickup]], [[autoquiver]], [[options#blind|blind]], [[options#bones|bones]], [[catname]], [[options#character|character]], [[checkpoint]], [[checkspace]], [[clicklook]], [[cmdassist]], [[confirm]], [[dark_room]], [[disclose]], [[dogname]], [[extmenu]], [[options#female|female]], [[fixinv]], [[options#fruit|fruit]], [[options#gender|gender]], [[options#help|help]], [[hilite_pet]], [[hilite_pile]], [[horsename]], [[ignitr]], [[implicit_uncursed]], [[legacy]], [[lit_corridor]], [[lootabc]], [[options#mail|mail]], [[male]], [[mention_walls]], [[menucolors]], [[menustyle]], [[menu_deselect_all]], [[menu_deselect_page]], [[menu_first_page]], [[menu_headings]], [[menu_invert_all]], [[menu_invert_page]], [[menu_last_page]], [[menu_next_page]], [[menu_objsyms]], [[menu_previous_page]], [[menu_search]], [[menu_select_all]], [[menu_select_page]], [[msghistory]], [[msg_window]], [[Options#name|name]], [[news]], [[Options#nudist|nudist]], [[null]], [[number_pad]], [[packorder]], [[paranoid_confirmation]], [[perm_invent]], [[pettype]], [[pickup_burden]], [[pickup_thrown]], [[pickup_types]], [[pile_limit]], [[playmode]], [[pushweapon]], [[options#race|race]], [[rest_on_space]], [[options#role|role]], [[options#roguesymset|roguesymset]], [[options#rlecomp|rlecomp]], [[runmode]], [[safe_pet]], [[scores]], [[showexp]], [[showrace]], [[showscore]], [[silent]], [[options#sortloot|sortloot]], [[sortpack]], [[sparkle]], [[standout]], [[statushilites]], [[suppress_alert]], [[options#symset|symset]], [[options#time|time]], [[timed_delay]], [[options#tombstone|tombstone]], [[toptenwin]], [[options#travel|travel]], [[verbose]], [[windowtype]].\n* ''And on some windowing systems:'' [[align_message]], [[align_status]], [[ascii_map]], [[options#color|color]], [[eight_bit_tty]], [[font_map]], [[font_menu]], [[font_message]], [[font_status]], [[font_size_map]], [[font_size_menu]], [[font_size_message]], [[font_size_status]], [[font_size_text]], [[font_text]], [[fullscreen]], [[large_font]], [[map_mode]], [[mouse_support]], [[player_selection]], [[popup_dialog]], [[preload_tiles]], [[scroll_amount]], [[scroll_margin]], [[selectsaved]], [[softkeyboard]], [[splash_screen]], [[tiled_map]], [[tile_file]], [[tile_height]], [[tile_width]], [[use_darkgray]], [[use_inverse]], [[vary_msgcount]], [[windowcolors]], [[wraptext]].\n* ''And on some operating systems:'' [[altkeyhandler]], [[altmeta]], [[options#BIOS|BIOS]], [[flush]], [[MACgraphics]], [[page_wait]], [[rawio]], [[soundcard]], [[subkeyvalue]], [[video]], [[videocolors]], [[videoshades]].\n\nSections 9.7 through 9.15 detail further configuration capabilities in Nethack, many of which are new to version 3.6.0. Detailed explanations are provided for regular expressions, [[autopickup exceptions]], [[MSGTYPE|message types]], [[menucolors]], [[user sounds]], [[statushilites]], modifying the [[Symset|symbols NetHack uses]] in its display, configuring NetHack for play by the blind, and notes for system administrators.\n\n=== Scoring ===\nThe tenth chapter of the Guidebook suggests what would lead you to a [[higher score]]. ''\"Your score is chiefly based upon how much experience you gained, how much loot you accumulated, how deep you explored, and how the game ended.\"'' This chapter argues that you might want to intentionally [[quit]] instead of dying, because death causes a 10% penalty to your score.\n\nThe quitting to preserve one's score seems not to be a common practice. In nearly all cases, players will try to survive (by [[Elbereth]], by the mercy of [[Random Number God]], or by some other [[strategy]]) instead of quitting.\n\n=== Explore mode ===\nThe eleventh chapter of the Guidebook documents [[explore mode]]. Also mentioned is debug mode, known as [[wizard mode]], but it is stressed that this is for debugging rather than to give the player god-like powers within the game.\n\n=== Credits ===\nThe twelfth and final chapter of the Guidebook contains one paragraph of credits for the Guidebook itself, followed by the [[game history]] text (which is the same as the text from the in-game help). The game history is a long list of contributors to ''NetHack'', including the original ''[[Hack]]'' developers and the persons who did various [[port]]s.\n\n==Variants==\n===SLASH'EM===\n''[[SLASH'EM]]'' players may access the Guidebook during the game, by pressing [?] and selecting \"The SLASH'EM Guidebook.\" This displays the Guidebook in the [[wikipedia:Terminal pager|pager]] of your [[user interface]]. You may find that this is too inconvenient, especially if you are using the [[tty]] interface and cannot scroll upward. You may prefer to use an external page to load the Guidebook.txt file in the [[playground]] directory.\n\nSLASH'EM modifies the Guidebook to introduce the new role and race selections and explain the new configurable options and multiple [[tileset]]s.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.nethack.org/v367/Guidebook.html The Guidebook for NetHack 3.6.7.]\n*[https://www.nethack.org/common/info.html#Old The Guidebook and other documentation for previous versions.]\n{{nethack-367}}\n[[Category:Strategy]]"}

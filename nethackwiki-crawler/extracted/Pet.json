By default, each character starts with a pet, and you can acquire many more through various methods. The [tameness](/wiki/Tameness \"Tameness\") of a pet is affected by how well you care for it.\n\nA user has suggested improving this page or section as follows:\n\n*\"pet #chatting messages need to be linked from here. A pet equipment section is already present, but if possible could be expended with tips from a relevant [rgrn thread](http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/eb707f2f94de9105#)\"*\n\n## Starting pet\n\nEvery character enters the dungeon with a pet, unless the player has specifically set [pettype:none](/wiki/Options#pettype \"Options\") in their [configuration file](/wiki/Configuration_file \"Configuration file\"). If your role has a definite pet type in the table below, your pet will always be of that type; for other roles, it will either be the pet type you have configured, or a [kitten](/wiki/Kitten \"Kitten\") or a [little dog](/wiki/Little_dog \"Little dog\") with equal probability. Note that only [Knights](/wiki/Knights \"Knights\") can start with a [pony](/wiki/Pony \"Pony\").\n\nThe pet will begin the game already [named](/wiki/Call \"Call\") if you have set the [catname](/wiki/Options#catname \"Options\"), [dogname](/wiki/Options#dogname \"Options\"), or [horsename](/wiki/Options#horsename \"Options\") options in the configuration file; in addition, certain roles have built-in default pet names if you did not specify a name. Names of pets (and other critters) can be changed using the [call](/wiki/Call \"Call\") or [name](/wiki/Name \"Name\") commands.\n\n- | Role                                     | Pet                                         | Default name                                            |\n  | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n  | [Barbarian](/wiki/Barbarian \"Barbarian\") | \\<random>                                   | Idefix (if [little dog](/wiki/Little_dog \"Little dog\")) |\n  | [Caveman](/wiki/Caveman \"Caveman\")       | [little dog](/wiki/Little_dog \"Little dog\") | Slasher                                                 |\n  | [Knight](/wiki/Knight \"Knight\")          | [pony](/wiki/Pony \"Pony\")                   |                                                         |\n  | [Ranger](/wiki/Ranger \"Ranger\")          | [little dog](/wiki/Little_dog \"Little dog\") | Sirius                                                  |\n  | [Samurai](/wiki/Samurai \"Samurai\")       | [little dog](/wiki/Little_dog \"Little dog\") | Hachi                                                   |\n  | [Wizard](/wiki/Wizard \"Wizard\")          | [kitten](/wiki/Kitten \"Kitten\")             |                                                         |\n\n## Taming\n\nIn addition to starting with one as above, there are other methods to obtain pets: most monster types can be tamed and made into pets with a [scroll of taming](/wiki/Scroll_of_taming \"Scroll of taming\"), [magic harp](/wiki/Magic_harp \"Magic harp\"), or spell of [charm monster](/wiki/Spellbook_of_charm_monster \"Spellbook of charm monster\").\n\n[Domestic animals](/wiki/Domestic_animal \"Domestic animal\") (all growth stages of [dog](/wiki/Dog \"Dog\"), [cat](/wiki/Cat \"Cat\"), and [horse](/wiki/Horse \"Horse\")) can be tamed by throwing certain types of [food](/wiki/Food \"Food\") at them:\n\n- Dogs and cats can be tamed with \"people food\" - [food rations](/wiki/Food_ration \"Food ration\"), [pancakes](/wiki/Pancake \"Pancake\"), [fortune cookies](/wiki/Fortune_cookie \"Fortune cookie\"), etc. - and meat such as [tripe rations](/wiki/Tripe_ration \"Tripe ration\"), fresh meaty corpses that are not harmful, and items such as [meatballs](/wiki/Meatball \"Meatball\") created with [stone to flesh](/wiki/Spellbook_of_stone_to_flesh \"Spellbook of stone to flesh\"). [Eggs](/wiki/Egg \"Egg\") can also be used, but they usually just break when thrown.\n- Horses can be tamed with fruits (including the user-specified custom fruit), vegetables, and most safe [vegetarian](/wiki/Vegetarian \"Vegetarian\") corpses.\n- During a [full moon](/wiki/Time \"Time\"), dogs of any growth stage have a 5/6 chance of becoming [peaceful](/wiki/Peaceful \"Peaceful\") instead of tame. Repeated attempts may still succeed.\n- Domestic animals can also be pacified by throwing food items at them that they will not eat, including tins or old corpses.\n\n### Spells, books and scrolls\n\nThe spell of charm monster can be used to tame an adjacent monster, as can a non-cursed scroll of taming, subject to a check versus [monster magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance_\\(monster\\) \"Magic resistance (monster)\"); the scroll can also have its range extended by reading it while [confused](/wiki/Confused \"Confused\"). The spell [create familiar](/wiki/Spellbook_of_create_familiar \"Spellbook of create familiar\") will create a tame domestic animal (1⁄3 chance) or a tame random monster (2⁄3 chance, unless the randomly created monster is of an untameable type).\n\nWhen not standing on the [vibrating square](/wiki/Vibrating_square \"Vibrating square\"), reading the blessed [Book of the Dead](/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead \"Book of the Dead\") can tame coaligned [undead](/wiki/Undead \"Undead\") monsters and increases the tameness of those that are already pets.\n\n### Magic harps\n\n[Applying](/wiki/Apply \"Apply\") a magic harp with charges can tame monsters around you, with the range of the effect dependent on your experience level.\n\n### Djinni and wishes\n\n[Quaffing](/wiki/Quaff \"Quaff\") a [smoky](/wiki/Smoky_and_milky_potions \"Smoky and milky potions\") [potion](/wiki/Potion \"Potion\") or [rubbing](/wiki/Rub \"Rub\") a [magic lamp](/wiki/Magic_lamp \"Magic lamp\") can summon a [djinni](/wiki/Djinni \"Djinni\"), which may randomly be tame. The odds of it being tame are never very high, though they are highest when the potion or lamp is uncursed. A released djinni that offers a [wish](/wiki/Wish \"Wish\") can be used to obtain a desired pet, often in the form of a blessed [figurine](#Figurine) - certain pets can only be obtained easily in this way, if at all.\n\n### Figurines\n\nMonster [figurines](/wiki/Figurine \"Figurine\") can be used to generate the monster depicted by the figurine. There is always a chance of the generated monster being tame, with the odds at their highest if the figurine is blessed. Figurines can bypass some [taming restrictions](#Restrictions), although a majority of such ineligible monsters cannot have figurines of them created in the first place.[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1)\n\n### Demon gating\n\nWhile [polymorphed](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") into any [major demon](/wiki/Major_demon \"Major demon\") other than a [balrog](/wiki/Balrog \"Balrog\") or [foocubus](/wiki/Foocubus \"Foocubus\"), attacking in [melee](/wiki/Melee \"Melee\") with your [bare hands](/wiki/Bare_hands \"Bare hands\") can [gate in other demons](/wiki/Major_demon#Summoning_while_polymorphed \"Major demon\"). Demons gated this way have a 5⁄6 of being the same type as your current form, and a 1⁄6 chance of being any random demon of your alignment.\n\n### Eggs\n\nIf a fresh monster [egg](/wiki/Egg \"Egg\") hatches while being carried in open inventory, the baby monster may be generated tame. [Dragon](/wiki/Dragon \"Dragon\") eggs and eggs laid by the player always hatch tame, as will 50% of any other eggs if the player character is [male](/wiki/Male \"Male\"). The easiest way to get eggs of a given species is to become a female monster of that species and lay the eggs yourself.\n\n### Werecreatures\n\nIf you are a [werecreature](/wiki/Werecreature \"Werecreature\"), you can use [#monster](/wiki/Monster_\\(command\\) \"Monster (command)\") to summon your brethren for a cost of 10 [Pw](/wiki/Pw \"Pw\"); their species is dependent on your were-species, and they will always arrive tame.\n\n### Traps\n\nTwo [traps](/wiki/Trap \"Trap\") can actually aid in obtaining tamed monsters with their effects:\n\n- A [magic trap](/wiki/Magic_trap \"Magic trap\") will tame adjacent monsters with 4.8% probability whenever it gives you the [charisma](/wiki/Charisma \"Charisma\")-raising effect. This effect does not check monster MR, so it can tame otherwise resistant monsters. However, magic traps also have a variety of effects, many of which are harmful, so be prepared to deal with them if you intend to gamble on the charisma effect.\n\n* The [polymorph trap](/wiki/Polymorph_trap \"Polymorph trap\") polymorphs most monsters that step on it, and already-tame monsters that are weak and/or low on HP will deliberately jump onto them. A [leash](/wiki/Leash \"Leash\") can be used to guide pets onto them, and this can be used in conjunction with methods of generating more tame monsters (such as a [gremlin](/wiki/Gremlin \"Gremlin\") multiplying in water or the werecreature form's #monster ability) to produce armies of high-quality pets.\n\n### The Astral Plane\n\nYou will be given a tame 'guardian' [Angel](/wiki/Angel \"Angel\") upon entering the [Astral Plane](/wiki/Astral_Plane \"Astral Plane\"), unless you are generating [conflict](/wiki/Conflict \"Conflict\") or badly [aligned](/wiki/Alignment_record \"Alignment record\"); the Angel will also disappear if you generate conflict at any point after entrance.\n\n## Restrictions\n\nCertain monsters cannot be made tame no matter what you do; in most cases, they will be made [peaceful](/wiki/Peaceful \"Peaceful\") instead. They are:\n\n- [Quest nemeses](/wiki/Quest_nemesis \"Quest nemesis\"), [Medusa](/wiki/Medusa \"Medusa\"), and the [Wizard of Yendor](/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor \"Wizard of Yendor\"), none of whom can even be made peaceful.\n- [Humans](/wiki/Human \"Human\") (any [K](/wiki/Keystone_Kop_\\(monster_class\\) \"Keystone Kop (monster class)\") or [@](/wiki/Human_or_elf \"Human or elf\") except [elves](/wiki/Elf_\\(monster_attribute\\) \"Elf (monster attribute)\")); [werecreatures](/wiki/Werecreature \"Werecreature\") can be tamed, but only while in creature form.\n- [Shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper \"Shopkeeper\"), [guards](/wiki/Guard \"Guard\"), [aligned priests](/wiki/Aligned_priest \"Aligned priest\"), [quest leaders](/wiki/Quest_leader \"Quest leader\"), and the Wizard of Yendor can all be polymorphed or slimed, but will remember who they were, and still resist taming; at most, except for the Wizard they can be made peaceful.\n- [Covetous](/wiki/Covetous \"Covetous\") monsters: [Demon lords and princes](/wiki/Demon_lords_and_princes \"Demon lords and princes\"), [Vlad the Impaler](/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler \"Vlad the Impaler\"), and [master- and arch-liches](/wiki/Lich \"Lich\").\n- Hostile [minions](/wiki/Minion \"Minion\") sent after you by an angry god.\n- Demons, unless you yourself are polymorphed into a demon.\n\nThese restrictions are only checked at the time the monster would be made tame; existing monsters changing to these forms (e.g. a demilich that grows up into a master lich, a werecreature reverting to human form) will not become untame. Notably, the [Riders](/wiki/Riders \"Riders\") are not inherently untameable, though their 100 monster MR makes it very difficult; Famine and Pestilence can be [level drained](/wiki/Level_drain \"Level drain\"), which reduces their effective MR, although it may still take many attempts at taming before success. Death is immune to level drain, and so cannot be tamed.\n\nAlthough Vlad the Impaler is covetous in his base form, as a [vampire](/wiki/Vampire \"Vampire\") he's capable of shapeshifting, and his transformations are non-covetous and tameable in principle. This requires significant resources and effort to accomplish; see the [strategy](/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler#Taming_Vlad \"Vlad the Impaler\") section for details.\n\n## Pet diets\n\n- *See also [Diet#Pets](/wiki/Diet#Pets \"Diet\")*\n\nA freshly tamed pet's hunger starts out at 1000. For the three cardinal domestic species, the same appropriate foods that work for [taming](#Taming) also work for routine feeding are as for taming. Eggs are appropriate for feeding carnivorous and omnivorous pets like dogs and cats, but they should be dropped with the **d** command, not [thrown](/wiki/Throw \"Throw\"); eggs that pets will not eat are probably [cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") eggs, and should be #named and saved. Additionally, starving pets will eat some foods which they will not otherwise (e.g., starving horses will eat \"people food\" such as food rations).\n\nPets gain two to eight times as much nutrition as players from food (smaller ones gain more), but take the same time to eat it;[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2) a pet that was just tamed with food will \"devour\" it, taking only half the normal time required to eat it, but also gaining only 3⁄4 the nominal nutrition. Generally, your pets (especially the carnivorous ones) will feed themselves from the monsters they kill. Pets will never eat food that would cause them harm, unless they have the appropriate resistance (e.g., pets without [poison resistance](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\") won't eat poisonous corpses).\n\nA pet that becomes [hungry](/wiki/Hungry \"Hungry\") will reach \"starving\" status in 500 turns; a starving pet becomes confused and will have their maximum hit points divided by 3.[\\[3\\]](#cite_note-3) You can get an idea of whether a pet is [hungry](/wiki/Hungry \"Hungry\") or not if you #[chat](/wiki/Chat \"Chat\") with them frequently - in many cases (though not all), their vocalizations will change noticeably (e.g., a hungry dog \"barks\" while an otherwise content dog \"yips\".) Pet monsters that are [inediate](/wiki/Inediate \"Inediate\") usually do not become hungry, but also cannot have their tameness increased through feeding them.\n\nPets can be trained to more reliably drop items near you by giving them [treats](/wiki/Treat \"Treat\") after they drop something; this willingness to 'fetch' is known as [apport](/wiki/Apport \"Apport\").\n\n### Preferred foods\n\nDepending on a pet's diet, the food it is willing to eat falls into one of four categories:\n\n- Treats, which can be used to increase the pet's apport\n- Good food, which the pet will eat even when not hungry\n- Acceptable food, which the pet will eat only if hungry or starving\n- Emergency food, which the pet will eat only if starving\n\nThe following rules apply to the majority of pets:\n\n- | Class      | [Carnivore](/wiki/Carnivore \"Carnivore\")                                                                                                     | [Herbivore](/wiki/Herbivore \"Herbivore\")                           |\n  | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n  | Treat      | - [tripe rations](/wiki/Tripe_ration \"Tripe ration\")\n  - items created by the spell of [stone to flesh](/wiki/Stone_to_flesh \"Stone to flesh\") | * [apples](/wiki/Apple \"Apple\")\n  * [carrots](/wiki/Carrot \"Carrot\") |\n  | Good       | - meaty [corpses](/wiki/Corpse \"Corpse\")\n  - [eggs](/wiki/Egg \"Egg\")                                                                           | * vegan corpses (any of b j F)                                     |\n  | Acceptable | - \"people food\"                                                                                                                              | * vegan non-corpse non-\"people\" comestibles                        |\n  | Emergency  | - vegan non-corpse non-\"people\" comestibles                                                                                                  | * \"people food\"                                                    |\n\n\"People food\" includes:\n\n- [food](/wiki/Food_ration \"Food ration\"), [cram](/wiki/Cram_ration \"Cram ration\"), [C](/wiki/C-ration \"C-ration\") and [K-rations](/wiki/K-ration \"K-ration\")\n- [lembas wafers](/wiki/Lembas_wafer \"Lembas wafer\")\n- [cream pies](/wiki/Cream_pie \"Cream pie\")\n- [pancakes](/wiki/Pancake \"Pancake\")\n- [candy bars](/wiki/Candy_bar \"Candy bar\")\n- [fortune cookies](/wiki/Fortune_cookie \"Fortune cookie\")\n\nOmnivorous pets use the highest of the carnivorous and herbivorous rankings of a food item; e.g. apples, carrots, and tripe are all treats to them.\n\n### Diet exceptions\n\nThe following are exceptions to the normal rules:\n\n- Pets won't eat anything that would harm them (e.g. poisonous, [acidic](/wiki/Acid \"Acid\"), or [stoning](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\")-inducing) unless they have the appropriate resistance. They will also avoid eating \"old\" tainted corpses, with the exception of [lizards](/wiki/Lizard \"Lizard\") and [lichens](/wiki/Lichen \"Lichen\") (which never rot away).\n- Non-slimeproof pets will only consider a [glob of green slime](/wiki/Glob_of_green_slime \"Glob of green slime\") if they're starving.\n- [Ghouls](/wiki/Ghoul \"Ghoul\") are technically [inediate](/wiki/Inediate \"Inediate\"), but will eat old corpses and old eggs, and consider the former treats.\n- [Bananas](/wiki/Banana \"Banana\") are treats to herbivorous and omnivorous [Y](/wiki/Apelike_creature \"Apelike creature\").\n- [Carrots](/wiki/Carrot \"Carrot\") are treats to [blind](/wiki/Blind \"Blind\") carnivores, who will eat them to regain their sight.\n- [Metallivores](/wiki/Metallivore \"Metallivore\") consider non-[rustproof](/wiki/Rustproof \"Rustproof\") [iron](/wiki/Iron \"Iron\") items a treat, and other metal items are acceptable food; thus, only metallivores will eat [tins](/wiki/Tin \"Tin\"). A metallivore will not eat an [amulet of strangulation](/wiki/Amulet_of_strangulation \"Amulet of strangulation\") or [ring of slow digestion](/wiki/Ring_of_slow_digestion \"Ring of slow digestion\"), and throwing iron weapons at a metallivore is a bad idea, even if they would eat them afterward.\n- [Gelatinous cubes](/wiki/Gelatinous_cube \"Gelatinous cube\") consider organic non-food items acceptable.\n- [Humanoids](/wiki/Humanoid \"Humanoid\") other than [ogres](/wiki/Ogre \"Ogre\"), [orcs](/wiki/Orc_\\(monster_attribute\\) \"Orc (monster attribute)\"), and [kobolds](/wiki/Kobold \"Kobold\") will not commit [cannibalism](/wiki/Cannibalism \"Cannibalism\") unless starving;[elves](/wiki/Elf_\\(monster_attribute\\) \"Elf (monster attribute)\") will not commit cannibalism even if starving.\n- None of the above pet types will eat your role's [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\"), any [unique items](/wiki/Unique_item \"Unique item\"), or [Rider](/wiki/Rider \"Rider\") corpses. Pets have a 95% chance of passing up other [artifacts](/wiki/Artifact \"Artifact\"), assuming they would normally eat the base item.\n\n## Pet behavior\n\nPets will very generally try to stay close to your position, though they are prone to wandering off; a pet with more [speed](/wiki/Speed \"Speed\") is usually (though not always) better at keeping up with you. Carrying food that a pet considers a treat (e.g. tripe rations) will cause them to follow you more closely. All tamed monsters will [follow](/wiki/Follow \"Follow\") you up and down [stairways](/wiki/Stairway \"Stairway\") and through [portals](/wiki/Portal \"Portal\") if they are adjacent to you when you enter, unless they cannot move or are in the middle of an action (e.g. eating).\n\n### Cursed items\n\nPets tend to avoid squares where a cursed item is present. If a pet does enter such a square, the message displayed is \"\\<pet> steps reluctantly over a(n) \\<item>\". Note that the item listed is *not* necessarily the cursed item -- it's whatever item happens to be \"on top\" of the square.\n\nThis message is not displayed if you displace the pet onto the square, or if there's food on the square that the pet wants to eat. Divine minion pets are not bothered by cursed items.[\\[4\\]](#cite_note-4)\n\n### Traps\n\nPets will also try to avoid known traps where possible. If leashed, a pet may \"whine\" or \"whimper\" to indicate that a trap is near, even if it hasn't been detected yet.\n\n### Movement\n\nApplying a [tin whistle](/wiki/Tin_whistle \"Tin whistle\") or a [bell](/wiki/Bell \"Bell\") can cause them to seek you out and stay close for a certain amount of turns; a [magic whistle](/wiki/Magic_whistle \"Magic whistle\") will warp them immediately to your side. Applying a [leash](/wiki/Leash \"Leash\") to a pet will keep them closer to you, though it alters and limits their movement as well: leashed pets can end up stuck around corners depending on where you and the pet move. Leashed pets will also move reluctantly over cursed items more often, and will whine if they sense a trap is nearby (though they still risk walking into the trap themselves). A leashed pet that can move always follows you when you travel via stairs or a portal, even if they are not adjacent to you.\n\n#### Displacing a pet\n\nIf you try to walk on a pet's square, you have a 6⁄7 chance of displacing it and switching places unless you are punished, in a [shop](/wiki/Shop \"Shop\"), or the pet is a [long worm](/wiki/Long_worm \"Long worm\").[\\[5\\]](#cite_note-5) If you fail to displace your pet (1⁄7), then the pet will become [scared](/wiki/Scare#Methods \"Scare\") for 1-6 turns. If the pet cannot move, but you otherwise would swap places, you have a 1⁄6 chance of swapping places anyway.[\\[6\\]](#cite_note-6)\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nIt is no longer possible to displace a pet out of a trap, directly onto a trap, into water or into other hazardous terrain. It is also no longer possible to displace a sleeping or paralysed pet, but a sessile pet can sometimes be displaced. It may be possible to displace a pet near a trap, causing it to move onto the trap.\n\n### Combat\n\nUnless confused, pets will generally only attack monsters that are not you, a [quest leader](/wiki/Quest_leader \"Quest leader\"), a [quest guardian](/wiki/Quest_guardian \"Quest guardian\"), or another pet.[\\[7\\]](#cite_note-7) In addition, they will also avoid attacking monsters that are at least two levels higher than they are.[\\[8\\]](#cite_note-8) A pet will not attack peaceful monsters if they are below 25% of their maximum HP.[\\[9\\]](#cite_note-9)\n\nA pet will not attack a [floating eye](/wiki/Floating_eye \"Floating eye\") 90% of the time, provided the pet can see; it will also avoid attacking a [gelatinous cube](/wiki/Gelatinous_cube \"Gelatinous cube\") 90% of the time.[\\[10\\]](#cite_note-10)[\\[11\\]](#cite_note-11) Pets will additionally avoid attacking monsters whose maximum passive damage exceeds their current hit points.[\\[12\\]](#cite_note-12) A pet will not attack a monster who can turn them to stone if the pet is not stoning-resistant.[\\[13\\]](#cite_note-13) [Conflict](/wiki/Conflict \"Conflict\") overrides all of these restrictions and will cause a pet to attack any nearby monster (or you), subject to a check versus monster magic resistance.\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nPets are now more careful about attacking higher-level monsters, compared to their own level, as their own health drops. Pets will not attack a monster above a certain level, as described in the table below; note that a healthy pet can now attack monsters 2 levels higher.\n\n| Pet's HP                | Maximum level (from 3.7.0)              |\n| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| Full health             | Pet's level + 2                         |\n| At least 80% of maximum | Pet's level + 1                         |\n| At least 60% of maximum | Pet's level                             |\n| At least 40% of maximum | Pet's level – 1                         |\n| At least 20% of maximum | Pet's level – 2                         |\n| Below 20% of maximum    | Pet's level – 3 [\\[14\\]](#cite_note-14) |\n\n### Abuse and death\n\n- *Main article: [Tameness#Abuse](/wiki/Tameness#Abuse \"Tameness\")*\n\nIn general, abusing your pet involves attacking it in any form, even if you were [confused](/wiki/Confused \"Confused\"), [stunned](/wiki/Stun \"Stun\") or otherwise impaired. Killing your pet outright carries a −15 penalty to [alignment record](/wiki/Alignment_record \"Alignment record\") and −1 [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") penalty[\\[15\\]](#cite_note-15)[\\[16\\]](#cite_note-16) - displacing your pet in a manner that causes its immediate death (i.e., into a trap or [pool](/wiki/Pool \"Pool\") of water) carries a −15 penalty and [angers](/wiki/Anger \"Anger\") your [god](/wiki/God \"God\").\n\nIf your pet died and left a corpse, you can try to resurrect it using a [wand](/wiki/Wand_of_undead_turning \"Wand of undead turning\") or spell of [turn undead](/wiki/Turn_undead \"Turn undead\"); a [scroll of food detection](/wiki/Scroll_of_food_detection \"Scroll of food detection\") or the spell of [detect food](/wiki/Spellbook_of_detect_food \"Spellbook of detect food\") can be used to locate your pet's corpse before it rots away. If it was turned to stone, you can try the spell of [stone to flesh](/wiki/Spellbook_of_stone_to_flesh \"Spellbook of stone to flesh\").\n\nPets that are revived or saved by an amulet of life saving are not guaranteed to revive tame - if you killed the pet yourself or [abused](/wiki/Abuse_\\(pet\\) \"Abuse (pet)\") it at least three times, it will never revive tame and has only a 1-in-(times abused) chance of being peaceful; if you abused it at least ten times, it will always revive as hostile.[\\[17\\]](#cite_note-17) If you didn't kill your pet and abused it at most twice, its tameness becomes a random number between zero and its prior tameness, with equal probability; if this new number is zero, the pet is no longer tame, but it still has a 50% chance of being peaceful. A pet that remains tame after being revived, or else is re-tamed manually, retains its tameness value and has its nutrition, abuse and apport reset as though it was a brand new pet.\n\nAttempting to [sacrifice](/wiki/Sacrifice \"Sacrifice\") the corpse of a pet that died while it was tame at an altar will anger that altar's god - doing the same at a cross-aligned altar will actually *reduce* your own god's anger. A pet that went feral or was otherwise untamed prior to dying is suitable to sacrifice.\n\nThere is no special penalty for abandoning or losing track of pets, eating your pets' corpses or (surprisingly) [genociding](/wiki/Genocide \"Genocide\") your pet's species or class. Keep in mind that the normal effects of corpses of the pets' species still apply, such as [cannibalism](/wiki/Cannibalism \"Cannibalism\") or [aggravate monster](/wiki/Aggravate_monster \"Aggravate monster\") from [cat](/wiki/Cat \"Cat\") and [dog](/wiki/Dog \"Dog\") corpses.\n\n## Pet growth\n\nLike [you](/wiki/You \"You\"), pets level up by defeating monsters. However, while your character gains experience points that build towards new experience level, the pets gain a random number of [hit points](/wiki/Hit_point \"Hit point\") between one and the defeated monster's level plus one, and their level is increased to roughly match their maximum hit point total.[\\[18\\]](#cite_note-18) A pet's health, level and status can be monitored via a [stethoscope](/wiki/Stethoscope \"Stethoscope\") or a [wand of probing](/wiki/Wand_of_probing \"Wand of probing\").\n\nThe maximum HP threshold for most monsters is 8 times their current level (or 4 for level 0), with the exception of [golems](/wiki/Golem \"Golem\") and [elementals](/wiki/Elemental \"Elemental\") on their home [Elemental Plane](/wiki/Elemental_Plane \"Elemental Plane\"). The maximum level for a monster is 3⁄2 of that monster's base level, or the next type if that monster has a more \"grown up\" form; said maximum will normally be no greater than 49.[\\[19\\]](#cite_note-19)\n\nSee [growing up](/wiki/Growing_up \"Growing up\") for more details about pet advancement.\n\n## Pets and equipment\n\n- *Main article: [Armor#Monsters, pets, and armor](/wiki/Armor#Monsters.2C_pets.2C_and_armor \"Armor\")*\n\nTamed [intelligent](/wiki/Intelligent \"Intelligent\") monsters that have hands can use items they pick up, and humanoid ones can wear and even replace [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\"). They will also use other items such as [potions](/wiki/Potion \"Potion\"), [scrolls](/wiki/Scroll \"Scroll\") and even certain [tools](/wiki/Tool \"Tool\"). As mentioned above, pets will not pick up cursed items, and will avoid moving onto them where possible; silver-hating pets will always avoid touching silver items.[\\[20\\]](#cite_note-20)\n\nIntelligent pets will quaff or throw various potions if they pick one up; for example, they can quaff a potion of [healing](/wiki/Potion_of_healing \"Potion of healing\") or [extra healing](/wiki/Potion_of_extra_healing \"Potion of extra healing\") if low on HP, and will throw harmful potions such as [acid](/wiki/Potion_of_acid \"Potion of acid\") or [sleeping](/wiki/Potion_of_sleeping \"Potion of sleeping\") at other monsters.\n\n### Weapons and armor\n\nOnly [medium](/wiki/Medium \"Medium\")-sized monsters can wear body armor or [shirts](/wiki/Shirt \"Shirt\"), and only medium or smaller monsters will fit into cloaks. All monsters know the enchantment of armor, and will replace a worn piece of armor with one that gives more AC, regardless of any other properties conveyed - e.g., a +3 [small shield](/wiki/Small_shield \"Small shield\") takes priority over a +0 [shield of reflection](/wiki/Shield_of_reflection \"Shield of reflection\").[\\[21\\]](#cite_note-21)[\\[22\\]](#cite_note-22)\n\nPets with a weapon attack will pick up and wield weapons, and select which one to wield based on type. They prefer (in this order): any usable artifact weapon, cockatrice or chickatrice corpse, *tsurugi*, runesword, *dwarvish mattock*, *two-handed sword*, *battle-axe*, katana, *unicorn horn*, crysknife, trident, long sword, elven broadsword, broadsword, scimitar, silver saber, morning star, elven short sword, dwarvish short sword, short sword, orcish short sword, mace, axe, dwarvish spear, silver spear, elven spear, spear, orcish spear, flail, bullwhip, *quarterstaff*, javelin, aklys, club, pick-axe, rubber hose, war hammer, silver dagger, elven dagger, dagger, orcish dagger, athame, scalpel, knife, worm tooth.[\\[23\\]](#cite_note-23) (Weapons in italics are two-handed, and will be chosen only if the monster is [strong](/wiki/Strong \"Strong\") and is not wearing a shield. A cockatrice corpse will not be chosen if it would immediately stone the monster. Stilettos and grappling hooks will never be chosen.)\n\nIf a monster has a wielded artifact weapon and picks up another one, it can switch to the new artifact and drop the old one, provided the new artifact is not cross-aligned and the conditions for two-handed weapons are met (if applicable). (\"Can\" here means the first admissible artifact in the game's internal list of carried objects is chosen.)\n\nPets can also make use of [ranged weapons](/wiki/Ranged_weapon \"Ranged weapon\") if they come across any, and will also use their [breath weapon](/wiki/Breath_weapon \"Breath weapon\") if they have one.[\\[24\\]](#cite_note-ranged_pet_attack-24)\n\n### Tools and other items\n\nSome pets can carry around a [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\") to apply if afflicted with a status condition, or a [key](/wiki/Key \"Key\") to unlock doors with. Some pets can also put on amulets of [life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\") or [reflection](/wiki/Amulet_of_reflection \"Amulet of reflection\"); they have no preference in this regard. A [nonliving](/wiki/Nonliving \"Nonliving\") monster that ends up wearing an amulet of life saving (typically due to being polymorphed from the form they put it on with) will not use up the amulet if they die.\n\n## Steeds\n\n- *Main article: [Riding](/wiki/Riding \"Riding\")*\n\nCertain pets can serve as steeds for your character if they have a [saddle](/wiki/Saddle \"Saddle\") placed on them. Mounting a steed reduces their tameness, making it imperative to treat them well and keep them fed where possible.\n\n## Strategy\n\nFrom a general outlook, having a tamed monster by your side can serve several useful purposes - they can help kill hostile monsters, [detect cursed items](/wiki/Curse-testing#Pet_testing \"Curse-testing\"), and even aid in [stealing from shops](/wiki/Stealing_from_shops \"Stealing from shops\") without angering the [shopkeeper](/wiki/Shopkeeper \"Shopkeeper\"). A pet can also kill a peaceful monster that you want a particular item from, such as a [dwarf's](/wiki/Dwarf_\\(monster\\) \"Dwarf (monster)\") [pick-axe](/wiki/Pick-axe \"Pick-axe\"), without any penalties - you are not considered responsible for monsters that your pet kills. Pets can also enlighten newer players to certain aspects of the game, such as which corpses are (mostly) safe to eat and which monsters are safe to attack in melee.\n\nHowever, pets can also be a hassle to manage. If strong enough, they will attack peaceful monsters, such as [aligned priests](/wiki/Aligned_priest \"Aligned priest\"), that you want to keep alive; pets on the weaker side that are left to constantly pick fights may eventually end up killed. Additionally, unless given stealth in some manner they will wake up nearby monsters, particularly [nymphs](/wiki/Nymph \"Nymph\") and [leprechauns](/wiki/Leprechaun \"Leprechaun\"), that you would rather leave asleep. Pets can also snatch up corpses you were hoping to eat and get in the way of vital spells, wand shots or [ranged attacks](/wiki/Ranged_attack \"Ranged attack\"). The more pets you have, the more tedious it becomes to keep them with you, and the more the above problems multiply - though a [magic whistle](/wiki/Magic_whistle \"Magic whistle\") can alleviate many of them.\n\nOne particular \"quirk\" with regards to pets is the relative weakness of most starting pets - [falling rock traps](/wiki/Falling_rock_trap \"Falling rock trap\") and [pits](/wiki/Pit \"Pit\") are enough to immediately kill an unfortunate kitten or little dog, and spectacularly unfortunate players may see them die to a [gecko](/wiki/Gecko \"Gecko\") or [jackal](/wiki/Jackal \"Jackal\"). Players invested in their pet's survival may consider letting them finish off weak monsters like [grid bugs](/wiki/Grid_bug \"Grid bug\") or [newts](/wiki/Newt \"Newt\") to quickly gain levels early on, so that it can become strong enough to survive the traps and encounters in the lower dungeon levels.\n\nAnother important factor to remember is that pets only provide clues to *non-fatal* corpses and *noncursed* objects. This is generally more relevant to understanding the difference between \"not cursed\" and \"safe to use-test\" - the helmet your dog walked over with no trouble might be a [dunce cap](/wiki/Dunce_cap \"Dunce cap\") or [helm of opposite alignment](/wiki/Helm_of_opposite_alignment \"Helm of opposite alignment\").\n\n### Feeding pets\n\nCarnivorous pets are easy to feed, to the point that you have to prevent them from stealing corpses you want to eat; conversely, herbivorous pets are somewhat trickier to feed due to the relative lack of safe pet-friendly foodstuffs, and are more likely to become confused from hunger as a result. [Trees](/wiki/Tree \"Tree\") such as the ones in most variants of [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\") can drop several fruits and vegetarian food items if kicked, though there is the risk of attracting [killer bees](/wiki/Killer_bee \"Killer bee\") or (in Minetown's case) angering the [Watch](/wiki/Watch \"Watch\"); it is also possible to create them by [polypiling](/wiki/Polypiling \"Polypiling\") comestibles.\n\nFor horse owners in particular, a common trick usually employed by Knights is to allow the horse to reach starving levels of hunger, then leave the level for a while, and re-enter to toss the now-wild horse a treat, resetting its nutrition and tameness. Non-knights with a horse (or other steed that can be re-tamed this way) can instead opt to mount and dismount their steed repeatedly untill it un-tames.\n\nAn inediate pet does not have to eat, but also cannot have its tameness increased with food; this makes inediate pets harder to keep tame, especially if you or they have the misfortune to step on a level-changing trap. Losing a [vampire lord](/wiki/Vampire_lord \"Vampire lord\") or [Archon](/wiki/Archon \"Archon\") to a [level teleporter](/wiki/Level_teleport \"Level teleport\") is a terrible happenstance, not least because they will use whatever kit they were given against you.\n\n### Caring for pets\n\nAs pets are at their most vulnerable during their weaker stages, [trap detection](/wiki/Trap#Strategy \"Trap\") is a especially useful skill to hone in order to protect them. Actively leading your pet(s) rather then letting them \"lead\" you makes it easier to provide a clear path for it, whether or not you use them to detect traps - even stronger pets can be \"threatened\" by an inopportune [trap door](/wiki/Trap_door \"Trap door\") if it separates you from them long enough for the pet(s) to become hostile. For other non-relocating traps such as pits and [bear traps](/wiki/Bear_trap \"Bear trap\"), you want to #[untrap](/wiki/Untrap \"Untrap\") the pet as soon as possible; be warned that unsuccessfully attempting to remove a bear trap will injure your pet, and if done repeatedly may kill it. When untrapping pets, make sure there is a safe square for them to access.\n\nObtaining [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\") as soon as possible is an ideal goal for most pet owners in order to avoid abusing or killing them while [blinded](/wiki/Blind \"Blind\"). Telepathy is also ideal to spot and eliminate digesting monsters such as [purple worms](/wiki/Purple_worm \"Purple worm\"), [trappers](/wiki/Trapper \"Trapper\") and [lurkers above](/wiki/Lurkers_above \"Lurkers above\"), who can potentially engulf and kill your pet instantly. Pets are also vulnerable to polymorph traps, which in practice are as likely to turn them into a sessile [mold](/wiki/Mold \"Mold\") or [jelly](/wiki/Jelly \"Jelly\") as it is to turn them into something stronger.\n\nIf you are [hallucinating](/wiki/Hallucinating \"Hallucinating\"), try using the #chat command to figure out which of the strange beings around you is your pet. A less reliable option is to wait and see how the creature in question moves and whether or not it attacks you.\n\n### Equipment for pets\n\nThe best way to equip a pet is to gather the desired items and leave them in a dead end, then stand on them until your pet comes near; swap places with the pet and keep them standing over the pile until they picks up something and start using it. If a pet drops something they had been using, you will need to swap places again to pick up their old stuff. For replacing equipment, the best way to do that is in a 2-square long corridor with a locked door. As pets tend to avoid picking up items when you are nearby, this method may take a while; locking them in a closet will often be faster if you don't have any items to replace. Pets with high apport are more likely to pick up things if you are not within their sight - be sure the pet isn't carrying a key of its own.\n\nIf you want your pet to keep a specific artifact, give it to it while it is carrying as few objects as possible.\n\n#### Armor and extrinsics\n\nA pet that can be armored should be given [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\"), [magic cancellation](/wiki/Magic_cancellation \"Magic cancellation\"), and [reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\"). All items that work for the player also work for monsters that can wear them, with some notes and exceptions:\n\n- [Speed boots](/wiki/Speed_boots \"Speed boots\") make monsters fast, but not very fast.\n- An [alchemy smock](/wiki/Alchemy_smock \"Alchemy smock\") confers only [poison resistance](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\").\n- Monster spellcasting is not hindered by metal armor.\n- [Dragon scales](/wiki/Dragon_scales \"Dragon scales\") and [dragon scale mail](/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail \"Dragon scale mail\") provide their extrinsics as usual, other armor properties than those discussed do not affect monsters.\n\nAfter deciding what extrinsics you can give your pet, the rest of their armor selection should be focused on improving AC.\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nPets can gain fire, cold, shock, sleep, poison, and disintegration resistances by eating corpses. This makes reflection a less crucial property, although death rays are still an issue, and puts inediate pets at a relative disadvantage.\n\n### Equipment for pet owners\n\nThere is a lot of equipment that can make pets more useful or make keeping them close easier.\n\n- Magic whistles will bring all pets to as close to the player as possible. [Eucalyptus leaves](/wiki/Eucalyptus_leaf \"Eucalyptus leaf\") will act like magic whistles if blessed. A tin whistle is a fine substitute if neither is available.\n- Stethoscopes will reveal information about your pet, including how injured it is, its level, and its maximum HP. Wands of probing will also give you this information and any equipment the pet is wearing, but they are less efficient due to their limited number of charges.\n- Leashes will keep pets nearby.\n- Saddles can be used to ride some pets. [Riding gloves and boots](/wiki/Randomized_appearance#Gloves \"Randomized appearance\") will make applying a saddle easier.\n- Carried treats will cause pets to stay close to the player; this can be annoying if they're always underfoot.\n- Spells of (extra) healing for healing pets, charm monster for acquiring new pets, stone to flesh for making treats for carnivores and omnivores.\n- The wand or spell of undead turning and the spell of stone to flesh can revive pets; they may revive hostile.\n- The spell of [detect monsters](/wiki/Spellbook_of_detect_monsters \"Spellbook of detect monsters\") and/or [potion of monster detection](/wiki/Potion_of_monster_detection \"Potion of monster detection\") to locate pets.\n- The wand of speed monster or [potions of speed](/wiki/Potion_of_speed \"Potion of speed\") to make pets fast.\n- Potions of healing, extra healing, full healing, restore ability, and gain ability will all restore a monster to full hit points if it hits them (wielded or thrown). Hitting a pet with a wielded potion counts as abuse, however.\n- Potions of unholy water will heal 2–12 HP for demons, undead, and lycanthropes.\n- A key to lock your pet in a room or closet, so it can heal, or equip itself, or to have it not attack something you want kept alive. Some pets may be smart enough to pick up keys and unlock doors.\n- A [blindfold](/wiki/Blindfold \"Blindfold\") or [towel](/wiki/Towel \"Towel\") if you have [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\") to locate your pets.\n- A [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\") (or a sack) is useful to carry all the other stuff and pet food, keep treats hidden, and to [rob shops](/wiki/Stealing_from_shops \"Stealing from shops\").\n- [Crystal balls](/wiki/Crystal_ball \"Crystal ball\"), including the [Orb of Fate](/wiki/Orb_of_Fate \"Orb of Fate\") and the [Orb of Detection](/wiki/Orb_of_Detection \"Orb of Detection\"), can be used for detecting traps that could harm pets, and can be recharged indefinitely with [the Platinum Yendorian Express Card](/wiki/The_Platinum_Yendorian_Express_Card \"The Platinum Yendorian Express Card\"); crystal balls are rather heavy to carry, however.\n\n### Preferred pets\n\nThe following is a list of monsters that make good pets. It is divided into two parts: the first consists of pets which a player might specifically work to obtain, for example through a wish or a polymorph trap. The second consists of pets that are useful (e.g. if you get them through a polytrap or magic trap), but not usually worth any extra effort to obtain.\n\n#### Worth the effort of trying to obtain\n\n- The [Archon](/wiki/Archon \"Archon\") is by general consensus the best all-around pet, with a high maximum level, powerful physical attacks, the ability to heal and haste itself, and its blinding gaze. They can fly, don't eat, and can wield weapons and wear some armor. Archons are rare to find and difficult to tame, however, and a hostile Archon is a dangerous foe to stand near as you repeatedly try to tame it. Monsters blinded by the Archon won't respect [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\"), a possible concern for low-level characters. A \"blessed [figurine](/wiki/Figurine \"Figurine\") of an Archon\" is a common first wish for [pacifists](/wiki/Pacifist \"Pacifist\"), and is popular in general. They cannot be obtained from a polytrap, and therefore must be wished for or found, and they never leave corpses to [revive](/wiki/Revive \"Revive\").\n- [Ki-rin](/wiki/Ki-rin \"Ki-rin\") don't eat, can fly, and have superb attacks. In particular, it is noteworthy as it can take a saddle as well, making it an excellent mount, especially given that its high [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance_\\(monster\\) \"Magic resistance (monster)\") and base level will prevent it from bucking you if you are generating [conflict](/wiki/Conflict \"Conflict\"). They are best for a [knight](/wiki/Knight \"Knight\"), as it will irrevocably lose one point of [tameness](/wiki/Tame \"Tame\") each time a non-knight mounts it. Like Archons, ki-rin are not found via polytraps and never leave corpses.\n- [Titans](/wiki/Titan \"Titan\") have excellent base level, armor class, and magic resistance, are fast, can [spell-cast](/wiki/Monster_spell \"Monster spell\"), fly, wield a weapon, and wear non-body armor. They are too large to be [engulfed](/wiki/Engulf \"Engulf\"), and so won't be instantly killed by digesting monsters, a common cause of death for Archons and ki-rin. They do eat, which, though sometimes an inconvenience, does mean their [tameness](/wiki/Tameness \"Tameness\") will increase. Thus when you fall down a [shaft](/wiki/Hole \"Hole\") that herd of pet Titans won't be wild by the time you find your way back. They can leave corpses to revive, and are large enough to always do so if their manner of death permits it. Titans can be obtained from a polymorph trap, and may be the strongest pet available by such means.\n- [Purple worms](/wiki/Purple_worm \"Purple worm\") of high enough level can swallow and thus instantly kill almost any enemy. A pet worm can be leveled up quickly by setting it loose in a [graveyard](/wiki/Graveyard \"Graveyard\") containing [wraiths](/wiki/Wraith \"Wraith\"). Their [engulfing](/wiki/Engulfing \"Engulfing\") attack is not subject to corpse-leaving odds. However, that means you need to keep them away from [chameleons](/wiki/Chameleon \"Chameleon\"), [doppelgangers](/wiki/Doppelganger \"Doppelganger\"), and [green slime](/wiki/Green_slime \"Green slime\"), which will transform your pet into something less effective. Digested monsters don't leave corpses for you to eat, nor any special drops they otherwise would, such as [unicorn horns](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\"). Some powerful monsters such as Titans and dragons are too large to be engulfed.\n- [Balrogs](/wiki/Balrog \"Balrog\") have very powerful attacks, a high base level, and a good armor class. They're a valid polymorph form, making them more practical to acquire than Archons or ki-rin, and are [inediate](/wiki/Inediate \"Inediate\"), so they'll be more available for combat than purple worms or Titans. Their base speed is fairly low.\n\n#### Nice to have if you get one\n\n- [Centaurs](/wiki/Centaur_\\(monster_class\\) \"Centaur (monster class)\") can use weapons and some armor, may be saddled and ridden, and are easy to keep fed. These are potentially excellent early pets for heroes with a [scroll of taming](/wiki/Scroll_of_taming \"Scroll of taming\") or reliable access to the [charm monster](/wiki/Spellbook_of_charm_monster \"Spellbook of charm monster\") spell.\n- [Cockatrices](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") can petrify many foes. They don't have much HP, however, and their low maximum level will prevent them from attacking tougher monsters. Consider using [conflict](/wiki/Conflict \"Conflict\") to force your pet 'trice into combat (and watch your messages to be sure you aren't [turning to stone](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\")).\n- [Dragons](/wiki/Dragon \"Dragon\") can fly, can serve as a mount, and have very good attacks. Silver and gray dragons are immune to [death rays](/wiki/Death_ray \"Death ray\"); the former is also immune to disintegration blasts, while the latter is immune to polymorph traps. Yellow dragons are stoning-resistant. In [3.6.0](/wiki/3.6.0 \"3.6.0\") and older versions, they only used their [breath weapons](/wiki/Breath_weapon \"Breath weapon\") in the presence of [conflict](/wiki/Conflict \"Conflict\"), and then only in your direction; as of [3.6.1](/wiki/3.6.1 \"3.6.1\"), pets are allowed to use a breath or spit weapon against hostile monsters.[\\[24\\]](#cite_note-ranged_pet_attack-24) Pet dragons can be obtained by [polymorphing](/wiki/Polymorphing \"Polymorphing\") yourself and laying eggs; eggs hatch into baby dragons which can [grow up](/wiki/Grow_up \"Grow up\") to full size.\n- [Winged gargoyles](/wiki/Winged_gargoyle \"Winged gargoyle\") can fly and also have decent [AC](/wiki/AC \"AC\") and attacks; in addition, they are resistant to [stoning](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\") and starvation. Winged gargoyles are very hard to get by egg-laying; most winged gargoyle eggs hatch into regular gargoyles, and gargoyles do not grow up to winged gargoyles.\n- [Jabberwocks](/wiki/Jabberwock \"Jabberwock\"), especially [hasted](/wiki/Wand_of_speed_monster \"Wand of speed monster\"), have excellent damage potential, and can fly and take a saddle. They lack resistances, though, and are thus vulnerable to being lost to traps, death or disintegration rays, and cockatrices.\n- Arch-[liches](/wiki/Lich \"Lich\") can reach terrifyingly high levels, are always by your side even without the aid of a [magic whistle](/wiki/Magic_whistle \"Magic whistle\"), can heal themselves, and have a powerful freezing touch attack. They are impotent against cold-resistant monsters, however, and frequently get in your way. Since they will always teleport to your side, it can be very difficult to prevent them from killing [priests](/wiki/Aligned_priest \"Aligned priest\") and [shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper \"Shopkeeper\"). You cannot tame master- or arch-liches directly, but you can tame a lich or demilich and let it grow up.\n- A [mastodon](/wiki/Mastodon \"Mastodon\") can substitute for a jabberwock as a pet. It has the same speed, and they have higher maximum level (30), which means more HP and being aggressive against more difficult enemies. Mastodons do in 8d8 damage instead of the jabberwock's 8d10, but that's still quite a lot. They're herbivores, so you can eat most of corpses they leave behind.\n- [Mind flayers](/wiki/Mind_flayer \"Mind flayer\") do a lot of melee damage with their tentacle attacks, and can clear out monsters from a distance with their psychic blasts, which won't damage you as long as the flayer isn't hostile. A confused pet flayer could be disastrous, however, so make sure it has a [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\"). A psychic blast could also wake the [Wizard of Yendor](/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor \"Wizard of Yendor\") before you're ready to deal with him. Their very large number of attacks per turn also make them very weak to [passive attacks](/wiki/Passive_attack \"Passive attack\")—keep them away from [jellies](/wiki/Jellies \"Jellies\")!\n- [Minotaurs](/wiki/Minotaur \"Minotaur\") are fast, hit very hard, and are guaranteed to appear on a maze-type level. They have 0 [MR](/wiki/MR \"MR\"), so a [scroll of taming](/wiki/Scroll_of_taming \"Scroll of taming\") is guaranteed to snare one on the first try (the [spell of charm monster](/wiki/Spellbook_of_charm_monster \"Spellbook of charm monster\") is of course dependent on your casting success rate).\n- [Skeletons](/wiki/Skeleton \"Skeleton\") don't breathe, don't eat, slow monsters, wield weapons, and will resist cold, sleep, poison, petrification, and wands and fingers of death. They are not randomly generated, but can be found in [Orcus-town](/wiki/Orcus-town \"Orcus-town\") or produced by a polytrap or by polypiling unihorns.\n- [Trolls](/wiki/Troll \"Troll\") have good physical attacks, and if killed may revive tame. They may also revive hostile, however, so be careful. Make sure your other pets don't eat your former pet's corpse.\n- [Vampires](/wiki/Vampire \"Vampire\") and [vampire lords](/wiki/Vampire_lord \"Vampire lord\") don't breathe or eat, can fly, can wield all weapons and armor, and will regenerate. They are also immune to [death rays](/wiki/Finger_of_death \"Finger of death\"). But in 3.6 vampires now spontaneously turn into fog clouds, wolves, and—especially—vampire bats and remain in that form unless defeated in battle. Wolves and vampire bats do eat (and move fast enough to steal corpses from you) but they are nearly useless in battle compared to vampires. You can keep a vampire pet in its true form with a [ring of protection from shape changers](/wiki/Ring_of_protection_from_shape_changers \"Ring of protection from shape changers\"). In addition, protection from shape changers is necessary to permanently change the form of a vampire or vampire lord - without it, polymorphing them will just result in them taking their vampire bat form, which can change again as normal.\n\n## Messages\n\n### Death\n\nThere are a number of subtly different messages associated with the death of a pet.\n\n- You hear the rumble of distant thunder...\n\n  You killed it yourself. Penalty −15 alignment and −1 Luck.\n\n- You hear the studio audience applaud!\n\n  As above while hallucinating.\n\n- You feel guilty about losing your pet like this.\n\n  You displaced it causing it to drown or die. Penalty −15 alignment and an angry god.\n\n- You feel sad for a moment.\n\n  Pet starved to death.\n\n- \\<Pet> starves.\n\n  Pet starved to death in your presence.\n\n- You have a sad feeling for a moment, then it passes.\n\n  Pet died in combat or due to a trap.\n\n- You have a melancholy feeling for a moment, then it passes.\n\n  Pet (light or sphere) exploded.\n\n- You have a peculiarly sad feeling for a moment, then it passes.\n\n  Pet turned to stone.\n\n- You have a sad thought for a moment, then it passes.\n\n  Pet (master) [mind flayer](/wiki/Mind_flayer \"Mind flayer\") ate the brain of [Medusa](/wiki/Medusa \"Medusa\").\n\n- You have a strangely sad feeling for a moment, then it passes.\n\n  Pet [clay golem](/wiki/Clay_golem \"Clay golem\") was [canceled](/wiki/Cancellation \"Cancellation\") by a [gremlin](/wiki/Gremlin \"Gremlin\").\n\n- You have a queasy feeling for a moment, then it passes.\n\n  Pet [purple worm](/wiki/Purple_worm \"Purple worm\"), [trapper](/wiki/Trapper \"Trapper\"), or [lurker above](/wiki/Lurker_above \"Lurker above\") swallowed one of the [Riders](/wiki/Rider \"Rider\").\n\n- May \\<pet> rust in peace.\n\n  Pet [iron golem](/wiki/Iron_golem \"Iron golem\") was hit by a [rusting attack](/wiki/Erosion \"Erosion\").\n\n- May \\<pet> rot in peace.\n\n  Pet [wood golem](/wiki/Wood_golem \"Wood golem\") was hit by a [rotting attack](/wiki/Erosion \"Erosion\").\n\n- May \\<pet> roast in peace.\n\n  Pet [paper](/wiki/Paper_golem \"Paper golem\") or [straw golem](/wiki/Straw_golem \"Straw golem\") was hit by a [fire attack](/wiki/Fire \"Fire\").\n\n### Hunger\n\n- \\<pet> is confused from hunger.\n\n  Your pet is starving. It becomes confused from hunger, its maximum HP is reduced to 25%, and it has 250 more turns to live.[\\[25\\]](#cite_note-25)\n\n- You feel worried about your \\<pet>.\n\n  As above, but your pet is out of sight.\n\n## Variants\n\n### SLASH'EM\n\n- *Main article: [Pet (SLASH'EM)](/wiki/Pet_\\(SLASH%27EM\\) \"Pet (SLASH'EM)\")*\n\n[SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\") makes various changes to the pet-keeping system, adding god-granted minions as well as pets that can turn [traitor](/wiki/Traitor \"Traitor\"); pets and other monsters in SLASH'EM that are polymorphed will also eventually return to their normal form upon being killed or after a certain amount of turns, much like the player would.\n\n### GruntHack\n\nIn [GruntHack](/wiki/GruntHack \"GruntHack\"), hostile monsters will aggressively seek out your pets to attack them - this makes it much harder to keep early pets in particular alive. GruntHack also uses the same rules for polymorphing non-player monsters as SLASH'EM: polymorphed pets return to normal when they die or the polyform expires.\n\n### AceHack\n\n[AceHack](/wiki/AceHack \"AceHack\") implements ranged combat for pets; however, they currently die much faster than in vanilla, as monsters are more aggressive toward them. (This is planned to be fixed before release.)\n\n### dNetHack\n\n[dNetHack](/wiki/DNetHack \"DNetHack\") implements several changes and improvements for pets.\n\n- Ranged combat and spellcasting is enabled for pets.\n\n- Pets and hostile monsters will more actively seek out and attack each other.\n\n- The total number of pets on the current dungeon level is limited to 1⁄3 the character's [charisma](/wiki/Charisma \"Charisma\") score. If this limit is exceeded, the lowest-level pets will quickly untame, typically returning to the same status (peaceful or hostile) as they were before they were tamed.\n\n  - Some pets do not count towards this limit and will not untame: loyal pets, temporary summons, temporarily tamed (\"friendly\") pets, and \"suicidal\" monsters (monsters whose attacks require killing themselves).\n  - \"Loyal\" pets also won't lose tameness from being left on other dungeon levels.\n  - If two pets have the same current level, then the tiebreakers, in order, are [tameness](/wiki/Tameness \"Tameness\"), species maximum level, and species [monster difficulty](/wiki/Monster_difficulty \"Monster difficulty\").\n  - Whenever a pet gains max HP (by killing a monster), it has a chance to decide to stay peaceful if it later untames, even if it was hostile before it was tamed. This chance depends on your beast mastery skill (see below) and your charisma.\n  - Monsters that are tamed by certain methods will always remain peaceful if they untame: monsters that decided to become tame on their own, monsters that were tamed by music (including [dolls of friendship](/wiki/Insight#Living_doll_merchants \"Insight\")), and starting pets.\n  - Pets on other dungeon levels don't count towards the limit and won't untame.\n\n- [Charm monster](/wiki/Spellbook_of_charm_monster \"Spellbook of charm monster\") and [scrolls of taming](/wiki/Scroll_of_taming \"Scroll of taming\") are now single-target spells.\n\n- The character can now take any item from a pet using the #[loot](/wiki/Loot \"Loot\") command, and may equip pets with armor using the #equip command.\n\n  - Armor now has an intrinsic size. Most pieces of armor must be the same size and the creature you want to wear the armor. Armor of unspecified size is Medium (human) sized.\n    - Most armor found randomly in the dungeon is sized for humans.\n\n  - Body armor and helms also have an intrinsic shape.\n\n    - Most armor and helms found randomly in the dungeon are shaped for humanoids (no modifier displayed).\n    - Barded armor fits roughly animal-shaped creatures, such as dogs, cats, horses, lizards, and spiders.\n    - Barded helms fit creatures with long heads, such as dogs, cats, horses, lizards, and snakes.\n    - Segmented armor fits roughly-snake shaped creatures, mostly snakes and most nagas.\n    - Snakeneck helms fit creatures with snake-like heads and necks attached to non-snake bodies. Examples are serpent men of Yoth, serpent-necked lionesses, bandersnatches, and jabberwocks.\n    - Centaur armor fits creatures with humanoid torsos attached to roughly animal-shaped lower bodies, which includes proper centaurs as well as driders (sprow, however, have humanoid bodies).\n    - Snakeleg armor fits creatures with humanoid torsos attached to serpentine lower bodies. Examples include mariliths, salamanders, and ancient nagas.\n    - Snakeback armor fits creatures with combined serpentine and animal-like body plan. [Deep Wyrms](/index.php?title=Deep_Wyrm\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Deep Wyrm (page does not exist)\") and [Deep Wyrmlings](/index.php?title=Deep_Wyrmling\\&action=edit\\&redlink=1 \"Deep Wyrmling (page does not exist)\") are the only such creatures.\n\n- A new skill, beast mastery, is implemented. Higher skill improves pets' AC and increases their chances to-hit in combat. It also increases the range from which pets will follow you when going up or downstairs. The skill is trained by witnessing your pets engaging in combat. Convicts, droven priests, dwarven nobles and wizards can get basic beast mastery, knights, elven, droven nobles and tourist can get skilled, and healers, troubadours, nobles and rangers can get expert.\n\n- Two new commands, #wait and #come allows you to tell a pet to stay on the current level or follow you between levels as normal. These are useful if you want to have a pet not follow you but find it difficult to do so because of the increased follow range due to high beast mastery skill.\n\n- Several 'storage' levels are implemented; pets left there won't lose tameness from being away from the player, even if they don't have the \"loyal\" tag. These include the first level of Sokoban and the first level of dNethack's Neutral Quest branch, and possibly others.\n\nA user has suggested improving this page or section as follows:\n\n*\"List the other effects of pets being loyal. There are some levels where pets don't lose tameness (or get hungry?) while you're off-level - list those levels.\"*\n\n#### dNetHack preferred pets\n\n- If wishing for a pet, the strongest non-unique angels are the best candidates.\n\n  - The counterpart of the vanilla Archon is the [Throne Archon](/wiki/Throne_Archon \"Throne Archon\"), a high-damage spellcaster that favors the lightning bolt spell and can buff itself. Its large size makes it harder to find equipment for.\n  - A [Light Archon](/wiki/Light_Archon \"Light Archon\") fires volleys of 3 (magically created) silver arrows for high potential damage against demons. Its large size makes it harder to find equipment for.\n  - A [Surya Deva](/wiki/Surya_Deva \"Surya Deva\") frequently casts *mass cure*, healing all nearby peaceful monsters as well as the player. Independent dancing blade means it can attack multiple targets per turn. It also casts *fire pillar* and fires (magically created) +57 phasing silver arrows. Its large size makes it harder to find equipment for, and each component of the Surya has a lower damage output than other choices. Fire damage is less useful than lightning.\n  - A [Mahadeva](/wiki/Mahadeva \"Mahadeva\") deals very high single-target melee damage and has the highest base level (30). However, it's also incredibly dangerous to have as a pet. Its weapon attack will make repeated attacks until it finally misses, and conventional wisdom would be to give it gauntlets of dexterity maybe and a weapon with good to-hit. This is a really awful idea. If the Mahadeva gets [confused](/wiki/Confused \"Confused\") you can very easily find yourself dead in a single turn unless you've got excellent AC (as in, \"good even for end-game AC\"). If you do, be careful to stay at range from your pet whenever possible.\n  - A [Tulani Eladrin](/wiki/Tulani_Eladrin \"Tulani Eladrin\") casts cold, shock, and fire damage spells, and its medium size means you can easily find and enchant a full set of armor for it. However, it can catch the player in fireball explosions. It has a lower base level (18) and chooses spells randomly, so damage drops off against targets with resistances. It only uses one weapon attack per turn, unless it is level 30.\n  - An [Ara Kamerel](/wiki/Ara_Kamerel \"Ara Kamerel\") comes with a [Kamerel Vajra](/wiki/Kamerel_Vajra \"Kamerel Vajra\") and casts [open wounds](/wiki/Open_wounds \"Open wounds\") in combat, resulting in high single-target damage. It resists shock damage, acid damage, sleep, poison, magic, petrification, and has intrinsic reflection. It reincarnates using gold golems, though it reverts to level 15 in the process. Its large size makes it harder to find equipment for, and its speed of 9 is rather slow. It can be permanently killed by some enemies.\n  - An [ancient of death](/wiki/Ancient_of_death \"Ancient of death\") inhales life and exhales death once per round, and is able to affect enemies through walls. However, its speed of 4 is very slow.\n  - An [ancient of ice](/wiki/Ancient_of_ice \"Ancient of ice\") is a less useful version of the ancient of death, since more targets resist fire and ice.\n\n- If searching the dungeon for endgame-capable pets:\n\n  - Lady [Oona](/wiki/Oona \"Oona\") has a decent base level (20), and her medium size means you can easily find and enchant equipment for her. She can wield weapons and casts a strong elemental damage spell. However, she is slow (speed 9), and her elemental damage spell is either fire, lightning, or cold, chosen randomly at the start of the game.\n  - [Medusa](/wiki/Medusa \"Medusa\") has a decent base level (20), and her medium size means you can easily find and enchant equipment for her, though her snake-like lower body does complicate matters. She can wield weapons and has numerous natural attacks. She constantly petrifies anything able to see her, though MC3 armor will block this effect.\n  - [Grue](/wiki/Grue \"Grue\") has a decent base level (20) and is very fast in the dark, with very high damage. It has a digestion attack and can be ridden. Its nonstandard body-type makes it unable to equip most types of armor, however. It can sometimes get itself killed by using its digestion attack.\n  - A strong [Darkness given hunger](/wiki/Darkness_given_hunger \"Darkness given hunger\") can be a surprisingly effective pet in the end game, particularly for players with a high pet cap, as enemy monsters with iron weapons will constantly divide your pet to create a small army around you. You will most likely want a means of mass healing your pets to keep them in good condition, such as the [Troubadour](/wiki/Bard \"Bard\")'s Meditative Healing song or the mass healing spell, and you will also need a ring of slow digestion to ward off engulfing attacks from any confused pets or pets that turn on you as pudding division causes you to exceed your pet cap.\n\n### FIQHack\n\nIn [FIQHack](/wiki/FIQHack \"FIQHack\"), pets actively seek out hostile monsters to pursue. Applying a tin whistle will temporarily disable this behavior.\n\nWhen considering what equipment to wear, you can throw items to intelligent, non-paralyzed pets to force them to pick them up. Pets will prefer items thrown at them over anything else - the more recently thrown, the better.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Apport](/wiki/Apport \"Apport\") – a measure of a pet's willingness to fetch items\n- [Tameness](/wiki/Tameness \"Tameness\") – a measure of a pet's loyalty to its owner\n- [Growing up](/wiki/Growing_up \"Growing up\") – for information about pet advancement\n\n## External links\n\n- [What are the best pets? by Kevin Hugo](http://web.archive.org/web/20100726084129/http://www.nethack.de/spoiler/32pets.txt)\n- [How to make your pet follow you](http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/b2ae347a4341976e/9f1796db44d11534?q=#9f1796db44d11534)\n\n## References\n\n1.

Mounting a steed reduces their tameness, making it imperative to treat them well and keep them fed where possible.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Strategy\">Strategy</span></h2>\n<p>From a general outlook, having a tamed monster by your side can serve several useful purposes - they can help kill hostile monsters, <a href=\"/wiki/Curse-testing#Pet_testing\" title=\"Curse-testing\">detect cursed items</a>, and even aid in <a href=\"/wiki/Stealing_from_shops\" title=\"Stealing from shops\">stealing from shops</a> without angering the <a href=\"/wiki/Shopkeeper\" title=\"Shopkeeper\">shopkeeper</a>. A pet can also kill a peaceful monster that you want a particular item from, such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Dwarf_(monster)\" title=\"Dwarf (monster)\">dwarf's</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Pick-axe\" title=\"Pick-axe\">pick-axe</a>, without any penalties - you are not considered responsible for monsters that your pet kills. Pets can also enlighten newer players to certain aspects of the game, such as which corpses are (mostly) safe to eat and which monsters are safe to attack in melee.\n</p><p>However, pets can also be a hassle to manage. If strong enough, they will attack peaceful monsters, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Aligned_priest\" title=\"Aligned priest\">aligned priests</a>, that you want to keep alive; pets on the weaker side that are left to constantly pick fights may eventually end up killed. Additionally, unless given stealth in some manner they will wake up nearby monsters, particularly <a href=\"/wiki/Nymph\" title=\"Nymph\">nymphs</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Leprechaun\" title=\"Leprechaun\">leprechauns</a>, that you would rather leave asleep. Pets can also snatch up corpses you were hoping to eat and get in the way of vital spells, wand shots or <a href=\"/wiki/Ranged_attack\" title=\"Ranged attack\">ranged attacks</a>. The more pets you have, the more tedious it becomes to keep them with you, and the more the above problems multiply - though a <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_whistle\" title=\"Magic whistle\">magic whistle</a> can alleviate many of them.\n</p><p>One particular \"quirk\" with regards to pets is the relative weakness of most starting pets - <a href=\"/wiki/Falling_rock_trap\" title=\"Falling rock trap\">falling rock traps</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Pit\" title=\"Pit\">pits</a> are enough to immediately kill an unfortunate kitten or little dog, and spectacularly unfortunate players may see them die to a <a href=\"/wiki/Gecko\" title=\"Gecko\">gecko</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Jackal\" title=\"Jackal\">jackal</a>. Players invested in their pet's survival may consider letting them finish off weak monsters like <a href=\"/wiki/Grid_bug\" title=\"Grid bug\">grid bugs</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Newt\" title=\"Newt\">newts</a> to quickly gain levels early on, so that it can become strong enough to survive the traps and encounters in the lower dungeon levels.\n</p><p>Another important factor to remember is that pets only provide clues to <i>non-fatal</i> corpses and <i>noncursed</i> objects. This is generally more relevant to understanding the difference between \"not cursed\" and \"safe to use-test\" - the helmet your dog walked over with no trouble might be a <a href=\"/wiki/Dunce_cap\" title=\"Dunce cap\">dunce cap</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Helm_of_opposite_alignment\" title=\"Helm of opposite alignment\">helm of opposite alignment</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Feeding_pets\">Feeding pets</span></h3>\n<p>Carnivorous pets are easy to feed, to the point that you have to prevent them from stealing corpses you want to eat; conversely, herbivorous pets are somewhat trickier to feed due to the relative lack of safe pet-friendly foodstuffs, and are more likely to become confused from hunger as a result. <a href=\"/wiki/Tree\" title=\"Tree\">Trees</a> such as the ones in most variants of <a href=\"/wiki/Minetown\" title=\"Minetown\">Minetown</a> can drop several fruits and vegetarian food items if kicked, though there is the risk of attracting <a href=\"/wiki/Killer_bee\" title=\"Killer bee\">killer bees</a> or (in Minetown's case) angering the <a href=\"/wiki/Watch\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Watch\">Watch</a>; it is also possible to create them by <a href=\"/wiki/Polypiling\" title=\"Polypiling\">polypiling</a> comestibles.\n</p><p>For horse owners in particular, a common trick usually employed by Knights is to allow the horse to reach starving levels of hunger, then leave the level for a while, and re-enter to toss the now-wild horse a treat, resetting its nutrition and tameness. Non-knights with a horse (or other steed that can be re-tamed this way) can instead opt to mount and dismount their steed repeatedly untill it un-tames.\n</p><p>An inediate pet does not have to eat, but also cannot have its tameness increased with food; this makes inediate pets harder to keep tame, especially if you or they have the misfortune to step on a level-changing trap. Losing a <a href=\"/wiki/Vampire_lord\" title=\"Vampire lord\">vampire lord</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Archon\" title=\"Archon\">Archon</a> to a <a href=\"/wiki/Level_teleport\" title=\"Level teleport\">level teleporter</a> is a terrible happenstance, not least because they will use whatever kit they were given against you.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Caring_for_pets\">Caring for pets</span></h3>\n<p>As pets are at their most vulnerable during their weaker stages, <a href=\"/wiki/Trap#Strategy\" title=\"Trap\">trap detection</a> is a especially useful skill to hone in order to protect them. Actively leading your pet(s) rather then letting them \"lead\" you makes it easier to provide a clear path for it, whether or not you use them to detect traps - even stronger pets can be \"threatened\" by an inopportune <a href=\"/wiki/Trap_door\" title=\"Trap door\">trap door</a> if it separates you from them long enough for the pet(s) to become hostile. For other non-relocating traps such as pits and <a href=\"/wiki/Bear_trap\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bear trap\">bear traps</a>, you want to #<a href=\"/wiki/Untrap\" title=\"Untrap\">untrap</a> the pet as soon as possible; be warned that unsuccessfully attempting to remove a bear trap will injure your pet, and if done repeatedly may kill it. When untrapping pets, make sure there is a safe square for them to access.\n</p><p>Obtaining <a href=\"/wiki/Telepathy\" title=\"Telepathy\">telepathy</a> as soon as possible is an ideal goal for most pet owners in order to avoid abusing or killing them while <a href=\"/wiki/Blind\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Blind\">blinded</a>. Telepathy is also ideal to spot and eliminate digesting monsters such as <a href=\"/wiki/Purple_worm\" title=\"Purple worm\">purple worms</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Trapper\" title=\"Trapper\">trappers</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Lurkers_above\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lurkers above\">lurkers above</a>, who can potentially engulf and kill your pet instantly. Pets are also vulnerable to polymorph traps, which in practice are as likely to turn them into a sessile <a href=\"/wiki/Mold\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mold\">mold</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Jelly\" title=\"Jelly\">jelly</a> as it is to turn them into something stronger.\n</p><p>If you are <a href=\"/wiki/Hallucinating\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hallucinating\">hallucinating</a>, try using the #chat command to figure out which of the strange beings around you is your pet. A less reliable option is to wait and see how the creature in question moves and whether or not it attacks you.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Equipment_for_pets\">Equipment for pets</span></h3>\n<p>The best way to equip a pet is to gather the desired items and leave them in a dead end, then stand on them until your pet comes near; swap places with the pet and keep them  standing over the pile until they picks up something and start using it. If a pet drops something they had been using, you will need to swap places again to pick up their old stuff. For replacing equipment, the best way to do that is in a 2-square long corridor with a locked door. As pets tend to avoid picking up items when you are nearby, this method may take a while; locking them in a closet will often be faster if you don't have any items to replace. Pets with high apport are more likely to pick up things if you are not within their sight - be sure the pet isn't carrying a key of its own.\n</p><p>If you want your pet to keep a specific artifact, give it to it while it is carrying as few objects as possible.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Armor_and_extrinsics\">Armor and extrinsics</span></h4>\n<p>A pet that can be armored should be given <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_cancellation\" title=\"Magic cancellation\">magic cancellation</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Reflection\" title=\"Reflection\">reflection</a>.

It is divided into two parts: the first consists of pets which a player might specifically work to obtain, for example through a wish or a polymorph trap. The second consists of pets that are useful (e.g. if you get them through a polytrap or magic trap), but not usually worth any extra effort to obtain.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Worth_the_effort_of_trying_to_obtain\">Worth the effort of trying to obtain</span></h4>\n<ul><li>The <a href=\"/wiki/Archon\" title=\"Archon\">Archon</a> is by general consensus the best all-around pet, with a high maximum level, powerful physical attacks, the ability to heal and haste itself, and its blinding gaze. They can fly, don't eat, and can wield weapons and wear some armor. Archons are rare to find and difficult to tame, however, and a hostile Archon is a dangerous foe to stand near as you repeatedly try to tame it. Monsters blinded by the Archon won't respect <a href=\"/wiki/Elbereth\" title=\"Elbereth\">Elbereth</a>, a possible concern for low-level characters. A \"blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Figurine\" title=\"Figurine\">figurine</a> of an Archon\" is a common first wish for <a href=\"/wiki/Pacifist\" title=\"Pacifist\">pacifists</a>, and is popular in general.  They cannot be obtained from a polytrap, and therefore must be wished for or found, and they never leave corpses to <a href=\"/wiki/Revive\" title=\"Revive\">revive</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Ki-rin\" title=\"Ki-rin\">Ki-rin</a> don't eat, can fly, and have superb attacks. In particular, it is noteworthy as it can take a saddle as well, making it an excellent mount, especially given that its high <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance_(monster)\" title=\"Magic resistance (monster)\">magic resistance</a> and base level will prevent it from bucking you if you are generating <a href=\"/wiki/Conflict\" title=\"Conflict\">conflict</a>. They are best for a <a href=\"/wiki/Knight\" title=\"Knight\">knight</a>, as it will irrevocably lose one point of <a href=\"/wiki/Tame\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tame\">tameness</a> each time a non-knight mounts it.  Like Archons, ki-rin are not found via polytraps and never leave corpses.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Titan\" title=\"Titan\">Titans</a> have excellent base level, armor class, and magic resistance, are fast, can <a href=\"/wiki/Monster_spell\" title=\"Monster spell\">spell-cast</a>, fly, wield a weapon, and wear non-body armor.  They are too large to be <a href=\"/wiki/Engulf\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Engulf\">engulfed</a>, and so won't be instantly killed by digesting monsters, a common cause of death for Archons and ki-rin. They do eat, which, though sometimes an inconvenience, does mean their <a href=\"/wiki/Tameness\" title=\"Tameness\">tameness</a> will increase.  Thus when you fall down a <a href=\"/wiki/Hole\" title=\"Hole\">shaft</a> that herd of pet Titans won't be wild by the time you find your way back. They can leave corpses to revive, and are large enough to always do so if their manner of death permits it. Titans can be obtained from a polymorph trap, and may be the strongest pet available by such means.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Purple_worm\" title=\"Purple worm\">Purple worms</a> of high enough level can swallow and thus instantly kill almost any enemy. A pet worm can be leveled up quickly by setting it loose in a <a href=\"/wiki/Graveyard\" title=\"Graveyard\">graveyard</a> containing <a href=\"/wiki/Wraith\" title=\"Wraith\">wraiths</a>. Their <a href=\"/wiki/Engulfing\" title=\"Engulfing\">engulfing</a> attack is not subject to corpse-leaving odds. However, that means you need to keep them away from <a href=\"/wiki/Chameleon\" title=\"Chameleon\">chameleons</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Doppelganger\" title=\"Doppelganger\">doppelgangers</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Green_slime\" title=\"Green slime\">green slime</a>, which will transform your pet into something less effective. Digested monsters don't leave corpses for you to eat, nor any special drops they otherwise would, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Unicorn_horn\" title=\"Unicorn horn\">unicorn horns</a>. Some powerful monsters such as Titans and dragons are too large to be engulfed.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Balrog\" title=\"Balrog\">Balrogs</a> have very powerful attacks, a high base level, and a good armor class. They're a valid polymorph form, making them more practical to acquire than Archons or ki-rin, and are <a href=\"/wiki/Inediate\" title=\"Inediate\">inediate</a>, so they'll be more available for combat than purple worms or Titans. Their base speed is fairly low.</li></ul>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nice_to_have_if_you_get_one\">Nice to have if you get one</span></h4>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Centaur_(monster_class)\" title=\"Centaur (monster class)\">Centaurs</a> can use weapons and some armor, may be saddled and ridden, and are easy to keep fed.

However, it's also incredibly dangerous to have as a pet.

'''pet''' is a tame [[monster]] that accompanies and assists [[you]] through the dungeon. By default, each character starts with a pet, and you can acquire many more through various methods. The [[tameness]] of a pet is affected by how well you care for it.\n\n{{todo|pet #chatting messages need to be linked from here. A pet equipment section is already present, but if possible could be expended with tips from a relevant [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/eb707f2f94de9105# rgrn thread]}}\n\n==Starting pet==\nEvery character enters the dungeon with a pet, unless the player has specifically set [[Options#pettype|pettype:none]] in their [[configuration file]]. If your role has a definite pet type in the table below, your pet will always be of that type; for other roles, it will either be the pet type you have configured, or a [[kitten]] or a [[little dog]] with equal probability. Note that only [[Knights]] can start with a [[pony]].\n\nThe pet will begin the game already [[call|named]] if you have set the [[Options#catname|catname]], [[Options#dogname|dogname]], or [[Options#horsename|horsename]] options in the configuration file; in addition, certain roles have built-in default pet names if you did not specify a name. Names of pets (and other critters) can be changed using the [[call]] or [[name]] commands.\n\n:{|class=\"prettytable\"\n!Role \n!Pet \n!Default name\n|-\n|[[Barbarian]]\n|&lt;random&gt;\n|Idefix (if [[little dog]])\n|-\n|[[Caveman]]\n|[[little dog]]\n|Slasher\n|-\n|[[Knight]]\n|[[pony]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Ranger]]\n|[[little dog]]\n|Sirius\n|-\n|[[Samurai]]\n|[[little dog]]\n|Hachi\n|-\n|[[Wizard]]\n|[[kitten]]\n|\n|}\n\n==Taming==\nIn addition to starting with one as above, there are other methods to obtain pets: most monster types can be tamed and made into pets with a [[scroll of taming]], [[magic harp]], or spell of {{spell of|charm monster}}.\n\n[[Domestic animal]]s (all growth stages of [[dog]], [[cat]], and [[horse]]) can be tamed by throwing certain types of [[food]] at them:\n* Dogs and cats can be tamed with \"people food\" - [[food ration]]s, [[pancake]]s, [[fortune cookie]]s, etc. - and meat such as [[tripe ration]]s, fresh meaty corpses that are not harmful, and items such as [[meatball]]s created with {{spell of|stone to flesh}}. [[Egg]]s can also be used, but they usually just break when thrown.\n* Horses can be tamed with fruits (including the user-specified custom fruit), vegetables, and most safe [[vegetarian]] corpses.\n* During a [[time|full moon]], dogs of any growth stage have a 5/6 chance of becoming [[peaceful]] instead of tame. Repeated attempts may still succeed.\n* Domestic animals can also be pacified by throwing food items at them that they will not eat, including tins or old corpses.\n\n===Spells, books and scrolls===\nThe spell of charm monster can be used to tame an adjacent monster, as can a non-cursed scroll of taming, subject to a check versus [[magic resistance (monster)|monster magic resistance]]; the scroll can also have its range extended by reading it while [[confused]]. The spell {{Spell of|create familiar}} will create a tame domestic animal ({{frac|3}} chance) or a tame random monster ({{frac|2|3}} chance, unless the randomly created monster is of an untameable type).\n\nWhen not standing on the [[vibrating square]], reading the blessed [[Book of the Dead]] can tame coaligned [[undead]] monsters and increases the tameness of those that are already pets.\n\n===Magic harps===\n[[Apply]]ing a magic harp with charges can tame monsters around you, with the range of the effect dependent on your experience level.\n\n===Djinni and wishes===\n[[Quaff]]ing a [[Smoky and milky potions|smoky]] [[potion]] or [[rub]]bing a [[magic lamp]] can summon a [[djinni]], which may randomly be tame. The odds of it being tame are never very high, though they are highest when the potion or lamp is uncursed. A released djinni that offers a [[wish]] can be used to obtain a desired pet, often in the form of a blessed [[#Figurine|figurine]] - certain pets can only be obtained easily in this way, if at all.\n\n===Figurines===\nMonster [[figurine]]s can be used to generate the monster depicted by the figurine. There is always a chance of the generated monster being tame, with the odds at their highest if the figurine is blessed. Figurines can bypass some [[#Restrictions |taming restrictions]], although a majority of such ineligible monsters cannot have figurines of them created in the first place.{{refsrc|mkobj.c|902|nethack=3.6.0|comment=Figurines follow normal monster generation, but with humans forbidden}}\n\n===Demon gating===\nWhile [[polymorph]]ed into any [[major demon]] other than a [[balrog]] or [[foocubus]], attacking in [[melee]] with your [[bare hands]] can [[Major demon#Summoning while polymorphed|gate in other demons]]. Demons gated this way have a {{frac|5|6}} of being the same type as your current form, and a {{frac|6}} chance of being any random demon of your alignment.\n\n===Eggs===\nIf a fresh monster [[egg]] hatches while being carried in open inventory, the baby monster may be generated tame. [[Dragon]] eggs and eggs laid by the player always hatch tame, as will 50% of any other eggs if the player character is [[male]]. The easiest way to get eggs of a given species is to become a female monster of that species and lay the eggs yourself.\n\n===Werecreatures===\nIf you are a [[werecreature]], you can use [[Monster (command)|#monster]] to summon your brethren for a cost of 10 [[Pw]]; their species is dependent on your were-species, and they will always arrive tame.\n\n===Traps===\nTwo [[trap]]s can actually aid in obtaining tamed monsters with their effects:\n\n* A [[magic trap]] will tame adjacent monsters with 4.8% probability whenever it gives you the [[charisma]]-raising effect. This effect does not check monster MR, so it can tame otherwise resistant monsters. However, magic traps also have a variety of effects, many of which are harmful, so be prepared to deal with them if you intend to gamble on the charisma effect.\n\n* The [[polymorph trap]] polymorphs most monsters that step on it, and already-tame monsters that are weak and/or low on HP will deliberately jump onto them. A [[leash]] can be used to guide pets onto them, and this can be used in conjunction with methods of generating more tame monsters (such as a [[gremlin]] multiplying in water or the werecreature form's #monster ability) to produce armies of high-quality pets.\n\n===The Astral Plane===\nYou will be given a tame 'guardian' [[Angel]] upon entering the [[Astral Plane]], unless you are generating [[conflict]] or badly [[Alignment record|aligned]]; the Angel will also disappear if you generate conflict at any point after entrance.\n\n==Restrictions==\nCertain monsters cannot be made tame no matter what you do; in most cases, they will be made [[peaceful]] instead. They are:\n\n* [[Quest nemesis|Quest nemeses]], [[Medusa]], and the [[Wizard of Yendor]], none of whom can even be made peaceful.\n* [[Human]]s (any {{mcsl|K}} or {{mcsl|@}} except [[elf (monster attribute)|elves]]); [[werecreature]]s can be tamed, but only while in creature form.\n* [[Shopkeeper]]s, [[guard]]s, [[aligned priest]]s, [[quest leader]]s, and the Wizard of Yendor can all be polymorphed or slimed, but will remember who they were, and still resist taming; at most, except for the Wizard they can be made peaceful.\n* [[Covetous]] monsters: [[Demon lords and princes]], [[Vlad the Impaler]], and [[lich|master- and arch-liches]].\n* Hostile [[minion]]s sent after you by an angry god.\n* Demons, unless you yourself are polymorphed into a demon.\n\nThese restrictions are only checked at the time the monster would be made tame; existing monsters changing to these forms (e.g. a demilich that grows up into a master lich, a werecreature reverting to human form) will not become untame. Notably, the [[Riders]] are not inherently untameable, though their 100 monster MR makes it very difficult; Famine and Pestilence can be [[level drain]]ed, which reduces their effective MR, although it may still take many attempts at taming before success. Death is immune to level drain, and so cannot be tamed.\n\nAlthough Vlad the Impaler is covetous in his base form, as a [[vampire]] he's capable of shapeshifting, and his transformations are non-covetous and tameable in principle. This requires significant resources and effort to accomplish; see the [[Vlad the Impaler#Taming Vlad|strategy]] section for details.\n\n==Pet diets==\n:''See also [[Diet#Pets]]''\nA freshly tamed pet's hunger starts out at 1000. For the three cardinal domestic species, the same appropriate foods that work for [[#Taming|taming]] also work for routine feeding are as for taming. Eggs are appropriate for feeding carnivorous and omnivorous pets like dogs and cats, but they should be dropped with the '''d''' command, not [[throw]]n; eggs that pets will not eat are probably [[cockatrice]] eggs, and should be #named and saved. Additionally, starving pets will eat some foods which they will not otherwise (e.g., starving horses will eat \"people food\" such as food rations).\n\nPets gain two to eight times as much nutrition as players from food (smaller ones gain more), but take the same time to eat it;{{refsrc|src/dogmove.c|160|nethack=3.6.7}} a pet that was just tamed with food will \"devour\" it, taking only half the normal time required to eat it, but also gaining only {{frac|3|4}} the nominal nutrition. Generally, your pets (especially the carnivorous ones) will feed themselves from the monsters they kill. Pets will never eat food that would cause them harm, unless they have the appropriate resistance (e.g., pets without [[poison resistance]] won't eat poisonous corpses).\n\nA pet that becomes [[hungry]] will reach \"starving\" status in 500 turns; a starving pet becomes confused and will have their maximum hit points divided by 3.{{refsrc|src/dogmove.c|355|nethack=3.6.7}} You can get an idea of whether a pet is [[hungry]] or not if you #[[chat]] with them frequently - in many cases (though not all), their vocalizations will change noticeably (e.g., a hungry dog \"barks\" while an otherwise content dog \"yips\".) Pet monsters that are [[inediate]] usually do not become hungry, but also cannot have their tameness increased through feeding them.\n\nPets can be trained to more reliably drop items near you by giving them [[treat]]s after they drop something; this willingness to 'fetch' is known as [[apport]].\n\n===Preferred foods===\nDepending on a pet's diet, the food it is  willing to eat falls into one of four categories:\n* Treats, which can be used to increase the pet's apport\n* Good food, which the pet will eat even when not hungry\n* Acceptable food, which the pet will eat only if hungry or starving\n* Emergency food, which the pet will eat only if starving\n\nThe following rules apply to the majority of pets:\n:{|class=\"prettytable\"\n!Class\n![[Carnivore]]\n![[Herbivore]]\n|-\n|Treat\n|\n* [[tripe ration]]s\n* items created by the spell of [[stone to flesh]]\n|\n* [[apple]]s\n* [[carrot]]s\n|-\n|Good\n|\n* meaty [[corpse]]s\n* [[egg]]s\n|\n* vegan corpses (any of {{white|b}} {{white|j}} {{white|F}})\n|-\n|Acceptable\n|\n* \"people food\"\n|\n* vegan non-corpse non-\"people\" comestibles\n|-\n|Emergency\n|\n* vegan non-corpse non-\"people\" comestibles\n|\n* \"people food\"\n|}\n\n\"People food\" includes:\n* [[food ration|food]], [[cram ration|cram]], [[C-ration|C]] and [[K-ration]]s\n* [[lembas wafer]]s\n* [[cream pie]]s\n* [[pancake]]s\n* [[candy bar]]s\n* [[fortune cookie]]s\n\nOmnivorous pets use the highest of the carnivorous and herbivorous rankings of a food item; e.g. apples, carrots, and tripe are all treats to them.\n\n===Diet exceptions===\nThe following are exceptions to the normal rules:\n\n* Pets won't eat anything that would harm them (e.g. poisonous, [[acid]]ic, or [[stoning]]-inducing) unless they have the appropriate resistance. They will also avoid eating \"old\" tainted corpses, with the exception of [[lizard]]s and [[lichen]]s (which never rot away).\n* Non-slimeproof pets will only consider a [[glob of green slime]] if they're starving.\n* [[Ghoul]]s are technically [[inediate]], but will eat old corpses and old eggs, and consider the former treats.\n* [[Banana]]s are treats to herbivorous and omnivorous {{mcsl|Y}}.\n* [[Carrot]]s are treats to [[blind]] carnivores, who will eat them to regain their sight.\n* [[Metallivore]]s consider non-[[rustproof]] [[iron]] items a treat, and other metal items are acceptable food; thus, only metallivores will eat [[tin]]s. A metallivore will not eat an [[amulet of strangulation]] or [[ring of slow digestion]], and throwing iron weapons at a metallivore is a bad idea, even if they would eat them afterward.\n* [[Gelatinous cube]]s consider organic non-food items acceptable.\n* [[Humanoid]]s other than [[ogre]]s, [[orc (monster attribute)|orc]]s, and [[kobold]]s will not commit [[cannibalism]] unless starving;[[Elf (monster attribute)|elves]] will not commit cannibalism even if starving.\n* None of the above pet types will eat your role's [[quest artifact]], any [[unique item]]s, or [[Rider]] corpses. Pets have a 95% chance of passing up other [[artifact]]s, assuming they would normally eat the base item.\n\n==Pet behavior==\nPets will very generally try to stay close to your position, though they are prone to wandering off; a pet with more [[speed]] is usually (though not always) better at keeping up with you. Carrying food that a pet considers a treat (e.g. tripe rations) will cause them to follow you more closely. All tamed monsters will [[follow]] you up and down [[stairway]]s and through [[portal]]s if they are adjacent to you when you enter, unless they cannot move or are in the middle of an action (e.g. eating).\n\n===Cursed items===\nPets tend to avoid squares where a cursed item is present. If a pet does enter such a square, the message displayed is \"<pet> steps reluctantly over a(n) <item>\". Note that the item listed is ''not'' necessarily the cursed item -- it's whatever item happens to be \"on top\" of the square.\n\nThis message is not displayed if you displace the pet onto the square, or if there's food on the square that the pet wants to eat. Divine minion pets are not bothered by cursed items.{{refsrc|dogmove.c|671}}\n\n===Traps===\nPets will also try to avoid known traps where possible. If leashed, a pet may \"whine\" or \"whimper\" to indicate that a trap is near, even if it hasn't been detected yet.\n\n===Movement===\nApplying a [[tin whistle]] or a [[bell]] can cause them to seek you out and stay close for a certain amount of turns; a [[magic whistle]] will warp them immediately to your side. Applying a [[leash]] to a pet will keep them closer to you, though it alters and limits their movement as well: leashed pets can end up stuck around corners depending on where you and the pet move. Leashed pets will also move reluctantly over cursed items more often, and will whine if they sense a trap is nearby (though they still risk walking into the trap themselves). A leashed pet that can move always follows you when you travel via stairs or a portal, even if they are not adjacent to you.\n\n====Displacing a pet====\nIf you try to walk on a pet's square, you have a {{frac|6|7}} chance of displacing it and switching places unless you are punished, in a [[shop]], or the pet is a [[long worm]].{{refsrc|uhitm.c|318}} If you fail to displace your pet ({{frac|7}}), then the pet will become [[Scare#Methods|scared]] for 1-6 turns. If the pet cannot move, but you otherwise would swap places, you have a {{frac|6}} chance of swapping places anyway.{{refsrc|uhitm.c|338}}\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|It is no longer possible to displace a pet out of a trap, directly onto a trap, into water or into other hazardous terrain. It is also no longer possible to displace a sleeping or paralysed pet, but a sessile pet can sometimes be displaced. It may be possible to displace a pet near a trap, causing it to move onto the trap.}}\n\n===Combat===\nUnless confused, pets will generally only attack monsters that are not you, a [[quest leader]], a [[quest guardian]], or another pet.{{refsrc|dogmove.c|624}} In addition, they will also avoid attacking monsters that are at least two levels higher than they are.{{refsrc|dogmove.c|616}} A pet will not attack peaceful monsters if they are below 25% of their maximum HP.{{refsrc|dogmove.c|622}}\n\nA pet will not attack a [[floating eye]] 90% of the time, provided the pet can see; it will also avoid attacking a [[gelatinous cube]] 90% of the time.{{refsrc|dogmove.c|617}}{{refsrc|dogmove.c|620}} Pets will additionally avoid attacking monsters whose maximum passive damage exceeds their current hit points.{{refsrc|dogmove.c|621}} A pet will not attack a monster who can turn them to stone if the pet is not stoning-resistant.{{refsrc|dogmove.c|627}} [[Conflict]] overrides all of these restrictions and will cause a pet to attack any nearby monster (or you), subject to a check versus monster magic resistance.\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Pets are now more careful about attacking higher-level monsters, compared to their own level, as their own health drops. Pets will not attack a monster above a certain level, as described in the table below; note that a healthy pet can now attack monsters 2 levels higher.}}\n\n{|class=\"prettytable\"\n! Pet's HP !! Maximum level (from 3.7.0)\n|-\n| Full health || Pet's level + 2\n|-\n| At least 80% of maximum || Pet's level + 1\n|-\n| At least 60% of maximum || Pet's level\n|-\n| At least 40% of maximum || Pet's level – 1\n|-\n| At least 20% of maximum || Pet's level – 2\n|-\n| Below 20% of maximum || Pet's level – 3 <ref>Pets still will not attack peaceful monsters if below 25% health. This contradicts a comment in the source code implying the peaceful-monster check applies to all monsters.</ref>\n|}\n\n===Abuse and death===\n{{main|Tameness#Abuse}}\nIn general, abusing your pet involves attacking it in any form, even if you were [[confused]], [[stun]]ned or otherwise impaired. Killing your pet outright carries a &minus;15 penalty to [[alignment record]] and &minus;1 [[Luck]] penalty{{refsrc|src/mon.c|2474|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/mon.c|2505|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} - displacing your pet in a manner that causes its immediate death (i.e., into a trap or [[pool]] of water) carries a &minus;15 penalty and [[anger]]s your [[god]].\n\nIf your pet died and left a corpse, you can try to resurrect it using a [[Wand of undead turning|wand]] or spell of [[turn undead]]; a [[scroll of food detection]] or the spell of {{spell of|detect food}} can be used to locate your pet's corpse before it rots away. If it was turned to stone, you can try the spell of {{spell of|stone to flesh}}.\n\nPets that are revived or saved by an amulet of life saving are not guaranteed to revive tame - if you killed the pet yourself or [[Abuse (pet)|abused]] it at least three times, it will never revive tame and has only a 1-in-(times abused) chance of being peaceful; if you abused it at least ten times, it will always revive as hostile.<ref>{{sourceref|wary_dog}}</ref> If you didn't kill your pet and abused it at most twice, its tameness becomes a random number between zero and its prior tameness, with equal probability; if this new number is zero, the pet is no longer tame, but it still has a 50% chance of being peaceful. A pet that remains tame after being revived, or else is re-tamed manually, retains its tameness value and has its nutrition, abuse and apport reset as though it was a brand new pet.\n\nAttempting to [[sacrifice]] the corpse of a pet that died while it was tame at an altar will anger that altar's god - doing the same at a cross-aligned altar will actually ''reduce'' your own god's anger. A pet that went feral or was otherwise untamed prior to dying is suitable to sacrifice.\n\nThere is no special penalty for abandoning or losing track of pets, eating your pets' corpses or (surprisingly)  [[genocide|genociding]] your pet's species or class. Keep in mind that the normal effects of corpses of the pets' species still apply, such as [[cannibalism]] or [[aggravate monster]] from [[cat]] and [[dog]] corpses.\n\n==Pet growth==\nLike [[you]], pets level up by defeating monsters. However, while your character gains experience points that build towards new experience level, the pets gain a random number of [[hit point]]s between one and the defeated monster's level plus one, and their level is increased to roughly match their maximum hit point total.{{refsrc|makemon.c|1775|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} A pet's health, level and status can be monitored via a [[stethoscope]] or a [[wand of probing]].\n\nThe maximum HP threshold for most monsters is 8 times their current level (or 4 for level 0), with the exception of [[golem]]s and [[elemental]]s on their home [[Elemental Plane]]. The maximum level for a monster is {{frac|3|2}} of that monster's base level, or the next type if that monster has a more \"grown up\" form; said maximum will normally be no greater than 49.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1700|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}\n\nSee [[growing up]] for more details about pet advancement.\n\n==Pets and equipment==\n{{main|Armor#Monsters, pets, and armor}}\nTamed [[intelligent]] monsters that have hands can use items they pick up, and humanoid ones can wear and even replace [[armor]]. They will also use other items such as [[potion]]s, [[scroll]]s and even certain [[tool]]s. As mentioned above, pets will not pick up cursed items, and will avoid moving onto them where possible; silver-hating pets will always avoid touching silver items.{{refsrc|dog.c|722}}\n\nIntelligent pets will quaff or throw various potions if they pick one up; for example, they can quaff a potion of {{of|potion|healing|or=1|extra healing}} if low on HP, and will throw harmful potions such as {{of|potion|acid|or=1|sleeping}} at other monsters.\n\n===Weapons and armor===\nOnly [[medium]]-sized monsters can wear body armor or [[shirt]]s, and only medium or smaller monsters will fit into cloaks. All monsters know the enchantment of armor, and will replace a worn piece of armor with one that gives more AC, regardless of any other properties conveyed - e.g., a +3 [[small shield]] takes priority over a +0 [[shield of reflection]].{{refsrc|worn.c|463}}{{refsrc|hack.h|284}}\n\nPets with a weapon attack will pick up and wield weapons, and select which one to wield based on type. They prefer (in this order): any usable artifact weapon, cockatrice or chickatrice corpse, ''tsurugi'', runesword, ''dwarvish mattock'', ''two-handed sword'', ''battle-axe'', katana, ''unicorn horn'', crysknife, trident, long sword, elven broadsword, broadsword, scimitar, silver saber, morning star, elven short sword, dwarvish short sword, short sword, orcish short sword, mace, axe, dwarvish spear, silver spear, elven spear, spear, orcish spear, flail, bullwhip, ''quarterstaff'', javelin, aklys, club, pick-axe, rubber hose, war hammer, silver dagger, elven dagger, dagger, orcish dagger, athame, scalpel, knife, worm tooth.{{refsrc|src/weapon.c|638|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} (Weapons in italics are two-handed, and will be chosen only if the monster is [[strong]] and is not wearing a shield. A cockatrice corpse will not be chosen if it would immediately stone the monster. Stilettos and grappling hooks will never be chosen.)\n\nIf a monster has a wielded artifact weapon and picks up another one, it can switch to the new artifact and drop the old one, provided the new artifact is not cross-aligned and the conditions for two-handed weapons are met (if applicable). (\"Can\" here means the first admissible artifact in the game's internal list of carried objects is chosen.) \n\nPets can also make use of [[ranged weapon]]s if they come across any, and will also use their [[breath weapon]] if they have one.{{refsrc|src/dogmove.c|1118|nethack=3.6.1|name=ranged_pet_attack}}\n\n===Tools and other items===\nSome pets can carry around a [[unicorn horn]] to apply if afflicted with a status condition, or a [[key]] to unlock doors with. Some pets can also put on amulets of {{of|amulet|life saving|or=1|reflection}}; they have no preference in this regard. A [[nonliving]] monster that ends up wearing an amulet of life saving (typically due to being polymorphed from the form they put it on with) will not use up the amulet if they die.\n\n==Steeds==\n{{main|Riding}}\nCertain pets can serve as steeds for your character if they have a [[saddle]] placed on them. Mounting a steed reduces their tameness, making it imperative to treat them well and keep them fed where possible.\n\n==Strategy==\nFrom a general outlook, having a tamed monster by your side can serve several useful purposes - they can help kill hostile monsters, [[Curse-testing#Pet testing|detect cursed items]], and even aid in [[stealing from shops]] without angering the [[shopkeeper]]. A pet can also kill a peaceful monster that you want a particular item from, such as a [[Dwarf (monster)|dwarf's]] [[pick-axe]], without any penalties - you are not considered responsible for monsters that your pet kills. Pets can also enlighten newer players to certain aspects of the game, such as which corpses are (mostly) safe to eat and which monsters are safe to attack in melee.\n\nHowever, pets can also be a hassle to manage. If strong enough, they will attack peaceful monsters, such as [[aligned priest]]s, that you want to keep alive; pets on the weaker side that are left to constantly pick fights may eventually end up killed. Additionally, unless given stealth in some manner they will wake up nearby monsters, particularly [[nymph]]s and [[leprechaun]]s, that you would rather leave asleep. Pets can also snatch up corpses you were hoping to eat and get in the way of vital spells, wand shots or [[ranged attack]]s. The more pets you have, the more tedious it becomes to keep them with you, and the more the above problems multiply - though a [[magic whistle]] can alleviate many of them.\n\nOne particular \"quirk\" with regards to pets is the relative weakness of most starting pets - [[falling rock trap]]s and [[pit]]s are enough to immediately kill an unfortunate kitten or little dog, and spectacularly unfortunate players may see them die to a [[gecko]] or [[jackal]]. Players invested in their pet's survival may consider letting them finish off weak monsters like [[grid bug]]s or [[newt]]s to quickly gain levels early on, so that it can become strong enough to survive the traps and encounters in the lower dungeon levels.\n\nAnother important factor to remember is that pets only provide clues to ''non-fatal'' corpses and ''noncursed'' objects. This is generally more relevant to understanding the difference between \"not cursed\" and \"safe to use-test\" - the helmet your dog walked over with no trouble might be a [[dunce cap]] or [[helm of opposite alignment]].\n\n===Feeding pets===\nCarnivorous pets are easy to feed, to the point that you have to prevent them from stealing corpses you want to eat; conversely, herbivorous pets are somewhat trickier to feed due to the relative lack of safe pet-friendly foodstuffs, and are more likely to become confused from hunger as a result. [[Tree]]s such as the ones in most variants of [[Minetown]] can drop several fruits and vegetarian food items if kicked, though there is the risk of attracting [[killer bee]]s or (in Minetown's case) angering the [[Watch]]; it is also possible to create them by [[polypiling]] comestibles.\n\nFor horse owners in particular, a common trick usually employed by Knights is to allow the horse to reach starving levels of hunger, then leave the level for a while, and re-enter to toss the now-wild horse a treat, resetting its nutrition and tameness. Non-knights with a horse (or other steed that can be re-tamed this way) can instead opt to mount and dismount their steed repeatedly untill it un-tames.\n\nAn inediate pet does not have to eat, but also cannot have its tameness increased with food; this makes inediate pets harder to keep tame, especially if you or they have the misfortune to step on a level-changing trap. Losing a [[vampire lord]] or [[Archon]] to a [[level teleport]]er is a terrible happenstance, not least because they will use whatever kit they were given against you.\n\n===Caring for pets===\nAs pets are at their most vulnerable during their weaker stages, [[Trap#Strategy|trap detection]] is a especially useful skill to hone in order to protect them. Actively leading your pet(s) rather then letting them \"lead\" you makes it easier to provide a clear path for it, whether or not you use them to detect traps - even stronger pets can be \"threatened\" by an inopportune [[trap door]] if it separates you from them long enough for the pet(s) to become hostile. For other non-relocating traps such as pits and [[bear trap]]s, you want to #[[untrap]] the pet as soon as possible; be warned that unsuccessfully attempting to remove a bear trap will injure your pet, and if done repeatedly may kill it. When untrapping pets, make sure there is a safe square for them to access.\n\nObtaining [[telepathy]] as soon as possible is an ideal goal for most pet owners in order to avoid abusing or killing them while [[blind]]ed. Telepathy is also ideal to spot and eliminate digesting monsters such as [[purple worm]]s, [[trapper]]s and [[lurkers above]], who can potentially engulf and kill your pet instantly. Pets are also vulnerable to polymorph traps, which in practice are as likely to turn them into a sessile [[mold]] or [[jelly]] as it is to turn them into something stronger.\n\nIf you are [[hallucinating]], try using the #chat command to figure out which of the strange beings around you is your pet. A less reliable option is to wait and see how the creature in question moves and whether or not it attacks you.\n\n===Equipment for pets===\nThe best way to equip a pet is to gather the desired items and leave them in a dead end, then stand on them until your pet comes near; swap places with the pet and keep them  standing over the pile until they picks up something and start using it. If a pet drops something they had been using, you will need to swap places again to pick up their old stuff. For replacing equipment, the best way to do that is in a 2-square long corridor with a locked door. As pets tend to avoid picking up items when you are nearby, this method may take a while; locking them in a closet will often be faster if you don't have any items to replace. Pets with high apport are more likely to pick up things if you are not within their sight - be sure the pet isn't carrying a key of its own.\n\nIf you want your pet to keep a specific artifact, give it to it while it is carrying as few objects as possible.\n\n====Armor and extrinsics====\nA pet that can be armored should be given [[magic resistance]], [[magic cancellation]], and [[reflection]]. All items that work for the player also work for monsters that can wear them, with some notes and exceptions:\n\n* [[Speed boots]] make monsters fast, but not very fast.\n* An [[alchemy smock]] confers only [[poison resistance]].\n* Monster spellcasting is not hindered by metal armor.\n* [[Dragon scales]] and [[dragon scale mail]] provide their extrinsics as usual, other armor properties than those discussed do not affect monsters.\n\nAfter deciding what extrinsics you can give your pet, the rest of their armor selection should be focused on improving AC.\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Pets can gain fire, cold, shock, sleep, poison, and disintegration resistances by eating corpses. This makes reflection a less crucial property, although death rays are still an issue, and puts inediate pets at a relative disadvantage.}}\n\n===Equipment for pet owners===\nThere is a lot of equipment that can make pets more useful or make keeping them close easier.\n\n* Magic whistles will bring all pets to as close to the player as possible. [[Eucalyptus leaf|Eucalyptus leaves]] will act like magic whistles if blessed. A tin whistle is a fine substitute if neither is available.\n* Stethoscopes will reveal information about your pet, including how injured it is, its level, and its maximum HP. Wands of probing will also give you this information and any equipment the pet is wearing, but they are less efficient due to their limited number of charges.\n* Leashes will keep pets nearby.\n* Saddles can be used to ride some pets. [[Randomized appearance#Gloves|Riding gloves and boots]] will make applying a saddle easier.\n* Carried treats will cause pets to stay close to the player; this can be annoying if they're always underfoot.\n* Spells of (extra) healing for healing pets, charm monster for acquiring new pets, stone to flesh for making treats for carnivores and omnivores.\n* The wand or spell of undead turning and the spell of stone to flesh can revive pets; they may revive hostile.\n* The spell of {{spell of|detect monsters}} and/or [[potion of monster detection]] to locate pets.\n* The wand of speed monster or [[potion of speed|potions of speed]] to make pets fast.\n* Potions of healing, extra healing, full healing, restore ability, and gain ability will all restore a monster to full hit points if it hits them (wielded or thrown). Hitting a pet with a wielded potion counts as abuse, however.\n* Potions of unholy water will heal 2&ndash;12 HP for demons, undead, and lycanthropes.\n* A key to lock your pet in a room or closet, so it can heal, or equip itself, or to have it not attack something you want kept alive. Some pets may be smart enough to pick up keys and unlock doors.\n* A [[blindfold]] or [[towel]] if you have [[telepathy]] to locate your pets.\n* A [[bag of holding]] (or a sack) is useful to carry all the other stuff and pet food, keep treats hidden, and to [[Stealing from shops|rob shops]].\n* [[Crystal ball]]s, including the [[Orb of Fate]] and the [[Orb of Detection]], can be used for detecting traps that could harm pets, and can be recharged indefinitely with [[the Platinum Yendorian Express Card]]; crystal balls are rather heavy to carry, however.\n\n===Preferred pets===\n<!--Split into its own article?-->\nThe following is a list of monsters that make good pets.  It is divided into two parts: the first consists of pets which a player might specifically work to obtain, for example through a wish or a polymorph trap. The second consists of pets that are useful (e.g. if you get them through a polytrap or magic trap), but not usually worth any extra effort to obtain.\n\n====Worth the effort of trying to obtain====\n* The [[Archon]] is by general consensus the best all-around pet, with a high maximum level, powerful physical attacks, the ability to heal and haste itself, and its blinding gaze. They can fly, don't eat, and can wield weapons and wear some armor. Archons are rare to find and difficult to tame, however, and a hostile Archon is a dangerous foe to stand near as you repeatedly try to tame it. Monsters blinded by the Archon won't respect [[Elbereth]], a possible concern for low-level characters. A \"blessed [[figurine]] of an Archon\" is a common first wish for [[pacifist]]s, and is popular in general.  They cannot be obtained from a polytrap, and therefore must be wished for or found, and they never leave corpses to [[revive]].\n* [[Ki-rin]] don't eat, can fly, and have superb attacks. In particular, it is noteworthy as it can take a saddle as well, making it an excellent mount, especially given that its high [[Magic resistance (monster)|magic resistance]] and base level will prevent it from bucking you if you are generating [[conflict]]. They are best for a [[knight]], as it will irrevocably lose one point of [[tame]]ness each time a non-knight mounts it.  Like Archons, ki-rin are not found via polytraps and never leave corpses.\n* [[Titan]]s have excellent base level, armor class, and magic resistance, are fast, can [[Monster spell|spell-cast]], fly, wield a weapon, and wear non-body armor.  They are too large to be [[engulf]]ed, and so won't be instantly killed by digesting monsters, a common cause of death for Archons and ki-rin. They do eat, which, though sometimes an inconvenience, does mean their [[tameness]] will increase.  Thus when you fall down a [[Hole|shaft]] that herd of pet Titans won't be wild by the time you find your way back. They can leave corpses to revive, and are large enough to always do so if their manner of death permits it. Titans can be obtained from a polymorph trap, and may be the strongest pet available by such means.\n* [[Purple worm]]s of high enough level can swallow and thus instantly kill almost any enemy. A pet worm can be leveled up quickly by setting it loose in a [[graveyard]] containing [[wraith]]s. Their [[engulfing]] attack is not subject to corpse-leaving odds. However, that means you need to keep them away from [[chameleon]]s, [[doppelganger]]s, and [[green slime]], which will transform your pet into something less effective. Digested monsters don't leave corpses for you to eat, nor any special drops they otherwise would, such as [[unicorn horn]]s. Some powerful monsters such as Titans and dragons are too large to be engulfed.\n* [[Balrog]]s have very powerful attacks, a high base level, and a good armor class. They're a valid polymorph form, making them more practical to acquire than Archons or ki-rin, and are [[inediate]], so they'll be more available for combat than purple worms or Titans. Their base speed is fairly low.\n\n====Nice to have if you get one====\n* [[Centaur (monster class)|Centaurs]] can use weapons and some armor, may be saddled and ridden, and are easy to keep fed. These are potentially excellent early pets for heroes with a [[scroll of taming]] or reliable access to the {{Spell of|charm monster}} spell.\n* [[Cockatrice]]s can petrify many foes. They don't have much HP, however, and their low maximum level will prevent them from attacking tougher monsters. Consider using [[conflict]] to force your pet 'trice into combat (and watch your messages to be sure you aren't [[stoning|turning to stone]]).\n* [[Dragon]]s can fly, can serve as a mount, and have very good attacks. Silver and gray dragons are immune to [[death ray]]s; the former is also immune to disintegration blasts, while the latter is immune to polymorph traps. Yellow dragons are stoning-resistant. In [[3.6.0]] and older versions, they only used their [[breath weapon]]s in the presence of [[conflict]], and then only in your direction; as of [[3.6.1]], pets are allowed to use a breath or spit weapon against hostile monsters.<ref name='ranged_pet_attack' />  Pet dragons can be obtained by [[polymorphing]] yourself and laying eggs; eggs hatch into baby dragons which can [[grow up]] to full size.\n* [[Winged gargoyle]]s can fly and also have decent [[AC]] and attacks; in addition, they are resistant to [[stoning]] and starvation.  Winged gargoyles are very hard to get by egg-laying; most winged gargoyle eggs hatch into regular gargoyles, and gargoyles do not grow up to winged gargoyles.\n* [[Jabberwock]]s, especially [[wand of speed monster|hasted]], have excellent damage potential, and can fly and take a saddle. They lack resistances, though, and are thus vulnerable to being lost to traps, death or disintegration rays, and cockatrices.\n* Arch-[[lich]]es can reach terrifyingly high levels, are always by your side even without the aid of a [[magic whistle]], can heal themselves, and have a powerful freezing touch attack. They are impotent against cold-resistant monsters, however, and frequently get in your way.  Since they will always teleport to your side, it can be very difficult to prevent them from killing [[aligned priest|priest]]s and [[shopkeeper]]s. You cannot tame master- or arch-liches directly, but you can tame a lich or demilich and let it grow up.\n* A [[mastodon]] can substitute for a jabberwock as a pet. It has the same speed, and they have higher maximum level (30), which means more HP and being aggressive against more difficult enemies. Mastodons do in 8d8 damage instead of the jabberwock's 8d10, but that's still quite a lot. They're herbivores, so you can eat most of corpses they leave behind.\n* [[Mind flayer]]s do a lot of melee damage with their tentacle attacks, and can clear out monsters from a distance with their psychic blasts, which won't damage you as long as the flayer isn't hostile. A confused pet flayer could be disastrous, however, so make sure it has a [[unicorn horn]]. A psychic blast could also wake the [[Wizard of Yendor]] before you're ready to deal with him. Their very large number of attacks per turn also make them very weak to [[passive attack]]s&mdash;keep them away from [[jellies]]!\n* [[Minotaur]]s are fast, hit very hard, and are guaranteed to appear on a maze-type level. They have 0 [[MR]], so a [[scroll of taming]] is guaranteed to snare one on the first try (the [[spellbook of charm monster|spell of charm monster]] is of course dependent on your casting success rate).\n* [[Skeleton]]s don't breathe, don't eat, slow monsters, wield weapons, and will resist cold, sleep, poison, petrification, and wands and fingers of death.  They are not randomly generated, but can be found in [[Orcus-town]] or produced by a polytrap or by polypiling unihorns.\n* [[Troll]]s have good physical attacks, and if killed may revive tame. They may also revive hostile, however, so be careful. Make sure your other pets don't eat your former pet's corpse.\n* [[Vampire]]s and [[vampire lord]]s don't breathe or eat, can fly, can wield all weapons and armor, and will regenerate. They are also immune to [[finger of death|death rays]]. But in 3.6 vampires now spontaneously turn into fog clouds, wolves, and—especially—vampire bats and remain in that form unless defeated in battle. Wolves and vampire bats do eat (and move fast enough to steal corpses from you) but they are nearly useless in battle compared to vampires. You can keep a vampire pet in its true form with a [[ring of protection from shape changers]]. In addition, protection from shape changers is necessary to permanently change the form of a vampire or vampire lord - without it, polymorphing them will just result in them taking their vampire bat form, which can change again as normal.\n\n==Messages==\n===Death===\nThere are a number of subtly different messages associated with the death of a pet.\n\n{{message|You hear the rumble of distant thunder...|You killed it yourself. Penalty &minus;15 alignment and &minus;1 Luck.}}\n{{message|You hear the studio audience applaud!|As above while hallucinating.}}\n{{message|You feel guilty about losing your pet like this.|You displaced it causing it to drown or die.

It becomes confused from hunger, its maximum HP is reduced to 25%, and it has 250 more turns to live.{{refsrc|dogmove.c|235}}}}\n{{message|You feel worried about your &lt;pet&gt;.|As above, but your pet is out of sight.}}\n\n==Variants==\n===SLASH'EM===\n{{main|Pet (SLASH'EM)}}\n\n[[SLASH'EM]] makes various changes to the pet-keeping system, adding god-granted minions as well as pets that can turn [[traitor]]; pets and other monsters in SLASH'EM that are polymorphed will also eventually return to their normal form upon being killed or after a certain amount of turns, much like the player would.<!--http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/pets2.html spoiler-->\n\n===GruntHack===\nIn [[GruntHack]], hostile monsters will aggressively seek out your pets to attack them - this makes it much harder to keep early pets in particular alive. GruntHack also uses the same rules for polymorphing non-player monsters as SLASH'EM: polymorphed pets return to normal when they die or the polyform expires.\n\n===AceHack===\n[[AceHack]] implements ranged combat for pets; however, they currently die much faster than in vanilla, as monsters are more aggressive toward them. (This is planned to be fixed before release.)\n\n===dNetHack===\n[[dNetHack]] implements several changes and improvements for pets.<!--should probably get its own article.-->\n\n* Ranged combat and spellcasting is enabled for pets.\n* Pets and hostile monsters will more actively seek out and attack each other.\n* The total number of pets on the current dungeon level is limited to {{frac|3}} the character's [[charisma]] score. If this limit is exceeded, the lowest-level pets will quickly untame, typically returning to the same status (peaceful or hostile) as they were before they were tamed.\n** Some pets do not count towards this limit and will not untame: loyal pets, temporary summons, temporarily tamed (\"friendly\") pets, and \"suicidal\" monsters (monsters whose attacks require killing themselves).\n** \"Loyal\" pets also won't lose tameness from being left on other dungeon levels.\n** If two pets have the same current level, then the tiebreakers, in order, are [[tameness]], species maximum level, and species [[monster difficulty]].\n** Whenever a pet gains max HP (by killing a monster), it has a chance to decide to stay peaceful if it later untames, even if it was hostile before it was tamed. This chance depends on your beast mastery skill (see below) and your charisma.\n** Monsters that are tamed by certain methods will always remain peaceful if they untame: monsters that decided to become tame on their own, monsters that were tamed by music (including [[Insight#Living doll merchants|dolls of friendship]]), and starting pets.\n** Pets on other dungeon levels don't count towards the limit and won't untame.\n* {{spell of|Charm monster}} and [[scroll of taming|scrolls of taming]] are now single-target spells.\n* The character can now take any item from a pet using the #[[loot]] command, and may equip pets with armor using the #equip command.\n** Armor now has an intrinsic size. Most pieces of armor must be the same size and the creature you want to wear the armor. Armor of unspecified size is Medium (human) sized.\n*** Most armor found randomly in the dungeon is sized for humans.\n** Body armor and helms also have an intrinsic shape.\n*** Most armor and helms found randomly in the dungeon are shaped for humanoids (no modifier displayed).\n*** Barded armor fits roughly animal-shaped creatures, such as dogs, cats, horses, lizards, and spiders.\n*** Barded helms fit creatures with long heads, such as dogs, cats, horses, lizards, and snakes.\n*** Segmented armor fits roughly-snake shaped creatures, mostly snakes and most nagas.\n*** Snakeneck helms fit creatures with snake-like heads and necks attached to non-snake bodies. Examples are serpent men of Yoth, serpent-necked lionesses, bandersnatches, and jabberwocks.\n*** Centaur armor fits creatures with humanoid torsos attached to roughly animal-shaped lower bodies, which includes proper centaurs as well as driders (sprow, however, have humanoid bodies).\n*** Snakeleg armor fits creatures with humanoid torsos attached to serpentine lower bodies.  Examples include mariliths, salamanders, and ancient nagas.\n*** Snakeback armor fits creatures with combined serpentine and animal-like body plan.  [[Deep Wyrm]]s and [[Deep Wyrmling]]s are the only such creatures.\n* A new skill, beast mastery, is implemented. Higher skill improves pets' AC and increases their chances to-hit in combat. It also increases the range from which pets will follow you when going up or downstairs. The skill is trained by witnessing your pets engaging in combat. Convicts, droven priests, dwarven nobles and wizards can get basic beast mastery, knights, elven, droven nobles and tourist can get skilled, and healers, troubadours, nobles and rangers can get expert.\n* Two new commands, #wait and #come allows you to tell a pet to stay on the current level or follow you between levels as normal. These are useful if you want to have a pet not follow you but find it difficult to do so because of the increased follow range due to high beast mastery skill.\n* Several 'storage' levels are implemented; pets left there won't lose tameness from being away from the player, even if they don't have the \"loyal\" tag. These include the first level of Sokoban and the first level of dNethack's Neutral Quest branch, and possibly others.\n{{todo|List the other effects of pets being loyal. There are some levels where pets don't lose tameness (or get hungry?) while you're off-level - list those levels.}}\n\n==== dNetHack preferred pets ====\n\n* If wishing for a pet, the strongest non-unique angels are the best candidates.\n** The counterpart of the vanilla Archon is the [[Throne Archon]], a high-damage spellcaster that favors the lightning bolt spell and can buff itself. Its large size makes it harder to find equipment for.\n** A [[Light Archon]] fires volleys of 3 (magically created) silver arrows for high potential damage against demons.  Its large size makes it harder to find equipment for.\n** A [[Surya Deva]] frequently casts ''mass cure'', healing all nearby peaceful monsters as well as the player.  Independent dancing blade means it can attack multiple targets per turn. It also casts ''fire pillar'' and fires (magically created) +57 phasing silver arrows. Its large size makes it harder to find equipment for, and each component of the Surya has a lower damage output than other choices. Fire damage is less useful than lightning.\n** A [[Mahadeva]] deals very high single-target melee damage and has the highest base level (30). However, it's also incredibly dangerous to have as a pet. Its weapon attack will make repeated attacks until it finally misses, and conventional wisdom would be to give it gauntlets of dexterity maybe and a weapon with good to-hit. This is a really awful idea. If the Mahadeva gets [[confused]] you can very easily find yourself dead in a single turn unless you've got excellent AC (as in, \"good even for end-game AC\"). If you do, be careful to stay at range from your pet whenever possible.\n** A [[Tulani Eladrin]] casts cold, shock, and fire damage spells, and its medium size means you can easily find and enchant a full set of armor for it. However, it can catch the player in fireball explosions. It has a lower base level (18) and chooses spells randomly, so damage drops off against targets with resistances. It only uses one weapon attack per turn, unless it is level 30.\n** An [[Ara Kamerel]] comes with a [[Kamerel Vajra]] and casts [[open wounds]] in combat, resulting in high single-target damage. It resists shock damage, acid damage, sleep, poison, magic, petrification, and has intrinsic reflection. It reincarnates using gold golems, though it reverts to level 15 in the process. Its large size makes it harder to find equipment for, and its speed of 9 is rather slow. It can be permanently killed by some enemies.\n** An [[ancient of death]] inhales life and exhales death once per round, and is able to affect enemies through walls. However, its speed of 4 is very slow.\n** An [[ancient of ice]] is a less useful version of the ancient of death, since more targets resist fire and ice.\n* If searching the dungeon for endgame-capable pets:\n** Lady [[Oona]] has a decent base level (20), and her medium size means you can easily find and enchant equipment for her.  She can wield weapons and casts a strong elemental damage spell. However, she is slow (speed 9), and her elemental damage spell is either fire, lightning, or cold, chosen randomly at the start of the game.\n** [[Medusa]] has a decent base level (20), and her medium size means you can easily find and enchant equipment for her, though her snake-like lower body does complicate matters. She can wield weapons and has numerous natural attacks. She constantly petrifies anything able to see her, though MC3 armor will block this effect.\n** [[Grue]] has a decent base level (20) and is very fast in the dark, with very high damage. It has a digestion attack and can be ridden. Its nonstandard body-type makes it unable to equip most types of armor, however. It can sometimes get itself killed by using its digestion attack.\n** A strong [[Darkness_given_hunger|Darkness given hunger]] can be a surprisingly effective pet in the end game, particularly for players with a high pet cap, as enemy monsters with iron weapons will constantly divide your pet to create a small army around you. You will most likely want a means of mass healing your pets to keep them in good condition, such as the [[Bard|Troubadour]]'s Meditative Healing song or the mass healing spell, and you will also need a ring of slow digestion to ward off engulfing attacks from any confused pets or pets that turn on you as pudding division causes you to exceed your pet cap.\n\n===FIQHack===\nIn [[FIQHack]], pets actively seek out hostile monsters to pursue. Applying a tin whistle will temporarily disable this behavior.\n\nWhen considering what equipment to wear, you can throw items to intelligent, non-paralyzed pets to force them to pick them up. Pets will prefer items thrown at them over anything else - the more recently thrown, the better.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Apport]] &ndash; a measure of a pet's willingness to fetch items\n* [[Tameness]] &ndash; a measure of a pet's loyalty to its owner\n* [[Growing up]] &ndash; for information about pet advancement\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://web.archive.org/web/20100726084129/http://www.nethack.de/spoiler/32pets.txt What are the best pets? by Kevin Hugo]\n* [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/b2ae347a4341976e/9f1796db44d11534?q=#9f1796db44d11534 How to make your pet follow you]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{nethack-362}}\n[[Category:Pets| ]]"}

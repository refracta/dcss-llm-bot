{"title":"Drain for gain","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Drain_for_gain","type":"markdown","data":"**Drain for gain** was a [bug](/wiki/Bug \"Bug\") (SC343-10) that increases your maximum [hit points](/wiki/Hit_points \"Hit points\") and [power](/wiki/Power \"Power\") by losing [experience level](/wiki/Experience_level \"Experience level\") (through some method of [level drain](/wiki/Level_drain \"Level drain\")) while having lower [stats](/wiki/Stats \"Stats\") (in particular [constitution](/wiki/Constitution \"Constitution\") and [wisdom](/wiki/Wisdom \"Wisdom\")), then leveling up while having higher stats. By manipulating your stats before and after level drain, the amount of maximum HP and Pw you lose when losing levels could be made much smaller than the amount you gain when leveling back up.\n\nIn [NetHack 3.6.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.6.0 \"NetHack 3.6.0\"), this bug was fixed by recording the HP/Pw increase at each level, instead of reducing it randomly based on Constitution and Wisdom. If you didn't gain any HP/Pw from other sources, draining a level will restore HP/Pw to exactly what it was before on each previous level. This effectively nullifies this strategy for HP or Pw gain by using things that increases/lowers constitution or wisdom, though it could still be used to do things like buy [protection](/wiki/Protection \"Protection\") cheaply, or to \"re-roll\" better HP/Pw increases after you've increased your Con/Wis since the beginning of the game.\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Benefits](#Benefits)\n\n- [2 Risks](#Risks)\n\n- [3 Execution](#Execution)\n\n  - [3.1 Reducing stats](#Reducing_stats)\n  - [3.2 Draining your level](#Draining_your_level)\n  - [3.3 Increasing stats](#Increasing_stats)\n  - [3.4 Leveling back up](#Leveling_back_up)\n\n- [4 Stats and HP/power gain per experience level](#Stats_and_HP.2Fpower_gain_per_experience_level)\n\n- [5 References](#References)\n\n## Benefits\n\nAt the beginning of the game, characters usually start with lower stats. Applying this strategy would allow your character to reach and exceed the maximum HP and Pw potential for average characters of the same level. It has effects comparable with or even surpassing those obtained through [alchemy](/wiki/Alchemy \"Alchemy\"), [nurse dancing](/wiki/Nurse_dancing \"Nurse dancing\") and [foocubi](/wiki/Foocubi \"Foocubi\"), without requiring the same resources.\n\nThis strategy also allows you to play the game as a relatively low level character (but with a lot of HP and Pw) for a long time. This has several advantages:\n\n- You can buy a lot more [protection](/wiki/Protection_racket#Safer_alternative:_Level_drain \"Protection racket\") more cheaply. Self draining to XL1 allows you a chance to buy protection for only 400 gold, this makes even naked AC -10 possible through donation if you have finished Ludios.\n- If you don't want to buy any more protection, you can give half as much gold (while carrying no more than double the amount you give each time) to the priest for [clairvoyance](/wiki/Clairvoyance \"Clairvoyance\"). An XL1 character spending only a few thousand gold on this may get enough clairvoyance to last through the entire game.\n- You can reassign your [skill slots](/wiki/Skill_slot \"Skill slot\").\n- You can explore deeper dungeons while avoiding tougher monsters. Monsters with difficulty higher than (your level + dungeon level) / 2 are considered too strong to be generated. So if you drain yourself to XL1 before descending down every staircase, while keeping pets around to kill some monsters for you, you may be able to descend really deep with a much smaller chance of seeing tough monsters such as [mind flayers](/wiki/Mind_flayer \"Mind flayer\").\n- You may use the [polyself bug](/wiki/Polyself_bug \"Polyself bug\").\n\nBasically, if for any reason you want to drain your own level, you might as well try reducing your constitution and wisdom before doing so.\n\n## Risks\n\nYou will temporarily lower your maximum HP with each cycle; during the first cycle in the relatively early game your hp may become dangerously low. But after two or three cycles you will probably end up at XL1 with 40+HP, with at least 9 points of protection, making low HP a much lesser concern from then on.\n\nWhen you have only limited method of reducing stats (e.g. cursed and non-cursed unicorn horn which is usually only good for 1-pt CON reduction), the effect of HP gain may not be very obvious (or sometimes even a slight HP reduction). But if you keep gaining several experience levels before draining, eventually you will find your maximum HP increasing. Switching to methods of greater stat reduction later in the game (e.g. rings of gain constitution) will accelerate your gain by a lot. You can combine multiple methods of stat reduction to achieve a greater effect. e.g. Applying a cursed unicorn horn while wearing a -2 ring of gain constitution until you get an extra -1 CON.\n\nIf you choose to lose level through a level-draining monster, you need to take caution not to die by over-draining yourself below XL1. This risk can be reduced by luring the monster into a controlled area (see below), zapping it with [wand of slow monster](/wiki/Wand_of_slow_monster \"Wand of slow monster\"), wearing an [amulet of life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\"), and/or using [MSGTYPE](/wiki/MSGTYPE \"MSGTYPE\") if your game is compiled with it and you are using the [tty](/wiki/Tty \"Tty\")Â interface. Consider putting the following lines in your [options file](/wiki/Options \"Options\"):\n\n```\nMSGTYPE=stop \"Goodbye level *\"\nMSGTYPE=stop \"Sayonara level *\"\nMSGTYPE=stop \"Fare thee well level *\"\nMSGTYPE=stop \"Aloha level *\"\nMSGTYPE=stop \"Farvel level *\"\n```\n\nThis will force a --MORE-- prompt every time you get drained a level. Then you could even hold down '.' next to a wraith without getting accidentally over-drained. Also always remember to replace MC-giving items immediately after you finish. You may need some pets around to protect you, or stop yourself to take care of other monsters that show up while you are draining levels. Gaining 1 or 2 experience levels when clearing distractions could be fine even without increasing your stats first, as you can drain them right back down afterwards, and having low stats means the fluctuation of maximum HP and power would also be relatively small.\n\nIf you choose to play as a low-level high-HP character for an extended period of time, there are also several disadvantages, but most of them can be mitigated:\n\n- It might become more difficult to hit monsters. Having a blessed [luckstone](/wiki/Luckstone \"Luckstone\") and maximizing your luck greatly improves your chances of hitting.\n- You may not have enough skill slots for spells. Simply drain level again to switch to a different spell class when you need it, gaining yourself a few extra points of maximum HP and power while doing so.\n- You may die to monster's level drain attack more easily. Having MC3 makes this risk almost negligible, and having level drain resistance (e.g. by wielding [Excalibur](/wiki/Excalibur \"Excalibur\")) removes this risk completely.\n\n## Execution\n\nTo use this strategy, you first need to find some methods of reducing stats, and a method of level-draining yourself. Then you need to find a way to increase your stats and level back up. In most situations, the resources for doing those only need to be obtained once, and then the cycle can be repeated indefinitely (and in some cases rather quickly, too).\n\n### Reducing stats\n\nThe following methods can be used for reducing stats:\n\n- Wearing a negatively enchanted [ring of gain constitution](/wiki/Ring_of_gain_constitution \"Ring of gain constitution\") to reduce constitution, or removing a positively enchanted one.\n- Wearing a negatively enchanted [helm of brilliance](/wiki/Helm_of_brilliance \"Helm of brilliance\") to reduce wisdom, or removing a positively enchanted one.\n- Engraving on a co-aligned [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\") will reduce wisdom by 1 without any other penalty. You can easily reduce wisdom to the minimum of 3 this way. A cross-aligned altar will reduce your *Luck* instead.\n- Quaffing a non-blessed [potion of sickness](/wiki/Potion_of_sickness \"Potion of sickness\") as a non-healer will decrease one stat, even if the character has [poison resistance](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\"). You can obtain potions of sickness from [random alchemy](/wiki/Alchemy#Random_alchemy_results \"Alchemy\").\n- Applying a cursed [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\"). Two of the possible effects of a cursed unicorn horn are reducing constitution (\"You feel fragile!\") and reducing wisdom (\"You feel foolish!\"). You will need a way to cure other bad effects including sickness. Using a non-cursed unicorn horn would likely cure stat-losses as well, and therefore you may only be able to reduce your CON or WIS by 1 point despite repeated tries. Alternatively, using a [cure sickness](/wiki/Cure_sickness \"Cure sickness\") spell or blessed [potion of healing](/wiki/Potion_of_healing \"Potion of healing\") to cure sickness may allow you to reduce stats lower. You can lock yourself in a [closet](/wiki/Closet \"Closet\") and wait out all the non-sickness effects, though it may take a long time.\n- Being seduced by [foocubus](/wiki/Foocubus \"Foocubus\") while having low intelligence and charisma. Two of five possible negative effects reduce constitution and wisdom by one, respectively.\n- [Abusing](/wiki/Abuse \"Abuse\") them.\n\nWhen your constitution is high enough, every extra point of CON reduction may have a large accumulated effect after draining multiple levels. So it might be worth the effort to get an extra point lower when you can (possibly through combining multiple methods above). See the table below for details.\n\n### Draining your level\n\nThe following methods can be used to drain your level:\n\n- Throwing [Stormbringer](/wiki/Stormbringer \"Stormbringer\") or [The Staff of Aesculapius](/wiki/The_Staff_of_Aesculapius \"The Staff of Aesculapius\") up and hitting yourself. Make sure you have enough HP to survive the hit. (You can wear a metal helmet to reduce the damage and draining will still take effect.)\n- Removing [MC](/wiki/Magic_cancellation \"Magic cancellation\")-giving items and dancing with a level-draining monster such as a [wraith](/wiki/Wraith \"Wraith\"), [vampire](/wiki/Vampire \"Vampire\") or [barrow wight](/wiki/Barrow_wight \"Barrow wight\"). A relatively safe way to do this is to lure a wraith into a lockable room, engrave Elbereth in front of the door with an object on top, then stand diagonally next to the door outside so that when your level is low enough, you can just step away and the wraith won't ever come out.\n\n\\-----#Â Â Â |[d](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\")[0](/wiki/Boulder \"Boulder\")[@](/wiki/You \"You\").|Â Â Â Â Â |..  \n|...|[@](/wiki/You \"You\")Â Â Â --|---Â Â Â ---[W](/wiki/Wraith \"Wraith\").  \n|[W](/wiki/Wraith \"Wraith\")..-[(](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\")Â Â Â Â Â [W](/wiki/Wraith \"Wraith\")Â Â Â Â Â Â .[(](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\")[@](/wiki/You \"You\")[0](/wiki/Boulder \"Boulder\").  \n\\-----Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â [>](/wiki/Sokoban_Level_1b \"Sokoban Level 1b\")---.\n\n*(Hover over symbols for tips and links).*\n\n- Casting [drain life](/wiki/Spellbook_of_drain_life \"Spellbook of drain life\") at yourself.\n- Dancing with [foocubi](/wiki/Foocubus \"Foocubus\") at low [charisma](/wiki/Charisma \"Charisma\"), which may either drain you or lower your stats further, both of which are actually desirable at this stage. However, even a negative result has the same chance of giving the foocubus a [severe headache](/wiki/Cancellation \"Cancellation\"), rendering it useless.\n\n### Increasing stats\n\nThe following methods can be used for increasing (or restoring) stats:\n\n- [Exercising](/wiki/Exercise \"Exercise\") them. [Donating to priests](/wiki/Donating_to_priests \"Donating to priests\") for a lot of clairvoyance is a good way to exercise wisdom in the early game, as you exercise wisdom every 5 turns you enjoy clairvoyance.\n- Applying a non-cursed unicorn horn to restore lost stats.\n- Drinking a [potion of restore ability](/wiki/Potion_of_restore_ability \"Potion of restore ability\"), preferably blessed, to restore lost stats.\n- Using the [spell of restore ability](/wiki/Spellbook_of_restore_ability \"Spellbook of restore ability\") to restore lost stats.\n- Wearing a positively enchanted [helm of brilliance](/wiki/Helm_of_brilliance \"Helm of brilliance\"), or removing a negatively enchanted one.\n- Wearing a positively enchanted [ring of gain constitution](/wiki/Ring_of_gain_constitution \"Ring of gain constitution\"), or removing a negatively enchanted one.\n\n### Leveling back up\n\nAfter fixing your stats, just kill some monsters to level up and watch as you get more maximum HP and Pw than before.\n\n## Stats and HP/power gain per experience level\n\nThe HP and Pw gain per experience level for different roles and races is covered in detail in [\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1). [Constitution](/wiki/Constitution \"Constitution\") is the only character stat related to HP gain per level. The effect of maximum HP bonus per level due to constitution is summarized in the following table:\n\n| CON   | Bonus |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| 3     | -2    |\n| 4-6   | -1    |\n| 7-14  | +0    |\n| 15-16 | +1    |\n| 17    | +2    |\n| 18    | +3    |\n| 19+   | +4    |\n\n[Wisdom](/wiki/Wisdom \"Wisdom\") is the only stat related to power gain per level. Every 2 WIS points has the approximate effect of adding d1 to the amount of power gain per level, this effect could be further multiplied depending on roles. (e.g. Wizards get a x2 multiplier.\n\n## References\n\n1.

In most situations, the resources for doing those only need to be obtained once, and then the cycle can be repeated indefinitely (and in some cases rather quickly, too).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reducing_stats\">Reducing stats</span></h3>\n<p>The following methods can be used for reducing stats:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Wearing a negatively enchanted <a href=\"/wiki/Ring_of_gain_constitution\" title=\"Ring of gain constitution\">ring of gain constitution</a> to reduce constitution, or removing a positively enchanted one.</li>\n<li>Wearing a negatively enchanted <a href=\"/wiki/Helm_of_brilliance\" title=\"Helm of brilliance\">helm of brilliance</a> to reduce wisdom, or removing a positively enchanted one.</li>\n<li>Engraving on a co-aligned <a href=\"/wiki/Altar\" title=\"Altar\">altar</a> will reduce wisdom by 1 without any other penalty. You can easily reduce wisdom to the minimum of 3 this way. A cross-aligned altar will reduce your <i>Luck</i> instead.</li>\n<li>Quaffing a non-blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_sickness\" title=\"Potion of sickness\">potion of sickness</a> as a non-healer will decrease one stat, even if the character has <a href=\"/wiki/Poison_resistance\" title=\"Poison resistance\">poison resistance</a>. You can obtain potions of sickness from <a href=\"/wiki/Alchemy#Random_alchemy_results\" title=\"Alchemy\">random alchemy</a>.</li>\n<li>Applying a cursed <a href=\"/wiki/Unicorn_horn\" title=\"Unicorn horn\">unicorn horn</a>. Two of the possible effects of a cursed unicorn horn are reducing constitution (\"You feel fragile!\") and reducing wisdom (\"You feel foolish!\"). You will need a way to cure other bad effects including sickness. Using a non-cursed unicorn horn would likely cure stat-losses as well, and therefore you may only be able to reduce your CON or WIS by 1 point despite repeated tries. Alternatively, using a <a href=\"/wiki/Cure_sickness\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cure sickness\">cure sickness</a> spell or blessed <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_healing\" title=\"Potion of healing\">potion of healing</a> to cure sickness may allow you to reduce stats lower. You can lock yourself in a <a href=\"/wiki/Closet\" title=\"Closet\">closet</a> and wait out all the non-sickness effects, though it may take a long time.</li>\n<li>Being seduced by <a href=\"/wiki/Foocubus\" title=\"Foocubus\">foocubus</a> while having low intelligence and charisma.  Two of five possible negative effects reduce constitution and wisdom by one, respectively.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Abuse\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Abuse\">Abusing</a> them.</li></ul>\n<p>When your constitution is high enough, every extra point of CON reduction may have a large accumulated effect after draining multiple levels. So it might be worth the effort to get an extra point lower when you can (possibly through combining multiple methods above). See the table below for details.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Draining_your_level\">Draining your level</span></h3>\n<p>The following methods can be used to drain your level:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Throwing <a href=\"/wiki/Stormbringer\" title=\"Stormbringer\">Stormbringer</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/The_Staff_of_Aesculapius\" title=\"The Staff of Aesculapius\">The Staff of Aesculapius</a> up and hitting yourself. Make sure you have enough HP to survive the hit. (You can wear a metal helmet to reduce the damage and draining will still take effect.)</li>\n<li>Removing <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_cancellation\" title=\"Magic cancellation\">MC</a>-giving items and dancing with a level-draining monster such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Wraith\" title=\"Wraith\">wraith</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Vampire\" title=\"Vampire\">vampire</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Barrow_wight\" title=\"Barrow wight\">barrow wight</a>. A relatively safe way to do this is to lure a wraith into a lockable room, engrave Elbereth in front of the door with an object on top, then stand diagonally next to the door outside so that when your level is low enough, you can just step away and the wraith won't ever come out.</li></ul>\n<div class=\"ttyscreen\"><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">-</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">-</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">-</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">-</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">-</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">#</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">&#160;</span><span class=\"nhsym clr-lightgray\">&#124;</span><a href=\"/wiki/Pet\" title=\"Pet\"><span title=\"Pets can protect you while you drain levels.

for gain''' was a [[bug]] (SC343-10) that increases your maximum [[hit points]] and [[power]] by losing [[experience level]] (through some method of [[level drain]]) while having lower [[stats]] (in particular [[constitution]] and [[wisdom]]), then leveling up while having higher stats. By manipulating your stats before and after level drain, the amount of maximum HP and Pw you lose when losing levels could be made much smaller than the amount you gain when leveling back up.\n\nIn [[NetHack 3.6.0]], this bug was fixed by recording the HP/Pw increase at each level, instead of reducing it randomly based on Constitution and Wisdom. If you didn't gain any HP/Pw from other sources, draining a level will restore HP/Pw to exactly what it was before on each previous level. This effectively nullifies this strategy for HP or Pw gain by using things that increases/lowers constitution or wisdom, though it could still be used to do things like buy [[protection]] cheaply, or to \"re-roll\" better HP/Pw increases after you've increased your Con/Wis since the beginning of the game.\n\n==Benefits==\nAt the beginning of the game, characters usually start with lower stats. Applying this strategy would allow your character to reach and exceed the maximum HP and Pw potential for average characters of the same level. It has effects comparable with or even surpassing those obtained through [[alchemy]], [[nurse dancing]] and [[foocubi]], without requiring the same resources.\n\nThis strategy also allows you to play the game as a relatively low level character (but with a lot of HP and Pw) for a long time. This has several advantages:\n* You can buy a lot more [[Protection_racket#Safer_alternative:_Level_drain|protection]] more cheaply. Self draining to XL1 allows you a chance to buy protection for only 400 gold, this makes even naked AC -10 possible through donation if you have finished Ludios.\n* If you don't want to buy any more protection, you can give half as much gold (while carrying no more than double the amount you give each time) to the priest for [[clairvoyance]]. An XL1 character spending only a few thousand gold on this may get enough clairvoyance to last through the entire game.\n* You can reassign your [[Skill slot|skill slots]].\n* You can explore deeper dungeons while avoiding tougher monsters. Monsters with difficulty higher than (your level + dungeon level) / 2 are considered too strong to be generated. So if you drain yourself to XL1 before descending down every staircase, while keeping pets around to kill some monsters for you, you may be able to descend really deep with a much smaller chance of seeing tough monsters such as [[mind flayer|mind flayers]].\n* You may use the [[polyself bug]].\n\nBasically, if for any reason you want to drain your own level, you might as well try reducing your constitution and wisdom before doing so.\n\n== Risks ==\nYou will temporarily lower your maximum HP with each cycle; during the first cycle in the relatively early game your hp may become dangerously low. But after two or three cycles you will probably end up at XL1 with 40+HP, with at least 9 points of protection, making low HP a much lesser concern from then on.\n\nWhen you have only limited method of reducing stats (e.g. cursed and non-cursed unicorn horn which is usually only good for 1-pt CON reduction), the effect of HP gain may not be very obvious (or sometimes even a slight HP reduction). But if you keep gaining several experience levels before draining, eventually you will find your maximum HP increasing. Switching to  methods of greater stat reduction later in the game (e.g. rings of gain constitution) will accelerate your gain by a lot. You can combine multiple methods of stat reduction to achieve a greater effect. e.g. Applying a cursed unicorn horn while wearing a -2 ring of gain constitution until you get an extra -1 CON.\n\nIf you choose to lose level through a level-draining monster, you need to take caution not to die by over-draining yourself below XL1. This risk can be reduced by luring the monster into a controlled area (see below), zapping it with [[wand of slow monster]], wearing an [[amulet of life saving]], and/or using [[MSGTYPE]] if your game is compiled with it and you are using the [[tty]]Â interface. Consider putting the following lines in your [[options|options file]]:\n MSGTYPE=stop \"Goodbye level *\"\n MSGTYPE=stop \"Sayonara level *\"\n MSGTYPE=stop \"Fare thee well level *\"\n MSGTYPE=stop \"Aloha level *\"\n MSGTYPE=stop \"Farvel level *\"\nThis will force a --MORE-- prompt every time you get drained a level. Then you could even hold down '.' next to a wraith without getting accidentally over-drained. Also always remember to replace MC-giving items immediately after you finish. You may need some pets around to protect you, or stop yourself to take care of other monsters that show up while you are draining levels. Gaining 1 or 2 experience levels when clearing distractions could be fine even without increasing your stats first, as you can drain them right back down afterwards, and having low stats means the fluctuation of maximum HP and power would also be relatively small.\n\nIf you choose to play as a low-level high-HP character for an extended period of time, there are also several disadvantages, but most of them can be mitigated:\n* It might become more difficult to hit monsters. Having a blessed [[luckstone]] and maximizing your luck greatly improves your chances of hitting.\n* You may not have enough skill slots for spells. Simply drain level again to switch to a different spell class when you need it, gaining yourself a few extra points of maximum HP and power while doing so.\n* You may die to monster's level drain attack more easily. Having MC3 makes this risk almost negligible, and having level drain resistance (e.g. by wielding [[Excalibur]]) removes this risk completely.\n\n== Execution ==\nTo use this strategy, you first need to find some methods of reducing stats, and a method of level-draining yourself. Then you need to find a way to increase your stats and level back up. In most situations, the resources for doing those only need to be obtained once, and then the cycle can be repeated indefinitely (and in some cases rather quickly, too).\n\n===Reducing stats===\nThe following methods can be used for reducing stats:\n* Wearing a negatively enchanted [[ring of gain constitution]] to reduce constitution, or removing a positively enchanted one.\n* Wearing a negatively enchanted [[helm of brilliance]] to reduce wisdom, or removing a positively enchanted one.\n* Engraving on a co-aligned [[altar]] will reduce wisdom by 1 without any other penalty. You can easily reduce wisdom to the minimum of 3 this way. A cross-aligned altar will reduce your ''Luck'' instead.\n* Quaffing a non-blessed [[potion of sickness]] as a non-healer will decrease one stat, even if the character has [[poison resistance]]. You can obtain potions of sickness from [[Alchemy#Random_alchemy_results|random alchemy]].\n* Applying a cursed [[unicorn horn]]. Two of the possible effects of a cursed unicorn horn are reducing constitution (\"You feel fragile!\") and reducing wisdom (\"You feel foolish!\"). You will need a way to cure other bad effects including sickness. Using a non-cursed unicorn horn would likely cure stat-losses as well, and therefore you may only be able to reduce your CON or WIS by 1 point despite repeated tries. Alternatively, using a [[cure sickness]] spell or blessed [[potion of healing]] to cure sickness may allow you to reduce stats lower. You can lock yourself in a [[closet]] and wait out all the non-sickness effects, though it may take a long time.\n* Being seduced by [[foocubus]] while having low intelligence and charisma.  Two of five possible negative effects reduce constitution and wisdom by one, respectively.\n* [[Abuse|Abusing]] them.\n\nWhen your constitution is high enough, every extra point of CON reduction may have a large accumulated effect after draining multiple levels. So it might be worth the effort to get an extra point lower when you can (possibly through combining multiple methods above). See the table below for details.\n\n===Draining your level===\nThe following methods can be used to drain your level:\n* Throwing [[Stormbringer]] or [[The Staff of Aesculapius]] up and hitting yourself. Make sure you have enough HP to survive the hit. (You can wear a metal helmet to reduce the damage and draining will still take effect.)\n* Removing [[Magic cancellation|MC]]-giving items and dancing with a level-draining monster such as a [[wraith]], [[vampire]] or [[barrow wight]]. A relatively safe way to do this is to lure a wraith into a lockable room, engrave Elbereth in front of the door with an object on top, then stand diagonally next to the door outside so that when your level is low enough, you can just step away and the wraith won't ever come out.\n\n<div class='ttyscreen'><replacecharsblock>\n|={{lightgray|&#124;}}\n-={{lightgray|-}}\n.={{lightgray|.}}\n#={{lightgray|#}}\nâ={{brown|-}}\nÂ¦={{brown|&#124;}}\nd=[[Pet|<span title=\"Pets can protect you while you drain levels.

However, even a negative result has the same chance of giving the foocubus a [[cancellation|severe headache]], rendering it useless.\n\n===Increasing stats===\nThe following methods can be used for increasing (or restoring) stats:\n* [[Exercise|Exercising]] them. [[Donating to priests]] for a lot of clairvoyance is a good way to exercise wisdom <!--to max NOPE, maxing stats takes ridiculous amounts of exercise--> in the early game, as you exercise wisdom every 5 turns you enjoy clairvoyance.\n* Applying a non-cursed unicorn horn to restore lost stats.\n* Drinking a [[potion of restore ability]], preferably blessed, to restore lost stats.\n* Using the [[Spellbook of restore ability|spell of restore ability]] to restore lost stats.\n* Wearing a positively enchanted [[helm of brilliance]], or removing a negatively enchanted one.\n* Wearing a positively enchanted [[ring of gain constitution]], or removing a negatively enchanted one.\n\n===Leveling back up===\nAfter fixing your stats, just kill some monsters to level up and watch as you get more maximum HP and Pw than before.\n\n== Stats and HP/power gain per experience level ==\nThe HP and Pw gain per experience level for different roles and races is covered in detail in <ref>[http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/343/hppw-343.html HP and power starting values, level increases, and regeneration in NetHack 3.4]</ref>. [[Constitution]] is the only character stat related to HP gain per level. The effect of maximum HP bonus per level due to constitution is summarized in the following table:\n{|class=\"prettytable\" align=\"center\"\n!CON\n!Bonus\n|-\n| 3\n| -2\n|-\n| 4-6\n| -1\n|-\n| 7-14\n| +0\n|-\n| 15-16\n| +1\n|-\n| 17\n| +2\n|-\n| 18\n| +3\n|-\n| 19+\n| +4\n|}\n\n[[Wisdom]] is the only stat related to power gain per level. Every 2 WIS points has the approximate effect of adding d1 to the amount of power gain per level, this effect could be further multiplied depending on roles. (e.g. Wizards get a x2 multiplier.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n\n[[Category:Strategy]]\n{{noversion}}"}

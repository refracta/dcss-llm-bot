The COST field\ndenotes the base price of each item.  WGT specifies the weight (100\nzorkmids weighs 1).\n\nFood comprises 20% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,\n15% in containers, 22% on the  Rogue level, and 16% in hell.  PROB is the\nrelative probability of each subtype.  Eggs not laid by you have a\nroughly 1/3 probability of hatching.  Tins are 1/6 spinach and are 5%\nblessed, 90% uncursed, and 5% cursed.  All other comestibles will be\ngenerated uncursed.\n\nThe nutrition of each item is listed under NUTR.  The cost of all items\nare based on the nutrition by the formula COST = (NUTR / 20) +5, with\nfractions rounded off.  Note that several previously archived spoilers\ndid not correctly round their costs.  The ratio of nutrition to weight\nis listed in the NUTR/WGT column; lembas wafers have the best ratio.\nThe amount of time needed to completely eat an item is given under TIME.\n\n\nHunger and nutrition\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from the spoiler \"food\" by Bryan Butler and J. Ali Harlow.)\n\nEach of the following conditions is checked on the turns shown; if it is\nthe case, then you lose one more point of nutrition that turn.  Rings\nand amulets cause additional hunger as shown; the only exception is a\nring that can be charged but is at +0. A ring of slow digestion prevents\nbase ordinary food consumption, but still causes ring hunger.  You can\ntherefore consume a maximum of 64 nutrition in 20 turns (if all of these\nconditions were met).\n  HOW OFTEN      CAUSE\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~\n  Each turn      Ordinary food consumption, if carnivorous or herbivorous\n                 and not wearing a ring of slow digestion. When asleep,\n                 only about 10% as much is needed.\n  Odd turns      Regeneration from anything other than an artifact.\n  Odd turns      Encumbrance is stressed or worse.\n  Even turns     Hunger intrinsic (e.g., from a ring).\n  Even turns     Conflict from anything other than an artifact.\n  Turn 4 of 20   Ring worn on left hand (except a +0 ring).\n  Turn 8 of 20   Amulet worn.\n  Turn 12 of 20  Ring worn on right hand (except a +0 ring).\n  Turn 16 of 20  Carrying the Amulet of Yendor.\n\nNaturally, eating some food will make you gain the amount of nutrition\nin the food.  Your level of nutrition is described as follows:\n  2000 or more           Death from choking (under certain circumstances)\n  1000 or more           Satiated\n   150 to  999           Not hungry\n    50 to  149           Hungry\n     0 to   49           Weak\n  Below zero             Fainting\n  Below (-200)-(20*CON)  Death from starvation\n\n\nCorpses\n~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from the spoiler \"corpses\", by Boudewijn Waijers and\nPeter Snelling.)\n\nWhen a monster is killed, the probability of leaving a corpse depends on\nseveral factors:\n  PROB  CONDITIONS\n  ~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~\n    0%  Killed by digestion or disintegration.\n    0%  Killed by stoning (creates a statue instead).\n    0%  Corpses are never generated on the Rogue level.\n    0%  Golems leave objects instead of a corpse.\n    0%  Some monsters never leave a corpse (e.g., Vlad, liches).\n  100%  Lizards, monsters of large size or bigger.\n  100%  The Riders and player-monsters on the Astral Plane.\n   1/2  Frequent monster that is not tiny\n   1/3  Monster appears infrequently or is tiny (but not both).\n   1/4  Monster both appears infrequently and is tiny.\nThere is a further reduction of the above chances for undead creatures\nthat die on a graveyard level: by 1/9 if it was killed by you or by\n1/3 if it was not killed by you (e.g., by a trap or another monster).  \nThis means that wraiths have a better chance of leaving a corpse if you\nlead them to a stairway and let them follow you to a non-graveyard\nlevel, a technique called \"wraith luring\". For this purpose, the\nCastle and all levels of the Priest Quest are considered graveyard\nlevels, as is any level on which undead have been summoned by the \ncursed Book of the Dead or Bell of Opening.\n\nThe nutrition, weight, and time needed to eat corpses is determined by\nthe type of monster.  The blessed/cursed status of corpses adjusts how\nfast they become tainted; corpses on an ice surface age half as fast,\ncorpses do not age while in iceboxes, and lizard and lichen corpses\nnever become tainted (though they do become too old for sacrifice).\nVampires, mummies and zombies leave corpses that are already considered\nold.  Tainted corpses do not provide either nutrition or intrinsics.\n\n(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)\n\nYou can acquire useful intrinsics by eating certain corpses or tins.\nThe blessed/cursed status does *not* change the likelihood of getting\nan intrinsic.  If the monster has more than one conferrable intrinsic,\none is randomly picked, with equal probability among all possible.\nThe CHANCE that the picked intrinsic is conferred varies among the\ndifferent intrinsics; some are based on the level of the monster (LEV).\nIf you get the intrinsic, you will get a MESSAGE (the second one if\nyou are hallucinating).\n  INTRINSIC          CHANCE  MESSAGE\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~\n  Fire resistance    LEV/15  \"You feel a momentary chill.\"\n                             \"You be chillin'.\"\n  Sleep resistance   LEV/15  \"You feel wide awake\"\n  Cold resistance    LEV/15  \"You feel full of hot air\"\n  Disintegration     LEV/15  \"You feel very firm.\"\n    resistance               \"You feel totally together, man.\"\n  Shock resistance   LEV/15  \"Your health currently feels amplified!\"\n                             \"You feel grounded in reality.\"\n  Poison resistance  LEV/15  \"You feel healthy.\"\n                             (\"You feel especially healthy.\" if you had\n                             previously acquired non-permanent poison\n                             resistance by other means.)\n                             Note: 25% better chance if killer bee or\n                             scorpion.\n  Teleport           LEV/10  \"You feel very jumpy.\"\n                             \"You feel diffuse.\"\n  Teleport control   LEV/12  \"You feel in control of yourself.\"\n                             \"You feel centered in your personal space.\"\n  Telepathy           100%   \"You feel a strange mental acuity.\"\n                             \"You feel in touch with the cosmos.\"\n        \nSome corpses or tins have additional effects:\n  :bjDFNP  If you eat a lizard or any acidic monster, a possible stoning\n           process is stopped.\n           \"You feel limber\" (non-hallucinating)\n           \"What a pity - you just ruined a future piece of art!\"\n           (hallucinating with charisma <= 15)\n           \"What a pity - you just ruined a future piece of fine art!\"\n           (hallucinating with charisma > 15)\n\n  :  Eating a lizard has the supplemental effect of reducing stunning\n     or confusion timeouts to 2 turns, if higher.\n\n  :  Eating a newt (\"eye of newt\") may cause you to gain 1 to 3 energy\n     (2/3 chance, always if at two-thirds maximum energy or below). If\n     this would take you above your maximum energy, there is a 1/3 chance\n     that your maximum energy will be increased by one.\n       \"You feel a mild buzz.\"\n\n  :@ Eating a chameleon or doppelganger makes you polymorph once.\n     (Eating doppelgangers may also be considered cannibalism if you\n     are human.)\n\n  h  a (master) mind flayer has a 50% chance of increasing your INT by\n     one. Otherwise, it confers telepathy.\n\n  m  Eating a mimic makes you mimic a pile of gold (or, if hallucinating,\n     an orange) for some turns, unless you have unchanging. The larger the\n     mimic the longer you imitate. During this time, you are shown as a\n     $-sign or %-sign.  If you are attacked, you revert to your previous\n     form.\n\n  yB Eating a bat will make you stunned for 30 (more) turns, or 60 (more)\n     turns for a giant bat.  In theory, this also holds for yellow lights\n     (but they don't leave corpses in recent versions).\n\n  E  When you eat a stalker's corpse and you are not invisible, you'll\n     become invisible for 50 to 149 turns. If you're already invisible,\n     you become permanently invisible and get the \"see invisible\"\n     intrinsic.  In both cases, you are stunned for 60 (more) turns.\n\n  F@ If the monster has a stun or hallucination attack or is a violet\n     fungus, you get hallucination for (another) 200 turns.\n\n  H  Eating a giant, stone giant, hill giant, fire giant, frost giant,\n     storm giant, or Lord Surtur will increase your strength.  If you\n     had less than 18 strength, then you have a 19/24 chance of gaining\n     one point, or a 1/24 chance each of gaining 2 to 6 points.  If you\n     had 18 strength or more, then you gain 1 to 10 points (equally\n     likely), or just one point if you had strength 18/85 or more, up to\n     18/** (or your racial maximum if lower).\n\n  P  Eating a green slime's corpse (unless polymorphed into a green slime,\n     a salamander, a flaming sphere, or a fire vortex or elemental; or you\n     have unchanging or were being slimed already) will slime you to death\n     in 10 turns.\n\n  Q  A quantum mechanic's corpse makes you toggle your speed.  If you\n     were not currently fast, you'll get fast; otherwise, you lose the\n     speed.\n\n  W  Eating a wraith's corpse lets you gain a level (unless the corpse\n     is rotten and rots away completely).\n\n  df If you eat any of little dog, dog, large dog, kitten, housecat, or\n     large cat, you'll get the intrinsic \"aggravate monster\" unless you\n     are a Caveman or an orc.  \"You feel that eating the <monster> was a\n     bad idea.\"\n\n  c@ If you eat a cockatrice, chickatrice or Medusa's corpse and you\n     are neither stoning resistant nor are you polymorphed into a golem,\n     you'll be instantly killed by stoning.\n\n  @hGK  Eating something of your own species (Kops are human) is \n        considered cannibalism unless you are a Caveman or an orc.  You\n        get the intrinsic \"aggravate monster\" and lose 2 to 5 luck.\n\n  @  Eating a were-creature makes you a lycanthrope of the same kind and\n     may be considered cannibalism if you are human.\n\n  @  Eating a nurse heals you up to max hitpoints and may be considered\n     cannibalism if you are human.\n\n  &  Eating Death, Pestilence or Famine is instantly fatal.\n\n\nTins\n~~~~\n(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)\n\nYou get up to 50 moves to open a tin; otherwise, you give up. If you are\nwielding a tin opener, it takes one turn; any dagger or crysknife, 3\nturns; or a pick-axe or axe, 6 turns. Failing this, if you have greasy\nfingers the tin will be dropped (if carried), otherwise it will take\n10+d(500/(DEX+STR)) turns to open (18/xx strengths being mapped to the\nrange 19-21).  Blessed tins \"open like magic\" in one turn.  Cursed tins\nhave a 1/8 chance of exploding and will always contain rotten food, so\nthey won't give any nutrition but will make you even more hungry. \n\nTins made by you with a tinning kit are always homemade if not cursed. \nAll other tins are one of these fifteen possibilities: pureed (500),\ndeep fried (60), homemade (50), pickled (40), soup (20), stir fried (80),\ncandied (100), boiled (50), dried (55), szechuan (70), french fried (40),\nsauteed (95), broiled (80), smoked (50), or rotten (-50).  The number in\nthe parentheses is the nutrition value of each.  You cannot tell in\nadvance what type a given tin is.\n\nWhen you eat deep fried or french fried food, you get slippery fingers\nfor up to 15 rounds, making you drop your wielded weapon.  You can shorten\nthe time by (a)pplying a towel.  Don't forget to pick your weapon up again.\n\nYou can obtain intrinsics from eating tins, with the same chance that\nyou would have from eating the monster's corpse.  Note that the chance\nof getting an intrinsic does not change if the tin is blessed or\ncursed.\n\nOne of the most useful tins is the tin of spinach. If the tin is cursed,\nyou lose strength equivalent to eating a giant corpse.  Otherwise,\neating the spinach \"makes you feel like Popeye\" (or Swee'pea while\nhallucinating) and gives you more strength equivalent to a giant corpse.\nTins of spinach have a nutrition of 600.\n\n\nOther food\n~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)\n\nEating a spring of wolfsbane cures lycanthropy.\n\nA carrot cures blindness.  Ever seen a rabbit with glasses? (It won't\nhelp with being creamed or envenomed, though.)\n\nEating a fortune cookie gives you a rumor. You can also just (r)ead it\nwithout eating the cookie. The rumour is from the true file if the\ncookie is blessed, the false file if cursed, or either if uncursed.\n\nEating a lump of royal jelly increases (decreases if cursed) your\nstrength by one. If the jelly was cursed, you lose up to 20 hit points,\notherwise you gain up to 20 HP and your wounded legs heal. If your\nactual HP would become higher than your maximum HP, there is a 1/17\nchance of increasing your maximum HP by one.\n\nEating a cockatrice egg is a real bad idea if you're not polymorphed\ninto something that resists stoning.  However, they are very useful when\nthrown at monsters.\n\nEating green slime is also an extremely bad idea unless you're polymorphed\ninto something fiery or a slime yourself (or have unchanging).\n\nEating a eucalyptus leaf cures sickness or vomiting. They can also be\na)pplied to give the effect of a tin whistle (cursed or uncursed) or a\nmagic whistle (blessed; this has a 1/49 chance of unblessing the leaf).\n\nEating tripe may make you vomit (50% chance) unless you are a Caveman\nor an orc, or polymorphed into a carnivorous non-humanoid.\n\nIn addition to eating them, cream pies may be thrown to blind their target,\nor you can a)pply one directly to blind yourself.\n\n\nEating objects\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)\n\nThere are some conditions before you can eat an object. If you are\npolymorphed into a metallivore (rock mole, rust monster, or xorn), you\nmay eat objects made of metal.\n\nIf you are polymorphed into a gelatinous cube, the object is organic,\nand the object doesn't contain other objects, you may eat it.  This is\ndifferent for real gelatinous cubes, which can eat a container and hold\nthe non-organic contents of that container engulfed.  So when such a\nbeasty eats your chest with all the artifacts, you may find them on its\ncorpse.\n\nYou can never eat Unique Items such as the Amulet or the invocation\nartifacts.\n\nEating something that isn't actually food always takes only one move.\nThe code addresses this issue by stating, \"[We don't want] to deal with\npartly eaten plate mails, players who polymorph back to human in the\nmiddle of their metallic meal, etc....\"\n\nEating rings has a 1/3 chance of conferring the intrinsic of the ring.\nEating amulets has a 1/5 chance of having an effect.  Not all intrinsics\ncan be acquired this way.  See the spoilers \"amul-343.txt\" and\n\"ring-343.txt\".\n\nWhen you eat a leash with a monster on the other side, this monster gets\nunleashed.\n\nIf you eat the iron ball or the chain while you are punished, the\npunishment is gone. If you eat the chain, the ball is still available to\nuse as a weapon or to throw.\n\nWhen you try to eat something rustproof while being polymorphed into a\nrust monster, you spit it out non-rustproof and get stunned a few rounds.\n\nEating a poisoned weapon has the same effect as eating poisonous corpses.\nYou get poisoned if you're not resistant.\n\nEating a non-cursed trident exercises wisdom. (This is apparently a\nUS-centric pun having something to do with a brand of chewing gum.)\n\"That was pure chewing satisfaction!\"\n\nEating a non-cursed flint stone exercises constitution. \"Yabba-dabba\ndelicious!\" (Note however that there are no monsters capable of eating\nflint stones in the present version.)\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks to Bruce Cox for proofreading the original version of this file.\nFurther corrections and clarifications by Kieron Dunbar, Stephen S.

The COST field\ndenotes the base price of each item.  WGT specifies the weight (100\nzorkmids weighs 1).\n\nFood comprises 20% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,\n15% in containers, 22% on the  Rogue level, and 16% in hell.  PROB is the\nrelative probability of each subtype.  Eggs not laid by you have a\nroughly 1/3 probability of hatching.  Tins are 1/6 spinach and are 5%\nblessed, 90% uncursed, and 5% cursed.  All other comestibles will be\ngenerated uncursed.\n\nThe nutrition of each item is listed under NUTR.  The cost of all items\nare based on the nutrition by the formula COST = (NUTR / 20) +5, with\nfractions rounded off.  Note that several previously archived spoilers\ndid not correctly round their costs.  The ratio of nutrition to weight\nis listed in the NUTR/WGT column; lembas wafers have the best ratio.\nThe amount of time needed to completely eat an item is given under TIME.\n\n\nHunger and nutrition\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from the spoiler \"food\" by Bryan Butler and J. Ali Harlow.)\n\nEach of the following conditions is checked on the turns shown; if it is\nthe case, then you lose one more point of nutrition that turn.  Rings\nand amulets cause additional hunger as shown; the only exception is a\nring that can be charged but is at +0. A ring of slow digestion prevents\nbase ordinary food consumption, but still causes ring hunger.  You can\ntherefore consume a maximum of 64 nutrition in 20 turns (if all of these\nconditions were met).\n  HOW OFTEN      CAUSE\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~\n  Each turn      Ordinary food consumption, if carnivorous or herbivorous\n                 and not wearing a ring of slow digestion. When asleep,\n                 only about 10% as much is needed.\n  Odd turns      Regeneration from anything other than an artifact.\n  Odd turns      Encumbrance is stressed or worse.\n  Even turns     Hunger intrinsic (e.g., from a ring).\n  Even turns     Conflict from anything other than an artifact.\n  Turn 4 of 20   Ring worn on left hand (except a +0 ring).\n  Turn 8 of 20   Amulet worn.\n  Turn 12 of 20  Ring worn on right hand (except a +0 ring).\n  Turn 16 of 20  Carrying the Amulet of Yendor.\n\nNaturally, eating some food will make you gain the amount of nutrition\nin the food.  Your level of nutrition is described as follows:\n  2000 or more           Death from choking (under certain circumstances)\n  1000 or more           Satiated\n   150 to  999           Not hungry\n    50 to  149           Hungry\n     0 to   49           Weak\n  Below zero             Fainting\n  Below (-200)-(20*CON)  Death from starvation\n\n\nCorpses\n~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from the spoiler \"corpses\", by Boudewijn Waijers and\nPeter Snelling.)\n\nWhen a monster is killed, the probability of leaving a corpse depends on\nseveral factors:\n  PROB  CONDITIONS\n  ~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~\n    0%  Killed by digestion or disintegration.\n    0%  Killed by stoning (creates a statue instead).\n    0%  Corpses are never generated on the Rogue level.\n    0%  Golems leave objects instead of a corpse.\n    0%  Some monsters never leave a corpse (e.g., Vlad, liches).\n  100%  Lizards, monsters of large size or bigger.\n  100%  The Riders and player-monsters on the Astral Plane.\n   1/2  Frequent monster that is not tiny\n   1/3  Monster appears infrequently or is tiny (but not both).\n   1/4  Monster both appears infrequently and is tiny.\nThere is a further reduction of the above chances for undead creatures\nthat die on a graveyard level: by 1/9 if it was killed by you or by\n1/3 if it was not killed by you (e.g., by a trap or another monster).  \nThis means that wraiths have a better chance of leaving a corpse if you\nlead them to a stairway and let them follow you to a non-graveyard\nlevel, a technique called \"wraith luring\". For this purpose, the\nCastle and all levels of the Priest Quest are considered graveyard\nlevels, as is any level on which undead have been summoned by the \ncursed Book of the Dead or Bell of Opening.\n\nThe nutrition, weight, and time needed to eat corpses is determined by\nthe type of monster.  The blessed/cursed status of corpses adjusts how\nfast they become tainted; corpses on an ice surface age half as fast,\ncorpses do not age while in iceboxes, and lizard and lichen corpses\nnever become tainted (though they do become too old for sacrifice).\nVampires, mummies and zombies leave corpses that are already considered\nold.  Tainted corpses do not provide either nutrition or intrinsics.\n\n(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)\n\nYou can acquire useful intrinsics by eating certain corpses or tins.\nThe blessed/cursed status does *not* change the likelihood of getting\nan intrinsic.  If the monster has more than one conferrable intrinsic,\none is randomly picked, with equal probability among all possible.\nThe CHANCE that the picked intrinsic is conferred varies among the\ndifferent intrinsics; some are based on the level of the monster (LEV).\nIf you get the intrinsic, you will get a MESSAGE (the second one if\nyou are hallucinating).\n  INTRINSIC          CHANCE  MESSAGE\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~\n  Fire resistance    LEV/15  \"You feel a momentary chill.\"\n                             \"You be chillin'.\"\n  Sleep resistance   LEV/15  \"You feel wide awake\"\n  Cold resistance    LEV/15  \"You feel full of hot air\"\n  Disintegration     LEV/15  \"You feel very firm.\"\n    resistance               \"You feel totally together, man.\"\n  Shock resistance   LEV/15  \"Your health currently feels amplified!\"\n                             \"You feel grounded in reality.\"\n  Poison resistance  LEV/15  \"You feel healthy.\"\n                             (\"You feel especially healthy.\" if you had\n                             previously acquired non-permanent poison\n                             resistance by other means.)\n                             Note: 25% better chance if killer bee or\n                             scorpion.\n  Teleport           LEV/10  \"You feel very jumpy.\"\n                             \"You feel diffuse.\"\n  Teleport control   LEV/12  \"You feel in control of yourself.\"\n                             \"You feel centered in your personal space.\"\n  Telepathy           100%   \"You feel a strange mental acuity.\"\n                             \"You feel in touch with the cosmos.\"\n        \nSome corpses or tins have additional effects:\n  :bjDFNP  If you eat a lizard or any acidic monster, a possible stoning\n           process is stopped.\n           \"You feel limber\" (non-hallucinating)\n           \"What a pity - you just ruined a future piece of art!\"\n           (hallucinating with charisma &lt;= 15)\n           \"What a pity - you just ruined a future piece of fine art!\"\n           (hallucinating with charisma &gt; 15)\n\n  :  Eating a lizard has the supplemental effect of reducing stunning\n     or confusion timeouts to 2 turns, if higher.\n\n  :  Eating a newt (\"eye of newt\") may cause you to gain 1 to 3 energy\n     (2/3 chance, always if at two-thirds maximum energy or below). If\n     this would take you above your maximum energy, there is a 1/3 chance\n     that your maximum energy will be increased by one.\n       \"You feel a mild buzz.\"\n\n  :@ Eating a chameleon or doppelganger makes you polymorph once.\n     (Eating doppelgangers may also be considered cannibalism if you\n     are human.)\n\n  h  a (master) mind flayer has a 50% chance of increasing your INT by\n     one. Otherwise, it confers telepathy.\n\n  m  Eating a mimic makes you mimic a pile of gold (or, if hallucinating,\n     an orange) for some turns, unless you have unchanging. The larger the\n     mimic the longer you imitate. During this time, you are shown as a\n     $-sign or&#160;%-sign.  If you are attacked, you revert to your previous\n     form.\n\n  yB Eating a bat will make you stunned for 30 (more) turns, or 60 (more)\n     turns for a giant bat.  In theory, this also holds for yellow lights\n     (but they don't leave corpses in recent versions).\n\n  E  When you eat a stalker's corpse and you are not invisible, you'll\n     become invisible for 50 to 149 turns. If you're already invisible,\n     you become permanently invisible and get the \"see invisible\"\n     intrinsic.  In both cases, you are stunned for 60 (more) turns.\n\n  F@ If the monster has a stun or hallucination attack or is a violet\n     fungus, you get hallucination for (another) 200 turns.\n\n  H  Eating a giant, stone giant, hill giant, fire giant, frost giant,\n     storm giant, or Lord Surtur will increase your strength.  If you\n     had less than 18 strength, then you have a 19/24 chance of gaining\n     one point, or a 1/24 chance each of gaining 2 to 6 points.  If you\n     had 18 strength or more, then you gain 1 to 10 points (equally\n     likely), or just one point if you had strength 18/85 or more, up to\n     18/** (or your racial maximum if lower).\n\n  P  Eating a green slime's corpse (unless polymorphed into a green slime,\n     a salamander, a flaming sphere, or a fire vortex or elemental; or you\n     have unchanging or were being slimed already) will slime you to death\n     in 10 turns.\n\n  Q  A quantum mechanic's corpse makes you toggle your speed.  If you\n     were not currently fast, you'll get fast; otherwise, you lose the\n     speed.\n\n  W  Eating a wraith's corpse lets you gain a level (unless the corpse\n     is rotten and rots away completely).\n\n  df If you eat any of little dog, dog, large dog, kitten, housecat, or\n     large cat, you'll get the intrinsic \"aggravate monster\" unless you\n     are a Caveman or an orc.  \"You feel that eating the &lt;monster&gt; was a\n     bad idea.\"\n\n  c@ If you eat a cockatrice, chickatrice or Medusa's corpse and you\n     are neither stoning resistant nor are you polymorphed into a golem,\n     you'll be instantly killed by stoning.\n\n  @hGK  Eating something of your own species (Kops are human) is \n        considered cannibalism unless you are a Caveman or an orc.  You\n        get the intrinsic \"aggravate monster\" and lose 2 to 5 luck.\n\n  @  Eating a were-creature makes you a lycanthrope of the same kind and\n     may be considered cannibalism if you are human.\n\n  @  Eating a nurse heals you up to max hitpoints and may be considered\n     cannibalism if you are human.\n\n  &amp;  Eating Death, Pestilence or Famine is instantly fatal.\n\n\nTins\n~~~~\n(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)\n\nYou get up to 50 moves to open a tin; otherwise, you give up. If you are\nwielding a tin opener, it takes one turn; any dagger or crysknife, 3\nturns; or a pick-axe or axe, 6 turns. Failing this, if you have greasy\nfingers the tin will be dropped (if carried), otherwise it will take\n10+d(500/(DEX+STR)) turns to open (18/xx strengths being mapped to the\nrange 19-21).  Blessed tins \"open like magic\" in one turn.  Cursed tins\nhave a 1/8 chance of exploding and will always contain rotten food, so\nthey won't give any nutrition but will make you even more hungry. \n\nTins made by you with a tinning kit are always homemade if not cursed. \nAll other tins are one of these fifteen possibilities: pureed (500),\ndeep fried (60), homemade (50), pickled (40), soup (20), stir fried (80),\ncandied (100), boiled (50), dried (55), szechuan (70), french fried (40),\nsauteed (95), broiled (80), smoked (50), or rotten (-50).  The number in\nthe parentheses is the nutrition value of each.  You cannot tell in\nadvance what type a given tin is.\n\nWhen you eat deep fried or french fried food, you get slippery fingers\nfor up to 15 rounds, making you drop your wielded weapon.  You can shorten\nthe time by (a)pplying a towel.  Don't forget to pick your weapon up again.\n\nYou can obtain intrinsics from eating tins, with the same chance that\nyou would have from eating the monster's corpse.  Note that the chance\nof getting an intrinsic does not change if the tin is blessed or\ncursed.\n\nOne of the most useful tins is the tin of spinach. If the tin is cursed,\nyou lose strength equivalent to eating a giant corpse.  Otherwise,\neating the spinach \"makes you feel like Popeye\" (or Swee'pea while\nhallucinating) and gives you more strength equivalent to a giant corpse.\nTins of spinach have a nutrition of 600.\n\n\nOther food\n~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)\n\nEating a spring of wolfsbane cures lycanthropy.\n\nA carrot cures blindness.  Ever seen a rabbit with glasses? (It won't\nhelp with being creamed or envenomed, though.)\n\nEating a fortune cookie gives you a rumor. You can also just (r)ead it\nwithout eating the cookie. The rumour is from the true file if the\ncookie is blessed, the false file if cursed, or either if uncursed.\n\nEating a lump of royal jelly increases (decreases if cursed) your\nstrength by one. If the jelly was cursed, you lose up to 20 hit points,\notherwise you gain up to 20 HP and your wounded legs heal. If your\nactual HP would become higher than your maximum HP, there is a 1/17\nchance of increasing your maximum HP by one.\n\nEating a cockatrice egg is a real bad idea if you're not polymorphed\ninto something that resists stoning.  However, they are very useful when\nthrown at monsters.\n\nEating green slime is also an extremely bad idea unless you're polymorphed\ninto something fiery or a slime yourself (or have unchanging).\n\nEating a eucalyptus leaf cures sickness or vomiting. They can also be\na)pplied to give the effect of a tin whistle (cursed or uncursed) or a\nmagic whistle (blessed; this has a 1/49 chance of unblessing the leaf).\n\nEating tripe may make you vomit (50% chance) unless you are a Caveman\nor an orc, or polymorphed into a carnivorous non-humanoid.\n\nIn addition to eating them, cream pies may be thrown to blind their target,\nor you can a)pply one directly to blind yourself.\n\n\nEating objects\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)\n\nThere are some conditions before you can eat an object. If you are\npolymorphed into a metallivore (rock mole, rust monster, or xorn), you\nmay eat objects made of metal.\n\nIf you are polymorphed into a gelatinous cube, the object is organic,\nand the object doesn't contain other objects, you may eat it.  This is\ndifferent for real gelatinous cubes, which can eat a container and hold\nthe non-organic contents of that container engulfed.  So when such a\nbeasty eats your chest with all the artifacts, you may find them on its\ncorpse.\n\nYou can never eat Unique Items such as the Amulet or the invocation\nartifacts.\n\nEating something that isn't actually food always takes only one move.\nThe code addresses this issue by stating, \"[We don't want] to deal with\npartly eaten plate mails, players who polymorph back to human in the\nmiddle of their metallic meal, etc....\"\n\nEating rings has a 1/3 chance of conferring the intrinsic of the ring.\nEating amulets has a 1/5 chance of having an effect.  Not all intrinsics\ncan be acquired this way.  See the spoilers \"amul-343.txt\" and\n\"ring-343.txt\".\n\nWhen you eat a leash with a monster on the other side, this monster gets\nunleashed.\n\nIf you eat the iron ball or the chain while you are punished, the\npunishment is gone. If you eat the chain, the ball is still available to\nuse as a weapon or to throw.\n\nWhen you try to eat something rustproof while being polymorphed into a\nrust monster, you spit it out non-rustproof and get stunned a few rounds.\n\nEating a poisoned weapon has the same effect as eating poisonous corpses.\nYou get poisoned if you're not resistant.\n\nEating a non-cursed trident exercises wisdom. (This is apparently a\nUS-centric pun having something to do with a brand of chewing gum.)\n\"That was pure chewing satisfaction!\"\n\nEating a non-cursed flint stone exercises constitution. \"Yabba-dabba\ndelicious!\" (Note however that there are no monsters capable of eating\nflint stones in the present version.)\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks to Bruce Cox for proofreading the original version of this file.\nFurther corrections and clarifications by Kieron Dunbar, Stephen S.

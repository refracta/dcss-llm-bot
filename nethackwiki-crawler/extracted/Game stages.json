{"title":"Game stages","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Game_stages","type":"markdown","data":"Like most games, a [player](/wiki/Player \"Player\") character's progress through *[NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\")* can be broken down into several **game stages**.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [ ]## Contents* [1 The early game](#The_early_game)\n  - [1.1 Early game threats](#Early_game_threats)\n* [2 The midgame](#The_midgame)\n  - [2.1 Midgame threats](#Midgame_threats)\n* [3 The late game](#The_late_game)\n  - [3.1 Late game threats](#Late_game_threats)\n* [4 The ascension run](#The_ascension_run)\n  - [4.1 Ascension run threats](#Ascension_run_threats) |\n\n## The early game\n\nThe first stage is the early game where survival and sometimes securing [food](/wiki/Food \"Food\") is of supreme importance. For many roles, the [starting pet](/wiki/Pet#starting_pet \"Pet\") is likely more powerful than the character itself. Securing basic [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\") and [weaponry](/wiki/Weapon \"Weapon\") is a top priority; use your [pet](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\") to [test](/wiki/Curse_testing#pet_testing \"Curse testing\") the [BUC](/wiki/BUC \"BUC\") status of items before you use or wear them. Many new players have trouble finding enough food: when they are [weak with hunger](/wiki/Nutrition \"Nutrition\") they should probably [pray](/wiki/Prayer \"Prayer\") for nutrition and save their [permafood](/wiki/Permafood \"Permafood\") for when they cannot pray. More experienced players will find they have enough [food](/wiki/Food \"Food\") almost all the time and will want to eat the [permafood](/wiki/Permafood \"Permafood\") and conserve their ability to pray. Safe [corpses](/wiki/Corpse \"Corpse\") are preferable to both, of course. Above all else, take your time and be careful, unless you have chosen to [speedrun](/wiki/Speedrun \"Speedrun\"), NetHack is not a race! The early game can be the most difficult stage of [NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\").\n\n### Early game threats\n\nRanked roughly in order of danger from most to least.\n\n- Team [a](/wiki/Ant_or_other_insect \"Ant or other insect\"): As a rule of thumb, any [monster](/wiki/Monster \"Monster\") represented by an ​a is a huge threat to an early character. They have high [speed](/wiki/Speed \"Speed\"), and get multiple attacks on each of their many [turns](/wiki/Turn \"Turn\"). To top it off, all of these monsters are generated in groups. Engrave [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") at first sight with these creatures, even if just with your [fingers](/wiki/Fingers \"Fingers\"). Using [attack wands](/wiki/Attack_wand \"Attack wand\") is not out of the question either.\n\n  - a [soldier ant](/wiki/Soldier_ant \"Soldier ant\") and a [killer bee](/wiki/Killer_bee \"Killer bee\"): These can [poison](/wiki/Poison \"Poison\") you to reduce your [strength](/wiki/Strength \"Strength\"), [hit points](/wiki/Hit_points \"Hit points\"), or even cause [instant death](/wiki/Instadeath \"Instadeath\") if the RNG hates you. [Magic cancellation](/wiki/Magic_cancellation \"Magic cancellation\") will help block the [poison](/wiki/Poison \"Poison\") but not the physical damage.\n  - a [fire ant](/wiki/Fire_ant \"Fire ant\"): These cannot [poison](/wiki/Poison \"Poison\") you, but instead can light you on [fire](/wiki/Fire \"Fire\"), causing [scrolls](/wiki/Scroll \"Scroll\") to [burn](/wiki/Fire \"Fire\"), [potions](/wiki/Potion \"Potion\") to [boil](/wiki/Fire \"Fire\"), and some [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\") to smolder. Again, [magic cancellation](/wiki/Magic_cancellation \"Magic cancellation\") can help somewhat by blocking the fire damage, but not the physical damage.\n  - a [giant ant](/wiki/Giant_ant \"Giant ant\"): These are mercifully much weaker than their soldier cousins, but are not to be underestimated; many a character has been killed by these insects.\n  - a [giant beetle](/wiki/Giant_beetle \"Giant beetle\"): These are an exception; they are very slow and have only one attack. Characters can easily use [hit and run](/wiki/Hit_and_run \"Hit and run\") tactics to defeat them.\n\n- q [leocrotta](/wiki/Leocrotta \"Leocrotta\"): They are fast enough to get 3 [turns](/wiki/Turn \"Turn\") for every 2 of a character who isn't [fast](/wiki/Fast \"Fast\") or [very fast](/wiki/Very_fast \"Very fast\"), and have three highly damaging attacks. They thankfully lack any [resistances](/wiki/Resistance \"Resistance\") and have low [MR](/wiki/Magic_resistance_\\(monster\\) \"Magic resistance (monster)\"), meaning that [attack wands](/wiki/Attack_wand \"Attack wand\") are quite useful. They respect [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\").\n\n- [Unicorns](/wiki/Unicorn \"Unicorn\"): the u [white unicorn](/wiki/White_unicorn \"White unicorn\"), u [gray unicorn](/wiki/Gray_unicorn \"Gray unicorn\"), and the u [black unicorn](/wiki/Black_unicorn \"Black unicorn\"): Unicorns have potent attacks, but will try to remain a knight's move away from you instead of engaging. A hapless [fast](/wiki/Fast \"Fast\"), [very fast](/wiki/Very_fast \"Very fast\"), or [invisible](/wiki/Invisible \"Invisible\") player can end up adjacent to one however, and it will continue attacking until you or it dies. Use [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") or pacify it by throwing a [gem](/wiki/Gem \"Gem\") at it, which may also alter your [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\"); see [the main article](/wiki/Unicorn \"Unicorn\") for details.\n\n- [Lycanthropes](/wiki/Lycanthrope \"Lycanthrope\"): the @ / r [wererat](/wiki/Wererat \"Wererat\"), @ / d [werejackal](/wiki/Werejackal \"Werejackal\"), and @ / d [werewolf](/wiki/Werewolf \"Werewolf\"): [Werecreatures](/wiki/Werecreature \"Werecreature\") are likely to be the first [shapeshifters](/wiki/Shapeshifter \"Shapeshifter\") encountered, and are thankfully limited to just two forms. They are still a threat however, due to their [infectious bite](/wiki/Lycanthropy \"Lycanthropy\") and ability to summon up to five normal animals of their kind (e.g. normal [jackals](/wiki/Jackal \"Jackal\") or normal [rats](/wiki/Rat \"Rat\")) to tear you to shreds. [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") will only work on [werecreatures](/wiki/Werecreature \"Werecreature\") while they are in animal form. Should you be infected with [lycanthropy](/wiki/Lycanthropy \"Lycanthropy\"), you should soon eat a [sprig of wolfsbane](/wiki/Sprig_of_wolfsbane \"Sprig of wolfsbane\") or quaff a [potion of holy water](/wiki/Potion_of_holy_water \"Potion of holy water\") to cure it; if you have neither, you should [pray](/wiki/Pray \"Pray\") as soon as it is safe to. Note that for one [turn](/wiki/Turn \"Turn\") after a [werecreature](/wiki/Werecreature \"Werecreature\")'s transformation to animal form, it will ignore [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\"), giving it an opportunity to infect you.\n\nThese [monsters](/wiki/Monster \"Monster\") require special precautions but are not especially dangerous if handled correctly.\n\n- The three starting [pet](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\") types and their stronger forms: u [horses](/wiki/Horse \"Horse\"), d [dogs](/wiki/Dog \"Dog\"), and f [cats](/wiki/Cat \"Cat\"): All of these species are much faster than you and have strong attacks. They can be tamed by throwing [food](/wiki/Food \"Food\") they like at them (they will eat it) or pacified by throwing any other type of [food](/wiki/Food \"Food\"). You might consider saving some [tripe](/wiki/Tripe_ration \"Tripe ration\") (for cats and dogs) and produce (for horses), but even a [food ration](/wiki/Food_ration \"Food ration\") or [tin](/wiki/Tin \"Tin\") will make them stop killing you. [Eggs](/wiki/Egg \"Egg\"), [melons](/wiki/Melon \"Melon\"), and [cream pies](/wiki/Cream_pie \"Cream pie\") will usually be destroyed by throwing them, preventing them from taming or pacifying your target. See [diet](/wiki/Diet \"Diet\") for details. As usual, they respect [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\").\n- e [floating eye](/wiki/Floating_eye \"Floating eye\"): Floating eyes are very slow and cannot directly damage you. They are still very dangerous due to their [passive attack](/wiki/Passive_attack \"Passive attack\")—should you fight them in melee, you will often be [paralyzed](/wiki/Paralysis \"Paralysis\") for several hundred [turns](/wiki/Turn \"Turn\"), during which you are a sitting duck. Attack them with ranged weapons or apply a [polearm](/wiki/Polearm \"Polearm\"), or simply ignore them. If they leave a [corpse](/wiki/Corpse \"Corpse\"), be sure to eat it, as [intrinsic telepathy](/wiki/Intrinsic_telepathy \"Intrinsic telepathy\") is valuable.\n- [m](/wiki/Mimic \"Mimic\") [Mimics](/wiki/Mimic \"Mimic\"): the m [small mimic](/wiki/Small_mimic \"Small mimic\"), m [large mimic](/wiki/Large_mimic \"Large mimic\"), and m [giant mimic](/wiki/Giant_mimic \"Giant mimic\"): Pose as items in [shops](/wiki/Shop \"Shop\") and kill unsuspecting players. They hit very hard and can [grab onto you](/wiki/Grabbing_attack#sticky_attack \"Grabbing attack\") but move very slowly. [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") is very useful against one that grabs you. See the [mimic page](/wiki/Mimic#Strategy \"Mimic\") for more advice.\n\n## The midgame\n\nIn the middle phase of the game, survival is less of a pressure and the game is about completing an [ascension kit](/wiki/Ascension_kit \"Ascension kit\"). The distinction between early game and midgame isn't clear. Depending on who is defining it, the transition point may be reaching [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") and [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\"), collecting the [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") prize, or the point at which you no longer fear [team a](/wiki/Ant \"Ant\"). The floors between the [Quest](/wiki/Quest \"Quest\") portal and the [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\") are almost certainly midgame territory.\n\n### Midgame threats\n\n- L [lich](/wiki/Lich \"Lich\") and L [demilich](/wiki/Demilich \"Demilich\"): These [undead](/wiki/Undead \"Undead\") monstrosities are likely to be the first truly threatening [spellcasting monsters](/wiki/Monster_spells#mage_spells \"Monster spells\") the player encounters. Normal liches are relatively slow, but have a toolbox of spells allowing them to [lower your strength](/wiki/Drain_strength \"Drain strength\"), [curse your items](/wiki/Curse_items \"Curse items\"), [destroy your precious armor](/wiki/Destroy_armor \"Destroy armor\"), even [summon nasties](/wiki/Summon_nasties \"Summon nasties\"), and high level demiliches can even cast [touch of death](/wiki/Touch_of_death \"Touch of death\"). Demiliches are also faster. [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") can prevent them from touching you or using their worst spells on you, and it is therefore highly recommended. Blessed [scrolls of genocide](/wiki/Scroll_of_genocide \"Scroll of genocide\") are often used on liches, and has the benefit of also annihilating their stronger cousins, [master](/wiki/Master_lich \"Master lich\") and [arch-liches](/wiki/Arch-lich \"Arch-lich\") which cast the same set of spells but are more likely to be high enough level to use the monster dangerous ones, [summon nasties](/wiki/Summon_nasties \"Summon nasties\") and [touch of death](/wiki/Touch_of_death \"Touch of death\").\n\n- h [mind flayer](/wiki/Mind_flayer \"Mind flayer\") and h [master mind flayer](/wiki/Master_mind_flayer \"Master mind flayer\"): These flying abominations are not spellcasters, but instead have the ability to suck your brain. This attack drains your [intelligence](/wiki/Attribute \"Attribute\"), and can also cause you to [forget object identities and level layouts](/wiki/Amnesia \"Amnesia\"). If they reduce you to below 3 [intelligence](/wiki/Intelligence \"Intelligence\"), you will die instantly and cannot be saved even with an [amulet of life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\"). Attack them from range whenever possible; if you must fight them in melee, wear a (preferably [greased](/wiki/Greased \"Greased\")) helmet and use [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") religiously. If they are within one [turn](/wiki/Turn \"Turn\")'s movement of you you should engrave [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") with a guaranteed one turn source, e.g. a [wand of fire](/wiki/Wand_of_fire \"Wand of fire\") or an [athame](/wiki/Athame \"Athame\"). After they are dead, you can use a [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\") to restore your [intelligence](/wiki/Intelligence \"Intelligence\"), but you will not recover lost object identities or level maps. [Genocide](/wiki/Genocide \"Genocide\") is also popular here, but beware: if you are a [dwarf](/wiki/Dwarf_\\(starting_race\\) \"Dwarf (starting race)\"), blessed-genociding 'h' will [instantly kill you](/wiki/Instadeath \"Instadeath\").\n\n- H [titan](/wiki/Titan \"Titan\"): While normally quite rare, one variant of [Medusa's Island](/wiki/Medusa%27s_Island \"Medusa's Island\") contains a guaranteed titan near the up [staircase](/wiki/Staircase \"Staircase\"). They are almost always [peaceful](/wiki/Peaceful \"Peaceful\") to [lawful](/wiki/Lawful \"Lawful\") characters, but [neutral](/wiki/Neutral \"Neutral\") and [chaotic](/wiki/Chaotic \"Chaotic\") characters are out of luck. They are probably the first monster you will encounter capable of casting [summon nasties](/wiki/Summon_nasties \"Summon nasties\"), and worse, they are immune to [genocide](/wiki/Genocide \"Genocide\"). They respect [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\"), but be wary as several of their summoned minions ignore it.\n\n- ​; [Sea monsters](/wiki/Sea_monster \"Sea monster\"): Two sea monsters in particular, the ; [giant eel](/wiki/Giant_eel \"Giant eel\") and the ; [electric eel](/wiki/Electric_eel \"Electric eel\"), possess a two-move [drowning attack](/wiki/Drowning_attack \"Drowning attack\") that [kills you instantly](/wiki/Instadeath \"Instadeath\"). The move will fail if you wear a [greased](/wiki/Greased \"Greased\") or [oilskin cloak](/wiki/Oilskin_cloak \"Oilskin cloak\"), however. If you lack either, be adjacent to [water](/wiki/Moat \"Moat\") as little as possible. Electric eels can also destroy your [rings](/wiki/Ring \"Ring\") with their electrical attacks—including a worn [ring of levitation](/wiki/Ring_of_levitation \"Ring of levitation\"). They are sometimes [genocided](/wiki/Genocide \"Genocide\"), but less commonly than the previous two monster types. Eels and [sharks](/wiki/Shark \"Shark\") are guaranteed around [Medusa's island](/wiki/Medusa%27s_island \"Medusa's island\") and in the [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\") moat. They will appear in [swamps](/wiki/Special_room#swamp \"Special room\") as well, but those are rather rare. ; [Krakens](/wiki/Kraken \"Kraken\"), A [couatls](/wiki/Couatl \"Couatl\"), and S [pythons](/wiki/Python \"Python\") are also capable of drowning you, but krakens are slow and couatls and pythons rarely near water.\n\n- c [chickatrice](/wiki/Chickatrice \"Chickatrice\") and c [cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\"): These monsters are possibly the most complex monsters in the game; it is important to understand what will and what will not [petrify](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\") you. The main article goes into detail, but the gist is that touching a cockatrice, living or dead, in any way, will kill you instantly. If [gloves](/wiki/Gloves \"Gloves\") are worn, they can be touched with your [hands](/wiki/Hands \"Hands\"), but beware of [wielding their corpse](/wiki/Cockatrice#Use_as_a_weapon \"Cockatrice\")—should you fall in a [pit](/wiki/Pit \"Pit\") or down a [staircase](/wiki/Staircase \"Staircase\"), you will touch it no matter what you wear. Should you begin to stiffen from their hiss, eat a [lizard](/wiki/Lizard \"Lizard\") or [acidic corpse](/wiki/Acid \"Acid\"), cast [stone to flesh](/wiki/Spellbook_of_stone_to_flesh \"Spellbook of stone to flesh\") at yourself, or quaff a [potion of acid](/wiki/Potion_of_acid \"Potion of acid\") posthaste; if no other option is available, [pray](/wiki/Pray \"Pray\"). With correct precautions, they become less dangerous and more of a powerful weapon. Just beware of leaving them on the floor, in case you walk over it while [blinded](/wiki/Blind \"Blind\") or have it used against you by an [intelligent](/wiki/Intelligent_monster \"Intelligent monster\") foe.\n\n- R [rust monster](/wiki/Rust_monster \"Rust monster\"): These monsters can be unbelievably irritating. Both their main attacks and their [passive attack](/wiki/Passive_attack \"Passive attack\") will cause [metal](/wiki/Metal \"Metal\") items to [rust](/wiki/Erosion \"Erosion\"), reducing their effectiveness. They will also eat any [metal](/wiki/Metal \"Metal\") items they find, including good items you may have wanted to obtain. If they are alone, you can simply punch them to death while wearing no [metal](/wiki/Metal \"Metal\") [armor](/wiki/Armor \"Armor\") uncovered by a cloak; they can do no physical damage. If not alone, use the almighty [E-Word](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") or zap them with [wands](/wiki/Wand \"Wand\") and spells. A [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\") is a good weapon here too.\n\n- H [minotaur](/wiki/Minotaur \"Minotaur\"): These monsters ignore [Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\") and have very high damage, but they also have no [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance_\\(monster\\) \"Magic resistance (monster)\"). They are generated by the [summon nasties](/wiki/Summon_nasties \"Summon nasties\") spell and can be created inside any [maze](/wiki/Maze \"Maze\"). They will not normally appear before late game, but the [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\") contains a small piece of [maze](/wiki/Maze \"Maze\") and there can be up to 3 complete [maze](/wiki/Maze \"Maze\") levels between [Medusa's Island](/wiki/Medusa%27s_Island \"Medusa's Island\") and the Castle, giving you plenty of chances to meet them early. A minotaur at the [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\") is particularly dangerous because the [maze](/wiki/Maze \"Maze\") is so small; if it appears there you are usually forced to fight it.\n\n- [Wand of death](/wiki/Wand_of_death \"Wand of death\"): Attack wands are always something to be worried about until you get [reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\") or [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\"), but once you're past the early game, the danger becomes much more serious: level 8+ intelligent monsters can generate with this wand as an offensive item. If you still don't have reflection and magic resistance after clearing Sokoban and [Mine's End](/wiki/Mine%27s_End \"Mine's End\"), it may be worth going out of your way to get protection from this wand. Possible strategies include:\n\n  - Blessing and using [magic lamps](/wiki/Magic_lamp \"Magic lamp\") and [smoky potions](/wiki/Smoky_potion \"Smoky potion\"), sitting on [thrones](/wiki/Throne \"Throne\"), and using [fountains](/wiki/Fountains \"Fountains\") on early floors for a chance to wish for reflection or magic resistance;\n  - Diving down to Medusa's Island for the possible [shield of reflection](/wiki/Shield_of_reflection \"Shield of reflection\") in the statue of Perseus;\n  - Diving down to the Castle to get the [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\");\n  - Finishing the [Quest](/wiki/Quest \"Quest\") as soon as possible to get reflection or magic resistance from your [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\") (varies by role and [quest nemesis](/wiki/Quest_nemesis \"Quest nemesis\") difficulty);\n  - Obtaining [polymorph control](/wiki/Polymorph_control \"Polymorph control\") and a way to [polymorph](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") yourself so you can turn into an [undead](/wiki/Undead \"Undead\") creature to become immune to wands of death.\n  - Until you're protected from the wand of death, you may want to take extra care around monsters that are eligible for it: stay out of zapping range until you can attack, get powerful weapons to kill them quickly, and have a means of [teleportation](/wiki/Teleportation \"Teleportation\"), [sleep](/wiki/Sleep \"Sleep\"), or [paralysis](/wiki/Paralysis \"Paralysis\") on hand in case you find out a monster has a wand of death (and you are still alive to worry about it). The most common monsters you will encounter at this stage that are eligible for the wand of death include T [trolls](/wiki/Troll_\\(monster_class\\) \"Troll (monster class)\"), O [ogres](/wiki/Ogre_\\(monster_class\\) \"Ogre (monster class)\"), H [giants](/wiki/Giants \"Giants\"), @ [elves](/wiki/Elves \"Elves\"), and members of @ [the Yendorian army](/wiki/Yendorian_army \"Yendorian army\").\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nUnicorn horns can no longer restore reduced attributes. Alternatives include [potions of restore ability](/wiki/Potion_of_restore_ability \"Potion of restore ability\"), the [restore ability spell](/wiki/Spellbook_of_restore_ability \"Spellbook of restore ability\"), [prayer](/wiki/Prayer \"Prayer\"), or [gain ability](/wiki/Gain_ability \"Gain ability\").\n\n## The late game\n\nIn the late game, survival is almost guaranteed (bar those [YASDs](/wiki/YASD \"YASD\") that an [amulet of life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\") could have saved you from), and the goal is to get the [Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor \"Amulet of Yendor\") and resurface. The late game is generally said to start either when you get the [wand of wishing](/wiki/Wand_of_wishing \"Wand of wishing\") from the [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\"), or when you begin exploring [Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\"); some players in some roles (e.g., [Samurai](/wiki/Samurai \"Samurai\")) usually do the [Quest](/wiki/Quest \"Quest\") after the [Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\").\n\n### Late game threats\n\n- [YASD](/wiki/YASD \"YASD\"): Most deaths here are either through player error or handling difficult [conducts](/wiki/Conduct \"Conduct\").\n\n  - H [minotaur](/wiki/Minotaur \"Minotaur\"): If something is going to kill you in melee, this is it.\n  - h [mind flayer](/wiki/Mind_flayer \"Mind flayer\") and h [master mind flayer](/wiki/Master_mind_flayer \"Master mind flayer\"): Amnesia is still a substantial setback, and a brainless death is still possible. And remember that unlike most of the post-[Castle](/wiki/Castle \"Castle\") blunders you could make, all the [amulets of life saving](/wiki/Amulets_of_life_saving \"Amulets of life saving\") in the world won't save you from brainlessness.\n  - P [green slime](/wiki/Green_slime \"Green slime\"): Not especially dangerous, but (rarely) being touched by them or (definitely) eating them can start a long [delayed instadeath](/wiki/Delayed_instadeath \"Delayed instadeath\") ([sliming](/wiki/Sliming \"Sliming\")) curable by [fire](/wiki/Fire \"Fire\"). Be aware that they exist.\n  - & [Juiblex](/wiki/Juiblex \"Juiblex\"): A [major demon](/wiki/Major_demon \"Major demon\") who inhabits [his own swamp](/wiki/Juiblex%27s_swamp \"Juiblex's swamp\"), guaranteed to appear in [Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\"). He is easy to kill but will almost surely infect you with a deadly [sickness](/wiki/Sickness \"Sickness\") at least once, which you must remember to cure with your [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\").\n  - & [Demogorgon](/wiki/Demogorgon \"Demogorgon\"): Not guaranteed to appear (in [vanilla](/wiki/Vanilla \"Vanilla\")), but can ruin an ascension run if you're not prepared; he's quite nasty. Read his article for tips.\n  - c [chickatrice](/wiki/Chickatrice \"Chickatrice\") and c [cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\"): A monster wielding a cockatrice corpse is one of the few truly frightening things at this point, and the cockatrice itself presents many possible [YASDs](/wiki/YASD \"YASD\").\n  - L [master lich](/wiki/Master_lich \"Master lich\") and L [arch-lich](/wiki/Arch-lich \"Arch-lich\"): These purple Ls will begin appearing frequently in [Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\"). They are stronger than the [lich](/wiki/Lich \"Lich\") and demilich. They are also [covetous](/wiki/Covetous \"Covetous\"), giving them the ability to teleport back and forth between you and the [upstairs](/wiki/Staircase \"Staircase\") where they will heal. They have a much higher [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance_\\(monster\\) \"Magic resistance (monster)\") and base level, practically guaranteeing that they can cast their full repertoire of spells.\n\n## The [ascension run](/wiki/Ascension_run \"Ascension run\")\n\nFinally, on the run your final death is a (slim) possibility again while racing to [ascend](/wiki/Ascension \"Ascension\"). Your character is likely fully equipped and very strong, but there are a few things to worry about. This stage of the game begins by recovering the [Book of the Dead](/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead \"Book of the Dead\").\n\nIt's worth noting that most players treat \"end game\" as a synonym for \"[ascension run](/wiki/Ascension_run \"Ascension run\")\", but [NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\") itself reserves the title \"End Game\" for the [Elemental Planes](/wiki/Elemental_Planes \"Elemental Planes\") and the [Astral Plane](/wiki/Astral_Plane \"Astral Plane\") (though it uses \"Elemental Planes\" internally for the [Astral Plane](/wiki/Astral_Plane \"Astral Plane\") as well as [the other four planes](/wiki/Elemental_Planes \"Elemental Planes\")). Most players refer to those as just \"the Planes\".

Read up on them.\n- @ [Wizard of Yendor](/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor \"Wizard of Yendor\"): The Wizard will return from the dead an infinite number of times, and will not stop appearing until you reach the [Astral plane](/wiki/Astral_plane \"Astral plane\"). Even while dead he will [strike out at you](/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor#Harassment \"Wizard of Yendor\").\n- E [air elemental](/wiki/Air_elemental \"Air elemental\"): On the [Plane of Air](/wiki/Plane_of_Air \"Plane of Air\"), Air Elementals are substantially stronger than in the rest of the game, and can rapidly kill characters with a subpar [Armor Class](/wiki/Armor_Class \"Armor Class\"). It can help to have some quick method of defeating or neutralizing them.\n- h [mind flayer](/wiki/Mind_flayer \"Mind flayer\") and h [master mind flayer](/wiki/Master_mind_flayer \"Master mind flayer\"): If you get amnesiaed now you will have to remap the levels you lost with [The Wizard of Yendor](/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Yendor \"The Wizard of Yendor\") on your tail.\n- % [Cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") corpses: These are a common choice on the ascension run, especially on the [Astral Plane](/wiki/Astral_Plane \"Astral Plane\"); as always, be careful with them.\n- The [Astral Plane](/wiki/Astral_Plane \"Astral Plane\"), the last level in the game, is by far the place where most ascension run deaths take place. Move slow and play carefully. Request the help of the players in [#nethack](/wiki/Libera \"Libera\") if you need it. [Player monsters](/wiki/Player_monster \"Player monster\") in particular may spawn with [Vorpal Blade](/wiki/Vorpal_Blade \"Vorpal Blade\") if it hasn't been generated yet, and can use that to kill you instantly with a 5% chance.\n\n[![This article has been updated to reflect NetHack 3.6.6.

The main article goes into detail, but the gist is that touching a cockatrice, living or dead, in any way, will kill you instantly. If <a href=\"/wiki/Gloves\" title=\"Gloves\">gloves</a> are worn, they can be touched with your <a href=\"/wiki/Hands\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hands\">hands</a>, but beware of <a href=\"/wiki/Cockatrice#Use_as_a_weapon\" title=\"Cockatrice\">wielding their corpse</a>&#8212;should you fall in a <a href=\"/wiki/Pit\" title=\"Pit\">pit</a> or down a <a href=\"/wiki/Staircase\" title=\"Staircase\">staircase</a>, you will touch it no matter what you wear. Should you begin to stiffen from their hiss, eat a <a href=\"/wiki/Lizard\" title=\"Lizard\">lizard</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Acid\" title=\"Acid\">acidic corpse</a>, cast <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_stone_to_flesh\" title=\"Spellbook of stone to flesh\">stone to flesh</a> at yourself, or quaff a <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_acid\" title=\"Potion of acid\">potion of acid</a> posthaste; if no other option is available, <a href=\"/wiki/Pray\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pray\">pray</a>. With correct precautions, they become less dangerous and more of a powerful weapon. Just beware of leaving them on the floor, in case you walk over it while <a href=\"/wiki/Blind\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Blind\">blinded</a> or have it used against you by an <a href=\"/wiki/Intelligent_monster\" title=\"Intelligent monster\">intelligent</a> foe.</li>\n<li><span class=\"nhsym clr-brown\">R</span>&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Rust_monster\" title=\"Rust monster\">rust monster</a>: These monsters can be unbelievably irritating. Both their main attacks and their <a href=\"/wiki/Passive_attack\" title=\"Passive attack\">passive attack</a> will cause <a href=\"/wiki/Metal\" title=\"Metal\">metal</a> items to <a href=\"/wiki/Erosion\" title=\"Erosion\">rust</a>, reducing their effectiveness. They will also eat any <a href=\"/wiki/Metal\" title=\"Metal\">metal</a> items they find, including good items you may have wanted to obtain. If they are alone, you can simply punch them to death while wearing no <a href=\"/wiki/Metal\" title=\"Metal\">metal</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Armor\" title=\"Armor\">armor</a> uncovered by a cloak; they can do no physical damage. If not alone, use the almighty <a href=\"/wiki/Elbereth\" title=\"Elbereth\">E-Word</a> or zap them with <a href=\"/wiki/Wand\" title=\"Wand\">wands</a> and spells. A <a href=\"/wiki/Unicorn_horn\" title=\"Unicorn horn\">unicorn horn</a> is a good weapon here too.</li>\n<li><span class=\"nhsym clr-brown\">H</span>&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Minotaur\" title=\"Minotaur\">minotaur</a>: These monsters ignore <a href=\"/wiki/Elbereth\" title=\"Elbereth\">Elbereth</a> and have very high damage, but they also have no <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance_(monster)\" title=\"Magic resistance (monster)\">magic resistance</a>. They are generated by the <a href=\"/wiki/Summon_nasties\" title=\"Summon nasties\">summon nasties</a> spell and can be created inside any <a href=\"/wiki/Maze\" title=\"Maze\">maze</a>. They will not normally appear before late game, but the <a href=\"/wiki/Castle\" title=\"Castle\">Castle</a> contains a small piece of <a href=\"/wiki/Maze\" title=\"Maze\">maze</a> and there can be up to 3 complete <a href=\"/wiki/Maze\" title=\"Maze\">maze</a> levels between <a href=\"/wiki/Medusa%27s_Island\" title=\"Medusa&#39;s Island\">Medusa's Island</a> and the Castle, giving you plenty of chances to meet them early. A minotaur at the <a href=\"/wiki/Castle\" title=\"Castle\">Castle</a> is particularly dangerous because the <a href=\"/wiki/Maze\" title=\"Maze\">maze</a> is so small; if it appears there you are usually forced to fight it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_death\" title=\"Wand of death\">Wand of death</a>: Attack wands are always something to be worried about until you get <a href=\"/wiki/Reflection\" title=\"Reflection\">reflection</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_resistance\" title=\"Magic resistance\">magic resistance</a>, but once you're past the early game, the danger becomes much more serious: level 8+ intelligent monsters can generate with this wand as an offensive item. If you still don't have reflection and magic resistance after clearing Sokoban and <a href=\"/wiki/Mine%27s_End\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mine&#39;s End\">Mine's End</a>, it may be worth going out of your way to get protection from this wand. Possible strategies include:\n<ul><li>Blessing and using <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_lamp\" title=\"Magic lamp\">magic lamps</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Smoky_potion\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Smoky potion\">smoky potions</a>, sitting on <a href=\"/wiki/Throne\" title=\"Throne\">thrones</a>, and using <a href=\"/wiki/Fountains\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fountains\">fountains</a> on early floors for a chance to wish for reflection or magic resistance;</li>\n<li>Diving down to Medusa's Island for the possible <a href=\"/wiki/Shield_of_reflection\" title=\"Shield of reflection\">shield of reflection</a> in the statue of Perseus;</li>\n<li>Diving down to the Castle to get the <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_wishing\" title=\"Wand of wishing\">wand of wishing</a>;</li>\n<li>Finishing the <a href=\"/wiki/Quest\" title=\"Quest\">Quest</a> as soon as possible to get reflection or magic resistance from your <a href=\"/wiki/Quest_artifact\" title=\"Quest artifact\">quest artifact</a> (varies by role and <a href=\"/wiki/Quest_nemesis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quest nemesis\">quest nemesis</a> difficulty);</li>\n<li>Obtaining <a href=\"/wiki/Polymorph_control\" title=\"Polymorph control\">polymorph control</a> and a way to <a href=\"/wiki/Polymorph\" title=\"Polymorph\">polymorph</a> yourself so you can turn into an <a href=\"/wiki/Undead\" title=\"Undead\">undead</a> creature to become immune to wands of death.</li>\n<li>Until you're protected from the wand of death, you may want to take extra care around monsters that are eligible for it: stay out of zapping range until you can attack, get powerful weapons to kill them quickly, and have a means of <a href=\"/wiki/Teleportation\" title=\"Teleportation\">teleportation</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Sleep\" title=\"Sleep\">sleep</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Paralysis\" title=\"Paralysis\">paralysis</a> on hand in case you find out a monster has a wand of death (and you are still alive to worry about it).

most games, a [[player]] character's progress through ''[[NetHack]]'' can be broken down into several '''game stages'''.\n\n{{tocright}}\n\n==The early game==\nThe first stage is the early game where survival and sometimes securing [[food]] is of supreme importance. For many roles, the [[pet#starting_pet|starting pet]] is likely more powerful than the character itself. Securing basic [[armor]] and [[weapon|weaponry]] is a top priority; use your [[pet]] to [[curse testing#pet_testing|test]] the [[BUC]] status of items before you use or wear them. Many new players have trouble finding enough food: when they are [[Nutrition|weak with hunger]] they should probably [[prayer|pray]] for nutrition and save their [[permafood]] for when they cannot pray. More experienced players will find they have enough [[food]] almost all the time and will want to eat the [[permafood]] and conserve their ability to pray. Safe [[corpse]]s are preferable to both, of course. Above all else, take your time and be careful, unless you have chosen to [[speedrun]], NetHack is not a race! The early game can be the most difficult stage of [[NetHack]].\n\n===Early game threats===\nRanked roughly in order of danger from most to least.\n* Team {{mcsl|a}}: As a rule of thumb, any [[monster]] represented by an {{monclasssym|a}} is a huge threat to an early character. They have high [[speed]], and get multiple attacks on each of their many [[turn]]s. To top it off, all of these monsters are generated in groups. Engrave [[Elbereth]] at first sight with these creatures, even if just with your [[fingers]]. Using [[attack wand]]s is not out of the question either.\n** {{monsymlink|soldier ant}} and {{monsymlink|killer bee}}: These can [[poison]] you to reduce your [[strength]], [[hit points]], or even cause [[instadeath|instant death]] if the RNG hates you. [[Magic cancellation]] will help block the [[poison]] but not the physical damage.\n** {{monsymlink|fire ant}}: These cannot [[poison]] you, but instead can light you on [[fire]], causing [[scroll]]s to [[fire|burn]], [[potion]]s to [[fire|boil]], and some [[armor]] to smolder. Again, [[magic cancellation]] can help somewhat by blocking the fire damage, but not the physical damage.\n** {{monsymlink|giant ant}}: These are mercifully much weaker than their soldier cousins, but are not to be underestimated; many a character has been killed by these insects.\n** {{monsymlink|giant beetle}}: These are an exception; they are very slow and have only one attack. Characters can easily use [[hit and run]] tactics to defeat them.\n* {{monsymlink|leocrotta}}: They are fast enough to get 3 [[turn]]s for every 2 of a character who isn't [[fast]] or [[very fast]], and have three highly damaging attacks. They thankfully lack any [[resistance]]s and have low [[Magic resistance (monster)|MR]], meaning that [[attack wand]]s are quite useful. They respect [[Elbereth]].\n* [[Unicorn]]s: the {{monsymlink|white unicorn}}, {{monsymlink|gray unicorn}}, and the {{monsymlink|black unicorn}}: Unicorns have potent attacks, but will try to remain a knight's move away from you instead of engaging. A hapless [[fast]], [[very fast]], or [[invisible]] player can end up adjacent to one however, and it will continue attacking until you or it dies. Use [[Elbereth]] or pacify it by throwing a [[gem]] at it, which may also alter your [[Luck]]; see [[unicorn|the main article]] for details.\n* [[Lycanthrope]]s: the {{monsymlink|wererat}}, {{monsymlink|werejackal}}, and {{monsymlink|werewolf}}: [[Werecreature]]s are likely to be the first [[shapeshifter]]s encountered, and are thankfully limited to just two forms. They are still a threat however, due to their [[lycanthropy|infectious bite]] and ability to summon up to five normal animals of their kind (e.g. normal [[jackal]]s or normal [[rat]]s) to tear you to shreds. [[Elbereth]] will only work on [[werecreature]]s while they are in animal form. Should you be infected with [[lycanthropy]], you should soon eat a [[sprig of wolfsbane]] or quaff a [[potion of holy water]] to cure it; if you have neither, you should [[pray]] as soon as it is safe to. Note that for one [[turn]] after a [[werecreature]]'s transformation to animal form, it will ignore [[Elbereth]], giving it an opportunity to infect you.\n\nThese [[monster]]s require special precautions but are not especially dangerous if handled correctly.\n* The three starting [[pet]] types and their stronger forms: {{brown|u}} [[horse]]s, {{white|d}} [[dog]]s, and {{white|f}} [[cat]]s: All of these species are much faster than you and have strong attacks. They can be tamed by throwing [[food]] they like at them (they will eat it) or pacified by throwing any other type of [[food]]. You might consider saving some [[tripe ration|tripe]] (for cats and dogs) and produce (for horses), but even a [[food ration]] or [[tin]] will make them stop killing you. [[Egg]]s, [[melon]]s, and [[cream pie]]s will usually be destroyed by throwing them, preventing them from taming or pacifying your target. See [[diet]] for details. As usual, they respect [[Elbereth]].\n* {{monsymlink|floating eye}}: Floating eyes are very slow and cannot directly damage you. They are still very dangerous due to their [[passive attack]]&mdash;should you fight them in melee, you will often be [[paralysis|paralyzed]] for several hundred [[turn]]s, during which you are a sitting duck. Attack them with ranged weapons or apply a [[polearm]], or simply ignore them. If they leave a [[corpse]], be sure to eat it, as [[intrinsic telepathy]] is valuable.\n* {{mcsl|m}} [[Mimic]]s: the {{monsymlink|small mimic}}, {{monsymlink|large mimic}}, and {{monsymlink|giant mimic}}: Pose as items in [[shop]]s and kill unsuspecting players. They hit very hard and can [[grabbing attack#sticky_attack|grab onto you]] but move very slowly. [[Elbereth]] is very useful against one that grabs you. See the [[mimic#Strategy|mimic page]] for more advice.\n\n==The midgame==\nIn the middle phase of the game, survival is less of a pressure and the game is about completing an [[ascension kit]]. The distinction between early game and midgame isn't clear. Depending on who is defining it, the transition point may be reaching [[Sokoban]] and [[Minetown]], collecting the [[Sokoban]] prize, or the point at which you no longer fear [[ant|team a]]. The floors between the [[Quest]] portal and the [[Castle]] are almost certainly midgame territory.\n\n===Midgame threats===\n* {{monsymlink|lich}} and {{monsymlink|demilich}}: These [[undead]] monstrosities are likely to be the first truly threatening [[monster spells#mage_spells|spellcasting monsters]] the player encounters. Normal liches are relatively slow, but have a toolbox of spells allowing them to [[drain strength|lower your strength]], [[curse items|curse your items]], [[destroy armor|destroy your precious armor]], even [[summon nasties]], and high level demiliches can even cast [[touch of death]]. Demiliches are also faster. [[Elbereth]] can prevent them from touching you or using their worst spells on you, and it is therefore highly recommended. Blessed [[scroll of genocide|scrolls of genocide]] are often used on liches, and has the benefit of also annihilating their stronger cousins, [[master lich|master]] and [[arch-lich]]es which cast the same set of spells but are more likely to be high enough level to use the monster dangerous ones, [[summon nasties]] and [[touch of death]].\n* {{monsymlink|mind flayer}} and {{monsymlink|master mind flayer}}: These flying abominations are not spellcasters, but instead have the ability to suck your brain. This attack drains your [[attribute|intelligence]], and can also cause you to [[amnesia|forget object identities and level layouts]]. If they reduce you to below 3 [[intelligence]], you will die instantly and cannot be saved even with an [[amulet of life saving]]. Attack them from range whenever possible; if you must fight them in melee, wear a (preferably [[greased]]) helmet and use [[Elbereth]] religiously. If they are within one [[turn]]'s movement of you you should engrave [[Elbereth]] with a guaranteed one turn source, e.g. a [[wand of fire]] or an [[athame]]. After they are dead, you can use a [[unicorn horn]] to restore your [[intelligence]], but you will not recover lost object identities or level maps. [[Genocide]] is also popular here, but beware: if you are a [[Dwarf (starting race)|dwarf]], blessed-genociding 'h' will [[instadeath|instantly kill you]].\n* {{monsymlink|titan}}: While normally quite rare, one variant of [[Medusa's Island]] contains a guaranteed titan near the up [[staircase]]. They are almost always [[peaceful]] to [[lawful]] characters, but [[neutral]] and [[chaotic]] characters are out of luck. They are probably the first monster you will encounter capable of casting [[summon nasties]], and worse, they are immune to [[genocide]]. They respect [[Elbereth]], but be wary as several of their summoned minions ignore it.\n* {{monclasssym|;}} [[Sea monster]]s: Two sea monsters in particular, the {{cyan|;}} [[giant eel]] and the {{blue|;}} [[electric eel]], possess a two-move [[drowning attack]] that [[instadeath|kills you instantly]]. The move will fail if you wear a [[greased]] or [[oilskin cloak]], however. If you lack either, be adjacent to [[moat|water]] as little as possible. Electric eels can also destroy your [[ring]]s with their electrical attacks&mdash;including a worn [[ring of levitation]]. They are sometimes [[genocide]]d, but less commonly than the previous two monster types. Eels and [[shark]]s are guaranteed around [[Medusa's island]] and in the [[Castle]] moat. They will appear in [[special room#swamp|swamps]] as well, but those are rather rare. {{monsymlink|Kraken}}s, {{monsymlink|couatl}}s, and {{monsymlink|python}}s are also capable of drowning you, but krakens are slow and couatls and pythons rarely near water.\n* {{monsymlink|chickatrice}} and {{monsymlink|cockatrice}}: These monsters are possibly the most complex monsters in the game; it is important to understand what will and what will not [[stoning|petrify]] you. The main article goes into detail, but the gist is that touching a cockatrice, living or dead, in any way, will kill you instantly. If [[gloves]] are worn, they can be touched with your [[hands]], but beware of [[Cockatrice#Use as a weapon|wielding their corpse]]&mdash;should you fall in a [[pit]] or down a [[staircase]], you will touch it no matter what you wear. Should you begin to stiffen from their hiss, eat a [[lizard]] or [[acid|acidic corpse]], cast {{spell of|stone to flesh}} at yourself, or quaff a [[potion of acid]] posthaste; if no other option is available, [[pray]]. With correct precautions, they become less dangerous and more of a powerful weapon. Just beware of leaving them on the floor, in case you walk over it while [[blind]]ed or have it used against you by an [[intelligent monster|intelligent]] foe.\n* {{monsymlink|rust monster}}: These monsters can be unbelievably irritating. Both their main attacks and their [[passive attack]] will cause [[metal]] items to [[erosion|rust]], reducing their effectiveness. They will also eat any [[metal]] items they find, including good items you may have wanted to obtain. If they are alone, you can simply punch them to death while wearing no [[metal]] [[armor]] uncovered by a cloak; they can do no physical damage. If not alone, use the almighty [[Elbereth|E-Word]] or zap them with [[wand]]s and spells. A [[unicorn horn]] is a good weapon here too.\n* {{monsymlink|minotaur}}: These monsters ignore [[Elbereth]] and have very high damage, but they also have no [[Magic resistance (monster)|magic resistance]]. They are generated by the [[summon nasties]] spell and can be created inside any [[maze]]. They will not normally appear before late game, but the [[Castle]] contains a small piece of [[maze]] and there can be up to 3 complete [[maze]] levels between [[Medusa's Island]] and the Castle, giving you plenty of chances to meet them early. A minotaur at the [[Castle]] is particularly dangerous because the [[maze]] is so small; if it appears there you are usually forced to fight it.\n* [[Wand of death]]: Attack wands are always something to be worried about until you get [[reflection]] or [[magic resistance]], but once you're past the early game, the danger becomes much more serious: level 8+ intelligent monsters can generate with this wand as an offensive item. If you still don't have reflection and magic resistance after clearing Sokoban and [[Mine's End]], it may be worth going out of your way to get protection from this wand. Possible strategies include:\n** Blessing and using [[magic lamp]]s and [[smoky potion]]s, sitting on [[throne]]s, and using [[fountains]] on early floors for a chance to wish for reflection or magic resistance;\n** Diving down to Medusa's Island for the possible [[shield of reflection]] in the statue of Perseus;\n** Diving down to the Castle to get the [[wand of wishing]];\n** Finishing the [[Quest]] as soon as possible to get reflection or magic resistance from your [[quest artifact]] (varies by role and [[quest nemesis]] difficulty);\n** Obtaining [[polymorph control]] and a way to [[polymorph]] yourself so you can turn into an [[undead]] creature to become immune to wands of death.<!--(The [[Potion of vampire blood|potions of vampire blood]] added in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[UnNetHack]] make this much simpler, offering a guaranteed polymorph into a {{monsymlink|vampire}}, which is not only undead, but can also wear all armor and has intrinsic [[regeneration]], a [[life drain]]ing bite, and the ability to [[fly]]. [[Vampire_(starting_race)|Players that start as vampires]], of course, don't have to worry about wands of death to begin with.)-->\n** Until you're protected from the wand of death, you may want to take extra care around monsters that are eligible for it: stay out of zapping range until you can attack, get powerful weapons to kill them quickly, and have a means of [[teleportation]], [[sleep]], or [[paralysis]] on hand in case you find out a monster has a wand of death (and you are still alive to worry about it). The most common monsters you will encounter at this stage that are eligible for the wand of death include {{brown|T}} [[Troll (monster class)|trolls]], {{brown|O}} [[Ogre (monster class)|ogres]], {{gray|H}} [[giants]], {{green|@}} [[elves]], and members of {{gray|@}} [[Yendorian army|the Yendorian army]].\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Unicorn horns can no longer restore reduced attributes. Alternatives include [[Potion of restore ability|potions of restore ability]], the [[Spellbook of restore ability|restore ability spell]], [[prayer]], or [[gain ability]].}}\n\n==The late game==\nIn the late game, survival is almost guaranteed (bar those [[YASD]]s that an [[amulet of life saving]] could have saved you from), and the goal is to get the [[Amulet of Yendor]] and resurface. The late game is generally said to start either when you get the [[wand of wishing]] from the [[Castle]], or when you begin exploring [[Gehennom]]; some players in some roles (e.g., [[Samurai]]) usually do the [[Quest]] after the [[Castle]].\n\n===Late game threats===\n* [[YASD]]: Most deaths here are either through player error or handling difficult [[conduct]]s.\n** {{monsymlink|minotaur}}: If something is going to kill you in melee, this is it.\n** {{monsymlink|mind flayer}} and {{monsymlink|master mind flayer}}: Amnesia is still a substantial setback, and a brainless death is still possible. And remember that unlike most of the post-[[Castle]] blunders you could make, all the [[amulets of life saving]] in the world won't save you from brainlessness.\n** {{monsymlink|green slime}}: Not especially dangerous, but (rarely) being touched by them or (definitely) eating them can start a long [[delayed_instadeath|delayed instadeath]] ([[sliming]]) curable by [[fire]]. Be aware that they exist.\n** {{monsymlink|Juiblex}}: A [[major demon]] who inhabits [[Juiblex's swamp|his own swamp]], guaranteed to appear in [[Gehennom]]. He is easy to kill but will almost surely infect you with a deadly [[sickness]] at least once, which you must remember to cure with your [[unicorn horn]].\n** {{monsymlink|Demogorgon}}: Not guaranteed to appear (in [[vanilla]]), but can ruin an ascension run if you're not prepared; he's quite nasty. Read his article for tips.\n** {{monsymlink|chickatrice}} and {{monsymlink|cockatrice}}: A monster wielding a cockatrice corpse is one of the few truly frightening things at this point, and the cockatrice itself presents many possible [[YASD]]s.\n** {{monsymlink|master lich}} and {{monsymlink|arch-lich}}: These purple Ls will begin appearing frequently in [[Gehennom]]. They are stronger than the [[lich]] and demilich. They are also [[covetous]], giving them the ability to teleport back and forth between you and the [[staircase|upstairs]] where they will heal. They have a much higher [[magic resistance (monster)|magic resistance]] and base level, practically guaranteeing that they can cast their full repertoire of spells.\n\n==The [[ascension run]]==\nFinally, on the run your final death is a (slim) possibility again while racing to [[ascension|ascend]]. Your character is likely fully equipped and very strong, but there are a few things to worry about. This stage of the game begins by recovering the [[Book of the Dead]].\n\nIt's worth noting that most players treat \"end game\" as a synonym for \"[[ascension run]]\", but [[NetHack]] itself reserves the title \"End Game\" for the [[Elemental Planes]] and the [[Astral Plane]] (though it uses \"Elemental Planes\" internally for the [[Astral Plane]] as well as [[Elemental Planes|the other four planes]]). Most players refer to those as just \"the Planes\". The terminology is a tad hazy.\n\n===[[Ascension run]] threats===\n* The same warnings about [[YASD]]s from the late game apply here, but with a few additional notes.\n* The [[Riders]]: {{monsymlink|Famine}}, {{monsymlink|Pestilence}}, {{monsymlink|Death}}: Unique monsters you will meet on the Astral plane. Read up on them.\n* {{monsymlink|Wizard of Yendor}}: The Wizard will return from the dead an infinite number of times, and will not stop appearing until you reach the [[Astral plane]]. Even while dead he will [[Wizard of Yendor#Harassment|strike out at you]].\n* {{monsymlink|air elemental}}: On the [[Plane of Air]], Air Elementals are substantially stronger than in the rest of the game, and can rapidly kill characters with a subpar [[Armor Class]]. It can help to have some quick method of defeating or neutralizing them.\n* {{monsymlink|mind flayer}} and {{monsymlink|master mind flayer}}: If you get amnesiaed now you will have to remap the levels you lost with [[The Wizard of Yendor]] on your tail.\n* {{yellow|%}} [[Cockatrice]] corpses: These are a common choice on the ascension run, especially on the [[Astral Plane]]; as always, be careful with them.\n* The [[Astral Plane]], the last level in the game, is by far the place where most ascension run deaths take place. Move slow and play carefully. Request the help of the players in [[Libera|#nethack]] if you need it. [[Player monster]]s in particular may spawn with [[Vorpal Blade]] if it hasn't been generated yet, and can use that to kill you instantly with a 5% chance.\n{{nethack-366}}\n[[Category:Articles for beginners]]\n[[Category:Game stages]]\n[[Category:Strategy]]"}

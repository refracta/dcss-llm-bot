              |\n\nThe **unicorn** is a type of [monster](/wiki/Monster \"Monster\") that appears in *[NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\")*.\n\nThere are three types of unicorns: white, gray, and black, which correspond to [lawful](/wiki/Lawful \"Lawful\"), [neutral](/wiki/Neutral \"Neutral\"), and [chaotic](/wiki/Chaotic \"Chaotic\") alignments respectively. Directly killing a unicorn of your own alignment always carries a −5 [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") penalty; eating a unicorn corpse is safe regardless of alignment, and has a 27% chance of giving [poison resistance](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\").\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Generation](#Generation)\n\n- [2 Strategy](#Strategy)\n\n  - [2.1 Combat](#Combat)\n  - [2.2 Unicorn horns](#Unicorn_horns)\n  - [2.3 Sacrificing unicorns](#Sacrificing_unicorns)\n  - [2.4 Unicorns and gems](#Unicorns_and_gems)\n\n- [3 Messages](#Messages)\n\n- [4 Origin](#Origin)\n\n- [5 Encyclopedia entry](#Encyclopedia_entry)\n\n- [6 References](#References)\n\n## Generation\n\nUnicorns tend to appear somewhat early in the dungeon, starting around DL 7 or so. Normally generated unicorns matching your alignment will be peaceful;[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1) all others will be hostile. Unicorns in bones files or created by polymorph traps may be exceptions to this rule. White unicorns are generated slightly more frequently than the other types; this is to compensate for [Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\") preventing the random generation of lawful monsters.\n\nA unicorn is guaranteed to leave a [corpse](/wiki/Corpse \"Corpse\") behind unless killed in a way that destroys it (e.g., [disintegration](/wiki/Disintegration \"Disintegration\") or [digestion](/wiki/Digestion \"Digestion\")); it will also leave a [unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\") with its corpse, unless it has been [revived](/wiki/Revive \"Revive\") or is a [polymorphed](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") monster from a polymorph [trap](/wiki/Trap \"Trap\"), in which case it has only a 50% chance of leaving one.[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2)\n\n## Strategy\n\nUnicorns are extremely fast and can easily outpace even players with [very fast](/wiki/Very_fast \"Very fast\") speed. A unicorn that can see the player will attempt to avoid being \"lined up\" by the player (orthogonally or diagonally) even if they are hostile.[\\[3\\]](#cite_note-3)[\\[4\\]](#cite_note-4)[\\[5\\]](#cite_note-5) If a unicorn has no available neighboring square where it would not be lined up, it has a 50% chance of teleporting away each time it tries to move.[\\[6\\]](#cite_note-6) Attempting to move into melee range of a non-peaceful unicorn will usually cause it to attack you before leaping or teleporting away to an applicable square.\n\nUnicorns do surprising amounts of damage, getting in multiple kicks and butts per turn. However, because they will not intentionally move into melee range, it is usually not difficult to avoid combat with them. This does not apply to pet unicorns that attack monsters, which occurs normally as with any other pet.\n\n### Combat\n\nIn the beginning of the game, when you typically are weak and most need the horn, the most sound strategy for fighting unicorn is to let a [pet](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\") take it out; this naturally also avoids any Luck penalties for killing a co-aligned unicorn, though the pet may be killed if the unicorn lands enough counterattacks.\n\nMore combat-capable characters can also lead them into hallways and attack with projectiles from a safe distance; rays can be bounced at unicorns from walls, and a [boomerang](/wiki/Boomerang \"Boomerang\") can be handy as well. Savvy players can trap a unicorn using a [pit](/wiki/Pit \"Pit\") or a [beartrap](/wiki/Beartrap \"Beartrap\"), though each trap will only work once. Characters at [Skilled](/wiki/Skilled \"Skilled\") or better in [polearms](/wiki/Polearms \"Polearms\") or [lance](/wiki/Lance \"Lance\") can [pound](/wiki/Pound \"Pound\") the unicorn while it is a knight's move away with no fear of counterattacks. Players with [very fast](/wiki/Very_fast \"Very fast\") speed will have occasional chances to attack with ranged weapons or to close in for direct combat, and a well-armored and well-prepared player with speed can defeat a unicorn fairly easily.\n\nA good way of closing in on a unicorn is to use [invisibility](/wiki/Invisibility \"Invisibility\"): unicorns cannot [see invisible](/wiki/See_invisible \"See invisible\"), so that lining them up to throw weapons or gems at them is much easier. However, invisibility can backfire for a weak character: a hostile unicorn that can't see you will not know to stay a knight's move away, and so may end up skewering you if it accidentally closes in. Due to a bug, unicorns are not fooled by [displacement](/wiki/Displacement \"Displacement\") while moving to avoid you - once within melee range, however, hostile unicorns will attack as normal and possibly target your displaced image instead of you.[\\[7\\]](#cite_note-7)\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nThe displacement bug is fixed as of [commit 62e09ae](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/62e09ae9f31ea052142544ec0061c292c3d5642c) - unicorns try to avoid being lined up with where they *perceive* you to be, even if you are displaced.\n\n### Unicorn horns\n\n- *Main article: [Unicorn horn](/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"Unicorn horn\")*\n\nApplying a unicorn horn has a chance of curing blindness, hallucination, confusion, and stunning status effects, making a unicorn horn an essential item for all adventurers - see its article for more details.\n\nUnicorns can use their own horn to cure themselves of these effects, producing the message *\"The tip of the \\<color> unicorn's horn glows!\"* A player polymorphed into a unicorn can use the [#monster](/wiki/Monster_\\(command\\) \"Monster (command)\") extended command to do the same, acting as a uncursed unicorn horn would.\n\n### Sacrificing unicorns\n\n- *Main article: [Sacrifice#Sacrificing unicorns](/wiki/Sacrifice#Sacrificing_unicorns \"Sacrifice\")*\n\nSacrificing a unicorn at an [altar](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\") is a special case: sacrificing cross-aligned unicorns on your god's altar can reap [alignment](/wiki/Alignment_record \"Alignment record\") and [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") benefits, you should sacrifice on your own altar a unicorn of a different alignment. If the corpse, the altar, and you are three different alignments, it is just a regular sacrifice. However, sacrificing coaligned unicorns - or sacrificing *any* unicorn on an altar of its own alignment - will cause bad things to happen. See the article on sacrifices for more details.\n\n### Unicorns and gems\n\nThrowing any gem to any hostile unicorn will make it [peaceful](/wiki/Peaceful \"Peaceful\"). A tamed unicorn will catch and immediately drop gems thrown at it, without any effect on [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") or identification. Unicorns also pick up any gems and stones they come across, worthless or not.\n\nIf the gem is worthless glass, a rock, or a [gray stone](/wiki/Gray_stone \"Gray stone\"), it will not affect your Luck, and the unicorn will either \"graciously\" accept it or be \"not interested in your junk\". If it is valuable, a co-aligned unicorn \"gratefully\" keeps the gem and improves your [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\"), depending on the identification status of the gem: +5 points if the gem is formally identified, +2 points if type-[named](/wiki/Name \"Name\"), and +1 point if completely unknown.[\\[8\\]](#cite_note-8)\n\nCoaligned unicorns are great for improving Luck and sorting out worthless glass. The game does not check what the gem is named, or what its type is called, as long as one of them is defined - ideally, you should type-name all gems before throwing them at coaligned unicorns. It is easiest to increase Luck this way in a no-teleport level, e.g. [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\"), in order to prevent them teleporting away after each catch. If you are sure you will not need the unicorn again after, you may want to encourage a [pet](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\") to kill it so you can recover your gems without any Luck penalty.\n\nA cross-aligned unicorn will \"hesitatingly\" accept a valuable gem, and your Luck may increase or decrease by one point if the gem is not formally identified, and by up to three points if it is. It is not generally a good idea to throw gems at cross-aligned unicorns unless you're pretty sure they're glass.\n\n## Messages\n\n- The \\<color> unicorn's recently regrown horn crumbles to dust.\n\n  A revived unicorn died, but did not drop a unicorn horn.\n\n- The tip of the \\<color> unicorn's horn glows!\n\n  A unicorn cured a status problem using its horn.\n\n- The \\<color> unicorn catches and drops the \\<gem>.\n\n  You threw a gem at a tame unicorn.\n\n- The \\<color> unicorn is not interested in your junk.\n\n  You threw a formally identified or type-named piece of worthless glass, a rock, or a gray stone at a unicorn.\n\n- The \\<color> unicorn hesitatingly accepts your gift.\n\n  You threw a valuable gem at a cross-aligned unicorn, and your Luck may have gone up or down.\n\n- The \\<color> unicorn graciously accepts your gift.\n\n  You threw an unidentified piece of worthless glass or a gray stone at a unicorn.\n\n- The \\<color> unicorn gratefully accepts your gift.\n\n  You threw a valuable gem at a coaligned unicorn, and your Luck increased by 1, 2, or 5.\n\n- The \\<color> unicorn catches the \\<color> gem.\n\n  You threw a (valuable or worthless) gem at a unicorn while blind.\n\n## Origin\n\n[![Wikipedia](/images/thumb/f/f8/Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png/50px-Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png)](/wiki/File:Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png \"Wikipedia\")\n\n[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page \"wikipedia:Main Page\") has an article about:\n\n***[Unicorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Unicorn \"wikipedia:Special:Search/Unicorn\")***\n\n[![Wikipedia](/images/thumb/f/f8/Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png/50px-Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png)](/wiki/File:Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png \"Wikipedia\")\n\n[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page \"wikipedia:Main Page\") has an article about:\n\n***[List of unicorns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unicorns \"wikipedia:List of unicorns\")***\n\nThe unicorn is a creature that features prominently in European-styled fairy tales, though it is much older and appears in many other folklores, being depicted as far back as the Indus Valley Civilization in ancient seals, and has been mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers such as Strabo, Pliny the Younger, and Aelian. In the Middle Ages, depictions of a unicorn trapped by a maiden were an elaborate allegory for the Incarnation of Christ (with the maiden representing the virgin Mary); this likely gave rise to the recurring motif of unicorns appearing to and/or being tameable only by a fair, virgin maiden. Naturally, unicorns are one of many folkloric creatures included in *[Dungeons & Dragons](/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons \"Dungeons & Dragons\")*.\n\nThe unicorn is commonly depicted as an equine beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead; it is quadrupedal and almost always equine or caprine in appearance, with white or light-colored hair. Unicorns are generally nearly impossible to catch, and are fittingly sought after for their various magical properties, such as those inherent to [its horn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_horn \"wikipedia:Unicorn horn\"); modern fiction often extends those properties to its other features, such as its hair or blood. \"Unicorn\" is used as a colloquial term that refers to someone or something that is rare and hard to find.\n\nThe Chinese *qilin* (Chinese: 麒麟), is sometimes called \"the Chinese unicorn\", and is described as a hybrid animal with the body of a deer, the head of a lion, green scales and a long forwardly-curved horn. The Japanese [ki-rin](/wiki/Ki-rin \"Ki-rin\") is based on the *qilin*, but more closely resembles the Western unicorn.\n\n## Encyclopedia entry\n\nMen have always sought the elusive unicorn, for the single twisted horn which projected from its forehead was thought to be a powerful talisman. It was said that the unicorn had simply to dip the tip of its horn in a muddy pool for the water to become pure. Men also believed that to drink from this horn was a protection against all sickness, and that if the horn was ground to a powder it would act as an antidote to all poisons. Less than 200 years ago in France, the horn of a unicorn was used in a ceremony to test the royal food for poison.  \nAlthough only the size of a small horse, the unicorn is a very fierce beast, capable of killing an elephant with a single thrust from its horn. Its fleetness of foot also makes this solitary creature difficult to capture. However, it can be tamed and captured by a maiden. Made gentle by the sight of a virgin, the unicorn can be lured to lay its head in her lap, and in this docile mood, the maiden may secure it with a golden rope.\n\n\\[ Mythical Beasts, by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]\n\n  \n\n\nMartin took a small sip of beer. \"Almost ready,\" he said.  \n\"You hold your beer awfully well.\"  \nTlingel laughed. \"A unicorn's horn is a detoxicant. Its possession is a universal remedy. I wait until I reach the warm glow stage, then I use my horn to burn off any excess and keep me right there.\"\n\n\\[ Unicorn Variations, by Roger Zelazny ]\n\n## References\n\n1.

This does not apply to pet unicorns that attack monsters, which occurs normally as with any other pet.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Combat\">Combat</span></h3>\n<p>In the beginning of the game, when you typically are weak and most need the horn, the most sound strategy for fighting unicorn is to let a <a href=\"/wiki/Pet\" title=\"Pet\">pet</a> take it out; this naturally also avoids any Luck penalties for killing a co-aligned unicorn, though the pet may be killed if the unicorn lands enough counterattacks.\n</p><p>More combat-capable characters can also lead them into hallways and attack with projectiles from a safe distance; rays can be bounced at unicorns from walls, and a <a href=\"/wiki/Boomerang\" title=\"Boomerang\">boomerang</a> can be handy as well. Savvy players can trap a unicorn using a <a href=\"/wiki/Pit\" title=\"Pit\">pit</a> or a <a href=\"/wiki/Beartrap\" title=\"Beartrap\">beartrap</a>, though each trap will only work once. Characters at <a href=\"/wiki/Skilled\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Skilled\">Skilled</a> or better in <a href=\"/wiki/Polearms\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Polearms\">polearms</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Lance\" title=\"Lance\">lance</a> can <a href=\"/wiki/Pound\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pound\">pound</a> the unicorn while it is a knight's move away with no fear of counterattacks. Players with <a href=\"/wiki/Very_fast\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Very fast\">very fast</a> speed will have occasional chances to attack with ranged weapons or to close in for direct combat, and a well-armored and well-prepared player with speed can defeat a unicorn fairly easily.\n</p><p>A good way of closing in on a unicorn is to use <a href=\"/wiki/Invisibility\" title=\"Invisibility\">invisibility</a>: unicorns cannot <a href=\"/wiki/See_invisible\" title=\"See invisible\">see invisible</a>, so that lining them up to throw weapons or gems at them is much easier. However, invisibility can backfire for a weak character: a hostile unicorn that can't see you will not know to stay a knight's move away, and so may end up skewering you if it accidentally closes in. Due to a bug, unicorns are not fooled by <a href=\"/wiki/Displacement\" title=\"Displacement\">displacement</a> while moving to avoid you - once within melee range, however, hostile unicorns will attack as normal and possibly target your displaced image instead of you.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"upcoming\">\n<p><i>The following information pertains to an upcoming version (<a href=\"/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0\" title=\"NetHack 3.7.0\">NetHack 3.7.0</a>).

If the corpse, the altar, and you are three different alignments, it is just a regular sacrifice. However, sacrificing coaligned unicorns - or sacrificing <i>any</i> unicorn on an altar of its own alignment - will cause bad things to happen. See the article on sacrifices for more details.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Unicorns_and_gems\">Unicorns and gems</span></h3>\n<p>Throwing any gem to any hostile unicorn will make it <a href=\"/wiki/Peaceful\" title=\"Peaceful\">peaceful</a>. A tamed unicorn will catch and immediately drop gems thrown at it, without any effect on <a href=\"/wiki/Luck\" title=\"Luck\">Luck</a> or identification. Unicorns also pick up any gems and stones they come across, worthless or not.\n</p><p>If the gem is worthless glass, a rock, or a <a href=\"/wiki/Gray_stone\" title=\"Gray stone\">gray stone</a>, it will not affect your Luck, and the unicorn will either \"graciously\" accept it or be \"not interested in your junk\". If it is valuable, a co-aligned unicorn \"gratefully\" keeps the gem and improves your <a href=\"/wiki/Luck\" title=\"Luck\">Luck</a>, depending on the identification status of the gem: +5 points if the gem is formally identified, +2 points if type-<a href=\"/wiki/Name\" title=\"Name\">named</a>, and +1 point if completely unknown.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Coaligned unicorns are great for improving Luck and sorting out worthless glass. The game does not check what the gem is named, or what its type is called, as long as one of them is defined - ideally, you should type-name all gems before throwing them at coaligned unicorns. It is easiest to increase Luck this way in a no-teleport level, e.g. <a href=\"/wiki/Sokoban\" title=\"Sokoban\">Sokoban</a>, in order to prevent them teleporting away after each catch. If you are sure you will not need the unicorn again after, you may want to encourage a <a href=\"/wiki/Pet\" title=\"Pet\">pet</a> to kill it so you can recover your gems without any Luck penalty.\n</p><p>A cross-aligned unicorn will \"hesitatingly\" accept a valuable gem, and your Luck may increase or decrease by one point if the gem is not formally identified, and by up to three points if it is. It is not generally a good idea to throw gems at cross-aligned unicorns unless you're pretty sure they're glass.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Messages\">Messages</span></h2>\n<dl><dt><span id=\"The_unicorn.27s_recently_regrown_horn_crumbles_to_dust.\">The &lt;color&gt; unicorn's recently regrown horn crumbles to dust.</span></dt>\n<dd>A revived unicorn died, but did not drop a unicorn horn.</dd>\n<dt><span id=\"The_tip_of_the_unicorn.27s_horn_glows.21\">The tip of the &lt;color&gt; unicorn's horn glows!</span></dt>\n<dd>A unicorn cured a status problem using its horn.</dd>\n<dt><span id=\"The_unicorn_catches_and_drops_the_.\">The &lt;color&gt; unicorn catches and drops the &lt;gem&gt;.</span></dt>\n<dd>You threw a gem at a tame unicorn.</dd>\n<dt><span id=\"The_unicorn_is_not_interested_in_your_junk.\">The &lt;color&gt; unicorn is not interested in your junk.</span></dt>\n<dd>You threw a formally identified or type-named piece of worthless glass, a rock, or a gray stone at a unicorn.</dd>\n<dt><span id=\"The_unicorn_hesitatingly_accepts_your_gift.\">The &lt;color&gt; unicorn hesitatingly accepts your gift.</span></dt>\n<dd>You threw a valuable gem at a cross-aligned unicorn, and your Luck may have gone up or down.</dd>\n<dt><span id=\"The_unicorn_graciously_accepts_your_gift.\">The &lt;color&gt; unicorn graciously accepts your gift.</span></dt>\n<dd>You threw an unidentified piece of worthless glass or a gray stone at a unicorn.</dd>\n<dt><span id=\"The_unicorn_gratefully_accepts_your_gift.\">The &lt;color&gt; unicorn gratefully accepts your gift.</span></dt>\n<dd>You threw a valuable gem at a coaligned unicorn, and your Luck increased by 1, 2, or 5.</dd>\n<dt><span id=\"The_unicorn_catches_the_gem.\">The &lt;color&gt; unicorn catches the &lt;color&gt; gem.</span></dt>\n<dd>You threw a (valuable or worthless) gem at a unicorn while blind.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origin\">Origin</span></h2>\n<div class=\"noprint sidebox\">\n<div style=\"float: left;\"><div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png\" class=\"image\" title=\"Wikipedia\"><img alt=\"Wikipedia\" src=\"/images/thumb/f/f8/Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png/50px-Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" srcset=\"/images/f/f8/Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png 1.5x\" /></a></div></div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 60px;\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Main Page\">Wikipedia</a> has an article about:\n<div style=\"margin-left: 10px;\"><i><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Unicorn\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Special:Search/Unicorn\">Unicorn </a></b></i></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"noprint sidebox\">\n<div style=\"float: left;\"><div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png\" class=\"image\" title=\"Wikipedia\"><img alt=\"Wikipedia\" src=\"/images/thumb/f/f8/Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png/50px-Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" srcset=\"/images/f/f8/Fair-use-wikipedia-logo.png 1.5x\" /></a></div></div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 60px;\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Main Page\">Wikipedia</a> has an article about:\n<div style=\"margin-left: 10px;\"><i><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unicorns\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:List of unicorns\">List of unicorns</a></b></i></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The unicorn is a creature that features prominently in European-styled fairy tales, though it is much older and appears in many other folklores, being depicted as far back as the Indus Valley Civilization in ancient seals, and has been mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers such as Strabo, Pliny the Younger, and Aelian. In the Middle Ages, depictions of a unicorn trapped by a maiden were an elaborate allegory for the Incarnation of Christ (with the maiden representing the virgin Mary); this likely gave rise to the recurring motif of unicorns appearing to and/or being tameable only by a fair, virgin maiden. Naturally, unicorns are one of many folkloric creatures included in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons\" title=\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></i>.\n</p><p>The unicorn is commonly depicted as an equine beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead; it is quadrupedal and almost always equine or caprine in appearance, with white or light-colored hair. Unicorns are generally nearly impossible to catch, and are fittingly sought after for their various magical properties, such as those inherent to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_horn\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Unicorn horn\">its horn</a>; modern fiction often extends those properties to its other features, such as its hair or blood. \"Unicorn\" is used as a colloquial term that refers to someone or something that is rare and hard to find. \n</p><p>The Chinese <i>qilin</i> (Chinese: 麒麟), is sometimes called \"the Chinese unicorn\", and is described as a hybrid animal with the body of a deer, the head of a lion, green scales and a long forwardly-curved horn. The Japanese <a href=\"/wiki/Ki-rin\" title=\"Ki-rin\">ki-rin</a> is based on the <i>qilin</i>, but more closely resembles the Western unicorn.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Encyclopedia_entry\">Encyclopedia entry</span></h2><div class=\"nhencyclopedia\">\n<div class=\"poem\">\n<p>Men have always sought the elusive unicorn, for the single twisted horn which projected from its forehead was thought to be a powerful talisman.  It was said that the unicorn had simply to dip the tip of its horn in a muddy pool for the water to become pure.  Men also believed that to drink from this horn was a protection against all sickness, and that if the horn was ground to a powder it would act as an antidote to all poisons.  Less than 200 years ago in France, the horn of a unicorn was used in a ceremony to test the royal food for poison.<br />\nAlthough only the size of a small horse, the unicorn is a very fierce beast, capable of killing an elephant with a single thrust from its horn.  Its fleetness of foot also makes this solitary creature difficult to capture.  However, it can be tamed and captured by a maiden.  Made gentle by the sight of a virgin, the unicorn can be lured to lay its head in her lap, and in this docile mood, the maiden may secure it with a golden rope.<br />\n</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:right\">[ Mythical Beasts, by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]</div><br />\n<p>Martin took a small sip of beer.  \"Almost ready,\" he said.<br />\n\"You hold your beer awfully well.\"<br />\nTlingel laughed.  \"A unicorn's horn is a detoxicant.

three types of unicorns: white, gray, and black, which correspond to [[lawful]], [[neutral]], and [[chaotic]] alignments respectively. Directly killing a unicorn of your own alignment always carries a &minus;5 [[Luck]] penalty; eating a unicorn corpse is safe regardless of alignment, and has a 27% chance of giving [[poison resistance]].\n\n==Generation==\nUnicorns tend to appear somewhat early in the dungeon, starting around DL 7 or so. Normally generated unicorns matching your alignment will be peaceful;{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1271|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} all others will be hostile. Unicorns in bones files or created by polymorph traps may be exceptions to this rule. White unicorns are generated slightly more frequently than the other types; this is to compensate for [[Gehennom]] preventing the random generation of lawful monsters.\n\nA unicorn is guaranteed to leave a [[corpse]] behind unless killed in a way that destroys it (e.g., [[disintegration]] or [[digestion]]); it will also leave a [[unicorn horn]] with its corpse, unless it has been [[revive]]d or is a [[polymorph]]ed monster from a polymorph [[trap]], in which case it has only a 50% chance of leaving one.{{refsrc|src/mon.c|332|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}\n\n==Strategy==\nUnicorns are extremely fast and can easily outpace even players with [[very fast]] speed. A unicorn that can see the player will attempt to avoid being \"lined up\" by the player (orthogonally or diagonally) even if they are hostile.{{refsrc|src/monmove.c|1089|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Unicorns have NOTONL flag set on teleportable levels}}{{refsrc|src/monmove.c|1125|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Non-teleportable levels are handled specially, but unicorns still attempt avoidance if possible}}{{refsrc|src/mon.c|1492|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Implementation of NOTONL flag behavior in mfndpos()}} If a unicorn has no available neighboring square where it would not be lined up, it has a 50% chance of teleporting away each time it tries to move.{{refsrc|src/monmove.c|1251|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Attempting to move into melee range of a non-peaceful unicorn will usually cause it to attack you before leaping or teleporting away to an applicable square.\n\nUnicorns do surprising amounts of damage, getting in multiple kicks and butts per turn. However, because they will not intentionally move into melee range, it is usually not difficult to avoid combat with them. This does not apply to pet unicorns that attack monsters, which occurs normally as with any other pet.\n\n===Combat===\nIn the beginning of the game, when you typically are weak and most need the horn, the most sound strategy for fighting unicorn is to let a [[pet]] take it out; this naturally also avoids any Luck penalties for killing a co-aligned unicorn, though the pet may be killed if the unicorn lands enough counterattacks.\n\nMore combat-capable characters can also lead them into hallways and attack with projectiles from a safe distance; rays can be bounced at unicorns from walls, and a [[boomerang]] can be handy as well. Savvy players can trap a unicorn using a [[pit]] or a [[beartrap]], though each trap will only work once. Characters at [[Skilled]] or better in [[polearms]] or [[lance]] can [[pound]] the unicorn while it is a knight's move away with no fear of counterattacks. Players with [[very fast]] speed will have occasional chances to attack with ranged weapons or to close in for direct combat, and a well-armored and well-prepared player with speed can defeat a unicorn fairly easily.\n\nA good way of closing in on a unicorn is to use [[invisibility]]: unicorns cannot [[see invisible]], so that lining them up to throw weapons or gems at them is much easier. However, invisibility can backfire for a weak character: a hostile unicorn that can't see you will not know to stay a knight's move away, and so may end up skewering you if it accidentally closes in. Due to a bug, unicorns are not fooled by [[displacement]] while moving to avoid you - once within melee range, however, hostile unicorns will attack as normal and possibly target your displaced image instead of you.<ref>[https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/issues/564 Issue #564: Unicorns ignore player's displacement when avoiding the player]</ref>\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The displacement bug is fixed as of {{commit|62e09ae9f31ea052142544ec0061c292c3d5642c|commit 62e09ae}} - unicorns try to avoid being lined up with where they ''perceive'' you to be, even if you are displaced.}}\n\n===Unicorn horns===\n{{main|Unicorn horn}}\nApplying a unicorn horn has a chance of curing blindness, hallucination, confusion, and stunning status effects, making a unicorn horn an essential item for all adventurers - see its article for more details.\n\nUnicorns can use their own horn to cure themselves of these effects, producing the message ''\"The tip of the &lt;color&gt; unicorn's horn glows!\"''  A player polymorphed into a unicorn can use the [[Monster (command)|#monster]] extended command to do the same, acting as a uncursed unicorn horn would.\n\n===Sacrificing unicorns===\n{{main|Sacrifice#Sacrificing unicorns}}\n\nSacrificing a unicorn at an [[altar]] is a special case: sacrificing cross-aligned unicorns on your god's altar can reap [[alignment record|alignment]] and [[Luck]] benefits, you should sacrifice on your own altar a unicorn of a different alignment. If the corpse, the altar, and you are three different alignments, it is just a regular sacrifice. However, sacrificing coaligned unicorns - or sacrificing ''any'' unicorn on an altar of its own alignment - will cause bad things to happen. See the article on sacrifices for more details.\n\n===Unicorns and gems===\nThrowing any gem to any hostile unicorn will make it [[peaceful]]. A tamed unicorn will catch and immediately drop gems thrown at it, without any effect on [[Luck]] or identification. Unicorns also pick up any gems and stones they come across, worthless or not.\n\nIf the gem is worthless glass, a rock, or a [[gray stone]], it will not affect your Luck, and the unicorn will either \"graciously\" accept it or be \"not interested in your junk\". If it is valuable, a co-aligned unicorn \"gratefully\" keeps the gem and improves your [[Luck]], depending on the identification status of the gem: +5 points if the gem is formally identified, +2 points if type-[[name]]d, and +1 point if completely unknown.{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|1801|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=function gem_accept()}}\n\nCoaligned unicorns are great for improving Luck and sorting out worthless glass. The game does not check what the gem is named, or what its type is called, as long as one of them is defined - ideally, you should type-name all gems before throwing them at coaligned unicorns. It is easiest to increase Luck this way in a no-teleport level, e.g. [[Sokoban]], in order to prevent them teleporting away after each catch. If you are sure you will not need the unicorn again after, you may want to encourage a [[pet]] to kill it so you can recover your gems without any Luck penalty.\n\nA cross-aligned unicorn will \"hesitatingly\" accept a valuable gem, and your Luck may increase or decrease by one point if the gem is not formally identified, and by up to three points if it is. It is not generally a good idea to throw gems at cross-aligned unicorns unless you're pretty sure they're glass.\n\n==Messages==\n{{message|The <color> unicorn's recently regrown horn crumbles to dust.|A revived unicorn died, but did not drop a unicorn horn.}}\n{{message|The tip of the <color> unicorn's horn glows!|A unicorn cured a status problem using its horn.}}\n{{message|The <color> unicorn catches and drops the <gem>.|You threw a gem at a tame unicorn.}}\n{{message|The <color> unicorn is not interested in your junk.|You threw a formally identified or type-named piece of worthless glass, a rock, or a gray stone at a unicorn.}}\n{{message|The <color> unicorn hesitatingly accepts your gift.|You threw a valuable gem at a cross-aligned unicorn, and your Luck may have gone up or down.}}\n{{message|The <color> unicorn graciously accepts your gift.|You threw an unidentified piece of worthless glass or a gray stone at a unicorn.}}\n{{message|The <color> unicorn gratefully accepts your gift.|You threw a valuable gem at a coaligned unicorn, and your Luck increased by 1, 2, or 5.}}\n{{message|The <color> unicorn catches the <color> gem.|You threw a (valuable or worthless) gem at a unicorn while blind.}}\n\n==Origin==\n{{wikipedia}}\n{{wikipedia|List of unicorns}}\nThe unicorn is a creature that features prominently in European-styled fairy tales, though it is much older and appears in many other folklores, being depicted as far back as the Indus Valley Civilization in ancient seals, and has been mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers such as Strabo, Pliny the Younger, and Aelian. In the Middle Ages, depictions of a unicorn trapped by a maiden were an elaborate allegory for the Incarnation of Christ (with the maiden representing the virgin Mary); this likely gave rise to the recurring motif of unicorns appearing to and/or being tameable only by a fair, virgin maiden. Naturally, unicorns are one of many folkloric creatures included in ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.\n\nThe unicorn is commonly depicted as an equine beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead; it is quadrupedal and almost always equine or caprine in appearance, with white or light-colored hair. Unicorns are generally nearly impossible to catch, and are fittingly sought after for their various magical properties, such as those inherent to [[wikipedia:Unicorn horn|its horn]]; modern fiction often extends those properties to its other features, such as its hair or blood. \"Unicorn\" is used as a colloquial term that refers to someone or something that is rare and hard to find. \n\nThe Chinese ''qilin'' (Chinese: 麒麟), is sometimes called \"the Chinese unicorn\", and is described as a hybrid animal with the body of a deer, the head of a lion, green scales and a long forwardly-curved horn. The Japanese [[ki-rin]] is based on the ''qilin'', but more closely resembles the Western unicorn.\n\n==Encyclopedia entry==\n{{encyclopedia|Men have always sought the elusive unicorn, for the single twisted horn which projected from its forehead was thought to be a powerful talisman.  It was said that the unicorn had simply to dip the tip of its horn in a muddy pool for the water to become pure.  Men also believed that to drink from this horn was a protection against all sickness, and that if the horn was ground to a powder it would act as an antidote to all poisons.  Less than 200 years ago in France, the horn of a unicorn was used in a ceremony to test the royal food for poison.\nAlthough only the size of a small horse, the unicorn is a very fierce beast, capable of killing an elephant with a single thrust from its horn.  Its fleetness of foot also makes this solitary creature difficult to capture.  However, it can be tamed and captured by a maiden.  Made gentle by the sight of a virgin, the unicorn can be lured to lay its head in her lap, and in this docile mood, the maiden may secure it with a golden rope.\n{{right-align|[ Mythical Beasts, by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]}}\nMartin took a small sip of beer.  \"Almost ready,\" he said.\n\"You hold your beer awfully well.\"\nTlingel laughed.  \"A unicorn's horn is a detoxicant.  Its possession is a universal remedy.  I wait until I reach the warm glow stage, then I use my horn to burn off any excess and keep me right there.\"\n|[ Unicorn Variations, by Roger Zelazny ]}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{nethack-366}}\n[[Category:Monsters]]"}

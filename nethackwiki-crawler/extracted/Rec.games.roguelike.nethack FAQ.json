Unlike many other Dungeons\n& Dragons-inspired games, the emphasis in NetHack is on discovering\nthe detail of the dungeon and not simply killing everything in sight -\nin fact, killing everything in sight is a good way to die\nquickly. Each game presents a different landscape - the random number\ngenerator provides an essentially unlimited number of variations of\nthe dungeon and its denizens to be discovered by the player in one of\na number of characters: you can pick your race, your role, and your\ngender.\" [From <http://www.nethack.org/>.]\n\n\"On the screen is kept a map of where you have been and what you\nhave seen on the current dungeon level; as you explore more of the\nlevel, it appears on the screen in front of you.  When NetHack's\nancestor Rogue first appeared, its screen orientation was almost\nunique among computer fantasy games. Since then, screen\norientation has become the norm rather than the exception; NetHack\ncontinues this fine tradition. Unlike text adventure games that\naccept commands in pseudo-English sentences and explain the\nresults in words, NetHack commands are all one or two keystrokes\nand the results are displayed graphically on the screen.\"\n[From the NetHack Guidebook.]\n\n\n1.2Q:   That sounds pretty good, where can I get it? How much does it\n        cost?\n\n1.2A:\n\nNetHack is free software. That's right, FREE. Not shareware.\nAvailable to you at the price of $0, under a license that permits you\nto freely modify and distribute it. (Note, however, that NetHack is NOT\nin the public domain; see the file 'license' or 'license.txt' that comes\nwith NetHack for details.)\n\n<http://www.nethack.org/> always has the latest version available\n(currently 3.4.3).\n\n\n1.3Q:   What computer is it playable on?\n\n1.3A: \n\nThere are official binary releases for Amiga, Atari, Linux, Macintosh,\nMS-DOS, OS/2, and 32-bit Windows systems. The source code (written in\nC) is available as well, which should compile and run on just about\nevery system imaginable (or at least every system that can run a C\ncompiler). There are limitations, however; for example, no-one has yet\nsucceeded in overcoming the difficulty of porting NetHack to the Palm,\nthough other PDA implementations have been managed.\n\n\n1.4Q:   I installed and ran NetHack, now what do all these symbols\n        and stuff mean?\n\n1.4A:\n\nConsult the file \"Guidebook.txt\" (or something similar) that came with\nNetHack. It's the NetHack Guidebook, and should be able to answer any\nquestions you have about the game display or controls. If you didn't\nget a copy of Guidebook.txt (or other documentation), download one\nfrom <http://www.nethack.org/common/info.html#Docs>. You can also gain\ninformation about symbols onscreen using the \"/\" or \";\" commands.\n\n\n1.5Q:   All these letters and things confuse me! Is there a\n        version of NetHack with graphics instead? \n\n1.5A: \n\nDepending on the system you are playing it on, yes. There are\ngraphical (or \"tiled\") versions of NetHack that use graphics in place\nof the ASCII characters. Consult the readme file specific to your\nsystem for details. If there's no mention of a tiled version, your\nsystem probably does not support tiles.\n\nThere are also several \"unofficial\" versions of NetHack (meaning only\nthat they were not released by the DevTeam) that use enhanced graphical\ninterfaces, among which the more popular are:\n\n           Vulture (development of Jaakko Peltonen's \"Falcon's Eye\")\n                    <http://www.darkarts.co.za/vulture/>\n           noeGNUd (supports a wide range of 2D and 3D character- and\n           tile-based views and game playback)\n                    <http://www.darkarts.co.za/noegnud>\n\n\n1.6Q:   Is there a multiplayer version of NetHack?\n\n1.6A:\n\nNo. Nor is there likely to be, according to the DevTeam. \"We think you\ncan't do that playably without compromising the basic idea of being\nable to think as long as you want about what you're doing.\" [From\n<http://www.nethack.org/>.] The only player interaction in NetHack\nis that of bones files and the score list on a multiplayer system.\n\n\n1.7Q:   Why is it called \"Net\"Hack if you can't play it online against\n        other people?\n\n1.7A:\n\n\"The 'Net' in NetHack refers to the way the developers, many of whom\nhave never met in person, organize the work on the program.\" \n[From <http://www.nethack.org/>.]\n\nYou can play NetHack online, just not directly against other people.\n<http://www.nicolaas.net/erebus/index.php?scat=04servers> lists\nseveral public servers you could try. Try doing a search for \"NetHack\nServers\" in your favorite search engine, and connect to one of the\nmany available.\n\nThere are also ways to add the \"bones files\" of other adventures to\nyour local copy of NetHack, such as with the \"Hearse\" program\n<http://hearse.krollmark.com/>. Hearse currently supports the official\nDOS and Windows binary versions, the official Linux non-Qt binary\nversion and compatibly-compiled Unix installations, as well as the\nunofficial Psion port, the latest SLASH'EM stable and (currently)\ndevelopment versions, and Philipp Lucas' distribution of PatchHack 5.0\n(with and without the Hell Patch enabled). Support for other versions\nmay be added if sufficient demand exists.\n\n\n1.8Q:   When will the next version be released?\n\n1.8A:\n\nAccording to the DevTeam, \"when it's ready\". Details of core NetHack\ndevelopment have always been closely held, and though minor aspects\nhave been leaked (see <http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Next_version> for\na collation), the only real visible signs of progress are occasional\nupdates to the public buglist. In the meantime, several NetHack\nvariants are in active development, and many third-party patches\nare available: see 4.10 through 4.13 for details.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2: rec.games.roguelike.nethack\n\n2.1Q:   What is rec.games.roguelike.nethack?\n\n2.1A:\n\nrec.games.roguelike.nethack, often abbreviated to \"rgrn\", is a Usenet\nnewsgroup \"concerned with NetHack and related games\" (from the group\ncharter). It's the successor to the groups net.games.hack and\nrec.games.hack, and lives in the rec.games.roguelike.* hierarchy,\nwhere roguelike games other than NetHack and its variants either have\ntheir own groups or fall by default into rec.games.roguelike.misc.\nReaders of rgrn may also want to read rec.games.roguelike.announce,\na moderated group where postings of significant general interest for\nroguelike players are made.\n\n\n2.2Q:   What's with the posts labeled \"YAAP\" or \"YASD\"?\n\n2.2A:\n\nrgrn uses some terminology that can be confusing to the\nuninitiated. For a fairly complete list, please see\n<http://www.spod-central.org/~psmith/nh/abbr-343.txt>, but here is a\nlist of the more common abbreviations:\n\n\n    YAAP: Yet Another Ascension Post\n    YAFAP: Yet Another First Ascension Post.\n        Someone has completed a game of NetHack (possibly for the\n        first time) and wants to brag/show off. Finishing NetHack is\n        not a trivial accomplishment, so some bragging is probably\n        called for (see 2.9).\n\n    YASD: Yet Another Stupid Death.\n    YAAD: Yet Another Annoying Death.\n        Get used to this phenomenon if you're going to play\n        NetHack. Someone has died in a particularly amusing or\n        annoying way, and wants pity for his or her stupidity or a\n        shoulder to cry on.\n\n    YAFM: Yet Another Funny Message.\n    YAFMC: Yet Another Funny Message Combination\n    YAFP: Yet Another Funny Prompt\n        Sometimes, the messages NetHack gives you are amusing, or have\n        a strange juxtaposition of several messages or an odd mix of\n        inventory letters. Someone has found a message or combination\n        that they liked.\n\n    YANI: Yet Another New (Nifty) Idea (Item).\n        Someone has an idea for an improvement or addition to\n        the game.\n\n    DYWYPI?: Do You Want Your Possessions Identified?\n        The first question NetHack asks you if you are killed.\n        Many posters use it as shorthand for \"And then the\n        <monster/trap/stupid move/typo> killed me.\"\n\n    The DevTeam:\n        The DevTeam is the group of programmers responsible for\n        the maintenance and development of NetHack.\n        Remember: The DevTeam Think of Everything! (TDTTOE!)\n\n    The RNG: Random Number Generator -or- Random NetHack God.\n       Every game of NetHack is different, thanks to the\n       effects of the random numbers used in the creation of\n       the dungeon. Sometimes it seems like the random numbers\n       have a malicious will of their own and are therefore\n       personified, as in \"The RNG was especially cruel to me\n       today.\"\n\nAs well as abbreviations, rgrn (like any community) has developed its own\njargon for frequently-discussed concepts and strategies, for example\n\"pudding farming\" and the \"protection racket\"; Eva Myers has a discussion\nof these at <http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/rgrnterms.html>.\n\n\n2.3Q:   What's a \"spoiler\"?\n\n2.3A:\n\nA \"spoiler\" is an explanation of something in the game. That\nexplanation may spoil the fun of discovering that something for\nyourself. Since some people would rather figure things out for\nthemselves, they don't want the answer blurted out. For this reason,\nif you do post a spoiler, you may wish to buffer it with some blank\nspace (20 lines or so, or a formfeed character) so no one reads it\naccidentally. Alternatively, and (given the wide variety of newsreader\ndisplays) preferably, you can ROT13 encipher the spoiler (a simple\ncipher where a->n, b->o, ... z->m; see <http://www.rot13.com/> if your\nnewsreader doesn't support it natively). If you're starting a\nspoilersome thread, consider putting \"(spoilers)\" in the Subject\nheader.\n\nHowever, if you read this newsgroup you should accept that you're\nprobably going to come across spoilers whether you want to or not.\n\n\n2.4Q:   What's a \"source diver\"?\n\n2.4A:\n\nThe computer code for NetHack is publicly available, unlike that for\nmost games. Someone with programming skill can look through the code\n(or \"source\") to get the answers to questions about how the game\nworks. This is called \"source diving\". For the curious, NetHack is\nwritten in C.\n\n\n2.5Q:   I'm having trouble with my game, can I post my saved game\n        file so someone can help me out?\n\n2.5A: \n\nNo. The posting of binaries (this includes screenshots) to non-binary\nnewsgroups such as rgrn is frowned upon. If you feel you need a map\nto explain your problem, use an ASCII \"screenshot\" instead.  Besides,\nsaved games won't work across platforms, and depending on the\nvariables set when the game was compiled, may not even work if they\nare from the same platform. Describe your situation/problem as best\nyou can, and we'll help you out as best we can.\n\n\n2.5Q:   What's this \"netiquette\" that other posters keep\n        mentioning?\n\n2.5A:\n\n\"Netiquette\" refers to InterNET etIQUETTE, or the polite way of doing\nthings online.  Following these conventions is not only polite, but\nwill make your articles much easier to read, and therefore more people\nare likely to read them. With specific regard to the newsgroup\nrgrn, there are a few things you should keep in mind when posting:\n\n    Top posting: \n        \"Top posting\" refers to putting your response before the\n        quoted material you are responding to. When you respond to an\n        article, put your response below the text you quote. (If\n        you're responding to several separate points in the same\n        article, put your response below each individually.) This\n        ensures that the later responses stay in proper chronological\n        order, making reading both easier and more logical.\n        Unfortunately, top posting is the default for some newsreaders\n        (notably Microsoft Outlook Express). This doesn't make it\n        correct. (A longer article on good Usenet quoting style can be\n        found at <http://www.anta.net/misc/nnq/nquote.shtml>.)\n\n    Quoting:\n        Quote appropriate context. Usenet is an asynchronous medium,\n        and you can't be sure that everyone's received, read, or\n        remembered the article you're responding to, so your message\n        should make sense in isolation. Only quote the relevant parts\n        of the article, and cut the rest (including signatures). This\n        keeps articles relatively short, and easy to read. In the same\n        vein, don't cut so much that it's hard to determine who or\n        what you are responding to. Pay particular attention to the\n        attributions, which indicate who said what; if you quote\n        someone's text, attribute it, otherwise remove their\n        attribution. (Again, see the article referred to in the\n        previous paragraph.)\n\n    Line lengths:\n        Set your newsreader for line lengths around 70 characters to\n        avoid other newsreaders mangling your post when displayed or\n        quoted.\n\n    Signatures:\n        Signatures should only be a few lines long; the \"standard\"\n        maximum is 4 lines of 80 characters. Make sure that your\n        signature, if you have one, is preceded by a proper sig\n        separator: i.e.  \"-- \", two hyphens and a space, with nothing\n        else on the line.\n\n    Subject headers:\n        Make your subject specific (\"Are kobolds poisonous?\" is much\n        better than \"Question\" or \"Help\") without trying to stuff your\n        entire article into it. Even if the question you're asking or\n        point you're making is in your subject header, repeat it in\n        the body of the message; and ensure that the article is\n        comprehensible without depending on the subject for crucial\n        context. Many newsreaders' displays make reading subject\n        headers in direct conjunction with article text awkward, and\n        having all the relevant content in the body will make quoting\n        for response easier.\n\n    HTML:\n        Usenet is a text medium, and as such many newsreaders render\n        HTML messages as practically unreadable gibberish. Plain text\n        only, please.\n\n    Binaries:\n        rgrn is a non-binary newsgroup. If you have a binary file\n        that you feel the group would like access to, upload it\n        somewhere and provide a URL.\n\n    Personal attacks and flames:\n        Personal attacks have no place in a public forum; if you feel\n        you must flame someone, take it to email.\n\nYour best bet, as with most newsgroups, is to read the newsgroup for a\nwhile and get a feeling for the place before you post.\n\n\n2.7Q:   What topics should I be careful about discussing?\n\n2.7A:\n\nApart from obviously \"controversial\" things which wouldn't generally\nbe on-topic for rgrn anyway, there are several subjects which you should\nbe cautious about raising. These fall into three main categories:\n\n    Holy wars\n        People are unlikely to change their minds on these; argument\n        just tends to lead to bickering and flaming. A by no means\n        comprehensive list:        \n\n        vi-keys (hjkl) versus number_pad.\n        ASCII versus tiles.\n        Arguments from realism versus \"NetHack Is Not Real Life\".\n        The morality of savescumming (see 4.1) and rerolling\n          starting characters.\n        Whether NetHack's license is more or less \"free\" than\n          some other program's license.\n\n    Hardy perennials\n        Fine in themselves, these subjects come up often enough\n        that there's little new to say about them. Some examples:\n\n        What background music to play NetHack to.\n        What letters to assign inventory to.\n        Age/location surveys.\n        The succubi/chains/bullwhips/BDSM jokes.\n\n    Cans of worms\n        Some suggestions for new features or changes to gameplay are\n        recurrently made, but open up large-scale problems of\n        implementation feasibility or game balance; as a result,\n        they're more or less at the status \"show us a working patch\n        that doesn't break the game, then we'll talk\". A few examples:\n\n        Potions leaving empty bottles when quaffed.\n        Ettins wearing two helmets/amulets, mariliths six rings, etc.\n        Facing.\n        Arbitrary rather than straight-line targetting.\n        Platform- or version-independent savefiles and bonesfiles.\n       \nPlease research the archives (Google Groups should be handy here)\nbeforehand and only post on these subjects if you think you have\nsomething particularly new to say; and try not to make it\ninflammatory.\n\n\n2.8Q:   Anything else I shouldn't post?\n\n2.8A:\n\nWhile in general people will be happy to answer genuine queries, it's\na good idea to do at least some basic reading before asking them,\nchecking they're not covered in the Guidebook (see 1.4) or this FAQ\nfirst. Repeatedly asking questions that are easily answerable on your\nown falls into the \"somewhat annoying\" category.\n\nPosting misinformation is also generally considered a bad idea; while\nit's not required that you have an in-depth knowledge of the game to\nbe able to post here, if you're answering questions or asserting facts\nit's better to do so based on what you know or can test rather than\nhalf-remembered hearsay. In particular, there are a number of common\nmisconceptions that you should be aware of and not perpetuate: Eva\nMyers documents many of these at her \"Myths and Facts about NetHack\"\npage, <http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/>.\n\n\n2.9Q:   I've won! I've won!\n\n2.9A:\n\nCongratulations! Feel free to tell us all about how it went; post a\nYAAP or YAFAP (see 2.2) with a description of the game. (If you're\nplaying a modified version of the game, it's a good idea to make it\nclear what modifications have been applied.)\n\nIt's conventional for these posts to include some of the information\nfrom the endgame disclosure screens (though you'll want to be\nselective about this: how many monsters you killed in total is\ninteresting, exactly how many giant beetles you killed usually isn't).\nIf you're playing with a text-based interface, you can copy and paste\nthe details from the terminal (under the Win32 tty interface,\nEdit|Mark from the console's system menu); be careful to only use\nstraight ASCII for \"screenshots\", not IBMgraphics or DECgraphics.\nAlternatively, there is a \"dump\" patch available (see 4.13 for how to\napply it, or for details on PatchHack which includes it), allowing you\nto automatically write out the endgame information to a file,\navailable from Jukka Lahtinen's site:\n<http://www.netsonic.fi/~walker/nethack.html#dump>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3: Gameplay and Spoilers\n\n3.1Q:   This game is really hard! Does anyone win? How?\n\n3.1A:\n\nBelieve it or not, people can and do \"win\" NetHack! The main key to\nwinning and not dying is patience. Nothing happens in the game if you\ndon't hit a key; this lets you think each of your moves out\ncarefully. Each time your character meets a grisly or stupid demise,\nuse it as a learning experience, and try not to repeat your mistake\nthe next time you play.\n\n\"The Complete Beginner's Guide to NetHack\" contains a great deal of\nadvice on playing NetHack. It's posted to the group frequently, or\nfind it online at <http://www.melankolia.net/nethack/nethack.guide.html>.\nIt does a good job of balancing advice against spoilers.\n\n\n3.2Q:   How much damage does <weapon> do? What good is an <item>?\n        How can I fix my armor when it gets rusty?\n\n3.2A:\n\nThese questions (and many others like them) all fall under the heading\nof spoilers, and as such are outside the bounds of this FAQ\nlist. There are numerous websites that will give you all the\ninformation you could want about the details of NetHack. Some of the\nrecommended ones include:\n\n        Yet Another NetHack Site (by Kate Nepveu):\n                <http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/>\n        Dylan O'Donnell's spoiler page:\n                <http://www.spod-central.org/~psmith/nh/>\n        NethackWiki, a publicly-editable wiki:\n                <http://nethackwiki.com/>\n\nEva Myers has a useful overview index of available spoilers at:\n<http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/spoilerlist.html>\n        \nOf course, if you don't (or can't) find the answer you seek, post your\nquestion and we'll do our best to answer it. (If your answer could be\nconsidered a \"spoiler\", see question 2.3).\n\n\n3.3Q:   Why are there TWO stairs leading down (or up)?\n\n3.3A:\n\nYou've discovered a \"branch\" off the main dungeon. There are several\nside trips you can make on your way to the bottom of the Dungeons of\nDoom. Some of them aren't needed to finish the game, but can garner\nyou useful items and experience.\n\n\n3.4Q:   I'm stuck! There doesn't seem to be any way down/up from\n        the level I'm on!\n\n3.4A:\n\nThere's always a way onwards. If you're in the main Dungeon, there\nwill be a way down, and a way to reach it; search every\nwall for secret doors (especially where the walls are near blank areas\nof the map). Check to make sure the stairs aren't hidden under an\nitem.  Move or smash any boulders or statues. If you're still stuck,\nfind (or dig) a hole or trap door and drop down to the next level.\n\nIf you're not in the main dungeon, you may have reached the end of the\ncurrent branch; time to retrace your steps and carry on by the other\nroute.\n\n\n3.5Q:   Why can't I successfully cast any spells? Why are all my \n        failure rates 100%?\n\n3.5A: \n\n\"Casting a spell also requires flexible movement, and wearing various\ntypes of armor may interfere with that.\" [From The NetHack Guidebook.]\nMetal items in particular are very inflexible.\n\n\n3.6Q:   Someone just told me to retrieve an artifact; where do I\n        go now?\n\n3.6A:\n\nDownstairs from where you are. If you can't find the staircase, it's\nprobably behind a secret door. It's no use going back through the\nmagic portal to look for it, because that's not where it is.\n\n\n3.7Q:   I'm on a maze level with a sealed-off area in the middle. I've\n        searched and searched, but can't find a secret door. I can't dig\n        or teleport through the walls, how do I get in there?\n\n3.7A:\n\nThere is a way in, just not from the level you are on. Keep exploring,\nand on some lower level you'll find a portal that will take you where\nyou want to go.\n\n\n3.8Q:   I'm trying to fight a monster that keeps teleporting away. How\n        do I get it to stop doing that so I can kill it?\n\n3.8A:\n\nTwo types of monsters do this; lowish-level ones that teleport\nrandomly every so often (and it's just a case of trying to get the\nkill in while they're in one spot for long enough) or after performing\ntheir attack on you (try not to let them), and higher-level boss\nmonsters that teleport away to heal up. In the latter case, find out\nwhere the monster goes (it's always the same spot), and get there\nfirst. You may need to use teleport yourself to get ahead of it.\n\n\n3.9Q:   I blocked up the trapdoors in this back corridor, and now I\n        can't get down!\n\n3.9A:\n\nThose trapdoors were the only way down from that particular special\nlevel, and once filled you can't dig through them again. However,\nyou can use level teleport to get to the level immediately beneath;\nteleport control would be useful here.\n \n\n3.10Q:   There's a monster stuck behind a boulder I particularly\n         want to push somewhere. How do I get rid of it?\n\n3.10A:\n\nYou can try to kill the monster: thrown or fired weapons will go past\nthe boulder, as will zapped wands or spells (though striking or force\nbolt will break the boulder, which may not be what you want).\nDropping all (or nearly all) your inventory will allow you to squeeze\ninto the same space as the boulder and attack the monster directly;\nbut this leaves you mostly defenceless, probably bare-handed, and can\nhave other undesirable side-effects. Or you can teleport both away in\none zap, though you won't be able to control where they end up.\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4: Miscellaneous\n\n4.1Q:   Did you guys know you can copy your save games and restore\n        them after you die? This makes the game a LOT easier!\n\n4.1A:\n\nYes, it does make it easier, but that's not the point. The game is\nSUPPOSED to be hard. Diabolically hard, as a matter of fact. This\ntactic is known as \"savescumming\" around these parts, and will garner\nyou no respect; indeed, the best you can hope for is polite scorn.\n\nThe DevTeam has added a mode to allow you to play without dying,\n\"explore mode\" (see question 4.2), but the downside is that your score\nwon't be recorded. How you play is your decision, just don't come here\nposting YAAP if you did it by savescumming. You should be aware,\nhowever, that there is a general consensus that savescumming is\nactually detrimental to the development of proper playing skills;\nbeing able to circumvent the required caution and tough strategic\ndecisions of NetHack may mean never learning to handle them well.\n\n\n4.2Q:   How do I get into explore or wizard mode?\n\n4.2A:\n\nTo enter explore mode use the \"-X\" switch on the command line (ie,\ntype \"nethack -X\" on the command line) or use the \"X\" command in the\ngame. Be warned that once you switch to Explore mode, there is no\nreturning to a regular game. Starting explore mode from the command\nline will also grant you a wand of wishing. If you die in explore\nmode, you can easily revive and try again, but as noted above, your\nscore will not be recorded.\n\nTo enter wizard (or debug; no relation to the Wizard role) mode type\n\"nethack -uwizard -D\" on the command line. If this doesn't work, then\nyou might have to enter a different name, be logged in as a different\nuser, or in your copy of the game wizard mode may be disabled. Ask the\nperson who compiled or installed the game about this.\n\n\n4.3Q:   What can I do in wizard mode that I can't do in a normal\n        game?\n\n4.3A:\n\nIn addition to the ability to continue after death as in explore mode,\nthe following is a list of wizard mode-specific commands:\n        \n    CTRL-E: Detect secret doors and traps\n    CTRL-F: Do magic mapping\n    CTRL-G: Create monster\n    CTRL-I: Identify items in pack\n    CTRL-O: Tell locations of special levels\n    CTRL-T: Do intra-level teleport\n    CTRL-V: Do trans-level teleport\n    CTRL-W: Make a wish\n    CTRL-X: Show attributes including intrinsic abilities\n\nThere are also a number of additional extended (#) commands, most\nproducing highly technical state information only useful for\ndebugging purposes.\n\n\n4.4Q:   My game crashed and I lost my character! Is there anything\n        I can do?\n\n4.4A:\n\nMaybe. There is a program that comes with NetHack called \"recover\"\nthat may be able to restore a crashed game, depending on how NetHack\nwas compiled. Check for a file called \"recover.txt\" for an explanation.\nOn some platforms, \"recover\" may have been incorporated into the game\nitself, and restarting the game using the same character name will\nwork (if the crash was recoverable from to start with).\n\n\n4.5Q:   I found a YAFMC! I found a bell on top of a grave and the\n        headstone said \"Saved by the bell.\" Quite a coincidence, huh?\n\n4.5A:\n\nNo, it's not. If the headstone generated for a grave reads \"Saved by\nthe bell,\" then a bell is generated for the grave as well.\n\n\n4.6Q:   Who's Schroedinger, and why did this quantum mechanic have\n        his cat in a box?\n\n4.6A: \n\nErwin Schroedinger (1887-1961) was a physicist who devised a famous\nthought experiment to translate quantum superposition into the\nmacroscopic classical-mechanical world. It involved an impenetrable\nbox (and, in NetHack, the box shows as empty until it's opened)\ncontaining a cat that would be killed by a 50/50 radioactive-decay\ntrigger; the resulting state of the cat, and how it is resolved when\nthe box is opened, depends on the particular school of quantum theory\nyou subscribe to, but one interpretation is that it is both alive and\ndead until observed.\n       \n\n4.7Q:   Why are elves chaotic? The elves in \"The Lord of the Rings\"\n        seem to be lawful.\n\n4.7A:\n\nNetHack draws on more than one source, and there are more elves than\nTolkien's (who weren't always as lawful as all that themselves, if you\nread the \"Silmarillion\"). Consider, by way of example, Michael Moorcock's\nMelniboneans (and remember that Stormbringer is also in the game), and\nSteven Brust's Dragaerans. In addition to these, there's hundreds of\nyears of tradition of the land of Faerie being one where human\nconcepts of law simply do not apply (though it's sometimes divided\nexplicitly into a Seelie and Unseelie Court). For a modern treatment\nof this concept, read Poul Anderson's \"Three Hearts and Three Lions\";\nor Terry Pratchett's \"Lords and Ladies\", for that matter.\n\n\n4.8Q:   I think I found a bug in the game! What should I do?\n\n4.8A:\n\nQuite possibly you have. If you're playing the latest version (3.4.3)\nyou may want to check the DevTeam's list of known bugs (available at\n<http://www.nethack.org/v343/bugs.html>) to make sure it's a new\none. If it's not a new one, the DevTeam may suggest a workaround. If\nit is a bug that hasn't been caught yet, please contact the DevTeam\nabout it at <http://www.nethack.org/common/contact.html>, or directly\nby e-mail at <nethack-bugs@nethack.org>. They appreciate knowing about\nbugs so they can fix them in the next release.\n\nAs well, please do post about it! Chances are, someone will put\ntogether a patch pretty quickly if it's really serious. To help work\nout where exactly the bug might lie, please give all the information\nyou can, including the exact text of any error messages the game\nproduced.\n\n\n4.9Q:   Has anyone ever written a program to play NetHack\n        automatically (a NetHack \"bot\")?\n\n4.9A\n\nNot successfully.  People have written \"bots\", or programs that will\nplay the game by themselves, for some other roguelikes. These bots\nusually play pretty successfully.\n\nHowever, no one has yet written a well-functioning one for NetHack,\nand the commonly held opinion is that NetHack is too complex for a\n\"bot\" that functions well to be currently practicable. If you're not\ndissuaded by this, you might want to address your efforts to NetHack's\npredecessor Hack first, as a rather simpler stepping-stone.\n\n\n4.10Q:   What is SLASH'EM?\n\n4.10A:\n\nSLASH'EM (Super Lotsa Added Stuff Hack - Extended Magic) is a variant\nof NetHack with more races, classes and generally just more stuff.\nLearn more about it at <http://www.slashem.org/>. Please mark questions\nabout SLASH'EM in rgrn with an \"[S]\" or \"[SLASH'EM]\" in the subject line\n(at the end is best, as some newsreaders strip initial square brackets),\nso people who only play regular (\"vanilla\") NetHack can more easily\nrecognize or filter your article.\n\n\n4.11Q:   What is SporkHack?\n\n4.11A:\n\nSporkHack is a variant of NetHack with a number of significant\ngameplay changes. Unlike SLASH'EM, its focus is less on adding new\nstuff, and more on improving balance and providing challenge and\nvariety for experienced players. Learn more about it, and play online,\nat <http://sporkhack.nineball.org/>. Please mark questions about\nSporkHack in rgrn with a \"[Spork] or \"[SPORK]\" in the subject line (at\nthe end is best, as some newsreaders strip initial square brackets),\nso people who only play regular (\"vanilla\") NetHack can more easily\nrecognize or filter your article.\n  \n\n4.12Q:   What is UnNetHack?\n\n4.12A:\n\nUnNetHack is a variant of NetHack, aimed at reducing predictability\nand increasing player challenge, along with adding more stuff. Its\nhomepage is at <http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/unnethack/>. Please\nmark questions about UnNetHack in rgrn with a \"[U] or \"[UnNetHack]\"\nin the subject line (at the end is best, as some newsreaders strip\ninitial square brackets), so people who only play regular (\"vanilla\")\nNetHack can more easily recognize or filter your article.\n\n\n4.13Q:   What are patches, and how do I apply them?\n\n4.13A:\n\nThere are many \"patches\" or code changes that people have written to\nalter or fix something about how NetHack works. These aren't \"official\"\nchanges to the game, but may include such things as new magic items or\ndifferent levels for the \"Hell\" area of NH. Pasi Kallinen maintains a\ndatabase of published patches at <http://bilious.homelinux.org/>;\nthere is also <http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/patches.html>, maintained\nby Ali Harlow, which is no longer updated but contains some patches\nPasi's doesn't.\n\nTo use these patches, you need to be able to compile them into your\nNetHack executable using a C compiler. First, you need to be able to\ncompile the basic game itself: download the source (see 1.3), read the\ninstallation instructions for your platform in the appropriate sys/\nsubdirectory, acquire one of the C compilers those recommend if\nnecessary, and follow the steps for compilation and installation.\n\nOnce this is working, you need a patch utility to apply the patch to\nthe source. For DOS or Windows, you can use the patch program from the\ndjgpp distribution available at <http://www.delorie.com/>. Use this\nutility to patch the base code and recompile the game.\n\n\n4.14Q:   I killed a shopkeeper named Izchak, why is everyone so\n         mad at me?\n\n4.14A:\n\nIzchak Miller, one of the founding members of the DevTeam, passed away\non April 1, 1994 from complications due to cancer. As he was\nresponsible for, among other things, much of the shopkeeper logic, the\nowner of the lighting shop was named for him as a tribute. The DevTeam\ndedicated version 3.2 of NetHack to the memory of Izchak Miller. Many\nplayers who will happily slay everything else that moves will spare\nIzchak's life as a sign of respect.\n\nFor a little more info, including a post from Izchak's\ndaughter, check out the following thread from 1996 in rgrn:\n<http://tinyurl.com/r7l23>\n\n\n4.15Q:   What websites have general information about NetHack?\n\n4.15A:\n\nIn addition to the sites mentioned in section 3.2 above, there are\nseveral excellent starting places for looking for NetHack web resources.\n\n    The DevTeam's links page:\n         <http://www.nethack.org/common/links.html>\n    Dion Nicolaas' NetHack Index:\n         <http://www.nicolaas.net/erebus/>\n    Ali Harlow's NetHack Page (particularly good for SLASH'EM):\n         <http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack.html>\n\nAlmost any NetHack webpage of value will be linked to by at least one\nof these sites.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5: Copyright info and acknowledgements\n\nThis document is Copyright 2000-2010 Stephen W.

Unlike many other Dungeons\n&amp; Dragons-inspired games, the emphasis in NetHack is on discovering\nthe detail of the dungeon and not simply killing everything in sight -\nin fact, killing everything in sight is a good way to die\nquickly. Each game presents a different landscape - the random number\ngenerator provides an essentially unlimited number of variations of\nthe dungeon and its denizens to be discovered by the player in one of\na number of characters: you can pick your race, your role, and your\ngender.\" [From &lt;http://www.nethack.org/&gt;.]\n\n\"On the screen is kept a map of where you have been and what you\nhave seen on the current dungeon level; as you explore more of the\nlevel, it appears on the screen in front of you.  When NetHack's\nancestor Rogue first appeared, its screen orientation was almost\nunique among computer fantasy games. Since then, screen\norientation has become the norm rather than the exception; NetHack\ncontinues this fine tradition. Unlike text adventure games that\naccept commands in pseudo-English sentences and explain the\nresults in words, NetHack commands are all one or two keystrokes\nand the results are displayed graphically on the screen.\"\n[From the NetHack Guidebook.]\n\n\n1.2Q:   That sounds pretty good, where can I get it? How much does it\n        cost?\n\n1.2A:\n\nNetHack is free software. That's right, FREE. Not shareware.\nAvailable to you at the price of $0, under a license that permits you\nto freely modify and distribute it. (Note, however, that NetHack is NOT\nin the public domain; see the file 'license' or 'license.txt' that comes\nwith NetHack for details.)\n\n&lt;http://www.nethack.org/&gt; always has the latest version available\n(currently 3.4.3).\n\n\n1.3Q:   What computer is it playable on?\n\n1.3A: \n\nThere are official binary releases for Amiga, Atari, Linux, Macintosh,\nMS-DOS, OS/2, and 32-bit Windows systems. The source code (written in\nC) is available as well, which should compile and run on just about\nevery system imaginable (or at least every system that can run a C\ncompiler). There are limitations, however; for example, no-one has yet\nsucceeded in overcoming the difficulty of porting NetHack to the Palm,\nthough other PDA implementations have been managed.\n\n\n1.4Q:   I installed and ran NetHack, now what do all these symbols\n        and stuff mean?\n\n1.4A:\n\nConsult the file \"Guidebook.txt\" (or something similar) that came with\nNetHack. It's the NetHack Guidebook, and should be able to answer any\nquestions you have about the game display or controls. If you didn't\nget a copy of Guidebook.txt (or other documentation), download one\nfrom &lt;http://www.nethack.org/common/info.html#Docs&gt;. You can also gain\ninformation about symbols onscreen using the \"/\" or \";\" commands.\n\n\n1.5Q:   All these letters and things confuse me! Is there a\n        version of NetHack with graphics instead? \n\n1.5A: \n\nDepending on the system you are playing it on, yes. There are\ngraphical (or \"tiled\") versions of NetHack that use graphics in place\nof the ASCII characters. Consult the readme file specific to your\nsystem for details. If there's no mention of a tiled version, your\nsystem probably does not support tiles.\n\nThere are also several \"unofficial\" versions of NetHack (meaning only\nthat they were not released by the DevTeam) that use enhanced graphical\ninterfaces, among which the more popular are:\n\n           Vulture (development of Jaakko Peltonen's \"Falcon's Eye\")\n                    &lt;http://www.darkarts.co.za/vulture/&gt;\n           noeGNUd (supports a wide range of 2D and 3D character- and\n           tile-based views and game playback)\n                    &lt;http://www.darkarts.co.za/noegnud&gt;\n\n\n1.6Q:   Is there a multiplayer version of NetHack?\n\n1.6A:\n\nNo. Nor is there likely to be, according to the DevTeam. \"We think you\ncan't do that playably without compromising the basic idea of being\nable to think as long as you want about what you're doing.\" [From\n&lt;http://www.nethack.org/&gt;.] The only player interaction in NetHack\nis that of bones files and the score list on a multiplayer system.\n\n\n1.7Q:   Why is it called \"Net\"Hack if you can't play it online against\n        other people?\n\n1.7A:\n\n\"The 'Net' in NetHack refers to the way the developers, many of whom\nhave never met in person, organize the work on the program.\" \n[From &lt;http://www.nethack.org/&gt;.]\n\nYou can play NetHack online, just not directly against other people.\n&lt;http://www.nicolaas.net/erebus/index.php?scat=04servers&gt; lists\nseveral public servers you could try. Try doing a search for \"NetHack\nServers\" in your favorite search engine, and connect to one of the\nmany available.\n\nThere are also ways to add the \"bones files\" of other adventures to\nyour local copy of NetHack, such as with the \"Hearse\" program\n&lt;http://hearse.krollmark.com/&gt;. Hearse currently supports the official\nDOS and Windows binary versions, the official Linux non-Qt binary\nversion and compatibly-compiled Unix installations, as well as the\nunofficial Psion port, the latest SLASH'EM stable and (currently)\ndevelopment versions, and Philipp Lucas' distribution of PatchHack 5.0\n(with and without the Hell Patch enabled). Support for other versions\nmay be added if sufficient demand exists.\n\n\n1.8Q:   When will the next version be released?\n\n1.8A:\n\nAccording to the DevTeam, \"when it's ready\". Details of core NetHack\ndevelopment have always been closely held, and though minor aspects\nhave been leaked (see &lt;http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Next_version&gt; for\na collation), the only real visible signs of progress are occasional\nupdates to the public buglist. In the meantime, several NetHack\nvariants are in active development, and many third-party patches\nare available: see 4.10 through 4.13 for details.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2: rec.games.roguelike.nethack\n\n2.1Q:   What is rec.games.roguelike.nethack?\n\n2.1A:\n\nrec.games.roguelike.nethack, often abbreviated to \"rgrn\", is a Usenet\nnewsgroup \"concerned with NetHack and related games\" (from the group\ncharter). It's the successor to the groups net.games.hack and\nrec.games.hack, and lives in the rec.games.roguelike.* hierarchy,\nwhere roguelike games other than NetHack and its variants either have\ntheir own groups or fall by default into rec.games.roguelike.misc.\nReaders of rgrn may also want to read rec.games.roguelike.announce,\na moderated group where postings of significant general interest for\nroguelike players are made.\n\n\n2.2Q:   What's with the posts labeled \"YAAP\" or \"YASD\"?\n\n2.2A:\n\nrgrn uses some terminology that can be confusing to the\nuninitiated. For a fairly complete list, please see\n&lt;http://www.spod-central.org/~psmith/nh/abbr-343.txt&gt;, but here is a\nlist of the more common abbreviations:\n\n\n    YAAP: Yet Another Ascension Post\n    YAFAP: Yet Another First Ascension Post.\n        Someone has completed a game of NetHack (possibly for the\n        first time) and wants to brag/show off. Finishing NetHack is\n        not a trivial accomplishment, so some bragging is probably\n        called for (see 2.9).\n\n    YASD: Yet Another Stupid Death.\n    YAAD: Yet Another Annoying Death.\n        Get used to this phenomenon if you're going to play\n        NetHack. Someone has died in a particularly amusing or\n        annoying way, and wants pity for his or her stupidity or a\n        shoulder to cry on.\n\n    YAFM: Yet Another Funny Message.\n    YAFMC: Yet Another Funny Message Combination\n    YAFP: Yet Another Funny Prompt\n        Sometimes, the messages NetHack gives you are amusing, or have\n        a strange juxtaposition of several messages or an odd mix of\n        inventory letters. Someone has found a message or combination\n        that they liked.\n\n    YANI: Yet Another New (Nifty) Idea (Item).\n        Someone has an idea for an improvement or addition to\n        the game.\n\n    DYWYPI?: Do You Want Your Possessions Identified?\n        The first question NetHack asks you if you are killed.\n        Many posters use it as shorthand for \"And then the\n        &lt;monster/trap/stupid move/typo&gt; killed me.\"\n\n    The DevTeam:\n        The DevTeam is the group of programmers responsible for\n        the maintenance and development of NetHack.\n        Remember: The DevTeam Think of Everything! (TDTTOE!)\n\n    The RNG: Random Number Generator -or- Random NetHack God.\n       Every game of NetHack is different, thanks to the\n       effects of the random numbers used in the creation of\n       the dungeon. Sometimes it seems like the random numbers\n       have a malicious will of their own and are therefore\n       personified, as in \"The RNG was especially cruel to me\n       today.\"\n\nAs well as abbreviations, rgrn (like any community) has developed its own\njargon for frequently-discussed concepts and strategies, for example\n\"pudding farming\" and the \"protection racket\"; Eva Myers has a discussion\nof these at &lt;http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/rgrnterms.html&gt;.\n\n\n2.3Q:   What's a \"spoiler\"?\n\n2.3A:\n\nA \"spoiler\" is an explanation of something in the game. That\nexplanation may spoil the fun of discovering that something for\nyourself. Since some people would rather figure things out for\nthemselves, they don't want the answer blurted out. For this reason,\nif you do post a spoiler, you may wish to buffer it with some blank\nspace (20 lines or so, or a formfeed character) so no one reads it\naccidentally. Alternatively, and (given the wide variety of newsreader\ndisplays) preferably, you can ROT13 encipher the spoiler (a simple\ncipher where a-&gt;n, b-&gt;o, ... z-&gt;m; see &lt;http://www.rot13.com/&gt; if your\nnewsreader doesn't support it natively). If you're starting a\nspoilersome thread, consider putting \"(spoilers)\" in the Subject\nheader.\n\nHowever, if you read this newsgroup you should accept that you're\nprobably going to come across spoilers whether you want to or not.\n\n\n2.4Q:   What's a \"source diver\"?\n\n2.4A:\n\nThe computer code for NetHack is publicly available, unlike that for\nmost games. Someone with programming skill can look through the code\n(or \"source\") to get the answers to questions about how the game\nworks. This is called \"source diving\". For the curious, NetHack is\nwritten in C.\n\n\n2.5Q:   I'm having trouble with my game, can I post my saved game\n        file so someone can help me out?\n\n2.5A: \n\nNo. The posting of binaries (this includes screenshots) to non-binary\nnewsgroups such as rgrn is frowned upon. If you feel you need a map\nto explain your problem, use an ASCII \"screenshot\" instead.  Besides,\nsaved games won't work across platforms, and depending on the\nvariables set when the game was compiled, may not even work if they\nare from the same platform. Describe your situation/problem as best\nyou can, and we'll help you out as best we can.\n\n\n2.5Q:   What's this \"netiquette\" that other posters keep\n        mentioning?\n\n2.5A:\n\n\"Netiquette\" refers to InterNET etIQUETTE, or the polite way of doing\nthings online.  Following these conventions is not only polite, but\nwill make your articles much easier to read, and therefore more people\nare likely to read them. With specific regard to the newsgroup\nrgrn, there are a few things you should keep in mind when posting:\n\n    Top posting: \n        \"Top posting\" refers to putting your response before the\n        quoted material you are responding to. When you respond to an\n        article, put your response below the text you quote. (If\n        you're responding to several separate points in the same\n        article, put your response below each individually.) This\n        ensures that the later responses stay in proper chronological\n        order, making reading both easier and more logical.\n        Unfortunately, top posting is the default for some newsreaders\n        (notably Microsoft Outlook Express). This doesn't make it\n        correct. (A longer article on good Usenet quoting style can be\n        found at &lt;http://www.anta.net/misc/nnq/nquote.shtml&gt;.)\n\n    Quoting:\n        Quote appropriate context. Usenet is an asynchronous medium,\n        and you can't be sure that everyone's received, read, or\n        remembered the article you're responding to, so your message\n        should make sense in isolation. Only quote the relevant parts\n        of the article, and cut the rest (including signatures). This\n        keeps articles relatively short, and easy to read. In the same\n        vein, don't cut so much that it's hard to determine who or\n        what you are responding to. Pay particular attention to the\n        attributions, which indicate who said what; if you quote\n        someone's text, attribute it, otherwise remove their\n        attribution. (Again, see the article referred to in the\n        previous paragraph.)\n\n    Line lengths:\n        Set your newsreader for line lengths around 70 characters to\n        avoid other newsreaders mangling your post when displayed or\n        quoted.\n\n    Signatures:\n        Signatures should only be a few lines long; the \"standard\"\n        maximum is 4 lines of 80 characters. Make sure that your\n        signature, if you have one, is preceded by a proper sig\n        separator: i.e.  \"-- \", two hyphens and a space, with nothing\n        else on the line.\n\n    Subject headers:\n        Make your subject specific (\"Are kobolds poisonous?\" is much\n        better than \"Question\" or \"Help\") without trying to stuff your\n        entire article into it. Even if the question you're asking or\n        point you're making is in your subject header, repeat it in\n        the body of the message; and ensure that the article is\n        comprehensible without depending on the subject for crucial\n        context. Many newsreaders' displays make reading subject\n        headers in direct conjunction with article text awkward, and\n        having all the relevant content in the body will make quoting\n        for response easier.\n\n    HTML:\n        Usenet is a text medium, and as such many newsreaders render\n        HTML messages as practically unreadable gibberish. Plain text\n        only, please.\n\n    Binaries:\n        rgrn is a non-binary newsgroup. If you have a binary file\n        that you feel the group would like access to, upload it\n        somewhere and provide a URL.\n\n    Personal attacks and flames:\n        Personal attacks have no place in a public forum; if you feel\n        you must flame someone, take it to email.\n\nYour best bet, as with most newsgroups, is to read the newsgroup for a\nwhile and get a feeling for the place before you post.\n\n\n2.7Q:   What topics should I be careful about discussing?\n\n2.7A:\n\nApart from obviously \"controversial\" things which wouldn't generally\nbe on-topic for rgrn anyway, there are several subjects which you should\nbe cautious about raising. These fall into three main categories:\n\n    Holy wars\n        People are unlikely to change their minds on these; argument\n        just tends to lead to bickering and flaming. A by no means\n        comprehensive list:        \n\n        vi-keys (hjkl) versus number_pad.\n        ASCII versus tiles.\n        Arguments from realism versus \"NetHack Is Not Real Life\".\n        The morality of savescumming (see 4.1) and rerolling\n          starting characters.\n        Whether NetHack's license is more or less \"free\" than\n          some other program's license.\n\n    Hardy perennials\n        Fine in themselves, these subjects come up often enough\n        that there's little new to say about them. Some examples:\n\n        What background music to play NetHack to.\n        What letters to assign inventory to.\n        Age/location surveys.\n        The succubi/chains/bullwhips/BDSM jokes.\n\n    Cans of worms\n        Some suggestions for new features or changes to gameplay are\n        recurrently made, but open up large-scale problems of\n        implementation feasibility or game balance; as a result,\n        they're more or less at the status \"show us a working patch\n        that doesn't break the game, then we'll talk\". A few examples:\n\n        Potions leaving empty bottles when quaffed.\n        Ettins wearing two helmets/amulets, mariliths six rings, etc.\n        Facing.\n        Arbitrary rather than straight-line targetting.\n        Platform- or version-independent savefiles and bonesfiles.\n       \nPlease research the archives (Google Groups should be handy here)\nbeforehand and only post on these subjects if you think you have\nsomething particularly new to say; and try not to make it\ninflammatory.\n\n\n2.8Q:   Anything else I shouldn't post?\n\n2.8A:\n\nWhile in general people will be happy to answer genuine queries, it's\na good idea to do at least some basic reading before asking them,\nchecking they're not covered in the Guidebook (see 1.4) or this FAQ\nfirst. Repeatedly asking questions that are easily answerable on your\nown falls into the \"somewhat annoying\" category.\n\nPosting misinformation is also generally considered a bad idea; while\nit's not required that you have an in-depth knowledge of the game to\nbe able to post here, if you're answering questions or asserting facts\nit's better to do so based on what you know or can test rather than\nhalf-remembered hearsay. In particular, there are a number of common\nmisconceptions that you should be aware of and not perpetuate: Eva\nMyers documents many of these at her \"Myths and Facts about NetHack\"\npage, &lt;http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/&gt;.\n\n\n2.9Q:   I've won! I've won!\n\n2.9A:\n\nCongratulations! Feel free to tell us all about how it went; post a\nYAAP or YAFAP (see 2.2) with a description of the game. (If you're\nplaying a modified version of the game, it's a good idea to make it\nclear what modifications have been applied.)\n\nIt's conventional for these posts to include some of the information\nfrom the endgame disclosure screens (though you'll want to be\nselective about this: how many monsters you killed in total is\ninteresting, exactly how many giant beetles you killed usually isn't).\nIf you're playing with a text-based interface, you can copy and paste\nthe details from the terminal (under the Win32 tty interface,\nEdit|Mark from the console's system menu); be careful to only use\nstraight ASCII for \"screenshots\", not IBMgraphics or DECgraphics.\nAlternatively, there is a \"dump\" patch available (see 4.13 for how to\napply it, or for details on PatchHack which includes it), allowing you\nto automatically write out the endgame information to a file,\navailable from Jukka Lahtinen's site:\n&lt;http://www.netsonic.fi/~walker/nethack.html#dump&gt;\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3: Gameplay and Spoilers\n\n3.1Q:   This game is really hard! Does anyone win? How?\n\n3.1A:\n\nBelieve it or not, people can and do \"win\" NetHack! The main key to\nwinning and not dying is patience. Nothing happens in the game if you\ndon't hit a key; this lets you think each of your moves out\ncarefully. Each time your character meets a grisly or stupid demise,\nuse it as a learning experience, and try not to repeat your mistake\nthe next time you play.\n\n\"The Complete Beginner's Guide to NetHack\" contains a great deal of\nadvice on playing NetHack. It's posted to the group frequently, or\nfind it online at &lt;http://www.melankolia.net/nethack/nethack.guide.html&gt;.\nIt does a good job of balancing advice against spoilers.\n\n\n3.2Q:   How much damage does &lt;weapon&gt; do? What good is an &lt;item&gt;?\n        How can I fix my armor when it gets rusty?\n\n3.2A:\n\nThese questions (and many others like them) all fall under the heading\nof spoilers, and as such are outside the bounds of this FAQ\nlist. There are numerous websites that will give you all the\ninformation you could want about the details of NetHack. Some of the\nrecommended ones include:\n\n        Yet Another NetHack Site (by Kate Nepveu):\n                &lt;http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/&gt;\n        Dylan O'Donnell's spoiler page:\n                &lt;http://www.spod-central.org/~psmith/nh/&gt;\n        NethackWiki, a publicly-editable wiki:\n                &lt;http://nethackwiki.com/&gt;\n\nEva Myers has a useful overview index of available spoilers at:\n&lt;http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/spoilerlist.html&gt;\n        \nOf course, if you don't (or can't) find the answer you seek, post your\nquestion and we'll do our best to answer it. (If your answer could be\nconsidered a \"spoiler\", see question 2.3).\n\n\n3.3Q:   Why are there TWO stairs leading down (or up)?\n\n3.3A:\n\nYou've discovered a \"branch\" off the main dungeon. There are several\nside trips you can make on your way to the bottom of the Dungeons of\nDoom. Some of them aren't needed to finish the game, but can garner\nyou useful items and experience.\n\n\n3.4Q:   I'm stuck! There doesn't seem to be any way down/up from\n        the level I'm on!\n\n3.4A:\n\nThere's always a way onwards. If you're in the main Dungeon, there\nwill be a way down, and a way to reach it; search every\nwall for secret doors (especially where the walls are near blank areas\nof the map). Check to make sure the stairs aren't hidden under an\nitem.  Move or smash any boulders or statues. If you're still stuck,\nfind (or dig) a hole or trap door and drop down to the next level.\n\nIf you're not in the main dungeon, you may have reached the end of the\ncurrent branch; time to retrace your steps and carry on by the other\nroute.\n\n\n3.5Q:   Why can't I successfully cast any spells? Why are all my \n        failure rates 100%?\n\n3.5A: \n\n\"Casting a spell also requires flexible movement, and wearing various\ntypes of armor may interfere with that.\" [From The NetHack Guidebook.]\nMetal items in particular are very inflexible.\n\n\n3.6Q:   Someone just told me to retrieve an artifact; where do I\n        go now?\n\n3.6A:\n\nDownstairs from where you are. If you can't find the staircase, it's\nprobably behind a secret door. It's no use going back through the\nmagic portal to look for it, because that's not where it is.\n\n\n3.7Q:   I'm on a maze level with a sealed-off area in the middle. I've\n        searched and searched, but can't find a secret door. I can't dig\n        or teleport through the walls, how do I get in there?\n\n3.7A:\n\nThere is a way in, just not from the level you are on. Keep exploring,\nand on some lower level you'll find a portal that will take you where\nyou want to go.\n\n\n3.8Q:   I'm trying to fight a monster that keeps teleporting away. How\n        do I get it to stop doing that so I can kill it?\n\n3.8A:\n\nTwo types of monsters do this; lowish-level ones that teleport\nrandomly every so often (and it's just a case of trying to get the\nkill in while they're in one spot for long enough) or after performing\ntheir attack on you (try not to let them), and higher-level boss\nmonsters that teleport away to heal up. In the latter case, find out\nwhere the monster goes (it's always the same spot), and get there\nfirst. You may need to use teleport yourself to get ahead of it.\n\n\n3.9Q:   I blocked up the trapdoors in this back corridor, and now I\n        can't get down!\n\n3.9A:\n\nThose trapdoors were the only way down from that particular special\nlevel, and once filled you can't dig through them again. However,\nyou can use level teleport to get to the level immediately beneath;\nteleport control would be useful here.\n \n\n3.10Q:   There's a monster stuck behind a boulder I particularly\n         want to push somewhere. How do I get rid of it?\n\n3.10A:\n\nYou can try to kill the monster: thrown or fired weapons will go past\nthe boulder, as will zapped wands or spells (though striking or force\nbolt will break the boulder, which may not be what you want).\nDropping all (or nearly all) your inventory will allow you to squeeze\ninto the same space as the boulder and attack the monster directly;\nbut this leaves you mostly defenceless, probably bare-handed, and can\nhave other undesirable side-effects. Or you can teleport both away in\none zap, though you won't be able to control where they end up.\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4: Miscellaneous\n\n4.1Q:   Did you guys know you can copy your save games and restore\n        them after you die? This makes the game a LOT easier!\n\n4.1A:\n\nYes, it does make it easier, but that's not the point. The game is\nSUPPOSED to be hard. Diabolically hard, as a matter of fact. This\ntactic is known as \"savescumming\" around these parts, and will garner\nyou no respect; indeed, the best you can hope for is polite scorn.\n\nThe DevTeam has added a mode to allow you to play without dying,\n\"explore mode\" (see question 4.2), but the downside is that your score\nwon't be recorded. How you play is your decision, just don't come here\nposting YAAP if you did it by savescumming. You should be aware,\nhowever, that there is a general consensus that savescumming is\nactually detrimental to the development of proper playing skills;\nbeing able to circumvent the required caution and tough strategic\ndecisions of NetHack may mean never learning to handle them well.\n\n\n4.2Q:   How do I get into explore or wizard mode?\n\n4.2A:\n\nTo enter explore mode use the \"-X\" switch on the command line (ie,\ntype \"nethack -X\" on the command line) or use the \"X\" command in the\ngame. Be warned that once you switch to Explore mode, there is no\nreturning to a regular game. Starting explore mode from the command\nline will also grant you a wand of wishing. If you die in explore\nmode, you can easily revive and try again, but as noted above, your\nscore will not be recorded.\n\nTo enter wizard (or debug; no relation to the Wizard role) mode type\n\"nethack -uwizard -D\" on the command line. If this doesn't work, then\nyou might have to enter a different name, be logged in as a different\nuser, or in your copy of the game wizard mode may be disabled. Ask the\nperson who compiled or installed the game about this.\n\n\n4.3Q:   What can I do in wizard mode that I can't do in a normal\n        game?\n\n4.3A:\n\nIn addition to the ability to continue after death as in explore mode,\nthe following is a list of wizard mode-specific commands:\n        \n    CTRL-E: Detect secret doors and traps\n    CTRL-F: Do magic mapping\n    CTRL-G: Create monster\n    CTRL-I: Identify items in pack\n    CTRL-O: Tell locations of special levels\n    CTRL-T: Do intra-level teleport\n    CTRL-V: Do trans-level teleport\n    CTRL-W: Make a wish\n    CTRL-X: Show attributes including intrinsic abilities\n\nThere are also a number of additional extended (#) commands, most\nproducing highly technical state information only useful for\ndebugging purposes.\n\n\n4.4Q:   My game crashed and I lost my character! Is there anything\n        I can do?\n\n4.4A:\n\nMaybe. There is a program that comes with NetHack called \"recover\"\nthat may be able to restore a crashed game, depending on how NetHack\nwas compiled. Check for a file called \"recover.txt\" for an explanation.\nOn some platforms, \"recover\" may have been incorporated into the game\nitself, and restarting the game using the same character name will\nwork (if the crash was recoverable from to start with).\n\n\n4.5Q:   I found a YAFMC! I found a bell on top of a grave and the\n        headstone said \"Saved by the bell.\" Quite a coincidence, huh?\n\n4.5A:\n\nNo, it's not. If the headstone generated for a grave reads \"Saved by\nthe bell,\" then a bell is generated for the grave as well.\n\n\n4.6Q:   Who's Schroedinger, and why did this quantum mechanic have\n        his cat in a box?\n\n4.6A: \n\nErwin Schroedinger (1887-1961) was a physicist who devised a famous\nthought experiment to translate quantum superposition into the\nmacroscopic classical-mechanical world. It involved an impenetrable\nbox (and, in NetHack, the box shows as empty until it's opened)\ncontaining a cat that would be killed by a 50/50 radioactive-decay\ntrigger; the resulting state of the cat, and how it is resolved when\nthe box is opened, depends on the particular school of quantum theory\nyou subscribe to, but one interpretation is that it is both alive and\ndead until observed.\n       \n\n4.7Q:   Why are elves chaotic? The elves in \"The Lord of the Rings\"\n        seem to be lawful.\n\n4.7A:\n\nNetHack draws on more than one source, and there are more elves than\nTolkien's (who weren't always as lawful as all that themselves, if you\nread the \"Silmarillion\"). Consider, by way of example, Michael Moorcock's\nMelniboneans (and remember that Stormbringer is also in the game), and\nSteven Brust's Dragaerans. In addition to these, there's hundreds of\nyears of tradition of the land of Faerie being one where human\nconcepts of law simply do not apply (though it's sometimes divided\nexplicitly into a Seelie and Unseelie Court). For a modern treatment\nof this concept, read Poul Anderson's \"Three Hearts and Three Lions\";\nor Terry Pratchett's \"Lords and Ladies\", for that matter.\n\n\n4.8Q:   I think I found a bug in the game! What should I do?\n\n4.8A:\n\nQuite possibly you have. If you're playing the latest version (3.4.3)\nyou may want to check the DevTeam's list of known bugs (available at\n&lt;http://www.nethack.org/v343/bugs.html&gt;) to make sure it's a new\none. If it's not a new one, the DevTeam may suggest a workaround. If\nit is a bug that hasn't been caught yet, please contact the DevTeam\nabout it at &lt;http://www.nethack.org/common/contact.html&gt;, or directly\nby e-mail at &lt;nethack-bugs@nethack.org&gt;. They appreciate knowing about\nbugs so they can fix them in the next release.\n\nAs well, please do post about it! Chances are, someone will put\ntogether a patch pretty quickly if it's really serious. To help work\nout where exactly the bug might lie, please give all the information\nyou can, including the exact text of any error messages the game\nproduced.\n\n\n4.9Q:   Has anyone ever written a program to play NetHack\n        automatically (a NetHack \"bot\")?\n\n4.9A\n\nNot successfully.  People have written \"bots\", or programs that will\nplay the game by themselves, for some other roguelikes. These bots\nusually play pretty successfully.\n\nHowever, no one has yet written a well-functioning one for NetHack,\nand the commonly held opinion is that NetHack is too complex for a\n\"bot\" that functions well to be currently practicable. If you're not\ndissuaded by this, you might want to address your efforts to NetHack's\npredecessor Hack first, as a rather simpler stepping-stone.\n\n\n4.10Q:   What is SLASH'EM?\n\n4.10A:\n\nSLASH'EM (Super Lotsa Added Stuff Hack - Extended Magic) is a variant\nof NetHack with more races, classes and generally just more stuff.\nLearn more about it at &lt;http://www.slashem.org/&gt;. Please mark questions\nabout SLASH'EM in rgrn with an \"[S]\" or \"[SLASH'EM]\" in the subject line\n(at the end is best, as some newsreaders strip initial square brackets),\nso people who only play regular (\"vanilla\") NetHack can more easily\nrecognize or filter your article.\n\n\n4.11Q:   What is SporkHack?\n\n4.11A:\n\nSporkHack is a variant of NetHack with a number of significant\ngameplay changes. Unlike SLASH'EM, its focus is less on adding new\nstuff, and more on improving balance and providing challenge and\nvariety for experienced players. Learn more about it, and play online,\nat &lt;http://sporkhack.nineball.org/&gt;. Please mark questions about\nSporkHack in rgrn with a \"[Spork] or \"[SPORK]\" in the subject line (at\nthe end is best, as some newsreaders strip initial square brackets),\nso people who only play regular (\"vanilla\") NetHack can more easily\nrecognize or filter your article.\n  \n\n4.12Q:   What is UnNetHack?\n\n4.12A:\n\nUnNetHack is a variant of NetHack, aimed at reducing predictability\nand increasing player challenge, along with adding more stuff. Its\nhomepage is at &lt;http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/unnethack/&gt;. Please\nmark questions about UnNetHack in rgrn with a \"[U] or \"[UnNetHack]\"\nin the subject line (at the end is best, as some newsreaders strip\ninitial square brackets), so people who only play regular (\"vanilla\")\nNetHack can more easily recognize or filter your article.\n\n\n4.13Q:   What are patches, and how do I apply them?\n\n4.13A:\n\nThere are many \"patches\" or code changes that people have written to\nalter or fix something about how NetHack works. These aren't \"official\"\nchanges to the game, but may include such things as new magic items or\ndifferent levels for the \"Hell\" area of NH. Pasi Kallinen maintains a\ndatabase of published patches at &lt;http://bilious.homelinux.org/&gt;;\nthere is also &lt;http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/patches.html&gt;, maintained\nby Ali Harlow, which is no longer updated but contains some patches\nPasi's doesn't.\n\nTo use these patches, you need to be able to compile them into your\nNetHack executable using a C compiler. First, you need to be able to\ncompile the basic game itself: download the source (see 1.3), read the\ninstallation instructions for your platform in the appropriate sys/\nsubdirectory, acquire one of the C compilers those recommend if\nnecessary, and follow the steps for compilation and installation.\n\nOnce this is working, you need a patch utility to apply the patch to\nthe source. For DOS or Windows, you can use the patch program from the\ndjgpp distribution available at &lt;http://www.delorie.com/&gt;. Use this\nutility to patch the base code and recompile the game.\n\n\n4.14Q:   I killed a shopkeeper named Izchak, why is everyone so\n         mad at me?\n\n4.14A:\n\nIzchak Miller, one of the founding members of the DevTeam, passed away\non April 1, 1994 from complications due to cancer. As he was\nresponsible for, among other things, much of the shopkeeper logic, the\nowner of the lighting shop was named for him as a tribute. The DevTeam\ndedicated version 3.2 of NetHack to the memory of Izchak Miller. Many\nplayers who will happily slay everything else that moves will spare\nIzchak's life as a sign of respect.\n\nFor a little more info, including a post from Izchak's\ndaughter, check out the following thread from 1996 in rgrn:\n&lt;http://tinyurl.com/r7l23&gt;\n\n\n4.15Q:   What websites have general information about NetHack?\n\n4.15A:\n\nIn addition to the sites mentioned in section 3.2 above, there are\nseveral excellent starting places for looking for NetHack web resources.\n\n    The DevTeam's links page:\n         &lt;http://www.nethack.org/common/links.html&gt;\n    Dion Nicolaas' NetHack Index:\n         &lt;http://www.nicolaas.net/erebus/&gt;\n    Ali Harlow's NetHack Page (particularly good for SLASH'EM):\n         &lt;http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack.html&gt;\n\nAlmost any NetHack webpage of value will be linked to by at least one\nof these sites.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5: Copyright info and acknowledgements\n\nThis document is Copyright 2000-2010 Stephen W.

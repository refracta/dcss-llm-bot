[Elbereth](/wiki/Elbereth \"Elbereth\"), [scrolls of scare monster](/wiki/Scroll_of_scare_monster \"Scroll of scare monster\"), [leather drums](/wiki/Leather_drum \"Leather drum\") and [tooled horns](/wiki/Tooled_horn \"Tooled horn\") are particularly useful for rogues.\n\nRogues are eligible for up to two bonuses when disarming floor [traps](/wiki/Trap \"Trap\"): one bonus applies with a (Xlvl/60) chance, while the other applies if the Rogue is carrying [the Master Key of Thievery](/wiki/The_Master_Key_of_Thievery \"The Master Key of Thievery\").\n\nRogues have double the normal chance of disarming [container traps](/wiki/Container_trap \"Container trap\").\n\nRogues also have additional proficiency with [lock picks](/wiki/Lock_pick \"Lock pick\") and credit cards - a Rogue with high [dexterity](/wiki/Dexterity \"Dexterity\") is actually faster with picks than with a skeleton key.\n\n(While the [guidebook](/wiki/Guidebook \"Guidebook\") describes Rogues as \"thieves,\" they do *not* have any inherent ability to steal gold or items from monsters or shops.)\n\n## Strategy\n\n### Character creation\n\nOrcs have an easier early game because of their starting food, [poison resistance](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\"), [infravision](/wiki/Infravision \"Infravision\"), and ability to commit [cannibalism](/wiki/Cannibalism \"Cannibalism\") or [same-race sacrifice](/wiki/Sacrifice#Sacrificing_creatures_of_same_race \"Sacrifice\") with impunity. Orcish daggers are slightly inferior, but it won't take you long to collect a set of generic daggers with which to replace them. On the other hand, humans have better [HP](/wiki/HP \"HP\") growth, as well as several advantages that become important later in the game: they have better [energy](/wiki/Energy \"Energy\") growth than orcs, and their higher [intelligence](/wiki/Intelligence \"Intelligence\") and [charisma](/wiki/Charisma \"Charisma\") caps make spellcasting and consorting with foocubi more reliable. Humans have other means of compensating for the lack of infravision, including [warning](/wiki/Warning \"Warning\") (e.g. from your [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\")) if all else fails.\n\nOrcish monsters are more likely to be generated peaceful for orcish heroes, while elven monsters are likely to be generated peaceful for chaotic humans - elves are always hostile to player orcs, and can be a fairly early nuisance to orcish Rogues due to ignoring Elbereth. Human monsters are not available as early for same-race sacrifices, and some of their corpses are harder to procure reliably compared to the groups of hostile orcs that may be generated.\n\n### Early game\n\n#### Objectives\n\nThe two top priorities in the early game are finding [food](/wiki/Food \"Food\") and [developing your primary attacks](#Weapons), which are weighted differently for humans and orcs. Orcish rogues' starting food items buy them some time to train before they need to start looking for food; once they do need to scavenge for food, they have more options thanks to their poison resistance—which allows them to eat the corpses of poisonous monsters like [kobolds](/wiki/Kobold \"Kobold\") safely—and their ability to [eat their own kind](/wiki/Cannibalism \"Cannibalism\") without an alignment penalty. Human rogues, however, will need to look for nonpoisonous corpses and (better yet) permafood on the first few levels of the dungeons.\n\nSince rogues can start with a relatively low [strength](/wiki/Strength \"Strength\"), it is a good idea to make an early run for [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") and push boulders to exercise that attribute. Raising strength not only increases your carrying capacity, but also the damage potential from your thrown daggers due to the bonus it provides; the random food items generated in that branch are also very welcome to a hungry rogue, and both of the two possible prizes can be of great use to them. A [bag of holding](/wiki/Bag_of_holding \"Bag of holding\") helps shore up carrying capacity, while an [amulet of reflection](/wiki/Amulet_of_reflection \"Amulet of reflection\") can protect your inventory and save you from many potentially game-ending wand attacks.\n\n#### Weapons\n\nA rogue's best attack in the early game is a volley of [thrown](/wiki/Throw \"Throw\") daggers. Rogues should rely on throwing daggers as much as circumstances and their stock of daggers permit in order to raise the dagger [skill](/wiki/Skill \"Skill\") to Expert before anything else. Having Expert level in the skill, combined with the role's bonus to multishot, allows you to throw up to four daggers at once, and gives each dagger a +2 damage bonus. However, be aware that if one of your daggers kills your target, any remaining daggers you threw may fly past the corpse and anger peaceful monsters behind it. Use the [numeric prefix](/wiki/Numeric_prefix \"Numeric prefix\") to fire only one dagger at a time when necessary, especially in [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\").\n\nYou may choose to wield one of your daggers in melee as well, instead of your starting short sword, because every bit of dagger training helps. There is little reason to train your short sword skill if you plan to get an [artifact](/wiki/Artifact \"Artifact\") melee weapon; however, an [elven short sword](/wiki/Elven_short_sword \"Elven short sword\") is perfectly serviceable for later [twoweaponing](/wiki/Twoweaponing \"Twoweaponing\"). One dagger can be separated from your starting stack for wielding by using the #[adjust](/wiki/Adjust \"Adjust\") command with a number prefix to change the letter under which it is stored in your inventory; it is possible to [quiver](/wiki/Quiver \"Quiver\") all but one of a wielded stack of weapons, changing the letter of the second set automatically. You can then #[name](/wiki/Name \"Name\") the two sets differently to prevent them stacking.\n\nTo increase your supply of ammunition, collect any daggers you find, but curse-test them before wielding any. [Elven daggers](/wiki/Elven_dagger \"Elven dagger\") are especially desirable—being made of [wood](/wiki/Wood \"Wood\"), they cannot [rust or corrode](/wiki/Erosion \"Erosion\"), so they are good for fighting [rust monsters](/wiki/Rust_monster \"Rust monster\") and [acidic](/wiki/Acid \"Acid\") monsters that would damage iron weapons.\n\n##### Projectiles\n\nVarious non-dagger [missile](/wiki/Missile \"Missile\") weapons—such as [darts](/wiki/Dart \"Dart\"), [crossbow bolts](/wiki/Crossbow_bolt \"Crossbow bolt\"), and [shuriken](/wiki/Shuriken \"Shuriken\")—can be poisoned by #[dipping](/wiki/Dipping \"Dipping\") them into your starting [potion of sickness](/wiki/Potion_of_sickness \"Potion of sickness\"). One strategy is to #[untrap](/wiki/Untrap \"Untrap\") [dart traps](/wiki/Dart_trap \"Dart trap\"), which are fairly common in the upper levels of the Dungeons of Doom, and then poison the resulting large stack of darts using the potion. Poisoned weapons do an additional d6 damage to non-resistant monsters, and also have a 10% chance of killing the monster outright, making it ideal for tougher monsters - [intelligent](/wiki/Intelligent \"Intelligent\") monsters can pick up poisoned weapons and toss them back at you, however. As [magic cancellation](/wiki/Magic_cancellation \"Magic cancellation\") does not protect against poisoning from thrown weapons, human Rogues should obtain the property as soon as they can and use poisoned missiles cautiously until then; orcs start with poison resistance, making this a much less risky option for them.\n\nRogues can also reach Expert in [crossbows](/wiki/Crossbow \"Crossbow\"), so another possibility is to collect [bolts](/wiki/Crossbow_bolt \"Crossbow bolt\") in the [Mines](/wiki/Mines \"Mines\") and poison them. Unlike darts, bolts require a launcher, but their damage potential is greater (1d4+1/1d6+1 vs 1d3/1d2). Both kinds of missiles have a chance of [breaking](/wiki/Projectile#Breakage \"Projectile\"), which can be reduced by enchanting them; if you plan to use crossbows, it is usually worthwhile to avoid advancing their skill beyond Basic until you have mastered daggers. Depending on your early weapon choices, you may find it easier to commit to [a specific type of projectile](#Weapon_choices) down the line.\n\n#### Contemplating twoweaponing\n\nRogues are one of the few roles who can reach Expert in twoweapon combat. They also reach Expert in the [knife](/wiki/Knife \"Knife\") skill, so they are the role that gets the most effect out of using a [crysknife](/wiki/Crysknife \"Crysknife\") as a secondary weapon.\n\nIn [NetHack 3.4.3](/wiki/NetHack_3.4.3 \"NetHack 3.4.3\") and previous versions, twoweaponing was relatively unpopular since rogues cannot reach Expert skill in the better [artifact weapons](/wiki/Artifact_weapon \"Artifact weapon\") (besides [Magicbane](/wiki/Magicbane \"Magicbane\"), which is [cross-aligned](/wiki/Artifact_blast \"Artifact blast\")) and cannot [backstab](/wiki/Backstab \"Backstab\") if they are wielding two weapons at once, sacrificing the bonus damage that was one of the most popular features of the role. Because of this, many players did not train the twoweapon skill at all, reserving the skill points for other skills, and using the free hand to augment their [AC](/wiki/AC \"AC\") with a [shield](/wiki/Shield \"Shield\"). [Backstab](/wiki/Backstab \"Backstab\") damage has been significantly weakened starting with [NetHack 3.6.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.6.0 \"NetHack 3.6.0\"): it now only occurs in single-weapon [melee](/wiki/Melee \"Melee\") and no longer applies to thrown projectiles. Backstabbing is still useful as an early game tactic, but its intermittent damage bonus now pales in comparison to consistent, high-level twoweaponing in the later game.\n\nThat said, if you find yourself next to a [fleeing](/wiki/Fleeing \"Fleeing\") monster, remember that switching from two weapons to one (to enable backstabs) doesn't take a [turn](/wiki/Turn \"Turn\").[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1) With a [double damage](/wiki/Double_damage \"Double damage\") weapon, backstabs deal ([XL](/wiki/XL \"XL\") + 1) damage on average, which outperforms most offhand weapons from midgame on.\n\nTwoweaponing can be considered an alternative way to produce major artifact damage with weaker weapons. Before strength, enchantment and skill bonuses, [Grayswandir](/wiki/Grayswandir \"Grayswandir\") will average 9 and 19.5 damage against non-haters and silver-haters respectively. A [crysknife](/wiki/Crysknife \"Crysknife\")/[silver dagger](/wiki/Silver_dagger \"Silver dagger\") twoweapon will yield approximately 7.75 and 18.25. With full strength, skill and enchantment available to a rogue, a single-handed Grayswandir will average 30 and 40.5 while the the crysknife/silver dagger twoweapon averages 35.75 and 46.25; the chaotic [Grimtooth](/wiki/Grimtooth \"Grimtooth\") averages the same damage as a single crysknife for a Rogue without requiring training in a new [skill](/wiki/Skill \"Skill\").\n\n#### Armor\n\nA Rogue's starting leather armor is not very good past the early game, and can be traded out for almost any noncursed body armor. Given their restrictions on attack and healing spells, rogues are not likely to rely heavily on magic in the heat of battle for most of the game, so they should not be as concerned about spellcasting failure. They typically start with low strength, however, and encumberment is a serious inconvenience in the early game, so avoid wearing anything you cannot lift without becoming Burdened. [Mithril-coats](/wiki/Mithril-coat \"Mithril-coat\") are most ideal for the early game, as they are not only high [AC](/wiki/AC \"AC\") (and [MC](/wiki/MC \"MC\")2) but weigh no more than your starting leather armor. Once you are confident in your fighting skills, fight dwarves and hobbits to relieve them of their mail.\n\nRogues who seek to backstab over twoweaponing in 3.4.3, previous versions and variants based on them lose the least from wearing a shield, since all of their best weapons are one-handed; the [shield of reflection](/wiki/Shield_of_reflection \"Shield of reflection\") is their best option, eliminating the need for an [amulet of reflection](/wiki/Amulet_of_reflection \"Amulet of reflection\") or [SDSM](/wiki/SDSM \"SDSM\") and freeing up the neck and torso slots for other items, but they are unfortunately rare. This is much less true as of 3.6.0 and later versions, where twoweaponing is more preferable.\n\nRogues are at a disadvantage when it comes to attempting the [protection racket](/wiki/Protection_racket \"Protection racket\"), because while their starting sack is handy for [shoplifting](/wiki/Shoplifting \"Shoplifting\") and [credit cloning](/wiki/Credit_cloning \"Credit cloning\"), the [Mines](/wiki/Mines \"Mines\") will inevitably be dangerous because dwarves and gnomes alike are hostile to chaotics. Since armor is less disadvantageous for Rogues than for other roles, racking up early protection points is less urgent for them.\n\n#### Spells\n\nRogues do not start with knowledge of any spells or skill in any spell school, and their starting intelligence (their spellcasting [attribute](/wiki/Attribute \"Attribute\")) and spellcasting power are both low, so spellcasting is not likely to be reliable in the early game.\n\nHowever, once you have a reliable source of food, and a safe place to read, it may be worthwhile to pick up spellbooks and read them so you can recognize useful spellbooks later. Spells in the [divination](/wiki/Divination \"Divination\"), [escape](/wiki/Escape \"Escape\"), and [matter](/wiki/Matter \"Matter\") classes can be trained, while most spells outside of your strong schools can be forgotten and cast to confuse yourself later.\n\nOnce you have learned low-level spells in your schools (such as [detect monsters](/wiki/Detect_monsters \"Detect monsters\") and [jumping](/wiki/Jumping \"Jumping\")) and have at least 5 power points, you can take advantages of lulls in the action to remove interfering armor and practice casting those spells to train the respective skills after you have reached expert in daggers.\n\n### Midgame\n\n#### Objectives\n\nThe [Rogue quest](/wiki/Rogue_quest \"Rogue quest\") is infamous as one of the trickiest in NetHack, and advance preparation is required to complete it; see the [strategy](/wiki/Rogue_quest#Strategy \"Rogue quest\") section for details. The Rogue quest artifact is [the Master Key of Thievery](/wiki/The_Master_Key_of_Thievery \"The Master Key of Thievery\"), a very nice artifact which confers the [half physical damage](/wiki/Half_physical_damage \"Half physical damage\"), [warning](/wiki/Warning \"Warning\"), and [teleport control](/wiki/Teleport_control \"Teleport control\") extrinsics and makes [untrapping](/wiki/Untrap \"Untrap\") more reliable. It can also be [invoked](/wiki/Invoke \"Invoke\") to untrap boxes and doors with 100% success -- this useful properly is easy to forget, so keep it in mind.\n\nWarning is somewhat superseded by [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\"), though the properties can complement each other, and there are other sources of teleport control (including [tengu](/wiki/Tengu \"Tengu\") meat); half physical damage is useful and rare enough to make the Master Key a [wish](/wiki/Wish \"Wish\") target for other chaotics on its own. If you have obtained the quest artifact without a source of magic resistance, seeking it out should be your next immediate goal.\n\n#### Weapon choices\n\nOnce you have access to [holy water](/wiki/Holy_water \"Holy water\") and [scrolls of enchant weapon](/wiki/Scroll_of_enchant_weapon \"Scroll of enchant weapon\"), you have a few choices of projectile weapons: daggers, darts, or crossbow bolts, any of which you can advance to Expert. If you have not committed to a projectile at this point, consider the advantages and disadvantages of each as listed below:\n\n- Daggers have [multishot](/wiki/Multishot \"Multishot\") and [to-hit](/wiki/To-hit \"To-hit\") bonuses and are likely to be at least Skilled if not Expert by this point of the game, though the to-hit bonus may not make as much difference at this stage. Unfortunately, they are the only projectile that cannot be poisoned, and are also fairly heavy at 10 [aum](/wiki/Aum \"Aum\") per dagger: the weight from a sizeable stack can add up, as many characters can struggle to carry more than 16-20 daggers without help from a bag of holding, and they exhaust quicker when thrown, making retrieval somewhat tricky in some cases. That said, daggers do not require a [launcher](/wiki/Launcher \"Launcher\") like crossbow bolts, and also do not \"mulch\" like darts or bolts can, making them a low-maintenance option for a melee-focused rogue.\n\n* Darts deal slightly less base damage than daggers (at most one point on average, assuming elven daggers against a small target), and also lack a multishot bonus; switching to them from daggers requires six skill slots. Darts also weigh 1⁄10th as much as daggers and do not require a launcher, making [encumbrance](/wiki/Encumbrance \"Encumbrance\") much easier to manage in comparison. They can easily be obtained in bulk from [dart traps](/wiki/Dart_trap \"Dart trap\") and poisoned with your starting [potion of sickness](/wiki/Potion_of_sickness \"Potion of sickness\") for extra damage and the chance of an instakill, although many late-game enemies are poison-resistant. Darts are often the most ideal choice for a ranged-focused game plan - you can often carry more than enough to freely engage certain monsters such as [disenchanters](/wiki/Disenchanter \"Disenchanter\") or flying monsters like [mind flayers](/wiki/Mind_flayer \"Mind flayer\") that are over a [moat](/wiki/Moat \"Moat\"), or else flee from potentially-lethal threats, all without losing much ranged capability from eroded, mulched or otherwise-lost darts.\n\n- Crossbow bolts deal slightly more base damage against small targets and substantially more against large ones. However, bolts also require a crossbow, which takes in-game time to switch to - this can prove unwieldly if one of your weapons is cursed, and makes two-weaponing more cumbersome. Additionally, bolts have a multishot *penalty* unless you have at least 18 [strength](/wiki/Strength \"Strength\") -- however, they don't benefit from the +2 or higher damage bonus that this level of strength grants to darts and daggers, negating their nominally higher damage. Switching to them from daggers also requires six skill slots. These caveats, and the carrying capacity required due to the launcher, as well as their relative rarity compared to darts, generally make bolts the hardest of the projectiles to utilize. With this in mind, bolts weigh 1⁄10th as much as daggers and can be poisoned much like darts, and still generate often in the inventories of ​G [gnomes](/wiki/Gnome_\\(monster_class\\) \"Gnome (monster class)\") and ​C [centaurs](/wiki/Centaur_\\(monster_class\\) \"Centaur (monster class)\") - losing individual bolts is also not as pressing as leaving daggers behind. The crossbow's enchantment only affects to-hit bonuses, so enchanting the bolts should prove sufficient for Rogues willing to take this route.\n\n* An [aklys](/wiki/Aklys \"Aklys\") is the lowest-maintenance weapon, weighing only 15 aum and being almost infinitely reusable. Since it can't be multishot, there's little benefit to advancing club skill beyond Basic, saving five skill slots relative to the projectile weapons. Its damage potential is far less than any of the above options, but a well-enchanted aklys is still sufficient to safely deal with the occasional [cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\"), [mimic](/wiki/Mimic \"Mimic\"), or sea monster.\n\nWhichever missiles you choose, bless and [rustproof](/wiki/Rustproof \"Rustproof\") them and raise their enchantment to increase their damage potential and accuracy: the bonus damage from enchantment somewhat flattens out the difference between their base damage. A [ring of increase damage](/wiki/Ring_of_increase_damage \"Ring of increase damage\") with a positive enchantment is a very useful supplement when throwing weapons, with the damage bonus applied to each hit - a [scroll of charging](/wiki/Scroll_of_charging \"Scroll of charging\") or two should raise the ring's enchantment to a suitable level, though beware of exploding the ring!\n\n##### Artifact weapons\n\nRogues can look for a powerful [artifact](/wiki/Artifact \"Artifact\") weapon to back up their ranged [daggerstorm](/wiki/Daggerstorm \"Daggerstorm\") with a strong melee attack that uses their backstab bonus to full effect. [Sacrificing](/wiki/Sacrificing \"Sacrificing\") for an artifact weapon is not terribly useful for Rogues, since they do not have a guaranteed sacrifice gift and the available chaotic artifact gifts are either very weak or of very narrow utility, with the exception of [Stormbringer](/wiki/Stormbringer \"Stormbringer\") - at least one sacrifice gift is required before they have any hope of getting one of the more useful weapons such as the unaligned [Fire Brand](/wiki/Fire_Brand \"Fire Brand\") and [Frost Brand](/wiki/Frost_Brand \"Frost Brand\").\n\nTwo of the better options, [Magicbane](/wiki/Magicbane \"Magicbane\") and Grayswandir, are cross-aligned and must be [wished](/wiki/Wish \"Wish\") for or found in [bones](/wiki/Bones \"Bones\") - watch out for the (admittedly small) [blasting damage](/wiki/Artifact_blast \"Artifact blast\"). Magicbane's [scare](/wiki/Scare \"Scare\") attack frequently causes monsters to flee, and as an [athame](/wiki/Athame \"Athame\") it uses the dagger skill that Rogues are naturally proficient in and can reliably engrave Elbereth. Grayswandir's [double damage](/wiki/Double_damage \"Double damage\") applies to backstab damage, and rogues can reach Skilled in [saber](/wiki/Saber \"Saber\").\n\n#### Spells\n\nRogues can reach Skilled in [divination spells](/wiki/Divination_spells \"Divination spells\") and [escape spells](/wiki/Escape_spells \"Escape spells\"), as well as the somewhat less useful [matter spells](/wiki/Matter_spells \"Matter spells\"), and [human](/wiki/Human \"Human\") rogues can reach a respectable 87% success rate without a [robe](/wiki/Robe \"Robe\"). You most likely started the game with a mediocre intelligence, so consider collecting any potions you find and performing [alchemy](/wiki/Alchemy \"Alchemy\") to brew up some [potions of gain ability](/wiki/Potion_of_gain_ability \"Potion of gain ability\"). In the absence of useful spells, however, rogues can easily make do without.\n\nDivination spells are worth raising to Skilled once you have at least two skill slots free, since several spells in this class ([detect monsters](/wiki/Detect_monsters \"Detect monsters\"), [detect treasure](/wiki/Detect_treasure \"Detect treasure\"), and [identify](/wiki/Identify \"Identify\")) have improved effects at this level. [Identify](/wiki/Identify \"Identify\") can save you a lot of curse-testing, and [magic mapping](/wiki/Magic_mapping \"Magic mapping\") is a boon in Gehennom. Advancing escape spells to Skilled is less important, but can be useful if you want to rely on the [jumping](/wiki/Spellbook_of_jumping \"Spellbook of jumping\") spell to reach tiles not accessible with [jumping boots](/wiki/Jumping_boots \"Jumping boots\"), or be able to terminate the [levitation](/wiki/Spellbook_of_levitation \"Spellbook of levitation\") spell at will. There is little reason to advance matter spells far, as Rogues are unlikely to have the spellcasting abilities or power to cast [polymorph](/wiki/Spellbook_of_polymorph \"Spellbook of polymorph\").\n\n#### Armor\n\nIf you chose to use a shield instead of twoweaponing, and you haven't found a shield of reflection before reaching [Medusa's Island](/wiki/Medusa%27s_Island \"Medusa's Island\"), checking [Perseus](/wiki/Perseus \"Perseus\")'s statue for one can be especially rewarding, provided you are careful not to get stoned by [Medusa](/wiki/Medusa \"Medusa\").\n\n### Late game\n\n#### Weapons\n\nEntering the late game, rogues should continue to refine their primary attacks, enchanting their melee artifact weapon to +5 or +6 and enchanting their missiles as well. [Silver daggers](/wiki/Silver_dagger \"Silver dagger\") are often desirable missile weapons, but are exceedingly rare, and not worth a wish.\n\nIf you choose to try twoweaponing despite forfeiting the backstab bonus, good secondary weapon choices for Rogues are crysknives, silver sabers, katanas, and elven broadswords. Crysknives pair well with Magicbane, since you can train both weapon classes to Expert for the lowest to-hit and damage penalty. If you have Grayswandir, [Stormbringer](/wiki/Stormbringer \"Stormbringer\"), or one of the Brands, you may prefer using secondary weapons from the same classes so you do not have to train a second weapon skill.\n\n#### Armor\n\nRogues can use shields of reflection comfortably if they so choose, allowing them to forego [silver dragon scale mail](/wiki/Silver_dragon_scale_mail \"Silver dragon scale mail\") [in favor of](/wiki/GDSM_versus_SDSM \"GDSM versus SDSM\") [gray dragon scale mail](/wiki/Gray_dragon_scale_mail \"Gray dragon scale mail\") - this supplies the [magic resistance](/wiki/Magic_resistance \"Magic resistance\") that your quest artifact lacks, and frees the neck and cloak slots for other items. Alternately, you may choose SDSM if you have another source of magic resistance and you prefer not to wear a shield.\n\n## Rank titles\n\nThe [status line](/wiki/Status_line \"Status line\") shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\n\n- XL 1-2: Footpad\n- XL 3-5: Cutpurse\n- XL 6-9: Rogue\n- XL 10-13: Pilferer\n- XL 14-17: Robber\n- XL 18-21: Burglar\n- XL 22-25: Filcher\n- XL 26-29: Magsman/Magswoman\n- XL 30: Thief\n\n## Quest\n\n- *Main article: [Rogue quest](/wiki/Rogue_quest \"Rogue quest\")*\n\nThe Rogue quest sees you fighting the [Master Assassin](/wiki/Master_Assassin \"Master Assassin\") for [The Master Key of Thievery](/wiki/The_Master_Key_of_Thievery \"The Master Key of Thievery\"). Inspired by the profession you have chosen, there are lots of stealing monsters, traps, shapeshifters and challenges even to access the quest nemesis!\n\n## Variants\n\nIn versions of NetHack prior to 3.6.0 and some variants (including SLASH'EM) based on these versions, rogues could also get backstab damage with thrown weapons for each hit. This was considered unbalancing and removed in 3.6.0. [\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2)\n\n### SLASH'EM\n\nSee [Rogue(SLASH'EM)](/wiki/Rogue/SLASH%27EM \"Rogue/SLASH'EM\").\n\n### SlashTHEM\n\nIn addition to SLASH'EM, they can be [incantifiers](/wiki/Incantifier \"Incantifier\"), [kobolds](/wiki/Kobold_\\(starting_race\\) \"Kobold (starting race)\"), or [lycanthropes](/wiki/Lycanthrope_\\(starting_race\\) \"Lycanthrope (starting race)\").\n\n## Encyclopedia entry\n\nI understand the business, I hear it: to have an open ear, a  \nquick eye, and a nimble hand, is necessary for a cut-purse; a  \ngood nose is requisite also, to smell out work for the other  \nsenses. I see this is the time that the unjust man doth  \nthrive. <...> The prince himself is about a piece of iniquity,  \nstealing away from his father with his clog at his heels: if  \nI thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king  \nwithal, I would not do't: I hold it the more knavery to  \nconceal it; and therein am I constant to my profession.\n\n\\[ Autolycus the Rogue, from The Winter's Tale by  \n                William Shakespeare ]\n\n## See also\n\n- [Rogue (player monster)](/wiki/Rogue_\\(player_monster\\) \"Rogue (player monster)\")\n\n## References\n\n1.

an easier early game because of their starting food, <a href=\"/wiki/Poison_resistance\" title=\"Poison resistance\">poison resistance</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Infravision\" title=\"Infravision\">infravision</a>, and ability to commit <a href=\"/wiki/Cannibalism\" title=\"Cannibalism\">cannibalism</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Sacrifice#Sacrificing_creatures_of_same_race\" title=\"Sacrifice\">same-race sacrifice</a> with impunity. Orcish daggers are slightly inferior, but it won't take you long to collect a set of generic daggers with which to replace them. On the other hand, humans have better <a href=\"/wiki/HP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HP\">HP</a> growth, as well as several advantages that become important later in the game: they have better <a href=\"/wiki/Energy\" title=\"Energy\">energy</a> growth than orcs, and their higher <a href=\"/wiki/Intelligence\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intelligence\">intelligence</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Charisma\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Charisma\">charisma</a> caps make spellcasting and consorting with foocubi more reliable. Humans have other means of compensating for the lack of infravision, including <a href=\"/wiki/Warning\" title=\"Warning\">warning</a> (e.g. from your <a href=\"/wiki/Quest_artifact\" title=\"Quest artifact\">quest artifact</a>) if all else fails.\n</p><p>Orcish monsters are more likely to be generated peaceful for orcish heroes, while elven monsters are likely to be generated peaceful for chaotic humans - elves are always hostile to player orcs, and can be a fairly early nuisance to orcish Rogues due to ignoring Elbereth. Human monsters are not available as early for same-race sacrifices, and some of their corpses are harder to procure reliably compared to the groups of hostile orcs that may be generated.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_game\">Early game</span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives\">Objectives</span></h4>\n<p>The two top priorities in the early game are finding <a href=\"/wiki/Food\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Food\">food</a> and <a href=\"#Weapons\">developing your primary attacks</a>, which are weighted differently for humans and orcs. Orcish rogues' starting food items buy them some time to train before they need to start looking for food; once they do need to scavenge for food, they have more options thanks to their poison resistance&#8212;which allows them to eat the corpses of poisonous monsters like <a href=\"/wiki/Kobold\" title=\"Kobold\">kobolds</a> safely&#8212;and their ability to <a href=\"/wiki/Cannibalism\" title=\"Cannibalism\">eat their own kind</a> without an alignment penalty. Human rogues, however, will need to look for nonpoisonous corpses and (better yet) permafood on the first few levels of the dungeons.\n</p><p>Since rogues can start with a relatively low <a href=\"/wiki/Strength\" title=\"Strength\">strength</a>, it is a good idea to make an early run for <a href=\"/wiki/Sokoban\" title=\"Sokoban\">Sokoban</a> and push boulders to exercise that attribute. Raising strength not only increases your carrying capacity, but also the damage potential from your thrown daggers due to the bonus it provides; the random food items generated in that branch are also very welcome to a hungry rogue, and both of the two possible prizes can be of great use to them. A <a href=\"/wiki/Bag_of_holding\" title=\"Bag of holding\">bag of holding</a> helps shore up carrying capacity, while an <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_reflection\" title=\"Amulet of reflection\">amulet of reflection</a> can protect your inventory and save you from many potentially game-ending wand attacks.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapons\">Weapons</span></h4>\n<p>A rogue's best attack in the early game is a volley of <a href=\"/wiki/Throw\" title=\"Throw\">thrown</a> daggers. Rogues should rely on throwing daggers as much as circumstances and their stock of daggers permit in order to raise the dagger <a href=\"/wiki/Skill\" title=\"Skill\">skill</a> to Expert before anything else. Having Expert level in the skill, combined with the role's bonus to multishot, allows you to throw up to four daggers at once, and gives each dagger a +2 damage bonus. However, be aware that if one of your daggers kills your target, any remaining daggers you threw may fly past the corpse and anger peaceful monsters behind it. Use the <a href=\"/wiki/Numeric_prefix\" title=\"Numeric prefix\">numeric prefix</a> to fire only one dagger at a time when necessary, especially in <a href=\"/wiki/Minetown\" title=\"Minetown\">Minetown</a>.\n</p><p>You may choose to wield one of your daggers in melee as well, instead of your starting short sword, because every bit of dagger training helps. There is little reason to train your short sword skill if you plan to get an <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact\" title=\"Artifact\">artifact</a> melee weapon; however, an <a href=\"/wiki/Elven_short_sword\" title=\"Elven short sword\">elven short sword</a> is perfectly serviceable for later <a href=\"/wiki/Twoweaponing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Twoweaponing\">twoweaponing</a>. One dagger can be separated from your starting stack for wielding by using the #<a href=\"/wiki/Adjust\" title=\"Adjust\">adjust</a> command with a number prefix to change the letter under which it is stored in your inventory; it is possible to <a href=\"/wiki/Quiver\" title=\"Quiver\">quiver</a> all but one of a wielded stack of weapons, changing the letter of the second set automatically. You can then #<a href=\"/wiki/Name\" title=\"Name\">name</a> the two sets differently to prevent them stacking.\n</p><p>To increase your supply of ammunition, collect any daggers you find, but curse-test them before wielding any. <a href=\"/wiki/Elven_dagger\" title=\"Elven dagger\">Elven daggers</a> are especially desirable&#8212;being made of <a href=\"/wiki/Wood\" title=\"Wood\">wood</a>, they cannot <a href=\"/wiki/Erosion\" title=\"Erosion\">rust or corrode</a>, so they are good for fighting <a href=\"/wiki/Rust_monster\" title=\"Rust monster\">rust monsters</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Acid\" title=\"Acid\">acidic</a> monsters that would damage iron weapons.\n</p>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Projectiles\">Projectiles</span></h5>\n<p>Various non-dagger <a href=\"/wiki/Missile\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Missile\">missile</a> weapons&#8212;such as <a href=\"/wiki/Dart\" title=\"Dart\">darts</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Crossbow_bolt\" title=\"Crossbow bolt\">crossbow bolts</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Shuriken\" title=\"Shuriken\">shuriken</a>&#8212;can be poisoned by #<a href=\"/wiki/Dipping\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dipping\">dipping</a> them into your starting <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_sickness\" title=\"Potion of sickness\">potion of sickness</a>. One strategy is to #<a href=\"/wiki/Untrap\" title=\"Untrap\">untrap</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Dart_trap\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dart trap\">dart traps</a>, which are fairly common in the upper levels of the Dungeons of Doom, and then poison the resulting large stack of darts using the potion. Poisoned weapons do an additional d6 damage to non-resistant monsters, and also have a 10% chance of killing the monster outright, making it ideal for tougher monsters - <a href=\"/wiki/Intelligent\" title=\"Intelligent\">intelligent</a> monsters can pick up poisoned weapons and toss them back at you, however. As <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_cancellation\" title=\"Magic cancellation\">magic cancellation</a> does not protect against poisoning from thrown weapons, human Rogues should obtain the property as soon as they can and use poisoned missiles cautiously until then; orcs start with poison resistance, making this a much less risky option for them.\n</p><p>Rogues can also reach Expert in <a href=\"/wiki/Crossbow\" title=\"Crossbow\">crossbows</a>, so another possibility is to collect <a href=\"/wiki/Crossbow_bolt\" title=\"Crossbow bolt\">bolts</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Mines\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mines\">Mines</a> and poison them. Unlike darts, bolts require a launcher, but their damage potential is greater (1d4+1/1d6+1 vs 1d3/1d2). Both kinds of missiles have a chance of <a href=\"/wiki/Projectile#Breakage\" title=\"Projectile\">breaking</a>, which can be reduced by enchanting them; if you plan to use crossbows, it is usually worthwhile to avoid advancing their skill beyond Basic until you have mastered daggers. Depending on your early weapon choices, you may find it easier to commit to <a href=\"#Weapon_choices\">a specific type of projectile</a> down the line.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contemplating_twoweaponing\">Contemplating twoweaponing</span></h4>\n<p>Rogues are one of the few roles who can reach Expert in twoweapon combat. They also reach Expert in the <a href=\"/wiki/Knife\" title=\"Knife\">knife</a> skill, so they are the role that gets the most effect out of using a <a href=\"/wiki/Crysknife\" title=\"Crysknife\">crysknife</a> as a secondary weapon.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/wiki/NetHack_3.4.3\" title=\"NetHack 3.4.3\">NetHack 3.4.3</a> and previous versions, twoweaponing was relatively unpopular since rogues cannot reach Expert skill in the better <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact_weapon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Artifact weapon\">artifact weapons</a> (besides <a href=\"/wiki/Magicbane\" title=\"Magicbane\">Magicbane</a>, which is <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact_blast\" title=\"Artifact blast\">cross-aligned</a>) and cannot <a href=\"/wiki/Backstab\" title=\"Backstab\">backstab</a> if they are wielding two weapons at once, sacrificing the bonus damage that was one of the most popular features of the role. Because of this, many players did not train the twoweapon skill at all, reserving the skill points for other skills, and using the free hand to augment their <a href=\"/wiki/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a> with a <a href=\"/wiki/Shield\" title=\"Shield\">shield</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/Backstab\" title=\"Backstab\">Backstab</a> damage has been significantly weakened starting with <a href=\"/wiki/NetHack_3.6.0\" title=\"NetHack 3.6.0\">NetHack 3.6.0</a>: it now only occurs in single-weapon <a href=\"/wiki/Melee\" title=\"Melee\">melee</a> and no longer applies to thrown projectiles. Backstabbing is still useful as an early game tactic, but its intermittent damage bonus now pales in comparison to consistent, high-level twoweaponing in the later game.\n</p><p>That said, if you find yourself next to a <a href=\"/wiki/Fleeing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fleeing\">fleeing</a> monster, remember that switching from two weapons to one (to enable backstabs) doesn't take a <a href=\"/wiki/Turn\" title=\"Turn\">turn</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  With a <a href=\"/wiki/Double_damage\" title=\"Double damage\">double damage</a> weapon, backstabs deal (<a href=\"/wiki/XL\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"XL\">XL</a> + 1) damage on average, which outperforms most offhand weapons from midgame on.  \n</p><p>Twoweaponing can be considered an alternative way to produce major artifact damage with weaker weapons. Before strength, enchantment and skill bonuses, <a href=\"/wiki/Grayswandir\" title=\"Grayswandir\">Grayswandir</a> will average 9 and 19.5 damage against non-haters and silver-haters respectively. A <a href=\"/wiki/Crysknife\" title=\"Crysknife\">crysknife</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/Silver_dagger\" title=\"Silver dagger\">silver dagger</a> twoweapon will yield approximately 7.75 and 18.25. With full strength, skill and enchantment available to a rogue, a single-handed Grayswandir will average 30 and 40.5 while the the crysknife/silver dagger twoweapon averages 35.75 and 46.25; the chaotic <a href=\"/wiki/Grimtooth\" title=\"Grimtooth\">Grimtooth</a> averages the same damage as a single crysknife for a Rogue without requiring training in a new <a href=\"/wiki/Skill\" title=\"Skill\">skill</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Armor\">Armor</span></h4>\n<p>A Rogue's starting leather armor is not very good past the early game, and can be traded out for almost any noncursed body armor. Given their restrictions on attack and healing spells, rogues are not likely to rely heavily on magic in the heat of battle for most of the game, so they should not be as concerned about spellcasting failure. They typically start with low strength, however, and encumberment is a serious inconvenience in the early game, so avoid wearing anything you cannot lift without becoming Burdened. <a href=\"/wiki/Mithril-coat\" title=\"Mithril-coat\">Mithril-coats</a> are most ideal for the early game, as they are not only high <a href=\"/wiki/AC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AC\">AC</a> (and <a href=\"/wiki/MC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"MC\">MC</a>2) but weigh no more than your starting leather armor. Once you are confident in your fighting skills, fight dwarves and hobbits to relieve them of their mail.\n</p><p>Rogues who seek to backstab over twoweaponing in 3.4.3, previous versions and variants based on them lose the least from wearing a shield, since all of their best weapons are one-handed; the <a href=\"/wiki/Shield_of_reflection\" title=\"Shield of reflection\">shield of reflection</a> is their best option, eliminating the need for an <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_reflection\" title=\"Amulet of reflection\">amulet of reflection</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/SDSM\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"SDSM\">SDSM</a> and freeing up the neck and torso slots for other items, but they are unfortunately rare. This is much less true as of 3.6.0 and later versions, where twoweaponing is more preferable.\n</p><p>Rogues are at a disadvantage when it comes to attempting the <a href=\"/wiki/Protection_racket\" title=\"Protection racket\">protection racket</a>, because while their starting sack is handy for <a href=\"/wiki/Shoplifting\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shoplifting\">shoplifting</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Credit_cloning\" title=\"Credit cloning\">credit cloning</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Mines\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mines\">Mines</a> will inevitably be dangerous because dwarves and gnomes alike are hostile to chaotics.  Since armor is less disadvantageous for Rogues than for other roles, racking up early protection points is less urgent for them.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spells\">Spells</span></h4>\n<p>Rogues do not start with knowledge of any spells or skill in any spell school, and their starting intelligence (their spellcasting <a href=\"/wiki/Attribute\" title=\"Attribute\">attribute</a>) and spellcasting power are both low, so spellcasting is not likely to be reliable in the early game.  \n</p><p>However, once you have a reliable source of food, and a safe place to read, it may be worthwhile to pick up spellbooks and read them so you can recognize useful spellbooks later. Spells in the <a href=\"/wiki/Divination\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Divination\">divination</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Escape\" title=\"Escape\">escape</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Matter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Matter\">matter</a> classes can be trained, while most spells outside of your strong schools can be forgotten and cast to confuse yourself later.\n</p><p>Once you have learned low-level spells in your schools (such as <a href=\"/wiki/Detect_monsters\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Detect monsters\">detect monsters</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Jumping\" title=\"Jumping\">jumping</a>) and have at least 5 power points, you can take advantages of lulls in the action to remove interfering armor and practice casting those spells to train the respective skills after you have reached expert in daggers.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Midgame\">Midgame</span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives_2\">Objectives</span></h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Rogue_quest\" title=\"Rogue quest\">Rogue quest</a> is infamous as one of the trickiest in NetHack, and advance preparation is required to complete it; see the <a href=\"/wiki/Rogue_quest#Strategy\" title=\"Rogue quest\">strategy</a> section for details. The Rogue quest artifact is <a href=\"/wiki/The_Master_Key_of_Thievery\" title=\"The Master Key of Thievery\">the Master Key of Thievery</a>, a very nice artifact which confers the <a href=\"/wiki/Half_physical_damage\" title=\"Half physical damage\">half physical damage</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Warning\" title=\"Warning\">warning</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Teleport_control\" title=\"Teleport control\">teleport control</a> extrinsics and makes <a href=\"/wiki/Untrap\" title=\"Untrap\">untrapping</a> more reliable. It can also be <a href=\"/wiki/Invoke\" title=\"Invoke\">invoked</a> to untrap boxes and doors with 100% success -- this useful properly is easy to forget, so keep it in mind.\n</p><p>Warning is somewhat superseded by <a href=\"/wiki/Telepathy\" title=\"Telepathy\">telepathy</a>, though the properties can complement each other, and there are other sources of teleport control (including <a href=\"/wiki/Tengu\" title=\"Tengu\">tengu</a> meat); half physical damage is useful and rare enough to make the Master Key a <a href=\"/wiki/Wish\" title=\"Wish\">wish</a> target for other chaotics on its own. If you have obtained the quest artifact without a source of magic resistance, seeking it out should be your next immediate goal.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapon_choices\">Weapon choices</span></h4>\n<p>Once you have access to <a href=\"/wiki/Holy_water\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Holy water\">holy water</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_enchant_weapon\" title=\"Scroll of enchant weapon\">scrolls of enchant weapon</a>, you have a few choices of projectile weapons: daggers, darts, or crossbow bolts, any of which you can advance to Expert. If you have not committed to a projectile at this point, consider the advantages and disadvantages of each as listed below:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Daggers have <a href=\"/wiki/Multishot\" title=\"Multishot\">multishot</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/To-hit\" title=\"To-hit\">to-hit</a> bonuses and are likely to be at least Skilled if not Expert by this point of the game, though the to-hit bonus may not make as much difference at this stage. Unfortunately, they are the only projectile that cannot be poisoned, and are also fairly heavy at 10 <a href=\"/wiki/Aum\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Aum\">aum</a> per dagger: the weight from a sizeable stack can add up, as many characters can struggle to carry more than 16-20 daggers without help from a bag of holding, and they exhaust quicker when thrown, making retrieval somewhat tricky in some cases. That said, daggers do not require a <a href=\"/wiki/Launcher\" title=\"Launcher\">launcher</a> like crossbow bolts, and also do not \"mulch\" like darts or bolts can, making them a low-maintenance option for a melee-focused rogue.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Darts deal slightly less base damage than daggers (at most one point on average, assuming elven daggers against a small target), and also lack a multishot bonus; switching to them from daggers requires six skill slots. Darts also weigh <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub>th as much as daggers and do not require a launcher, making <a href=\"/wiki/Encumbrance\" title=\"Encumbrance\">encumbrance</a> much easier to manage in comparison. They can easily be obtained in bulk from <a href=\"/wiki/Dart_trap\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dart trap\">dart traps</a> and poisoned with your starting <a href=\"/wiki/Potion_of_sickness\" title=\"Potion of sickness\">potion of sickness</a> for extra damage and the chance of an instakill, although many late-game enemies are poison-resistant. Darts are often the most ideal choice for a ranged-focused game plan - you can often carry more than enough to freely engage certain monsters such as <a href=\"/wiki/Disenchanter\" title=\"Disenchanter\">disenchanters</a> or flying monsters like <a href=\"/wiki/Mind_flayer\" title=\"Mind flayer\">mind flayers</a> that are over a <a href=\"/wiki/Moat\" title=\"Moat\">moat</a>, or else flee from potentially-lethal threats, all without losing much ranged capability from eroded, mulched or otherwise-lost darts.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Crossbow bolts deal slightly more base damage against small targets and substantially more against large ones. However, bolts also require a crossbow, which takes in-game time to switch to - this can prove unwieldly if one of your weapons is cursed, and makes two-weaponing more cumbersome. Additionally, bolts have a multishot <i>penalty</i> unless you have at least 18 <a href=\"/wiki/Strength\" title=\"Strength\">strength</a> -- however, they don't benefit from the +2 or higher damage bonus that this level of strength grants to darts and daggers, negating their nominally higher damage. Switching to them from daggers also requires six skill slots. These caveats, and the carrying capacity required due to the launcher, as well as their relative rarity compared to darts, generally make bolts the hardest of the projectiles to utilize. With this in mind, bolts weigh <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub>th as much as daggers and can be poisoned much like darts, and still generate often in the inventories of <span class=\"nhsym clr-white\">&#8203;G</span> <a href=\"/wiki/Gnome_(monster_class)\" title=\"Gnome (monster class)\">gnomes</a> and <span class=\"nhsym clr-white\">&#8203;C</span> <a href=\"/wiki/Centaur_(monster_class)\" title=\"Centaur (monster class)\">centaurs</a> - losing individual bolts is also not as pressing as leaving daggers behind. The crossbow's enchantment only affects to-hit bonuses, so enchanting the bolts should prove sufficient for Rogues willing to take this route.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>An <a href=\"/wiki/Aklys\" title=\"Aklys\">aklys</a> is the lowest-maintenance weapon, weighing only 15 aum and being almost infinitely reusable. Since it can't be multishot, there's little benefit to advancing club skill beyond Basic, saving five skill slots relative to the projectile weapons. Its damage potential is far less than any of the above options, but a well-enchanted aklys is still sufficient to safely deal with the occasional <a href=\"/wiki/Cockatrice\" title=\"Cockatrice\">cockatrice</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Mimic\" title=\"Mimic\">mimic</a>, or sea monster.</li></ul>\n<p>Whichever missiles you choose, bless and <a href=\"/wiki/Rustproof\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rustproof\">rustproof</a> them and raise their enchantment to increase their damage potential and accuracy: the bonus damage from enchantment somewhat flattens out the difference between their base damage. A <a href=\"/wiki/Ring_of_increase_damage\" title=\"Ring of increase damage\">ring of increase damage</a> with a positive enchantment is a very useful supplement when throwing weapons, with the damage bonus applied to each hit - a <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_charging\" title=\"Scroll of charging\">scroll of charging</a> or two should raise the ring's enchantment to a suitable level, though beware of exploding the ring!\n</p>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Artifact_weapons\">Artifact weapons</span></h5>\n<p>Rogues can look for a powerful <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact\" title=\"Artifact\">artifact</a> weapon to back up their ranged <a href=\"/wiki/Daggerstorm\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Daggerstorm\">daggerstorm</a> with a strong melee attack that uses their backstab bonus to full effect. <a href=\"/wiki/Sacrificing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sacrificing\">Sacrificing</a> for an artifact weapon is not terribly useful for Rogues, since they do not have a guaranteed sacrifice gift and the available chaotic artifact gifts are either very weak or of very narrow utility, with the exception of <a href=\"/wiki/Stormbringer\" title=\"Stormbringer\">Stormbringer</a> - at least one sacrifice gift is required before they have any hope of getting one of the more useful weapons such as the unaligned <a href=\"/wiki/Fire_Brand\" title=\"Fire Brand\">Fire Brand</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Frost_Brand\" title=\"Frost Brand\">Frost Brand</a>.\n</p><p>Two of the better options, <a href=\"/wiki/Magicbane\" title=\"Magicbane\">Magicbane</a> and Grayswandir, are cross-aligned and must be <a href=\"/wiki/Wish\" title=\"Wish\">wished</a> for or found in <a href=\"/wiki/Bones\" title=\"Bones\">bones</a> - watch out for the (admittedly small) <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact_blast\" title=\"Artifact blast\">blasting damage</a>. Magicbane's <a href=\"/wiki/Scare\" title=\"Scare\">scare</a> attack frequently causes monsters to flee, and as an <a href=\"/wiki/Athame\" title=\"Athame\">athame</a> it uses the dagger skill that Rogues are naturally proficient in and can reliably engrave Elbereth. Grayswandir's <a href=\"/wiki/Double_damage\" title=\"Double damage\">double damage</a> applies to backstab damage, and rogues can reach Skilled in <a href=\"/wiki/Saber\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Saber\">saber</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spells_2\">Spells</span></h4>\n<p>Rogues can reach Skilled in <a href=\"/wiki/Divination_spells\" title=\"Divination spells\">divination spells</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Escape_spells\" title=\"Escape spells\">escape spells</a>, as well as the somewhat less useful <a href=\"/wiki/Matter_spells\" title=\"Matter spells\">matter spells</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">human</a> rogues can reach a respectable 87% success rate without a <a href=\"/wiki/Robe\" title=\"Robe\">robe</a>.

In the absence of useful spells, however, rogues can easily make do without.\n</p><p>Divination spells are worth raising to Skilled once you have at least two skill slots free, since several spells in this class (<a href=\"/wiki/Detect_monsters\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Detect monsters\">detect monsters</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Detect_treasure\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Detect treasure\">detect treasure</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Identify\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Identify\">identify</a>) have improved effects at this level. <a href=\"/wiki/Identify\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Identify\">Identify</a> can save you a lot of curse-testing, and <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_mapping\" title=\"Magic mapping\">magic mapping</a> is a boon in Gehennom.

(character class)}}\n{{otheruses|the player role|the game|Rogue (game)}}\n\nThe '''Rogue''' is a player [[role]].  Rogues are skilled thieves. From the [[guidebook]]:\n{{guidebook|Rogues are agile and stealthy  thieves,  with  knowledge  of locks,  traps,  and  poisons.   Their advantage lies in surprise, which they employ to great advantage.}}\n\nRogues can be [[Human (starting race)|humans]] or [[Orc (starting race)|orcs]], and are always [[chaotic]].\n\n==Starting equipment==\n* an uncursed +0 [[short sword]]  (orcish short sword if an orc)\n* 6&ndash;16 uncursed +0 [[dagger]]s (orcish daggers if an orc)\n* an uncursed +1 [[leather armor]] (5% chance of being blessed)\n* an uncursed [[potion of sickness]]\n* an uncursed [[lock pick]]\n* an uncursed [[sack]]\n* 20% chance of a [[blindfold]]\n* for orcs, 2 random food items (each of which has the usual chance of being a stack of 2)\n\n==Intrinsics==\n* XL 1: [[Stealth]]\n* XL 10: [[Automatic searching]]\n\n==Skills==\n{{Rogue skill table}}\nRogues start with ''Basic'' skill in ''Short sword'' and ''Dagger''.\n\n==Special rules==\nRogues get a +1 bonus to [[multishot]] when throwing daggers.\n\nRogues gain an additional 1d([[experience level|XL]]) \"[[backstab]]\" damage when striking a [[flee]]ing monster in melee and not two-weaponing.  [[Elbereth]], [[scroll of scare monster|scrolls of scare monster]], [[leather drum]]s and [[tooled horn]]s are particularly useful for rogues.\n\nRogues are eligible for up to two bonuses when disarming floor [[trap]]s: one bonus applies with a (Xlvl/60) chance, while the other applies if the Rogue is carrying [[the Master Key of Thievery]].\n\nRogues have double the normal chance of disarming [[container trap]]s.\n\nRogues also have additional proficiency with [[lock pick]]s and credit cards - a Rogue with high [[dexterity]] is actually faster with picks than with a skeleton key.\n\n(While the [[guidebook]] describes Rogues as \"thieves,\" they do ''not'' have any inherent ability to steal gold or items from monsters or shops.)\n\n==Strategy==\n===Character creation===\nOrcs have an easier early game because of their starting food, [[poison resistance]], [[infravision]], and ability to commit [[cannibalism]] or [[Sacrifice#Sacrificing creatures of same race|same-race sacrifice]] with impunity. Orcish daggers are slightly inferior, but it won't take you long to collect a set of generic daggers with which to replace them. On the other hand, humans have better [[HP]] growth, as well as several advantages that become important later in the game: they have better [[energy]] growth than orcs, and their higher [[intelligence]] and [[charisma]] caps make spellcasting and consorting with foocubi more reliable.<!-- Max attributes still matter even with the modern foocubus effective caps, because not all characters are at max in every attribute, e.g. a 14 IN 18 CH human who maxed CH through magic traps will do better than a 14 IN 16 CH orc.--> Humans have other means of compensating for the lack of infravision, including [[warning]] (e.g. from your [[quest artifact]]) if all else fails.\n\nOrcish monsters are more likely to be generated peaceful for orcish heroes, while elven monsters are likely to be generated peaceful for chaotic humans - elves are always hostile to player orcs, and can be a fairly early nuisance to orcish Rogues due to ignoring Elbereth. Human monsters are not available as early for same-race sacrifices, and some of their corpses are harder to procure reliably compared to the groups of hostile orcs that may be generated.\n\n===Early game===\n====Objectives====\nThe two top priorities in the early game are finding [[food]] and [[#Weapons|developing your primary attacks]], which are weighted differently for humans and orcs. Orcish rogues' starting food items buy them some time to train before they need to start looking for food; once they do need to scavenge for food, they have more options thanks to their poison resistance&mdash;which allows them to eat the corpses of poisonous monsters like [[kobold]]s safely&mdash;and their ability to [[Cannibalism|eat their own kind]] without an alignment penalty. Human rogues, however, will need to look for nonpoisonous corpses and (better yet) permafood on the first few levels of the dungeons.\n\nSince rogues can start with a relatively low [[strength]], it is a good idea to make an early run for [[Sokoban]] and push boulders to exercise that attribute. Raising strength not only increases your carrying capacity, but also the damage potential from your thrown daggers due to the bonus it provides; the random food items generated in that branch are also very welcome to a hungry rogue, and both of the two possible prizes can be of great use to them. A [[bag of holding]] helps shore up carrying capacity, while an [[amulet of reflection]] can protect your inventory and save you from many potentially game-ending wand attacks.\n\n====Weapons====\nA rogue's best attack in the early game is a volley of [[throw]]n daggers. Rogues should rely on throwing daggers as much as circumstances and their stock of daggers permit in order to raise the dagger [[skill]] to Expert before anything else. Having Expert level in the skill, combined with the role's bonus to multishot, allows you to throw up to four daggers at once, and gives each dagger a +2 damage bonus. However, be aware that if one of your daggers kills your target, any remaining daggers you threw may fly past the corpse and anger peaceful monsters behind it. Use the [[numeric prefix]] to fire only one dagger at a time when necessary, especially in [[Minetown]].\n\nYou may choose to wield one of your daggers in melee as well, instead of your starting short sword, because every bit of dagger training helps. There is little reason to train your short sword skill if you plan to get an [[artifact]] melee weapon; however, an [[elven short sword]] is perfectly serviceable for later [[twoweaponing]]. One dagger can be separated from your starting stack for wielding by using the #[[adjust]] command with a number prefix to change the letter under which it is stored in your inventory; it is possible to [[quiver]] all but one of a wielded stack of weapons, changing the letter of the second set automatically. You can then #[[name]] the two sets differently to prevent them stacking.\n\nTo increase your supply of ammunition, collect any daggers you find, but curse-test them before wielding any. [[Elven dagger]]s are especially desirable&mdash;being made of [[wood]], they cannot [[Erosion|rust or corrode]], so they are good for fighting [[rust monster]]s and [[acid]]ic monsters that would damage iron weapons.\n\n=====Projectiles=====\nVarious non-dagger [[missile]] weapons&mdash;such as [[dart]]s, [[crossbow bolt]]s, and [[shuriken]]&mdash;can be poisoned by #[[dipping]] them into your starting [[potion of sickness]]. One strategy is to #[[untrap]] [[dart trap]]s, which are fairly common in the upper levels of the Dungeons of Doom, and then poison the resulting large stack of darts using the potion. Poisoned weapons do an additional d6 damage to non-resistant monsters, and also have a 10% chance of killing the monster outright, making it ideal for tougher monsters - [[intelligent]] monsters can pick up poisoned weapons and toss them back at you, however. As [[magic cancellation]] does not protect against poisoning from thrown weapons, human Rogues should obtain the property as soon as they can and use poisoned missiles cautiously until then; orcs start with poison resistance, making this a much less risky option for them.\n\nRogues can also reach Expert in [[crossbow]]s, so another possibility is to collect [[crossbow bolt|bolt]]s in the [[Mines]] and poison them. Unlike darts, bolts require a launcher, but their damage potential is greater (1d4+1/1d6+1 vs 1d3/1d2). Both kinds of missiles have a chance of [[Projectile#Breakage|breaking]], which can be reduced by enchanting them; if you plan to use crossbows, it is usually worthwhile to avoid advancing their skill beyond Basic until you have mastered daggers. Depending on your early weapon choices, you may find it easier to commit to [[#Weapon choices|a specific type of projectile]] down the line.\n\n====Contemplating twoweaponing====\nRogues are one of the few roles who can reach Expert in twoweapon combat. They also reach Expert in the [[knife]] skill, so they are the role that gets the most effect out of using a [[crysknife]] as a secondary weapon.\n\nIn [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and previous versions, twoweaponing was relatively unpopular since rogues cannot reach Expert skill in the better [[artifact weapon]]s (besides [[Magicbane]], which is [[Artifact blast|cross-aligned]]) and cannot [[backstab]] if they are wielding two weapons at once, sacrificing the bonus damage that was one of the most popular features of the role. Because of this, many players did not train the twoweapon skill at all, reserving the skill points for other skills, and using the free hand to augment their [[AC]] with a [[shield]]. [[Backstab]] damage has been significantly weakened starting with [[NetHack 3.6.0]]: it now only occurs in single-weapon [[melee]] and no longer applies to thrown projectiles. Backstabbing is still useful as an early game tactic, but its intermittent damage bonus now pales in comparison to consistent, high-level twoweaponing in the later game.\n\nThat said, if you find yourself next to a [[fleeing]] monster, remember that switching from two weapons to one (to enable backstabs) doesn't take a [[turn]].{{refsrc|src/wield.c|658|nethack=3.6.7}}  With a [[double damage]] weapon, backstabs deal ([[XL]] + 1) damage on average, which outperforms most offhand weapons from midgame on.  <!-- Even a +7 trident deals 14.5 (vs. large), which is surpassed at XL 14, but a silver weapon might still be better. -->\n\nTwoweaponing can be considered an alternative way to produce major artifact damage with weaker weapons. Before strength, enchantment and skill bonuses, [[Grayswandir]] will average 9 and 19.5 damage against non-haters and silver-haters respectively. A [[crysknife]]/[[silver dagger]] twoweapon will yield approximately 7.75 and 18.25. With full strength, skill and enchantment available to a rogue, a single-handed Grayswandir will average 30 and 40.5 while the the crysknife/silver dagger twoweapon averages 35.75 and 46.25; the chaotic [[Grimtooth]] averages the same damage as a single crysknife for a Rogue without requiring training in a new [[skill]].\n\n====Armor====\nA Rogue's starting leather armor is not very good past the early game, and can be traded out for almost any noncursed body armor. Given their restrictions on attack and healing spells, rogues are not likely to rely heavily on magic in the heat of battle for most of the game, so they should not be as concerned about spellcasting failure. They typically start with low strength, however, and encumberment is a serious inconvenience in the early game, so avoid wearing anything you cannot lift without becoming Burdened. [[Mithril-coat]]s are most ideal for the early game, as they are not only high [[AC]] (and [[MC]]2) but weigh no more than your starting leather armor. Once you are confident in your fighting skills, fight dwarves and hobbits to relieve them of their mail.\n\nRogues who seek to backstab over twoweaponing in 3.4.3, previous versions and variants based on them lose the least from wearing a shield, since all of their best weapons are one-handed; the [[shield of reflection]] is their best option, eliminating the need for an [[amulet of reflection]] or [[SDSM]] and freeing up the neck and torso slots for other items, but they are unfortunately rare. This is much less true as of 3.6.0 and later versions, where twoweaponing is more preferable.\n\nRogues are at a disadvantage when it comes to attempting the [[protection racket]], because while their starting sack is handy for [[shoplifting]] and [[credit cloning]], the [[Mines]] will inevitably be dangerous because dwarves and gnomes alike are hostile to chaotics.  Since armor is less disadvantageous for Rogues than for other roles, racking up early protection points is less urgent for them.\n\n====Spells====\nRogues do not start with knowledge of any spells or skill in any spell school, and their starting intelligence (their spellcasting [[attribute]]) and spellcasting power are both low, so spellcasting is not likely to be reliable in the early game.  \n\nHowever, once you have a reliable source of food, and a safe place to read, it may be worthwhile to pick up spellbooks and read them so you can recognize useful spellbooks later. Spells in the [[divination]], [[escape]], and [[matter]] classes can be trained, while most spells outside of your strong schools can be forgotten and cast to confuse yourself later.\n\nOnce you have learned low-level spells in your schools (such as [[detect monsters]] and [[jumping]]) and have at least 5 power points, you can take advantages of lulls in the action to remove interfering armor and practice casting those spells to train the respective skills after you have reached expert in daggers.\n\n===Midgame===\n====Objectives====\nThe [[Rogue quest]] is infamous as one of the trickiest in NetHack, and advance preparation is required to complete it; see the [[Rogue quest#Strategy|strategy]] section for details. The Rogue quest artifact is [[the Master Key of Thievery]], a very nice artifact which confers the [[half physical damage]], [[warning]], and [[teleport control]] extrinsics and makes [[untrap]]ping more reliable. It can also be [[invoke]]d to untrap boxes and doors with 100% success -- this useful properly is easy to forget, so keep it in mind.\n\nWarning is somewhat superseded by [[telepathy]], though the properties can complement each other, and there are other sources of teleport control (including [[tengu]] meat); half physical damage is useful and rare enough to make the Master Key a [[wish]] target for other chaotics on its own. If you have obtained the quest artifact without a source of magic resistance, seeking it out should be your next immediate goal.\n\n====Weapon choices====\nOnce you have access to [[holy water]] and [[scroll of enchant weapon|scrolls of enchant weapon]], you have a few choices of projectile weapons: daggers, darts, or crossbow bolts, any of which you can advance to Expert. If you have not committed to a projectile at this point, consider the advantages and disadvantages of each as listed below:\n\n* Daggers have [[multishot]] and [[to-hit]] bonuses and are likely to be at least Skilled if not Expert by this point of the game, though the to-hit bonus may not make as much difference at this stage. Unfortunately, they are the only projectile that cannot be poisoned, and are also fairly heavy at 10 [[aum]] per dagger: the weight from a sizeable stack can add up, as many characters can struggle to carry more than 16-20 daggers without help from a bag of holding, and they exhaust quicker when thrown, making retrieval somewhat tricky in some cases. That said, daggers do not require a [[launcher]] like crossbow bolts, and also do not \"mulch\" like darts or bolts can, making them a low-maintenance option for a melee-focused rogue.\n\n* Darts deal slightly less base damage than daggers (at most one point on average, assuming elven daggers against a small target), and also lack a multishot bonus; switching to them from daggers requires six skill slots. Darts also weigh {{frac|10}}th as much as daggers and do not require a launcher, making [[encumbrance]] much easier to manage in comparison. They can easily be obtained in bulk from [[dart trap]]s and poisoned with your starting [[potion of sickness]] for extra damage and the chance of an instakill, although many late-game enemies are poison-resistant. Darts are often the most ideal choice for a ranged-focused game plan - you can often carry more than enough to freely engage certain monsters such as [[disenchanter]]s or flying monsters like [[mind flayer]]s that are over a [[moat]], or else flee from potentially-lethal threats, all without losing much ranged capability from eroded, mulched or otherwise-lost darts.\n\n* Crossbow bolts deal slightly more base damage against small targets and substantially more against large ones. However, bolts also require a crossbow, which takes in-game time to switch to - this can prove unwieldly if one of your weapons is cursed, and makes two-weaponing more cumbersome. Additionally, bolts have a multishot ''penalty'' unless you have at least 18 [[strength]] -- however, they don't benefit from the +2 or higher damage bonus that this level of strength grants to darts and daggers, negating their nominally higher damage. Switching to them from daggers also requires six skill slots. These caveats, and the carrying capacity required due to the launcher, as well as their relative rarity compared to darts, generally make bolts the hardest of the projectiles to utilize. With this in mind, bolts weigh {{frac|10}}th as much as daggers and can be poisoned much like darts, and still generate often in the inventories of {{monclass|G}}s and {{monclass|C}}s - losing individual bolts is also not as pressing as leaving daggers behind. The crossbow's enchantment only affects to-hit bonuses, so enchanting the bolts should prove sufficient for Rogues willing to take this route.\n\n* An [[aklys]] is the lowest-maintenance weapon, weighing only 15 aum and being almost infinitely reusable. Since it can't be multishot, there's little benefit to advancing club skill beyond Basic, saving five skill slots relative to the projectile weapons. Its damage potential is far less than any of the above options, but a well-enchanted aklys is still sufficient to safely deal with the occasional [[cockatrice]], [[mimic]], or sea monster.\n\nWhichever missiles you choose, bless and [[rustproof]] them and raise their enchantment to increase their damage potential and accuracy: the bonus damage from enchantment somewhat flattens out the difference between their base damage. A [[ring of increase damage]] with a positive enchantment is a very useful supplement when throwing weapons, with the damage bonus applied to each hit - a [[scroll of charging]] or two should raise the ring's enchantment to a suitable level, though beware of exploding the ring!\n\n=====Artifact weapons=====\nRogues can look for a powerful [[artifact]] weapon to back up their ranged [[daggerstorm]] with a strong melee attack that uses their backstab bonus to full effect. [[Sacrificing]] for an artifact weapon is not terribly useful for Rogues, since they do not have a guaranteed sacrifice gift and the available chaotic artifact gifts are either very weak or of very narrow utility, with the exception of [[Stormbringer]] - at least one sacrifice gift is required before they have any hope of getting one of the more useful weapons such as the unaligned [[Fire Brand]] and [[Frost Brand]].\n\nTwo of the better options, [[Magicbane]] and Grayswandir, are cross-aligned and must be [[wish]]ed for or found in [[bones]] - watch out for the (admittedly small) [[Artifact blast|blasting damage]]. Magicbane's [[scare]] attack frequently causes monsters to flee, and as an [[athame]] it uses the dagger skill that Rogues are naturally proficient in and can reliably engrave Elbereth. Grayswandir's [[double damage]] applies to backstab damage, and rogues can reach Skilled in [[saber]].\n\n====Spells====\nRogues can reach Skilled in [[divination spells]] and [[escape spells]], as well as the somewhat less useful [[matter spells]], and [[human]] rogues can reach a respectable 87% success rate without a [[robe]]. You most likely started the game with a mediocre intelligence, so consider collecting any potions you find and performing [[alchemy]] to brew up some [[potion of gain ability|potions of gain ability]]. In the absence of useful spells, however, rogues can easily make do without.\n\nDivination spells are worth raising to Skilled once you have at least two skill slots free, since several spells in this class ([[detect monsters]], [[detect treasure]], and [[identify]]) have improved effects at this level. [[Identify]] can save you a lot of curse-testing, and [[magic mapping]] is a boon in Gehennom. Advancing escape spells to Skilled is less important, but can be useful if you want to rely on the [[Spellbook of jumping|jumping]] spell to reach tiles not accessible with [[jumping boots]], or be able to terminate the [[spellbook of levitation|levitation]] spell at will. There is little reason to advance matter spells far, as Rogues are unlikely to have the spellcasting abilities or power to cast [[spellbook of polymorph|polymorph]].\n\n====Armor====\nIf you chose to use a shield instead of twoweaponing, and you haven't found a shield of reflection before reaching [[Medusa's Island]], checking [[Perseus]]'s statue for one can be especially rewarding, provided you are careful not to get stoned by [[Medusa]].\n\n=== Late game ===\n====Weapons====\nEntering the late game, rogues should continue to refine their primary attacks, enchanting their melee artifact weapon to +5 or +6 and enchanting their missiles as well. [[Silver dagger]]s are often desirable missile weapons, but are exceedingly rare, and not worth a wish. \n\nIf you choose to try twoweaponing despite forfeiting the backstab bonus, good secondary weapon choices for Rogues are crysknives, silver sabers, katanas, and elven broadswords. Crysknives pair well with Magicbane, since you can train both weapon classes to Expert for the lowest to-hit and damage penalty. If you have Grayswandir, [[Stormbringer]], or one of the Brands, you may prefer using secondary weapons from the same classes so you do not have to train a second weapon skill.\n\n====Armor====\nRogues can use shields of reflection comfortably if they so choose, allowing them to forego [[silver dragon scale mail]] [[GDSM versus SDSM|in favor of]] [[gray dragon scale mail]] - this supplies the [[magic resistance]] that your quest artifact lacks, and frees the neck and cloak slots for other items. Alternately, you may choose SDSM if you have another source of magic resistance and you prefer not to wear a shield.\n\n==Rank titles==\nThe [[status line]] shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\n\n*XL 1-2: Footpad\n*XL 3-5: Cutpurse\n*XL 6-9: Rogue\n*XL 10-13: Pilferer\n*XL 14-17: Robber\n*XL 18-21: Burglar\n*XL 22-25: Filcher\n*XL 26-29: Magsman/Magswoman\n*XL 30: Thief\n\n==Quest==\n{{main|Rogue quest}}\nThe Rogue quest sees you fighting the [[Master Assassin]] for [[The Master Key of Thievery]].

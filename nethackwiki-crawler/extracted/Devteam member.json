They are character representations of the *[NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\")* [DevTeam](/wiki/DevTeam \"DevTeam\") that reside within [the DevTeam Office](/wiki/The_DevTeam_Office \"The DevTeam Office\"), a special optional [dungeon branch](/wiki/Dungeon_branch \"Dungeon branch\") where you can take on a quest to find a [scroll of missing code](/wiki/Scroll_of_missing_code \"Scroll of missing code\") on three dungeon floors in exchange for the [Really Cool Shirt](/wiki/Really_Cool_Shirt \"Really Cool Shirt\").\n\nDevteam members have two powerful weapon attacks, and the second can [stun](/wiki/Stun \"Stun\") targets. They possess [sleep resistance](/wiki/Sleep_resistance \"Sleep resistance\"), [poison resistance](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\") and [stoning resistance](/wiki/Stoning_resistance \"Stoning resistance\").\n\n[Chatting](/wiki/Chat \"Chat\") to devteam members gives various unique [messages](#messages), depending on which specific one is talked to.\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Generation](#Generation)\n\n- [2 Strategy](#Strategy)\n\n- [3 Origin](#Origin)\n\n- [4 Messages](#Messages)\n\n  - [4.1 bhaak](#bhaak)\n  - [4.2 paxed](#paxed)\n  - [4.3 PatR](#PatR)\n  - [4.4 lorimer](#lorimer)\n  - [4.5 ais](#ais)\n  - [4.6 Mike Stephenson](#Mike_Stephenson)\n  - [4.7 Death](#Death)\n\n## Generation\n\nThe six devteam members occupy the rightmost half of the Office's level: [bhaak](/wiki/User:Bhaak \"User:Bhaak\"), [paxed](/wiki/User:Paxed \"User:Paxed\"), [lorimer](/wiki/User:Lorimer \"User:Lorimer\"), and [ais](/wiki/User:Ais523 \"User:Ais523\") are stationed at each corner of the room containing a statue of a [balrog](/wiki/Balrog \"Balrog\") named the RNG, while [PatR](/wiki/Pat_Rankin \"Pat Rankin\") and [Mike Stephenson](/wiki/Mike_Stephenson \"Mike Stephenson\") sit in rooms on each side of the hall that leads to the \"PEBCAK disposal area\"; Mike Stephenson will additionally be seated on a [throne](/wiki/Throne \"Throne\").\n\nAll devteam members are [generated with](/wiki/Monster_starting_inventory \"Monster starting inventory\") either a [long sword](/wiki/Long_sword \"Long sword\") or [katana](/wiki/Katana \"Katana\") as their weapon, alongside a [shield of reflection](/wiki/Shield_of_reflection \"Shield of reflection\"), [leather gloves](/wiki/Leather_gloves \"Leather gloves\"), [high boots](/wiki/High_boots \"High boots\"), and either an [elven mithril-coat](/wiki/Elven_mithril-coat \"Elven mithril-coat\") or [dwarvish mithril-coat](/wiki/Dwarvish_mithril-coat \"Dwarvish mithril-coat\").\n\n## Strategy\n\nChatting to Mike Stephenson is required to initiate the quest and return the three scrolls of missing code; while the quest is active, talking to Mike will also give a hint as to which floor each scroll can be found on. It is very possible to find one or more of the scrolls before encountering the DevTeam Office - stash them in a [container](/wiki/Container \"Container\") as soon as possible to keep them from burning up or fading. Mike will also accept the scrolls if they are [thrown](/wiki/Thrown \"Thrown\") to him, and a [deaf](/wiki/Deaf \"Deaf\") character can throw one to him to begin the quest - this is done to accommodate permadeaf characters (who cannot use #chat).\n\nFor characters that complete the quest and do not personally kill [Izchak](/wiki/Izchak \"Izchak\"), Mike Stephenson will give the Really Cool Shirt as a reward.\n\nBe very careful not to anger any of the devteam members: they are very powerful and can displace monsters as the [Riders](/wiki/Riders \"Riders\") do. There is also no reward for killing any of them, as [the game immediately ends](/wiki/Instadeath \"Instadeath\") if a devteam member dies by any means, and [life saving](/wiki/Life_saving \"Life saving\") will not protect a character who dies this way. Thankfully, throwing scrolls of missing code at any devteam member other than Mike Stephenson will not anger them or lose the scrolls.\n\n## Origin\n\nAs mentioned, all of the devteam member monsters are based on the real-life *NetHack* DevTeam.\n\nThe sequence of events that occurs when killing a devteam member is probably a reference to the [panic](/wiki/Panic \"Panic\") handler: 'Suddenly, the dungeon collapses.'\n\n## Messages\n\n- \"Oh, neat! Show this scroll to Mike Stephenson!\"\n\n  You chatted to any of the other devteam members with a scroll of missing code in open inventory.\n\n- <[foo](/wiki/Foo \"Foo\")> looks \\<peeved/indignant/irritated>.  \n  \"Why don't you just #chat to me like a normal adventurer?\"\n\n  You threw a scroll at a devteam member other than Mike Stephenson.\n\n- \\<foo> asks you about your day.  \n  \"LOUD NOISES!!\"\n\n  Both of these serve as backup generic messages for devteam members.\n\n### bhaak\n\n- bhaak tries to get you to play something called '[UnNetHack](/wiki/UnNetHack \"UnNetHack\")'.\n\n  bhaak is the developer of UnNetHack.\n\n- bhaak starts swearing at you in German.  \n  bhaak discusses the merits of HTML [dumplogs](/wiki/Dumplog \"Dumplog\").  \n  \"Denial is a valid [bug](/wiki/Bug \"Bug\") resolution technique.\"  \n  \"UnNetHack5 > [NetHack4](/wiki/NetHack4 \"NetHack4\").

[SporkHack](/wiki/SporkHack \"SporkHack\") introduced it.\"\n\n  lorimer is SporkHack's developer and the author of [the commit](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/b1835cc65d23c033c800abfbc3b4f66b73cc8792) that introduced Orctown to vanilla *NetHack*.\n\n### ais\n\n- ais discusses limiting the player's inventory.  \n  \"Ever tried to ascend with only a [large box](/wiki/Large_box \"Large box\") for a container?\"  \n  ais mentions tweaking the [Wands Balance Patch](/wiki/Wands_Balance_Patch \"Wands Balance Patch\").  \n  ais opines that NetHack4 is fairer to the player.  \n  \"NetHack is just a mound of special cases taped together by global variables.\"  \n  \"You know, you really don't need most items to ascend.\"\n\n### Mike Stephenson\n\nMike Stephenson acts as a \"quest leader\" for the DevTeam Quest, with some of his messages formatted similarly.\n\nWhen you begin the DevTeam Quest:\n\n```\n\"Ah, you must be a hero questing for the Amulet of Yendor. May I ask you\nto listen for a moment? We are in dire need of some assistance.\n```\n\n```\nRecently, we had collected our best new ideas and inscribed the source\ncode on three scrolls. But before we were able to add them to the\ncodebase, the RNG glitched and sent them into the game itself.\n```\n\n```\nWithout these scrolls, we can't finish work on the next version of\nNetHack. We're trying to use our terminals here to search for them, and\npaxed is pretty sure that they all ended up in the Dungeons of Doom...\nbut we're still trying to figure out on which levels.\n```\n\n```\nIt's too dangerous for me to send any of the DevTeam members out\nsearching for them. Unlike you, we are not expendable. But, if you can\nreturn our missing code to us, I can promise you a fine reward.\"\n```\n\nUpon completing the quest:\n\n```\n\"Thank you, %p! You have done the DevTeam a great service. We will\ncertainly be able to release the next version before long. In exchange,\nallow me to present you with this T-shirt, which you may find helpful in\nyour quest.\"\n```\n\nAn alternate completion message if you have personally killed [Izchak](/wiki/Izchak \"Izchak\"):\n\n```\nMike Stephenson looks at you frostily.\n```\n\n```\n\"Thank you... I suppose. You have done us a service. But I think you have done\nus a far greater disservice as well. Now that our business is concluded, kindly\nremove yourself from our office.\"\n```\n\nStandard messages:\n\n- \"How is your search going?\"\n\n  You have not yet brought Mike Stephenson any scrolls of missing code.\n\n- \"Thank you.

'''devteam member''', {{monsym|devteam member}}, is a type of [[monster]] that appears in [[TNNT (the game)]]. They are character representations of the ''[[NetHack]]'' [[DevTeam]] that reside within [[the DevTeam Office]], a special optional [[dungeon branch]] where you can take on a quest to find a [[scroll of missing code]] on three dungeon floors in exchange for the [[Really Cool Shirt]].\n\nDevteam members have two powerful weapon attacks, and the second can [[stun]] targets. They possess [[sleep resistance]], [[poison resistance]] and [[stoning resistance]].\n\n[[Chat]]ting to devteam members gives various unique [[#messages|messages]], depending on which specific one is talked to.\n\n==Generation==\nThe six devteam members occupy the rightmost half of the Office's level: [[User:bhaak|bhaak]], [[User:paxed|paxed]], [[User:lorimer|lorimer]], and [[User:Ais523|ais]] are stationed at each corner of the room containing a statue of a [[balrog]] named the RNG, while [[Pat Rankin|PatR]] and [[Mike Stephenson]] sit in rooms on each side of the hall that leads to the \"PEBCAK disposal area\"; Mike Stephenson will additionally be seated on a [[throne]].\n\nAll devteam members are [[Monster starting inventory|generated with]] either a [[long sword]] or [[katana]] as their weapon, alongside a [[shield of reflection]], [[leather gloves]], [[high boots]], and either an [[elven mithril-coat]] or [[dwarvish mithril-coat]].\n\n==Strategy==\nChatting to Mike Stephenson is required to initiate the quest and return the three scrolls of missing code; while the quest is active, talking to Mike will also give a hint as to which floor each scroll can be found on. It is very possible to find one or more of the scrolls before encountering the DevTeam Office - stash them in a [[container]] as soon as possible to keep them from burning up or fading. Mike will also accept the scrolls if they are [[thrown]] to him, and a [[deaf]] character can throw one to him to begin the quest - this is done to accommodate permadeaf characters (who cannot use #chat).\n\nFor characters that complete the quest and do not personally kill [[Izchak]], Mike Stephenson will give the Really Cool Shirt as a reward.\n\nBe very careful not to anger any of the devteam members: they are very powerful and can displace monsters as the [[Riders]] do. There is also no reward for killing any of them, as [[Instadeath|the game immediately ends]] if a devteam member dies by any means, and [[life saving]] will not protect a character who dies this way. Thankfully, throwing scrolls of missing code at any devteam member other than Mike Stephenson will not anger them or lose the scrolls.\n\n==Origin==\nAs mentioned, all of the devteam member monsters are based on the real-life ''NetHack'' DevTeam.\n\nThe sequence of events that occurs when killing a devteam member is probably a reference to the [[panic]] handler: 'Suddenly, the dungeon collapses.'\n\n==Messages==\n{{message|\"Oh, neat! Show this scroll to Mike Stephenson!\"|You chatted to any of the other devteam members with a scroll of missing code in open inventory.}}\n{{message|<[[foo]]> looks <peeved/indignant/irritated>.<br>\"Why don't you just #chat to me like a normal adventurer?\"|You threw a scroll at a devteam member other than Mike Stephenson.}}\n{{message|<foo> asks you about your day.<br>\"LOUD NOISES!!\"|Both of these serve as backup generic messages for devteam members.}}\n\n===bhaak===\n{{message|bhaak tries to get you to play something called '[[UnNetHack]]'.|bhaak is the developer of UnNetHack.}}\n{{message|bhaak starts swearing at you in German.<br>bhaak discusses the merits of HTML [[dumplog]]s.<br>\"Denial is a valid [[bug]] resolution technique.\"<br>\"UnNetHack5 > [[NetHack4]]. Just ask any sorting algorithm.<br>\"I hate [[secret door]]s.\"<br>\"The Gods are not deaf and can get annoyed by constant mortal lamentations.\"<br>\"You can lead players to [[variant]]s but you can't make them play.\"}}\n\n===paxed===\n{{message|paxed asks you if you've seen [[User:dtype|dtype]].<br>paxed mumbles something about [[X11]] [[tty]] status.<br>\"We just come here to idle.\"<br>\"You can finally [[wish]] for [[orange]]s.

May I ask you\n to listen for a moment? We are in dire need of some assistance.\n\n Recently, we had collected our best new ideas and inscribed the source\n code on three scrolls. But before we were able to add them to the\n codebase, the RNG glitched and sent them into the game itself.\n\n Without these scrolls, we can't finish work on the next version of\n NetHack. We're trying to use our terminals here to search for them, and\n paxed is pretty sure that they all ended up in the Dungeons of Doom...\n but we're still trying to figure out on which levels.\n\n It's too dangerous for me to send any of the DevTeam members out\n searching for them. Unlike you, we are not expendable. But, if you can\n return our missing code to us, I can promise you a fine reward.\"\n\nUpon completing the quest:\n\n \"Thank you, %p! You have done the DevTeam a great service. We will\n certainly be able to release the next version before long. In exchange,\n allow me to present you with this [[T-shirt]], which you may find helpful in\n your quest.\"\n\nAn alternate completion message if you have personally killed [[Izchak]]:\n\n Mike Stephenson looks at you frostily.\n\n \"Thank you... I suppose. You have done us a service. But I think you have done\n us a far greater disservice as well. Now that our business is concluded, kindly\n remove yourself from our office.\"\n\nStandard messages:\n\n{{message|\"How is your search going?\"|You have not yet brought Mike Stephenson any scrolls of missing code.}}\n{{message|\"Thank you.

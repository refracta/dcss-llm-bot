You will be prompted for\nconfirmation, and you must have hands and a strength of at least 10.\nWands with no charges and some wands listed below have no effect (\"But\nnothing else happens...\").\n\nMost wands will produce an explosion when broken.  The explosion causes\ndamage to yourself and any monsters that were in the adjacent squares\nwhen you broke the wand.  This damage can be reduced or eliminated if\nyou (or the monster) has an appropriate resistance.  Damage is also\nreduced to 1/2 for Healers and Knights and to 1/5 for Monks, Priests,\nand Wizards.  Further effects can occur as if you had zapped yourself\nwith the wand.  The explosion can also affect objects in your inventory,\non your square, and on adjacent squares, and affect locations as if they\nwere zapped.  Finally, some types of wands have explosions that make you\nidentify the wand.\n\nSpecific effects are detailed below.  In any case, you destroy the wand\nand owe the cost if it was unpaid.\n\nWAND                   EFFECTS\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~\ncancellation           There is an explosion from 1 to (4*charges) damage.\n                       Monsters and objects in the affected squares are\n                       cancelled.\n\ncold                   There is an explosion of cold with (8 * charges)\n                       damage.\n                       Potions may freeze.\n                       You identify the wand.\n\ncreate monster         There is an explosion from 1 to (4*charges) damage.\n                       You are surrounded by monsters.\n\ndeath                  There is an explosion of death with (16 * charges)\n                       damage.

Not really a good idea.\n\n\nCancelling\n~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from the spoiler \"cancel\", by Boudewijn Waijers.)\n\nMonsters (including you) can be cancelled when hit by wands or spells of\ncancellation, and sometimes by Magicbane.  The monster may resist.  Also,\nwhen a gremlin (including you) manages to steal an intrinsic from a\nmonster, the monster is automatically cancelled as well.  Cancelled\nmonsters cannot use most of their special attacks against you:\n  Blind you with light\n  Cast spells at you\n  Charm you\n  Confuse you\n  Drain your constitution\n  Drain your dexterity\n  Explode in your face\n  Paralyse you\n  Poison you\n  Put you to sleep\n  Rust, rot or disenchant something, offensive or defensive\n  Seduce you\n  Slime you\n  Slow you down\n  Spit at you\n  Steal an item (other than the Unique Items)\n  Steal intrinsics\n  Steal your gold\n  Stick to you\n  Stun you\n  Teleport you away\n  Use acid offensively against you\n  Use its breath weapon\n  Use its cold attack, offensive or defensive\n  Use its electricity attack, offensive or defensive\n  Use its fire attack or gaze, offensive or defensive\n  Wrap itself around you\nMany monsters also lose abilities specific to their species as well:\n  Medusa's gaze cannot turn you to stone\n  Medusa cannot be turned to stone with a reflecting item\n  A black or brown pudding cannot divide\n  A clay golem will die\n  A chickatrice or cockatrice can't turn you to stone by hissing\n  A demon cannot summon other demons\n  A floating eye cannot be paralysed with a mirror\n  A lycanthrope cannot change you into another one\n  A lycanthrope cannot summon help\n  A lycanthrope cannot polymorph into their wereform by attacking\n  A mimic cannot revert to mimicking an object\n  A nurse won't heal you with its attack\n  A nymph or succubus won't steal your mirror if you apply it\n  A tengu cannot teleport\n  An umber hulk cannot be confused with a mirror\n  A xan's prick doesn't weaken you\n\nNote that some attacks aren't susceptible to cancellation:\n  Defensive acid splashing\n  Disease attacks\n  Famine's hunger attack\n  Mind-flaying attacks\n  Physical blinding attacks\n  Physical damage attacks\n  The Oracle's magic defences\n  Touch of Death\n  Wizard or Quest Nemesis stealing the Amulet, Bell, Book or Candelabrum\n\nWhen a monster cannot use a certain attack on you, it normally cannot\nuse it on another monster either.\n\nA wand or spell of cancellation will also affect objects on the floor, or\nobjects in your inventory if you zap yourself.  However, it does not\naffect other monster's inventories or the contents of containers.\nAffected objects will always become uncursed.  Specific effects are\ndescribed below:\n  OBJECT                     RESULT\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~\n  weapon                     uncursed +0 weapon, same erodeproofing\n  armor                      uncursed +0 armor, same erodeproofing\n  scroll of mail             uncursed scroll of mail\n  other scrolls              uncursed scroll of blank paper\n  spellbook of cancellation  uncursed spellbook of cancellation\n  Book of the Dead           uncursed Book of the Dead\n  other spellbooks           uncursed spellbook of blank paper\n  potion of sickness         uncursed potion of fruit juice, same dilution\n  potion of see invisible    uncursed potion of fruit juice, same dilution\n  potion of fruit juice      uncursed potion of fruit juice, same dilution\n  potion of booze            uncursed potion of booze, same dilution\n  potion of oil              uncursed potion of oil, same dilution\n  other potions              uncursed potion of water\n  charged ring               uncursed +0 ring\n  wand of cancellation       uncursed, still charged\n  other wands                uncursed, uncharged, can't wrest last charge\n  Bell of Opening            uncursed Bell of Opening (0)\n  Candelabrum of Invocation  uncursed, same number of candles attached\n  charged magic tools        uncursed, uncharged\n  charged non-magic tools    uncursed, still charged\n  uncharged tools            uncursed, unaltered\n  containers                 uncursed, still same type, contents unchanged\n\nNote that cancellation won't work on corpses; if it is resurrected, the\nmonster will still function exactly the same as if the monster had\nnot been cancelled when it was still alive.\n\n\nPolymorphing\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nYou can use a wand or spell of polymorph on both monsters and objects.\nThe beam acts over a maximum distance of 6 to 13 squares, and cannot be\nreflected.  Polymorph traps may also affect monsters, but not objects.\nPotions of polymorph can be quaffed to polymorph yourself, thrown at\na target, or used to dip an object into. Quaffing from a sink has a\n1/20 chance of polymorphing you.\n\nWhen a monster (including you) is affected, the monster may change into a\ndifferent species.  Magic resistance will prevent a monster from\npolymorphing, unless the monster zapped itself (or yourself).  Some\nmonsters may also resist the attack, as well.  A polymorphing monster has\na 1/25 chance of dying of system shock, unless it is a natural\nshapeshifter.  Objects in the monster's or your inventory are not affected,\nnor are objects dropped as a result of the polymorph.\n\nThere are several special cases when you are polymorphed.  If you are\nwearing an amulet of unchanging, you will not polymorph.  If you have\npolymorph control, you can choose the creature you wish to be polymorphed\ninto.  If you are wearing dragon armour, you will become that type of\ndragon (unless you have polymorph control) and will lose your cloak and\nshirt; the armour will merge with your skin and be unharmed if not\nbroken by a further polymorph.  If you have lycanthropy, you turn into\nthat were-creature (or vice versa); if you are a vampire, you become a\nvampire bat (or vice versa).  If you have none of the above, you have\na (19 - Constitution) in 20 chance of getting system shock (\"You shudder\nfor a moment\", lose 1 to 30 HP, and abuse your constitution); if this\ndoes not occur, there is a 1/5 chance (which also applies to controlled\npolymorphs) that you become a \"new man/woman/<race>\" rather than a\ndifferent monster, and your level, hit points, energy, and statistics will\nbe randomly adjusted.\n\nHow long you are polymorphed depends on your experience level and the\nlevel of the monster you became (this prevents abuse by low-level\ncharacters); you will not revert while you have unchanging.  You can\nalways return to your natural form by losing all of your hit points\n(in a pinch by throwing objects upwards (<) and letting them hit you)\nunless you have unchanging; in this case, you will simply die.  Other\nmonsters remain the same species indefinitely (except true shapeshifters).\n\nYou can also polymorph objects.  Many people call this \"polypiling\",\nbecause they painstakingly collect items, line them up into several\npiles, and polymorph them all at once.  Each item may become a new item\nin the same object class.  The objects retain their blessed/cursed state,\nerosion, erosionproofing, traps, and poisoning.  Wands keep their number\nof charges, whereas weapons and armor keep their enchantment.  Worn items\nare removed on polymorphing.  Magical objects (see the next section) will\ntend not to polymorph into non-magical ones, and vice versa; the\nprobabilities of this for the object classes that have members of each\nkind are as below.\n\nclass       magical -> non-magical  non-magical -> magical\n~~~~~     : ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\narmour    :        54%                        0.6%\ngem       :        92%                      negligible\npotion    :       1.7%                         41%\nscroll    :     negligible                     92%\nspellbook :     negligible                     95%\ntool      :        60%                        0.3%\nwand      :     negligible                     93%\n\nYou will eventually lose some objects.  Items appearing in quantities of\n2 or more have a (quantity in 1000) chance of merging into one object.\nItems also have a probability of \"shuddering\": 1/3 if a wand or cursed,\n1/8 if uncursed, 1/12 if blessed (if in quantities greater than 4, 100%,\n1/4, and 1/6, respectively).  This will decrease the quantity of the item\nrandomly, cause any remainder not to be polymorphed, and has a one in\n(luck + 45) chance per object of creating a golem from the material of\nthe shuddered item (provided at least two items total remain in the pile).\nScrolls of mail will never merge or shudder.\n\nThere are some limitations to polypiling.  You can't change scrolls of\nmail, wands of polymorph, potions of polymorph, spellbooks of polymorph,\nRider corpses, the invocation items, or the Amulet of Yendor.  Artifacts\nhave a much higher chance of resisting polymorph than non-artifacts; the\nresult of a polymorph will never be an artifact.  Eggs laid by you become\nother types of eggs, still laid by you.  Spellbooks will become more faded,\nwands have their recharge count incremented.  Magic markers will be\nconsidered to have been recharged once.  Crocodile corpses become\nnon-cursed fireproof +0 low boots.  Containers lose all of their contents.\nThere are limits to converting stones (e.g. rocks and luckstones) into\ngems and glass; you won't get more than four.  Note that balls and chains\nbecome (surprise!) balls and chains.  You can never create the following\nobjects through polypiling:\n  magic lamps           wands of wishing         wands of polymorph\n  potions of polymorph  spellbooks of polymorph\nand, since the probabilities of the new item are the same as for random\ngeneration of that object class, you'll never get anything you wouldn't\nfind randomly created in the dungeon either.\n\n\nMagical objects\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from a spoiler by Peter Snelling)\n\nTo maximise the results from polymorphing objects, it's useful to know\nwhich objects the game considers \"magical\" and which not.\n\nMagical armour (all other being non-magical):\n  cloak of displacement          dunce cap\n  alchemy smock                  cornuthaum\n  cloak of invisibility          helm of brilliance\n  cloak of magic resistance      helm of opposite alignment\n  elven cloak                    helm of telepathy\n  robe\n  cloak of protection            elven boots\n                                 kicking boots\n  gauntlets of dexterity         fumble boots\n  gauntlets of fumbling          levitation boots\n  gauntlets of power             jumping boots\n                                 speed boots\n  shield of reflection           water walking boots\n\n  all dragon scale mail (but not dragon scales)\n\nMagical tools (all other being non-magical):\n  bag of holding                 magic whistle     \n  bag of tricks                  magic flute       \n  magic lamp                     frost horn\t       \n  crystal ball                   fire horn\t       \n  unicorn horn                   horn of plenty    \n  figurine                       magic harp\t       \n  magic marker                   drum of earthquake\n\nMagical stones (the remaining gems and stones are non-magical):\n  luckstone\n  loadstone\n  touchstone\n\nNon-magical potions (all other being magical):\n  booze\n  fruit juice\n  sickness\n  water\n  acid\n  oil\n\nNo weapon, food, boulder, or statue is magical.\nAll non-blank scrolls are magical (except non-polyable scrolls of mail).\nAll non-blank spellbooks are magical.\nAll wands except nothing are magical.\nAll rings (except meat rings, which are food) are magical.\nAll non-fake amulets are magical.\nAll Unique Items are magical, but can't be polymorphed anyway.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks to Bruce Cox for proofreading the original version of this file.\nFurther corrections and clarifications provided by Joe Bednorz,\nRoger Breitenstein, David Corbett, Kent Paul Dolan, Michael Deutschmann,\nDavid Gale, Wes Irby, Toni Keskitalo, Bruce Labbate, Oberon, Jason Parker,\nPat Rankin, Irina Rempt, Stanislav Traykov, and Jeremy Turner.\n```\n\n*This page is based on a spoiler by [Dylan O'Donnell](https://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.spod-central.org/%257Epsmith/).

You will be prompted for\nconfirmation, and you must have hands and a strength of at least 10.\nWands with no charges and some wands listed below have no effect (\"But\nnothing else happens...\").\n\nMost wands will produce an explosion when broken.  The explosion causes\ndamage to yourself and any monsters that were in the adjacent squares\nwhen you broke the wand.  This damage can be reduced or eliminated if\nyou (or the monster) has an appropriate resistance.  Damage is also\nreduced to 1/2 for Healers and Knights and to 1/5 for Monks, Priests,\nand Wizards.  Further effects can occur as if you had zapped yourself\nwith the wand.  The explosion can also affect objects in your inventory,\non your square, and on adjacent squares, and affect locations as if they\nwere zapped.  Finally, some types of wands have explosions that make you\nidentify the wand.\n\nSpecific effects are detailed below.  In any case, you destroy the wand\nand owe the cost if it was unpaid.\n\nWAND                   EFFECTS\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~\ncancellation           There is an explosion from 1 to (4*charges) damage.\n                       Monsters and objects in the affected squares are\n                       cancelled.\n\ncold                   There is an explosion of cold with (8 * charges)\n                       damage.\n                       Potions may freeze.\n                       You identify the wand.\n\ncreate monster         There is an explosion from 1 to (4*charges) damage.\n                       You are surrounded by monsters.\n\ndeath                  There is an explosion of death with (16 * charges)\n                       damage.

Not really a good idea.\n\n\nCancelling\n~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from the spoiler \"cancel\", by Boudewijn Waijers.)\n\nMonsters (including you) can be cancelled when hit by wands or spells of\ncancellation, and sometimes by Magicbane.  The monster may resist.  Also,\nwhen a gremlin (including you) manages to steal an intrinsic from a\nmonster, the monster is automatically cancelled as well.  Cancelled\nmonsters cannot use most of their special attacks against you:\n  Blind you with light\n  Cast spells at you\n  Charm you\n  Confuse you\n  Drain your constitution\n  Drain your dexterity\n  Explode in your face\n  Paralyse you\n  Poison you\n  Put you to sleep\n  Rust, rot or disenchant something, offensive or defensive\n  Seduce you\n  Slime you\n  Slow you down\n  Spit at you\n  Steal an item (other than the Unique Items)\n  Steal intrinsics\n  Steal your gold\n  Stick to you\n  Stun you\n  Teleport you away\n  Use acid offensively against you\n  Use its breath weapon\n  Use its cold attack, offensive or defensive\n  Use its electricity attack, offensive or defensive\n  Use its fire attack or gaze, offensive or defensive\n  Wrap itself around you\nMany monsters also lose abilities specific to their species as well:\n  Medusa's gaze cannot turn you to stone\n  Medusa cannot be turned to stone with a reflecting item\n  A black or brown pudding cannot divide\n  A clay golem will die\n  A chickatrice or cockatrice can't turn you to stone by hissing\n  A demon cannot summon other demons\n  A floating eye cannot be paralysed with a mirror\n  A lycanthrope cannot change you into another one\n  A lycanthrope cannot summon help\n  A lycanthrope cannot polymorph into their wereform by attacking\n  A mimic cannot revert to mimicking an object\n  A nurse won't heal you with its attack\n  A nymph or succubus won't steal your mirror if you apply it\n  A tengu cannot teleport\n  An umber hulk cannot be confused with a mirror\n  A xan's prick doesn't weaken you\n\nNote that some attacks aren't susceptible to cancellation:\n  Defensive acid splashing\n  Disease attacks\n  Famine's hunger attack\n  Mind-flaying attacks\n  Physical blinding attacks\n  Physical damage attacks\n  The Oracle's magic defences\n  Touch of Death\n  Wizard or Quest Nemesis stealing the Amulet, Bell, Book or Candelabrum\n\nWhen a monster cannot use a certain attack on you, it normally cannot\nuse it on another monster either.\n\nA wand or spell of cancellation will also affect objects on the floor, or\nobjects in your inventory if you zap yourself.  However, it does not\naffect other monster's inventories or the contents of containers.\nAffected objects will always become uncursed.  Specific effects are\ndescribed below:\n  OBJECT                     RESULT\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~\n  weapon                     uncursed +0 weapon, same erodeproofing\n  armor                      uncursed +0 armor, same erodeproofing\n  scroll of mail             uncursed scroll of mail\n  other scrolls              uncursed scroll of blank paper\n  spellbook of cancellation  uncursed spellbook of cancellation\n  Book of the Dead           uncursed Book of the Dead\n  other spellbooks           uncursed spellbook of blank paper\n  potion of sickness         uncursed potion of fruit juice, same dilution\n  potion of see invisible    uncursed potion of fruit juice, same dilution\n  potion of fruit juice      uncursed potion of fruit juice, same dilution\n  potion of booze            uncursed potion of booze, same dilution\n  potion of oil              uncursed potion of oil, same dilution\n  other potions              uncursed potion of water\n  charged ring               uncursed +0 ring\n  wand of cancellation       uncursed, still charged\n  other wands                uncursed, uncharged, can't wrest last charge\n  Bell of Opening            uncursed Bell of Opening (0)\n  Candelabrum of Invocation  uncursed, same number of candles attached\n  charged magic tools        uncursed, uncharged\n  charged non-magic tools    uncursed, still charged\n  uncharged tools            uncursed, unaltered\n  containers                 uncursed, still same type, contents unchanged\n\nNote that cancellation won't work on corpses; if it is resurrected, the\nmonster will still function exactly the same as if the monster had\nnot been cancelled when it was still alive.\n\n\nPolymorphing\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nYou can use a wand or spell of polymorph on both monsters and objects.\nThe beam acts over a maximum distance of 6 to 13 squares, and cannot be\nreflected.  Polymorph traps may also affect monsters, but not objects.\nPotions of polymorph can be quaffed to polymorph yourself, thrown at\na target, or used to dip an object into. Quaffing from a sink has a\n1/20 chance of polymorphing you.\n\nWhen a monster (including you) is affected, the monster may change into a\ndifferent species.  Magic resistance will prevent a monster from\npolymorphing, unless the monster zapped itself (or yourself).  Some\nmonsters may also resist the attack, as well.  A polymorphing monster has\na 1/25 chance of dying of system shock, unless it is a natural\nshapeshifter.  Objects in the monster's or your inventory are not affected,\nnor are objects dropped as a result of the polymorph.\n\nThere are several special cases when you are polymorphed.  If you are\nwearing an amulet of unchanging, you will not polymorph.  If you have\npolymorph control, you can choose the creature you wish to be polymorphed\ninto.  If you are wearing dragon armour, you will become that type of\ndragon (unless you have polymorph control) and will lose your cloak and\nshirt; the armour will merge with your skin and be unharmed if not\nbroken by a further polymorph.  If you have lycanthropy, you turn into\nthat were-creature (or vice versa); if you are a vampire, you become a\nvampire bat (or vice versa).  If you have none of the above, you have\na (19 - Constitution) in 20 chance of getting system shock (\"You shudder\nfor a moment\", lose 1 to 30 HP, and abuse your constitution); if this\ndoes not occur, there is a 1/5 chance (which also applies to controlled\npolymorphs) that you become a \"new man/woman/&lt;race&gt;\" rather than a\ndifferent monster, and your level, hit points, energy, and statistics will\nbe randomly adjusted.\n\nHow long you are polymorphed depends on your experience level and the\nlevel of the monster you became (this prevents abuse by low-level\ncharacters); you will not revert while you have unchanging.  You can\nalways return to your natural form by losing all of your hit points\n(in a pinch by throwing objects upwards (&lt;) and letting them hit you)\nunless you have unchanging; in this case, you will simply die.  Other\nmonsters remain the same species indefinitely (except true shapeshifters).\n\nYou can also polymorph objects.  Many people call this \"polypiling\",\nbecause they painstakingly collect items, line them up into several\npiles, and polymorph them all at once.  Each item may become a new item\nin the same object class.  The objects retain their blessed/cursed state,\nerosion, erosionproofing, traps, and poisoning.  Wands keep their number\nof charges, whereas weapons and armor keep their enchantment.  Worn items\nare removed on polymorphing.  Magical objects (see the next section) will\ntend not to polymorph into non-magical ones, and vice versa; the\nprobabilities of this for the object classes that have members of each\nkind are as below.\n\nclass       magical -&gt; non-magical  non-magical -&gt; magical\n~~~~~     : ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\narmour    :        54%                        0.6%\ngem       :        92%                      negligible\npotion    :       1.7%                         41%\nscroll    :     negligible                     92%\nspellbook&#160;:     negligible                     95%\ntool      :        60%                        0.3%\nwand      :     negligible                     93%\n\nYou will eventually lose some objects.  Items appearing in quantities of\n2 or more have a (quantity in 1000) chance of merging into one object.\nItems also have a probability of \"shuddering\": 1/3 if a wand or cursed,\n1/8 if uncursed, 1/12 if blessed (if in quantities greater than 4, 100%,\n1/4, and 1/6, respectively).  This will decrease the quantity of the item\nrandomly, cause any remainder not to be polymorphed, and has a one in\n(luck + 45) chance per object of creating a golem from the material of\nthe shuddered item (provided at least two items total remain in the pile).\nScrolls of mail will never merge or shudder.\n\nThere are some limitations to polypiling.  You can't change scrolls of\nmail, wands of polymorph, potions of polymorph, spellbooks of polymorph,\nRider corpses, the invocation items, or the Amulet of Yendor.  Artifacts\nhave a much higher chance of resisting polymorph than non-artifacts; the\nresult of a polymorph will never be an artifact.  Eggs laid by you become\nother types of eggs, still laid by you.  Spellbooks will become more faded,\nwands have their recharge count incremented.  Magic markers will be\nconsidered to have been recharged once.  Crocodile corpses become\nnon-cursed fireproof +0 low boots.  Containers lose all of their contents.\nThere are limits to converting stones (e.g. rocks and luckstones) into\ngems and glass; you won't get more than four.  Note that balls and chains\nbecome (surprise!) balls and chains.  You can never create the following\nobjects through polypiling:\n  magic lamps           wands of wishing         wands of polymorph\n  potions of polymorph  spellbooks of polymorph\nand, since the probabilities of the new item are the same as for random\ngeneration of that object class, you'll never get anything you wouldn't\nfind randomly created in the dungeon either.\n\n\nMagical objects\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Adapted from a spoiler by Peter Snelling)\n\nTo maximise the results from polymorphing objects, it's useful to know\nwhich objects the game considers \"magical\" and which not.\n\nMagical armour (all other being non-magical):\n  cloak of displacement          dunce cap\n  alchemy smock                  cornuthaum\n  cloak of invisibility          helm of brilliance\n  cloak of magic resistance      helm of opposite alignment\n  elven cloak                    helm of telepathy\n  robe\n  cloak of protection            elven boots\n                                 kicking boots\n  gauntlets of dexterity         fumble boots\n  gauntlets of fumbling          levitation boots\n  gauntlets of power             jumping boots\n                                 speed boots\n  shield of reflection           water walking boots\n\n  all dragon scale mail (but not dragon scales)\n\nMagical tools (all other being non-magical):\n  bag of holding                 magic whistle     \n  bag of tricks                  magic flute       \n  magic lamp                     frost horn\t       \n  crystal ball                   fire horn\t       \n  unicorn horn                   horn of plenty    \n  figurine                       magic harp\t       \n  magic marker                   drum of earthquake\n\nMagical stones (the remaining gems and stones are non-magical):\n  luckstone\n  loadstone\n  touchstone\n\nNon-magical potions (all other being magical):\n  booze\n  fruit juice\n  sickness\n  water\n  acid\n  oil\n\nNo weapon, food, boulder, or statue is magical.\nAll non-blank scrolls are magical (except non-polyable scrolls of mail).\nAll non-blank spellbooks are magical.\nAll wands except nothing are magical.\nAll rings (except meat rings, which are food) are magical.\nAll non-fake amulets are magical.\nAll Unique Items are magical, but can't be polymorphed anyway.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks to Bruce Cox for proofreading the original version of this file.\nFurther corrections and clarifications provided by Joe Bednorz,\nRoger Breitenstein, David Corbett, Kent Paul Dolan, Michael Deutschmann,\nDavid Gale, Wes Irby, Toni Keskitalo, Bruce Labbate, Oberon, Jason Parker,\nPat Rankin, Irina Rempt, Stanislav Traykov, and Jeremy Turner.\n</pre>\n<div class=\"license_dod\">\n<p><i>This page is based on a spoiler by <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.spod-central.org/%257Epsmith/\">Dylan O'Donnell</a>.

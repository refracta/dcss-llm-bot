{"title":"Kick","url":"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Kick","type":"markdown","data":"In *[NetHack](/wiki/NetHack \"NetHack\")*, a [player](/wiki/Player \"Player\") character can **kick** objects, monsters, and dungeon features using [ctrl](/wiki/Ctrl \"Ctrl\") + [d](/wiki/D \"D\") (or [k](/wiki/K \"K\"), if the [number\\_pad](/wiki/Number_pad \"Number pad\") [option](/wiki/Option \"Option\") is on). Kicking makes [noise](/wiki/Noise \"Noise\") that wakes up nearby monsters and attracts pets.\n\nSome monsters kick as part of their [attack](/wiki/Attack \"Attack\") sequence. If you are [polymorphed](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") into such a monster, you will kick enemies automatically when you attack them in [melee](/wiki/Melee \"Melee\") - you can use the kick command if you only want to kick the enemy without using other attacks such as a [pony](/wiki/Pony \"Pony\")'s bite or a [unicorn](/wiki/Unicorn \"Unicorn\")'s headbutt.\n\n[Monks](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\") and [Samurai](/wiki/Samurai \"Samurai\") get a bonus to kicking because of their [martial arts](/wiki/Martial_arts \"Martial arts\") training.\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Restrictions on kicking](#Restrictions_on_kicking)\n- [2 Kicking objects](#Kicking_objects)\n  - [2.1 Maximal distance](#Maximal_distance)\n- [3 Kicking dungeon features](#Kicking_dungeon_features)\n- [4 Kicking monsters](#Kicking_monsters)\n  - [4.1 Limitations to kicking monsters](#Limitations_to_kicking_monsters)\n- [5 See also](#See_also)\n- [6 References](#References)\n\n## Restrictions on kicking\n\nYou can't kick if:\n\n- You are [carrying too much](/wiki/Carrying_capacity \"Carrying capacity\") ([stressed](/wiki/Encumbrance \"Encumbrance\") or greater).\n- You are trapped in a [pit](/wiki/Pit \"Pit\"), [web](/wiki/Web \"Web\"), or [bear trap](/wiki/Bear_trap \"Bear trap\").\n- One of your legs is [wounded](/wiki/Wounded_legs \"Wounded legs\").\n- You are [polymorphed](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") into a [reptile](/wiki/Lizard_\\(monster_class\\) \"Lizard (monster class)\"), a monster that is [tiny](/wiki/Tiny \"Tiny\") or one that lacks legs (e.g. a [slithy](/wiki/Slithy \"Slithy\") creature).\n\nTrying to kick while [underwater](/wiki/Underwater \"Underwater\") has a 50% chance of failing (\"Your slow motion kick doesn't hit anything.\")[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1)\n\nIf you kick while [levitating](/wiki/Levitation \"Levitation\") and hit something (a monster, a wall), you will [hurtle](/wiki/Hurtle \"Hurtle\") in the opposite direction.\n\nIf you are [riding](/wiki/Riding \"Riding\"), the only thing you can kick is your steed, and the game will ask you if you want to do so. Kicking your steed is one way to make it [temporarily move faster](/wiki/Gallop \"Gallop\"), but at the cost of reducing its [tameness](/wiki/Tameness \"Tameness\").\n\n## Kicking objects\n\nIf you kick an object, it flies in the direction of kicking, possibly hitting the monsters, except the following:\n\n| Target                                                                                                                        | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Pile of objects                                                                                                               | Only the top object in pile is kicked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| [Stack](/wiki/Stack \"Stack\") of [gold](/wiki/Gold \"Gold\")                                                                     | Scatters the gold pieces across surrounding tiles.[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2)                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Immobile objects (too heavy, against a wall, fixed in place)                                                                  | May wound your leg for a short time, making you unable to kick and reducing your [carrying capacity](/wiki/Carrying_capacity \"Carrying capacity\").                                                                                                                                        |\n| Heavy object                                                                                                                  | \"Thump!\" The object does not move.

In this case it is considered too heavy: the player receives a \"Thump!\" message and possibly wounds their legs.\n\nOtherwise, the object moves the distance unless stopped by an obstacle.\n\n## Kicking dungeon features\n\nA user has suggested improving this page or section as follows:\n\n*\"Per [3.6.3](/wiki/3.6.3 \"3.6.3\"): \"When players injure themselves kicking an altar, the relevant god's wrath is no longer ignored.\" This implies significant effects on [anger](/wiki/Anger \"Anger\"), and the article should be updated accordingly.\"*\n\n| Target                                         | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Empty space                                    | Has a chance of [abusing](/wiki/Abuse \"Abuse\") [strength](/wiki/Strength \"Strength\") and [wounding your leg](/wiki/Wounded_legs \"Wounded legs\").

The exact formula is\n\n![1d(\\frac{Str + Dex + Con}{15} + b)](/images/math/a/d/4/ad411ff01a2a2fa3facdc23d753dabcb.png)\n\nwhere ![b](/images/math/9/2/e/92eb5ffee6ae2fec3ad71c777531578f.png) is 5 if wearing kicking boots and 0 otherwise.\n\nUsually, this will come up to 1d7 - 1d8 with kicking boots or 1d2 - 1d3 without.\n\n- If your kick is 'clumsy', this base damage is halved. (This is not quite the same thing as \"Your clumsy kick does no damage\", but related.) Kicks can be clumsy if you are:\n\n  - Wearing bulky body armor (dragon scales and dragon scale mail are considered bulky, as is any form of body armor that weighs 350 or more; all other body armors are non-bulky)\n  - Wearing a [large shield](/wiki/Large_shield \"Large shield\"), which is also considered bulky\n  - Carrying a heavy load (more than 70% of your carrying capacity, with higher probability to be clumsy at 80%, and guaranteed at 90%)\n  - [Fumbling](/wiki/Fumbling \"Fumbling\").\n\n- If you are a [martial artist](/wiki/Martial_arts \"Martial arts\") ([monk](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\") or [samurai](/wiki/Samurai \"Samurai\")), there is a random damage bonus between 0 and half your [dexterity](/wiki/Dexterity \"Dexterity\"). This exercises the martial arts skill, but the skill level does not affect the amount of bonus damage.\n\n- If you are wearing [blessed](/wiki/Blessed \"Blessed\") boots, you deal an additional 1d4 damage against [major demons](/wiki/Major_demon \"Major demon\") and [undead](/wiki/Undead \"Undead\") creatures.\n\n- The enchantment of your boots is added to the total damage amount, plus the enchantment of any [rings of increase damage](/wiki/Ring_of_increase_damage \"Ring of increase damage\") you are wearing or have [eaten](/wiki/Eating_jewelry \"Eating jewelry\").\n\n- [Thick-skinned](/wiki/Thick-skinned \"Thick-skinned\") monsters like [dragons](/wiki/Dragon \"Dragon\") and [mumakil](/wiki/Mumak \"Mumak\") take no base damage from a kick. Rings of increase damage, enchanted boots, and blessed boots will still cause their normal damage.[\\[5\\]](#cite_note-5)\n\n- If you attempt to kick a [shade](/wiki/Shade \"Shade\") with unblessed boots, your foot will pass through it, doing no damage. You can only damage a shade by kicking if your boots are blessed, and even then the only damage comes from the 1d4 bonus versus undead.\n\nIf you are [polymorphed](/wiki/Polymorph \"Polymorph\") into a [sasquatch](/wiki/Sasquatch \"Sasquatch\"), you will get a bonus to kicking because you are (a) 'bigfoot'.\n\nThere is a +1 [to-hit](/wiki/To-hit \"To-hit\") bonus to kicking, even if you are unskilled in martial arts, so it may be a useful strategy for fighting a monster you are having trouble hitting (like a [ghost](/wiki/Ghost \"Ghost\")).\n\nKicking a [sleeping](/wiki/Sleep \"Sleep\") monster will wake it up. (As usual, the [noise](/wiki/Noise \"Noise\") from kicking wakes up all sleeping monsters nearby.)\n\nWhen [levitating](/wiki/Levitating \"Levitating\"), kicking [larger](/wiki/Monster_size \"Monster size\") monsters will propel you farther, and very small monsters will be more difficult to hit.\n\nWith the right [training](/wiki/Martial_arts \"Martial arts\") or [equipment](/wiki/Kicking_boots \"Kicking boots\"), you can sometimes send smaller monsters reeling back a square—perhaps into a [trap](/wiki/Trap \"Trap\").\n\n### Limitations to kicking monsters\n\nKicking monsters can displace them to a random point adjacent to you, even if they couldn't normally reach that spot: \"The *monster* jumps (or swoops, slides, etc.), nimbly avoiding your kick.\" This is more likely to happen if you are [fumbling](/wiki/Fumbling \"Fumbling\") or [burdened](/wiki/Encumbrance \"Encumbrance\"). It is also more likely to happen with [flying](/wiki/Flying \"Flying\") monsters such as bats.\n\nKicking a [cockatrice](/wiki/Cockatrice \"Cockatrice\") without wearing [boots](/wiki/Boots \"Boots\") will result in [stoning](/wiki/Stoning \"Stoning\").\n\nKicking a [pet](/wiki/Pet \"Pet\") is considered [abuse](/wiki/Tameness#Abuse \"Tameness\").[\\[6\\]](#cite_note-6)\n\n## See also\n\n- [Kicking boots](/wiki/Kicking_boots \"Kicking boots\")\n\n## References\n\n1.

''[[NetHack]]'', a [[player]] character can '''kick''' objects, monsters, and dungeon features using {{kbd|ctrl|d}} (or {{kbd|k}}, if the [[number_pad]] [[option]] is on). Kicking makes [[noise]] that wakes up nearby monsters and attracts pets.\n\nSome monsters kick as part of their [[attack]] sequence. If you are [[polymorph]]ed into such a monster, you will kick enemies automatically when you attack them in [[melee]] - you can use the kick command if you only want to kick the enemy without using other attacks such as a [[pony]]'s bite or a [[unicorn]]'s headbutt.\n\n[[Monk]]s and [[Samurai]] get a bonus to kicking because of their [[martial arts]] training.\n\n==Restrictions on kicking==\nYou can't kick if:\n* You are [[carrying capacity|carrying too much]] ([[encumbrance|stressed]] or greater).\n* You are trapped in a [[pit]], [[web]], or [[bear trap]].\n* One of your legs is [[wounded legs|wounded]].\n* You are [[polymorph]]ed into a [[Lizard (monster class)|reptile]], a monster that is [[tiny]] or one that lacks legs (e.g. a [[slithy]] creature).\n\nTrying to kick while [[underwater]] has a 50% chance of failing (\"Your slow motion kick doesn't hit anything.\"){{refsrc|src/dokick.c|791|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}\n\nIf you kick while [[levitation|levitating]] and hit something (a monster, a wall), you will [[hurtle]] in the opposite direction.\n\nIf you are [[riding]], the only thing you can kick is your steed, and the game will ask you if you want to do so. Kicking your steed is one way to make it [[Gallop|temporarily move faster]], but at the cost of reducing its [[tameness]].\n\n==Kicking objects==\nIf you kick an object, it flies in the direction of kicking, possibly hitting the monsters, except the following:\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n|-\n! Target\n! Effect\n|-\n|Pile of objects\n||Only the top object in pile is kicked.\n|-\n|[[Stack]] of [[gold]]\n||Scatters the gold pieces across surrounding tiles.{{refsrc|src/dokick.c|634|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}\n|-\n|Immobile objects (too heavy, against a wall, fixed in place)\n||May wound your leg for a short time, making you unable to kick and reducing your [[carrying capacity]].\n|-\n|Heavy object\n||\"Thump!\"  The object does not move.  This has a chance of doing damage to you as if you kicked a wall.  Whether the object is heavy or not, determined by it's weight, player's [[strength]], and other factors (see [[#maximal distance]] below).\n|-\n|[[Fragile]] object\n||Causes it to shatter.  If the object is a [[potion]], you will inhale its [[vapors]] and experience their effects.\n|-\n|Locked [[container]]\n||May break the lock.  This is also likely to break fragile items like potions inside it, (\"You hear a muffled shatter.\") \n|-\n|[[Mimic]] disguised as an object\n||Reveals the mimic.\n|-\n|Object embedded in a wall\n||May release the object (\"The <item> comes loose!\") and deposit it on the floor where you are standing.  This is an alternative to [[digging]] the object loose.\n|-\n|[[Cockatrice]] or [[chickatrice]] [[corpse]]\n||If you are not wearing [[boots]], results in immediate [[stoning]].\n|}\n\nKicking a cursed [[scroll of scare monster]] will not cause it to crumble, as picking it up would.  This is one way to move scrolls that have become cursed.\n\n===Maximal distance===\nThe distance the kicked object moves is S/2 - W/40{{refsrc|src/dokick.c||version=NetHack 3.6.0}}, where S is the player's strength, W is the object's weight, with the following caveats:\n* If the player's strength is 18/01 to 18/31, S=18{{refsrc|src/attrib.c||version=NetHack 3.6.0}}\n* If the player's strength is 18/32 to 19 inclusively, S is effectively 20\n* Each of the following adds [[rn1|1-3]] to the kicking distance:\n** The object is in air (at [[Plane of Air]]) or on ice\n** The object is greased, and not underwater or in air\n** The player is a Samurai or Monk, wearing [[kicking boots]], or polymorphed to a [[sasquatch]].\n* If the object is under water, the distance is D/3 + 1, where D is the distance it would move otherwise.\n\nThe distance is ''from the player'', so a distance of 1 or less means that the object does not move at all. In this case it is considered too heavy: the player receives a \"Thump!\" message and possibly wounds their legs.\n\nOtherwise, the object moves the distance unless stopped by an obstacle.\n\n==Kicking dungeon features==\n{{todo|Per [[3.6.3]]: \"When players injure themselves kicking an altar, the relevant god's wrath is no longer ignored.\" This implies significant effects on [[anger]], and the article should be updated accordingly.}}\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n|-\n! Target\n! Effect\n|-\n|Empty space\n||Has a chance of [[Abuse|abusing]] [[strength]] and [[wounded legs|wounding your leg]].  (\"Dumb move!  You strain a muscle.\")\n|-\n|Closed [[door]]\n||May break the door, leaving an empty doorway.  Breaking a [[shop]] door will anger the [[shopkeeper]] unless you immediately pay 400 zorkmids.  The act of kicking [[exercise]]s [[dexterity]].  Successfully breaking doors exercises [[strength]].\n|-\n|[[Sink]]\n||May create a [[foocubus]] (always of the opposite gender), a [[black pudding]], or a random [[ring]].  Only one of each can come from a given sink.\n|-\n|[[Altar]]\n||With a 1/3 probability, hurts you as if you were kicking a wall. Otherwise, if co-aligned, immediately reduces your [[wisdom]] by one point;  if cross-aligned, reduces [[luck]] by one point. \n|-\n|[[Tree]]\n||May create some fruit (e.g. [[apple]]s or [[pear]]s), or a swarm of [[killer bee]]s.  Either event can only happen once per tree.\n|-\n|[[Throne]]\n||May knock loose some [[gold]] and [[gem]]s (only once per throne) or send you to a lower dungeon level.  If the throne has already produced gems and gold or your [[luck]] is negative, kicking may destroy it.\n|-\n|[[Wall]]\n||Does a small amount of damage to you (\"Ouch! That hurts!\") with a chance of [[wounded legs|hurting your leg]].\n|-\n|[[Secret door]]\n||May reveal the door.  \"Crash!  You kick open a secret door!\" or \"Crash!  You uncover a secret door!\"  If your [[luck]] is low, this may be a faster way to make a suspected secret door appear than [[search]]ing.\n|}\n\n==Kicking monsters==\nKicking [[monster]]s can damage them.\n\nThe base kicking damage is based on your [[Strength|strength]], [[Constitution|constitution]], [[Dexterity|dexterity]] and whether you are wearing [[kicking boots]]. The exact formula is\n\n<math>1d(\\frac{Str + Dex + Con}{15} + b)</math>\n\nwhere <math>b</math> is 5 if wearing kicking boots and 0 otherwise.\n\nUsually, this will come up to 1d7 - 1d8 with kicking boots or 1d2 - 1d3 without.\n* If your kick is 'clumsy', this base damage is halved.  (This is not quite the same thing as \"Your clumsy kick does no damage\", but related.)  Kicks can be clumsy if you are:\n** Wearing bulky body armor (dragon scales and dragon scale mail are considered bulky, as is any form of body armor that weighs 350 or more; all other body armors are non-bulky)\n** Wearing a [[large shield]], which is also considered bulky\n** Carrying a heavy load (more than 70% of your carrying capacity, with higher probability to be clumsy at 80%, and guaranteed at 90%)\n** [[Fumbling]]. \n* If you are a [[martial arts|martial artist]] ([[monk]] or [[samurai]]), there is a random damage bonus between 0 and half your [[dexterity]].  This exercises the martial arts skill, but the skill level does not affect the amount of bonus damage.\n* If you are wearing [[blessed]] boots, you deal an additional 1d4 damage against [[major demon]]s and [[undead]] creatures.\n* The enchantment of your boots is added to the total damage amount, plus the enchantment of any [[ring of increase damage|rings of increase damage]] you are wearing or have [[eating jewelry|eaten]].\n* [[Thick-skinned]] monsters like [[dragon]]s and [[mumak]]il take no base damage from a kick.  Rings of increase damage, enchanted boots, and blessed boots will still cause their normal damage.{{refsrc|src/dokick.c|49|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}\n* If you attempt to kick a [[shade]] with unblessed boots, your foot will pass through it, doing no damage. You can only damage a shade by kicking if your boots are blessed, and even then the only damage comes from the 1d4 bonus versus undead.\nIf you are [[polymorph]]ed into a [[sasquatch]], you will get a bonus to kicking because you are (a) 'bigfoot'.  \n\nThere is a +1 [[to-hit]] bonus to kicking, even if you are unskilled in martial arts, so it may be a useful strategy for fighting a monster you are having trouble hitting (like a [[ghost]]).  \n\nKicking a [[sleep]]ing monster will wake it up. (As usual, the [[noise]] from kicking wakes up all sleeping monsters nearby.)\n\nWhen [[levitating]], kicking [[monster size|larger]] monsters will propel you farther, and very small monsters will be more difficult to hit.\n\nWith the right [[martial arts|training]] or [[kicking boots|equipment]], you can sometimes send smaller monsters reeling back a square&mdash;perhaps into a [[trap]].\n\n===Limitations to kicking monsters===\nKicking monsters can displace them to a random point adjacent to you, even if they couldn't normally reach that spot: \"The ''monster'' jumps (or swoops, slides, etc.), nimbly avoiding your kick.\" This is more likely to happen if you are [[fumbling]] or [[encumbrance|burdened]]. It is also more likely to happen with [[flying]] monsters such as bats.\n\nKicking a [[cockatrice]] without wearing [[boots]] will result in [[stoning]].\n\nKicking a [[pet]] is considered [[Tameness#Abuse|abuse]].{{refsrc|src/dokick.c|75|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kicking boots]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{nethack-360}}\n[[Category:Commands]]\n[[Category:Monster attacks]]"}

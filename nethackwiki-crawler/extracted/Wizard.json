For other uses, see [Wizard (disambiguation)](/wiki/Wizard_\\(disambiguation\\) \"Wizard (disambiguation)\").*\n\nThe **Wizard** is one of the [roles](/wiki/Role \"Role\") in *NetHack*. Wizards can be either [neutral](/wiki/Neutral \"Neutral\") or [chaotic](/wiki/Chaotic \"Chaotic\"), and can be [humans](/wiki/Human_\\(starting_race\\) \"Human (starting race)\"), [elves](/wiki/Elf_\\(starting_race\\) \"Elf (starting race)\"), [gnomes](/wiki/Gnome_\\(starting_race\\) \"Gnome (starting race)\") or [orcs](/wiki/Orc_\\(starting_race\\) \"Orc (starting race)\"). Their first [sacrifice gift](/wiki/Sacrifice#Gifts \"Sacrifice\") is [Magicbane](/wiki/Magicbane \"Magicbane\"). They are relatively poor fighters, but are arguably the best [spellcasters](/wiki/Spellcaster \"Spellcaster\") in the game. The [guidebook](/wiki/Guidebook \"Guidebook\") says of them:\n\nWizards start out with a knowledge of magic, a selection of magical items, and a particular affinity for dweomercraft. Although seemingly weak and easy to overcome at first sight, an experienced Wizard is a deadly foe.\n\n[ ]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Starting equipment](#Starting_equipment)\n\n- [2 Intrinsics](#Intrinsics)\n\n- [3 Skills](#Skills)\n\n- [4 Special rules](#Special_rules)\n\n  - [4.1 Spellcasting](#Spellcasting)\n  - [4.2 Reading and writing](#Reading_and_writing)\n  - [4.3 Miscellaneous](#Miscellaneous)\n\n- [5 Strategy](#Strategy)\n\n  - [5.1 Character creation](#Character_creation)\n\n  - [5.2 Skill slot management](#Skill_slot_management)\n\n  - [5.3 Early game](#Early_game)\n\n    - [5.3.1 Objectives](#Objectives)\n    - [5.3.2 Weapons](#Weapons)\n    - [5.3.3 Spellcasting](#Spellcasting_2)\n\n  - [5.4 Mid game](#Mid_game)\n\n    - [5.4.1 Objectives](#Objectives_2)\n    - [5.4.2 Weapons](#Weapons_2)\n    - [5.4.3 Spellcasting](#Spellcasting_3)\n\n  - [5.5 Late game](#Late_game)\n\n    - [5.5.1 Objectives](#Objectives_3)\n    - [5.5.2 Weapons](#Weapons_3)\n    - [5.5.3 Spellcasting](#Spellcasting_4)\n\n- [6 Rank titles](#Rank_titles)\n\n- [7 Quest](#Quest)\n\n- [8 Variants](#Variants)\n\n  - [8.1 SLASH'EM](#SLASH.27EM)\n    - [8.1.1 Strategy](#Strategy_2)\n  - [8.2 SporkHack](#SporkHack)\n  - [8.3 xNetHack](#xNetHack)\n  - [8.4 FIQHack](#FIQHack)\n\n- [9 Encyclopedia entry](#Encyclopedia_entry)\n\n- [10 References](#References)\n\n## Starting equipment\n\nA wizard begins the game with:[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1)\n\n- a [blessed](/wiki/Blessed \"Blessed\") [+1](/wiki/Enchantment \"Enchantment\") [quarterstaff](/wiki/Quarterstaff \"Quarterstaff\")\n- a [cloak of magic resistance](/wiki/Cloak_of_magic_resistance \"Cloak of magic resistance\")\n- three random [scrolls](/wiki/Scroll \"Scroll\")\n- a blessed [spellbook of force bolt](/wiki/Spellbook_of_force_bolt \"Spellbook of force bolt\")\n- a random non-force bolt [spellbook](/wiki/Spellbook \"Spellbook\") of level 3 or lower [\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2)\n- three random [potions](/wiki/Potion \"Potion\")\n- two random [rings](/wiki/Ring \"Ring\")\n- one random [wand](/wiki/Wand \"Wand\")\n- if an [elf](/wiki/Elf_\\(starting_race\\) \"Elf (starting race)\"), random non-magical [musical instrument](/wiki/Musical_instrument \"Musical instrument\")[\\[3\\]](#cite_note-3)\n- 20% chance of [magic marker](/wiki/Magic_marker \"Magic marker\")[\\[4\\]](#cite_note-4)\n- 20% chance of [blindfold](/wiki/Blindfold \"Blindfold\")\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")).

This is independent of the category of the random spellbook, because the spellcasting skills are hardcoded in the function *skill\\_init* in [weapon.c](/wiki/Weapon.c \"Weapon.c\").\n\n## Special rules\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nAs of [commit 319dfbda](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/319dfbdaa3e608e88e39e0a296a9c41febfc1a59), wizards learn the appearances of spellbooks as they gain skill in the relevant spell schools, and start out with knowledge of all level-1 spellbooks. Also, they no longer have an advantage when writing unknown spellbooks (but still have an advantage when writing scrolls).\n\n### Spellcasting\n\nWizards with an intelligence of 15 or 16 have [reduced-hunger casting](/wiki/Reduced-hunger_casting \"Reduced-hunger casting\"), and Wizards with an intelligence of 17 or above have hungerless casting.\n\nWizards have no bonus or penalty for [emergency spells](/wiki/Emergency_spell \"Emergency spell\"), but their special spell is [magic missile](/wiki/Spellbook_of_magic_missile \"Spellbook of magic missile\"), which is probably the most useful special spell among the spellcasting roles.\n\nWizards regain [energy](/wiki/Energy \"Energy\") more often than other roles.\n\n### Reading and writing\n\nWizards can write scrolls and spellbooks they don't know yet with [much higher success rates](/wiki/Magic_marker#Unknown_scrolls_and_spellbooks \"Magic marker\") than other roles. With maximized Luck, writing one is nearly a certainty.\n\nWizards get a warning when they have a chance of failing to read an uncursed spellbook: \"This spellbook is \\[very] difficult to comprehend. Continue?\"\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n[Cornuthaums](/wiki/Cornuthaum \"Cornuthaum\") give Wizards a [charisma](/wiki/Charisma \"Charisma\") boost and [clairvoyance](/wiki/Clairvoyance \"Clairvoyance\"), and only Wizards can safely enchant them from up to +5.\n\nWizards cannot [fire multiple projectiles at once](/wiki/Multishot \"Multishot\") unless they are Expert at the relevant weapon skill, and do not gain a multishot bonus for their racial [launcher](/wiki/Launcher \"Launcher\").\n\nWizards with [teleportitis](/wiki/Teleportitis \"Teleportitis\") can teleport at will at experience level 8 or higher, rather than 12 as with other roles. Wizards also spend less time as a [beginner](/wiki/Beginner \"Beginner\") than other roles.\n\n## Strategy\n\n### Character creation\n\nAmong all roles, Wizards have the greatest variation in their starting items. Some players like to \"start scum\", quitting and rolling new Wizards repeatedly until they start with desirable items and spells.\n\n- Humans make the hardiest Wizards with their relatively high [HP](/wiki/HP \"HP\") growth; their [energy](/wiki/Energy \"Energy\") growth is competitive as well. On the downside, their lack of [infravision](/wiki/Infravision \"Infravision\") makes it somewhat difficult to target spells at distant monsters until they obtain a source of [warning](/wiki/Warning \"Warning\") or [telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\") (usually via [ring of warning](/wiki/Ring_of_warning \"Ring of warning\") or [floating eye](/wiki/Floating_eye \"Floating eye\")).\n- A gnomish Wizard will face a relatively peaceful [Mines](/wiki/Mines \"Mines\"); although Wizards generally want to solve [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") first for the guaranteed food and [strength](/wiki/Strength \"Strength\") training, they should still tackle the Mines at some point for access to [Minetown](/wiki/Minetown \"Minetown\") and the guaranteed [luckstone](/wiki/Luckstone \"Luckstone\"). Their higher maximum [intelligence](/wiki/Intelligence \"Intelligence\") and bonus to energy growth are obvious advantages, but their hit points are mediocre.\n- Orcs are crippled by their penalties to HP and energy growth. Unlike other orcs, orcish Wizards start with no bonus food; their maximum intelligence makes uncursed [spellbooks](/wiki/Spellbook \"Spellbook\") slightly riskier to read, and requires a [helm of brilliance](/wiki/Helm_of_brilliance \"Helm of brilliance\") for hungerless casting. With that in mind, 16 intelligence is still enough for 100% reliable spellcasting, and they also gain modest benefits from [poison resistance](/wiki/Poison_resistance \"Poison resistance\"). While Wizards are generally frail enough that they should worry more about death from HP than a poison [instadeath](/wiki/Instadeath \"Instadeath\"), their low intelligence cap tends to distribute more points towards their physical stats, making them somewhat better at early-game combat than gnomes and elves - just how much varies greatly between individual characters.\n- Elves have the highest energy growth of any race, but due to their low maximum [constitution](/wiki/Constitution \"Constitution\"), their HP tends to lag far behind other races. If they're lucky enough to start with the maximum 20 intelligence, they'll have a relatively easy time reading new spellbooks, although this comes at the expense of their other attributes. Their maximum natural strength and constitution aren't enough to reach maximum [encumbrance](/wiki/Encumbrance \"Encumbrance\"), and [gauntlets of power](/wiki/Gauntlets_of_power \"Gauntlets of power\") might not be a viable option due to their spellcasting penalty.\n\nChaotic characters have the usual benefit of a less malicious [mysterious force](/wiki/Mysterious_force \"Mysterious force\"), although since they can acquire [teleport control](/wiki/Teleport_control \"Teleport control\") by leveling up, they can recover relatively easily from being sent down in Gehennom. Chaotic gods grant more prayer timeout reduction from [sacrifice](/wiki/Sacrifice \"Sacrifice\"), which is a boon to a Wizard who wants to altar farm for spellbooks. Being neutral is of relatively little benefit to a Wizard unless they want to wish for a specific [quest artifact](/wiki/Quest_artifact \"Quest artifact\").\n\n### Skill slot management\n\nIt takes 6 [skill](/wiki/Skill \"Skill\") slots to reach Expert in [daggers](/wiki/Dagger \"Dagger\"), and 20 slots to max out all the spellcasting skills. This means that a level 30 Wizard who chooses to enhance all spellcasting skills to maximum should have 3 slots free to spend on other skills, such as unrestricted [artifact weapon](/wiki/Artifact_weapon \"Artifact weapon\") skills.\n\nAs part of skill slot management, a Wizard should defer enhancing any spell skill until there comes a point when doing so would provide an in-game benefit. The benefits from enhancing a spell skill are that it lowers spell failure rates, and (depending on the spell) sometimes augments the effects of a spell. When advancing spell skills, it is a good idea to check which spells you have in each school, and make sure that at least one of your spells would benefit from being enhanced, before using up the skill slot.\n\nIt is important to note that a great many spells enjoy augmented effects when advancing from Basic to Skilled (notably, [fireball](/wiki/Spellbook_of_fireball \"Spellbook of fireball\"), [cone of cold](/wiki/Spellbook_of_cone_of_cold \"Spellbook of cone of cold\"), [remove curse](/wiki/Spellbook_of_remove_curse \"Spellbook of remove curse\"), and [detect monsters](/wiki/Spellbook_of_detect_monsters \"Spellbook of detect monsters\")), but only two spells enjoy augmented effects when going from Skilled to Expert (namely, [jumping](/wiki/Spellbook_of_jumping \"Spellbook of jumping\") and [protection](/wiki/Spellbook_of_protection \"Spellbook of protection\")), and of these two, Wizards can only become Expert in jumping. Therefore, for spells other than [escape spells](/wiki/Escape_spells \"Escape spells\"), a Wizard gains no benefit from advancing to Expert unless there is a currently known high level spell (e.g. [finger of death](/wiki/Spellbook_of_finger_of_death \"Spellbook of finger of death\"), [cancellation](/wiki/Spellbook_of_cancellation \"Spellbook of cancellation\"), or [polymorph](/wiki/Spellbook_of_polymorph \"Spellbook of polymorph\")) whose failure rate would be lowered by such advancement.\n\nIn particular, there is almost never any need to advance [divination spells](/wiki/Divination_spells \"Divination spells\") to Expert, since all divination spells have the same effects at Skilled as at Expert, and none of the divination spells are of very high spell level. The Skilled casting effects of [enchantment spells](/wiki/Enchantment_spells \"Enchantment spells\") and [healing spells](/wiki/Healing_spells \"Healing spells\") may also not be worth the skill slots. The skill slots saved thereby are valuable to have available for weapons, especially early in the game.\n\n*The following information pertains to an upcoming version ([NetHack 3.7.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0 \"NetHack 3.7.0\")). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.*\n\nOnce you no longer need to throw daggers, a [scroll of amnesia](/wiki/Scroll_of_amnesia \"Scroll of amnesia\") may reset your dagger skill, freeing those slots to be spent on spell skills. You may also forget spells and spell skills, but you can relearn your spells from your books and retrain your skills quickly with the energy regeneration from the Eye.\n\n### Early game\n\n#### Objectives\n\nSome people advocate deliberately keeping your [experience level](/wiki/Experience_level \"Experience level\") low in the early game, but this is controversial. Increases in [monster difficulty](/wiki/Monster_difficulty \"Monster difficulty\") due to a higher experience levels are roughly balanced out with the spellcasting benefits of a higher experience level, such as higher maximum [power](/wiki/Power \"Power\"). The easiest way to prevent yourself from over-leveling is to allow your pet to kill as many monsters as is feasible, although one would be wise to still gain a few levels for the additional survivability and spell power capacity. These constraints are loosened when you learn [magic missile](/wiki/Magic_missile \"Magic missile\"), get [Magicbane](/wiki/Magicbane \"Magicbane\"), or obtain some other offensive upgrade.\n\nUnless you are playing an [atheist](/wiki/Atheist \"Atheist\"), if you manage to find an early coaligned altar, consider sacrificing at it until you get Magicbane, which will make your early game a lot easier.\n\nThe Mines are dangerous. Unless you are a gnome, all the normal inhabitants will want to kill you. It can be quite hard for inexperienced players to go straight to Minetown and survive long enough to return to the main dungeon. Exploring the deeper Mines past Minetown should perhaps be postponed, though you do eventually want to get there, as the [Catacombs](/wiki/Catacombs \"Catacombs\") can be very profitable for a Wizard.\n\nCompleting Sokoban before doing anything else is likewise dangerous, because monsters difficulty increases with each completed puzzle, and your own experience level will probably not keep up with it.\n\nConsider going down to the Oracle level and breaking the centaur statues there in search of spare spellbooks, gaining a few levels in the process, then coming back up to do the Gnomish Mines.\n\nHunger may become an issue, especially if you do not start the game with Intelligence of 17 or above for hungerless casting. You may need to pray for food when weak, and the first floor of Sokoban with its guaranteed food might be a good place to go to stock up.\n\n#### Weapons\n\nEarly-game Wizards are very weak and should avoid engaging in melee combat with monsters. Finding a source of thrown weapons to damage or kill monsters before they can reach you is critical.\n\nMost Wizards pursue [daggers](/wiki/Dagger \"Dagger\") as their sole weapon skill, because it is easy for them to get Magicbane (which uses the dagger skill), and because throwing daggers at Expert skill later in the game does considerably more damage than using a [quarterstaff](/wiki/Quarterstaff \"Quarterstaff\"). To that end, training daggers as soon as you come across some is a good idea. Easy ways to train daggers include throwing them at slow enemies, letting a [fog cloud](/wiki/Fog_cloud \"Fog cloud\") engulf you, or naming [Sting](/wiki/Sting \"Sting\") and training it on goblins for the +d5 to-hit bonus. Descending briefly into the [Gnomish Mines](/wiki/Gnomish_Mines \"Gnomish Mines\"), where daggers are plentiful, is a good way to acquire some.\n\nIn the very early game, daggers may still be hard to come by, so consider casting [force bolt](/wiki/Force_bolt \"Force bolt\") at a [boulder](/wiki/Boulder \"Boulder\") or [statue](/wiki/Statue \"Statue\"), picking up the resulting [stones](/wiki/Stone \"Stone\") (as many as can be carried while staying unburdened), and [quivering](/wiki/Quiver \"Quiver\") them. Throwing rocks at a monster is better than nothing, especially if you're out of power. Of course, you should replace them with [darts](/wiki/Dart \"Dart\"), [daggers](/wiki/Dagger \"Dagger\"), or other missiles as they become available.\n\nSome players advocate dumping the starting quarterstaff early on, either as soon as you find a non-cursed [dagger](/wiki/Dagger \"Dagger\") or you reach Basic skill in daggers. There is little reason to keep the staff after this point unless you plan to wish for [The Staff of Aesculapius](/wiki/The_Staff_of_Aesculapius \"The Staff of Aesculapius\"), in which case you should continue training quarterstaff skill. The Staff of Aesculapius has become a more viable choice with the advent of the #[tip](/wiki/Tip \"Tip\") command in [Nethack 3.6.0](/wiki/Nethack_3.6.0 \"Nethack 3.6.0\"), as you can now access the means to uncurse it in the unlikely event it should become cursed while you are wielding it. In addition to having good damage, it provides hungerless [regeneration](/wiki/Regeneration \"Regeneration\") and [drain resistance](/wiki/Drain_resistance \"Drain resistance\").\n\n#### Spellcasting\n\nPlayers disagree on whether Wizards should wear high-AC metal armor and focus on melee skills, or ignore all metal armor in favor of being able to use spells in combat. Wearing metal is fine if it doesn't encumber you and you're confident in your ability to survive without relying on magic. Not wearing it is fine if you're prepared to flee from monsters when you run low on energy. If you do choose to wear metal, you should plan to swap it out later for nonmetal armor as that gradually becomes available.\n\nSave your energy for when you really need it. You won't be able to cast force bolt more than a few times until you gain a few levels.\n\nRead any non-cursed spellbook as soon as you find it. You will always get a warning if there's a chance of failing to read it, and if you do, it's likely to be too high level to be of much use right now.\n\nIf you start with a [wand of polymorph](/wiki/Wand_of_polymorph \"Wand of polymorph\"), you may consider polymorphing your starting spellbooks. Your force bolt book, since it is blessed, will polymorph into another blessed book that can thus be read with a 100% success rate. However, this can be done only once or twice before the spellbook becomes too faint to read. You can also polymorph your starting pet at the same time, often ending up with something much stronger for an early pet (though this risks killing it).\n\n### Mid game\n\n#### Objectives\n\nRaising your [Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") and maintaining it should be a priority. Finish the Mines and Sokoban when you feel ready.\n\nThe [Wizard quest](/wiki/Wizard_quest \"Wizard quest\") is fairly easy, the [Dark One](/wiki/Dark_One \"Dark One\") is a pushover, and the reward—[the Eye of the Aethiopica](/wiki/The_Eye_of_the_Aethiopica \"The Eye of the Aethiopica\")—is so fantastically useful that a Wizard should probably go on the quest as soon as possible. One of the many things the Eye does is vastly enhance strategic mobility through the Mazes of Menace—in particular, you can get out of trouble in an instant. Many Wizards set up a base camp in [Sokoban](/wiki/Sokoban \"Sokoban\") and leave most of their worldly possessions there, going back whenever they need to read a spellbook or pick up more food. Adjacent monsters may follow you through the Eye's magical portal, but this also has its uses, such as luring [wraiths](/wiki/Wraith \"Wraith\") out of a [graveyard](/wiki/Graveyard \"Graveyard\") level.\n\nIf you have found the quest portal, but are not yet level 14, be aware that the first level of the quest, the Lonely Tower, is often well-provided with wraiths. You may be able to gain a few levels and reach XL 14 before you meet your quest leader.\n\nFor Wizards with the Eye and the magic missile and create monster spells, [altar farming](/wiki/Farming#Altar_scumming \"Farming\") is incredibly easy, since an arbitrary number of corpses for sacrifice can be created on demand. This is good for increasing your Luck or obtaining more sacrifice gifts and favors. If you decide to get [crowned](/wiki/Crowned \"Crowned\"), you will receive a [spellbook of finger of death](/wiki/Spellbook_of_finger_of_death \"Spellbook of finger of death\").\n\n#### Weapons\n\nYou can and should train daggers to Expert skill. Although Wizards don't get the [multishot](/wiki/Multishot \"Multishot\") bonus at Skilled as of [NetHack 3.6.0](/wiki/NetHack_3.6.0 \"NetHack 3.6.0\"), throwing two daggers in a single turn is still powerful, so it is recommended to acquire a good number of daggers that stack together. [Elven daggers](/wiki/Elven_dagger \"Elven dagger\") are especially useful.\n\nAcquire Magicbane at this stage, unless you have some reason not to.\n\n#### Spellcasting\n\nIf you have come across a [magic marker](/wiki/Magic_marker \"Magic marker\"), you can blank other spellbooks and write useful ones like [magic missile](/wiki/Spellbook_of_magic_missile \"Spellbook of magic missile\"), [identify](/wiki/Spellbook_of_identify \"Spellbook of identify\"), or [polymorph](/wiki/Spellbook_of_polymorph \"Spellbook of polymorph\").\n\nSince so many monsters are resistant to one or more forms of magical attack, you will need to build a diverse toolkit. A fire-resistant opponent may be especially vulnerable to cold attacks; an opponent with [reflection](/wiki/Reflection \"Reflection\") can probably be brought down by splash effects from a [fireball](/wiki/Spellbook_of_fireball \"Spellbook of fireball\"). Reading the wiki entries for new opponents to learn their immunities and weaknesses is a good idea. Ultimately, nothing has \"stab resistance\"—even [shades](/wiki/Shade \"Shade\") will succumb to an enchanted or silver weapon—so a Wizard should always have a good physical combat option to fall back on. Still, spells are generally the most powerful means of attack by this point in the game.\n\n### Late game\n\n#### Objectives\n\nSome players prefer to raise their experience level as high as possible in order to have the largest maximum HP and energy, and to maximize damage from casting magic missile. A level 30 Wizard gets 16d6 damage with each magic missile. Luring wraiths out of the Valley of the Dead and other graveyards will probably be required to reach this level. Remember to buy all the [divine protection](/wiki/Divine_protection \"Divine protection\") you want before trying to level up.\n\nOther players like to keep their experience level low, to keep higher-difficulty monsters from being generated. Ultimately, the choice is up to you.\n\n#### Weapons\n\nMagicbane remains an excellent weapon. With its magic resistance and ability to catch curses, you can fight powerful spellcasters like [arch-liches](/wiki/Arch-lich \"Arch-lich\") head-on. Opinions vary as to whether you should enchant it to +7 or keep it at +2; see [Magicbane#Enchanting](/wiki/Magicbane#Enchanting \"Magicbane\") for details.\n\nOther weapons such as [Frost Brand](/wiki/Frost_Brand \"Frost Brand\"), [Stormbringer](/wiki/Stormbringer \"Stormbringer\"), or The Staff of Aesculapius are good options that do significantly more damage than Magicbane. Note that the Staff of Aesculapius will not deal double damage to major [demons](/wiki/Demons \"Demons\") or [undead](/wiki/Undead \"Undead\"), so it is best paired with high-level spells like [cone of cold](/wiki/Cone_of_cold \"Cone of cold\") and [magic missile](/wiki/Magic_missile \"Magic missile\") (as well as [fireball](/wiki/Fireball \"Fireball\") if you haven't genocided [liches](/wiki/Lich_\\(monster_class\\) \"Lich (monster class)\")) along with other ranged damage options to handle these enemies in [Gehennom](/wiki/Gehennom \"Gehennom\").\n\n#### Spellcasting\n\nYou should definitely have the [finger of death](/wiki/Spellbook_of_finger_of_death \"Spellbook of finger of death\") spell in your repertoire by now. Save charges on your wands of death for when you really need them; e.g. when facing the [Riders](/wiki/Riders \"Riders\") on the Astral Plane.\n\nThe [helm of brilliance](/wiki/Helm_of_brilliance \"Helm of brilliance\") while not necessary, can be useful for reducing spell failure rates of difficult spells, or giving less capable wizards the benefit of [hungerless casting](/wiki/Hungerless_casting \"Hungerless casting\").\n\nGetting a source of [confusion](/wiki/Confusion \"Confusion\") for the Planes should be easy, since you probably have at least one useless forgotten spell like [cure blindness](/wiki/Spellbook_of_cure_blindness \"Spellbook of cure blindness\") or [restore ability](/wiki/Spellbook_of_restore_ability \"Spellbook of restore ability\").\n\nCasting spells when you have the [Amulet of Yendor](/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor \"Amulet of Yendor\") can drain your power very fast. You can drop it on the ground when you need to cast a lot of spells without moving. Also, consider stocking up on a few [scrolls of charging](/wiki/Scroll_of_charging \"Scroll of charging\") and reading them when confused to restore all your energy immediately.\n\n## Rank titles\n\nThe [status line](/wiki/Status_line \"Status line\") shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\n\n- XL 1–2: Evoker\n- XL 3–5: Conjurer\n- XL 6–9: Thaumaturge\n- XL 10–13: Magician\n- XL 14–17: Enchanter/Enchantress\n- XL 18–21: Sorcerer/Sorceress\n- XL 22–25: Necromancer\n- XL 26–29: Wizard\n- XL 30: Mage\n\n## Quest\n\n- *Main article: [Wizard quest](/wiki/Wizard_quest \"Wizard quest\")*\n\nThe Wizard quest sees you fighting the [Dark One](/wiki/Dark_One \"Dark One\") for [the Eye of the Aethiopica](/wiki/The_Eye_of_the_Aethiopica \"The Eye of the Aethiopica\").\n\n## Variants\n\n### SLASH'EM\n\nIn [SLASH'EM](/wiki/SLASH%27EM \"SLASH'EM\"), Wizards start with four spellbooks, with one book chosen randomly from each of:\n\n- [force bolt](/wiki/Spellbook_of_force_bolt \"Spellbook of force bolt\") or [sleep](/wiki/Spellbook_of_sleep \"Spellbook of sleep\")\n- [resist poison](/wiki/Spellbook_of_resist_poison \"Spellbook of resist poison\") or [resist sleep](/wiki/Spellbook_of_resist_sleep \"Spellbook of resist sleep\")\n- [detect food](/wiki/Spellbook_of_detect_food \"Spellbook of detect food\"), [detect monsters](/wiki/Spellbook_of_detect_monsters \"Spellbook of detect monsters\"), [light](/wiki/Spellbook_of_light \"Spellbook of light\"), [knock](/wiki/Spellbook_of_knock \"Spellbook of knock\"), or [wizard lock](/wiki/Spellbook_of_wizard_lock \"Spellbook of wizard lock\")\n- [magic missile](/wiki/Spellbook_of_magic_missile \"Spellbook of magic missile\"), [confuse monster](/wiki/Spellbook_of_confuse_monster \"Spellbook of confuse monster\"), [slow monster](/wiki/Spellbook_of_slow_monster \"Spellbook of slow monster\"), [cure blindness](/wiki/Spellbook_of_cure_blindness \"Spellbook of cure blindness\"), [endure heat](/wiki/Spellbook_of_endure_heat \"Spellbook of endure heat\"), [endure cold](/wiki/Spellbook_of_endure_cold \"Spellbook of endure cold\"), [insulate](/wiki/Spellbook_of_insulate \"Spellbook of insulate\"), [create monster](/wiki/Spellbook_of_create_monster \"Spellbook of create monster\"), or [healing](/wiki/Spellbook_of_healing \"Spellbook of healing\")\n\nSLASH'EM adds the rank titles Warlock/Witch (XL 14–17), bumps Enchanter/Enchantress to XL 18–21, Sorcerer/Sorceress to XL 22–25, and removes the rank title of Necromancer (presumably, to avoid confusion with the new [Necromancer](/wiki/Necromancer \"Necromancer\") role).\n\n#### Strategy\n\nWizards in SLASH'EM are a bit more difficult then in vanilla. In vanilla, once you get [Magicbane](/wiki/Magicbane \"Magicbane\") you are likely to be on the road to ascension. Here, you had better stay sharp even after you get Magicbane. Keep your pet around you for longer. A good advice would be to stay careful and keep your pet until your AC is below −10 and your level is above 10.\n\nAn additional difficulty is that you don't have enough slots for all the extrinsics you would want. [Dragon scale mail](/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail \"Dragon scale mail\") interferes with spellcasting now and generally isn't worth having in your [ascension kit](/wiki/Ascension_kit \"Ascension kit\"). In addition, you have to deal with the [create pool](/wiki/Create_pool \"Create pool\") spell and more serious [level drain](/wiki/Level_drain \"Level drain\") attacks.\n\nSome possible equipment choices:\n\n- [Water walking boots](/wiki/Water_walking_boots \"Water walking boots\"): You need these to deal with [create pool](/wiki/Create_pool \"Create pool\") spells. You can use [haste self](/wiki/Spellbook_of_haste_self \"Spellbook of haste self\") as a substitute to [speed boots](/wiki/Speed_boots \"Speed boots\"). The amulet slot is already crowded for other things, so no [amulet of flying](/wiki/Amulet_of_flying \"Amulet of flying\") for you.\n- [Ring of levitation](/wiki/Ring_of_levitation \"Ring of levitation\") with [speed boots](/wiki/Speed_boots \"Speed boots\"): With the ring, you are vulnerable to [electric bugs](/wiki/Electric_bug \"Electric bug\"). If you use this, you might want to blessed-genocide `x` to be safe, and this is no joke. The [levitation](/wiki/Spellbook_of_levitation \"Spellbook of levitation\") spell is dangerously unreliable (unless Skilled or better in escape spells).\n- [Robe of protection](/wiki/Robe_of_protection \"Robe of protection\"): The highest natural AC for the body armor slot without spellcasting interference. It can be [upgraded](/wiki/Upgrade \"Upgrade\") from plain [robes](/wiki/Robe_\\(SLASH%27EM\\) \"Robe (SLASH'EM)\") with 50% chance. The [robe of power](/wiki/Robe_of_power \"Robe of power\") is useless for a Wizard, unless you are wearing metallic armor. Robes take the body armor slot here, so you can't attempt to wear a [robe of power](/wiki/Robe_of_power \"Robe of power\") on top of dragon scale mail.\n- Amulet of [reflection](/wiki/Amulet_of_reflection \"Amulet of reflection\") or [drain resistance](/wiki/Amulet_of_drain_resistance \"Amulet of drain resistance\"): You'll need to give up on the amulet of [flying](/wiki/Amulet_of_flying \"Amulet of flying\") and [life saving](/wiki/Amulet_of_life_saving \"Amulet of life saving\").\n- Wielding [The Hand of Vecna](/wiki/The_Hand_of_Vecna_\\(SLASH%27EM\\) \"The Hand of Vecna (SLASH'EM)\"): It confers [drain resistance](/wiki/Drain_resistance \"Drain resistance\"). You can rely on the [remove curse](/wiki/Spellbook_of_remove_curse \"Spellbook of remove curse\") spell for the curses. Be careful of the blast if you are neutral.\n- Wielding [Stormbringer](/wiki/Stormbringer \"Stormbringer\") if chaotic for [drain resistance](/wiki/Drain_resistance \"Drain resistance\"). You can obtain Stormbringer easily by [crowning](/wiki/Crowning \"Crowning\") *while carrying* a [spellbook of finger of death](/wiki/Spellbook_of_finger_of_death \"Spellbook of finger of death\"); this will also unrestrict broadsword skill. Without already carrying finger of death spellbook, you'll get that instead.\n- Wielding [Nighthorn](/wiki/Nighthorn \"Nighthorn\"): It confers reflection, but it is two-handed, so if it gets cursed, you can't cast spells anymore. Also, being lawful, it will blast you for sure.\n- Depending on your situation, you could forgo reflection or drain resistance, but this is risky.\n\nBad ideas:\n\n- Wielding [the Staff of Aesculapius](/wiki/The_Staff_of_Aesculapius \"The Staff of Aesculapius\"): It doesn't confer drain resistance in SLASH'EM. Because it is two-handed, you can't cast spells if it gets cursed.\n- Wearing a [shield of reflection](/wiki/Shield_of_reflection \"Shield of reflection\"): Your success rate will not be higher than 55% for [magic missile](/wiki/Spellbook_of_magic_missile \"Spellbook of magic missile\") and 25% for anything else.\n\nNice wishes:\n\n[The Wallet of Perseus](/wiki/The_Wallet_of_Perseus \"The Wallet of Perseus\") can help overcome the role's initial low carrying capacity without wearing [gauntlets of power](/wiki/Gauntlets_of_power \"Gauntlets of power\").\n\n### SporkHack\n\nIn [SporkHack](/wiki/SporkHack \"SporkHack\"), Wizards start with a [spellbook of protection](/wiki/Spellbook_of_protection \"Spellbook of protection\") and a [cloak of protection](/wiki/Cloak_of_protection \"Cloak of protection\") instead of a cloak of magic resistance.\n\n### xNetHack\n\nIn [xNetHack](/wiki/XNetHack \"XNetHack\"), energy regeneration is increased by 0.33 per turn if the player is a Wizard. They start with four spellbooks ([force bolt](/wiki/Spellbook_of_force_bolt \"Spellbook of force bolt\"), [magic missile](/wiki/Spellbook_of_magic_missile \"Spellbook of magic missile\"), and two random ones), but no potions, scrolls, rings, or wand.\n\n### FIQHack\n\nIn [FIQHack](/wiki/FIQHack \"FIQHack\"), Wizards no longer get scrolls, potions, or rings as starting inventory. The only starting wand is the [wand of striking](/wiki/Wand_of_striking \"Wand of striking\"). However, Wizards also start with 4 spells (force bolt, magic missile, and 2 random).\n\nSimilar to xNetHack, energy regeneration is increased by 0.33 per turn for Wizards.\n\n[Hungerless casting](/wiki/Hungerless_casting \"Hungerless casting\") no longer exists.\n\n## Encyclopedia entry\n\nEbenezum walked before me along the closest thing we could  \nfind to a path in these overgrown woods. Every few paces he  \nwould pause, so that I, burdened with a pack stuffed with  \narcane and heavy paraphernalia, could catch up with his  \nwizardly strides. He, as usual, carried nothing, preferring,  \nas he often said, to keep his hands free for quick conjuring  \nand his mind free for the thoughts of a mage.\n\n\\[ A Dealing with Demons, by Craig Shaw Gardner ]\n\n## References\n\n1.

With maximized Luck, writing one is nearly a certainty.\n</p><p>Wizards get a warning when they have a chance of failing to read an uncursed spellbook: \"This spellbook is [very] difficult to comprehend. Continue?\"\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Miscellaneous\">Miscellaneous</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Cornuthaum\" title=\"Cornuthaum\">Cornuthaums</a> give Wizards a <a href=\"/wiki/Charisma\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Charisma\">charisma</a> boost and <a href=\"/wiki/Clairvoyance\" title=\"Clairvoyance\">clairvoyance</a>, and only Wizards can safely enchant them from up to +5.\n</p><p>Wizards cannot <a href=\"/wiki/Multishot\" title=\"Multishot\">fire multiple projectiles at once</a> unless they are Expert at the relevant weapon skill, and do not gain a multishot bonus for their racial <a href=\"/wiki/Launcher\" title=\"Launcher\">launcher</a>.\n</p><p>Wizards with <a href=\"/wiki/Teleportitis\" title=\"Teleportitis\">teleportitis</a> can teleport at will at experience level 8 or higher, rather than 12 as with other roles.

Some players like to \"start scum\", quitting and rolling new Wizards repeatedly until they start with desirable items and spells.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Humans make the hardiest Wizards with their relatively high <a href=\"/wiki/HP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HP\">HP</a> growth; their <a href=\"/wiki/Energy\" title=\"Energy\">energy</a> growth is competitive as well. On the downside, their lack of <a href=\"/wiki/Infravision\" title=\"Infravision\">infravision</a> makes it somewhat difficult to target spells at distant monsters until they obtain a source of <a href=\"/wiki/Warning\" title=\"Warning\">warning</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Telepathy\" title=\"Telepathy\">telepathy</a> (usually via <a href=\"/wiki/Ring_of_warning\" title=\"Ring of warning\">ring of warning</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Floating_eye\" title=\"Floating eye\">floating eye</a>).</li>\n<li>A gnomish Wizard will face a relatively peaceful <a href=\"/wiki/Mines\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mines\">Mines</a>; although Wizards generally want to solve <a href=\"/wiki/Sokoban\" title=\"Sokoban\">Sokoban</a> first for the guaranteed food and <a href=\"/wiki/Strength\" title=\"Strength\">strength</a> training, they should still tackle the Mines at some point for access to <a href=\"/wiki/Minetown\" title=\"Minetown\">Minetown</a> and the guaranteed <a href=\"/wiki/Luckstone\" title=\"Luckstone\">luckstone</a>. Their higher maximum <a href=\"/wiki/Intelligence\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intelligence\">intelligence</a> and bonus to energy growth are obvious advantages, but their hit points are mediocre.</li>\n<li>Orcs are crippled by their penalties to HP and energy growth. Unlike other orcs, orcish Wizards start with no bonus food; their maximum intelligence makes uncursed <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook\" title=\"Spellbook\">spellbooks</a> slightly riskier to read, and requires a <a href=\"/wiki/Helm_of_brilliance\" title=\"Helm of brilliance\">helm of brilliance</a> for hungerless casting. With that in mind, 16 intelligence is still enough for 100% reliable spellcasting, and they also gain modest benefits from <a href=\"/wiki/Poison_resistance\" title=\"Poison resistance\">poison resistance</a>. While Wizards are generally frail enough that they should worry more about death from HP than a poison <a href=\"/wiki/Instadeath\" title=\"Instadeath\">instadeath</a>, their low intelligence cap tends to distribute more points towards their physical stats, making them somewhat better at early-game combat than gnomes and elves - just how much varies greatly between individual characters.</li>\n<li>Elves have the highest energy growth of any race, but due to their low maximum <a href=\"/wiki/Constitution\" title=\"Constitution\">constitution</a>, their HP tends to lag far behind other races. If they're lucky enough to start with the maximum 20 intelligence, they'll have a relatively easy time reading new spellbooks, although this comes at the expense of their other attributes. Their maximum natural strength and constitution aren't enough to reach maximum <a href=\"/wiki/Encumbrance\" title=\"Encumbrance\">encumbrance</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Gauntlets_of_power\" title=\"Gauntlets of power\">gauntlets of power</a> might not be a viable option due to their spellcasting penalty.</li></ul>\n<p>Chaotic characters have the usual benefit of a less malicious <a href=\"/wiki/Mysterious_force\" title=\"Mysterious force\">mysterious force</a>, although since they can acquire <a href=\"/wiki/Teleport_control\" title=\"Teleport control\">teleport control</a> by leveling up, they can recover relatively easily from being sent down in Gehennom. Chaotic gods grant more prayer timeout reduction from <a href=\"/wiki/Sacrifice\" title=\"Sacrifice\">sacrifice</a>, which is a boon to a Wizard who wants to altar farm for spellbooks. Being neutral is of relatively little benefit to a Wizard unless they want to wish for a specific <a href=\"/wiki/Quest_artifact\" title=\"Quest artifact\">quest artifact</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Skill_slot_management\">Skill slot management</span></h3>\n<p>It takes 6 <a href=\"/wiki/Skill\" title=\"Skill\">skill</a> slots to reach Expert in <a href=\"/wiki/Dagger\" title=\"Dagger\">daggers</a>, and 20 slots to max out all the spellcasting skills. This means that a level 30 Wizard who chooses to enhance all spellcasting skills to maximum should have 3 slots free to spend on other skills, such as unrestricted <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact_weapon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Artifact weapon\">artifact weapon</a> skills.\n</p><p>As part of skill slot management, a Wizard should defer enhancing any spell skill until there comes a point when doing so would provide an in-game benefit. The benefits from enhancing a spell skill are that it lowers spell failure rates, and (depending on the spell) sometimes augments the effects of a spell. When advancing spell skills, it is a good idea to check which spells you have in each school, and make sure that at least one of your spells would benefit from being enhanced, before using up the skill slot.\n</p><p>It is important to note that a great many spells enjoy augmented effects when advancing from Basic to Skilled (notably, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_fireball\" title=\"Spellbook of fireball\">fireball</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_cone_of_cold\" title=\"Spellbook of cone of cold\">cone of cold</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_remove_curse\" title=\"Spellbook of remove curse\">remove curse</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_detect_monsters\" title=\"Spellbook of detect monsters\">detect monsters</a>), but only two spells enjoy augmented effects when going from Skilled to Expert (namely, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_jumping\" title=\"Spellbook of jumping\">jumping</a>&#32;and <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_protection\" title=\"Spellbook of protection\">protection</a>), and of these two, Wizards can only become Expert in jumping. Therefore, for spells other than <a href=\"/wiki/Escape_spells\" title=\"Escape spells\">escape spells</a>, a Wizard gains no benefit from advancing to Expert unless there is a currently known high level spell (e.g. <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_finger_of_death\" title=\"Spellbook of finger of death\">finger of death</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_cancellation\" title=\"Spellbook of cancellation\">cancellation</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_polymorph\" title=\"Spellbook of polymorph\">polymorph</a>) whose failure rate would be lowered by such advancement.\n</p><p>In particular, there is almost never any need to advance <a href=\"/wiki/Divination_spells\" title=\"Divination spells\">divination spells</a> to Expert, since all divination spells have the same effects at Skilled as at Expert, and none of the divination spells are of very high spell level. The Skilled casting effects of <a href=\"/wiki/Enchantment_spells\" title=\"Enchantment spells\">enchantment spells</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Healing_spells\" title=\"Healing spells\">healing spells</a> may also not be worth the skill slots. The skill slots saved thereby are valuable to have available for weapons, especially early in the game.\n</p>\n<div class=\"upcoming\">\n<p><i>The following information pertains to an upcoming version (<a href=\"/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0\" title=\"NetHack 3.7.0\">NetHack 3.7.0</a>). If this version is now released, please verify that it is still accurate, then update the page to incorporate this information.</i>\n</p>\nOnce you no longer need to throw daggers, a <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_amnesia\" title=\"Scroll of amnesia\">scroll of amnesia</a> may reset your dagger skill, freeing those slots to be spent on spell skills. You may also forget spells and spell skills, but you can relearn your spells from your books and retrain your skills quickly with the energy regeneration from the Eye.</div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_game\">Early game</span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives\">Objectives</span></h4>\n<p>Some people advocate deliberately keeping your <a href=\"/wiki/Experience_level\" title=\"Experience level\">experience level</a> low in the early game, but this is controversial. Increases in <a href=\"/wiki/Monster_difficulty\" title=\"Monster difficulty\">monster difficulty</a> due to a higher experience levels are roughly balanced out with the spellcasting benefits of a higher experience level, such as higher maximum <a href=\"/wiki/Power\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Power\">power</a>. The easiest way to prevent yourself from over-leveling is to allow your pet to kill as many monsters as is feasible, although one would be wise to still gain a few levels for the additional survivability and spell power capacity. These constraints are loosened when you learn <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_missile\" title=\"Magic missile\">magic missile</a>, get <a href=\"/wiki/Magicbane\" title=\"Magicbane\">Magicbane</a>, or obtain some other offensive upgrade.\n</p><p>Unless you are playing an <a href=\"/wiki/Atheist\" title=\"Atheist\">atheist</a>, if you manage to find an early coaligned altar, consider sacrificing at it until you get Magicbane, which will make your early game a lot easier.\n</p><p>The Mines are dangerous. Unless you are a gnome, all the normal inhabitants will want to kill you. It can be quite hard for inexperienced players to go straight to Minetown and survive long enough to return to the main dungeon. Exploring the deeper Mines past Minetown should perhaps be postponed, though you do eventually want to get there, as the <a href=\"/wiki/Catacombs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Catacombs\">Catacombs</a> can be very profitable for a Wizard. \n</p><p>Completing Sokoban before doing anything else is likewise dangerous, because monsters difficulty increases with each completed puzzle, and your own experience level will probably not keep up with it.\n</p><p>Consider going down to the Oracle level and breaking the centaur statues there in search of spare spellbooks, gaining a few levels in the process, then coming back up to do the Gnomish Mines.\n</p><p>Hunger may become an issue, especially if you do not start the game with Intelligence of 17 or above for hungerless casting. You may need to pray for food when weak, and the first floor of Sokoban with its guaranteed food might be a good place to go to stock up.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapons\">Weapons</span></h4>\n<p>Early-game Wizards are very weak and should avoid engaging in melee combat with monsters. Finding a source of thrown weapons to damage or kill monsters before they can reach you is critical. \n</p><p>Most Wizards pursue <a href=\"/wiki/Dagger\" title=\"Dagger\">daggers</a> as their sole weapon skill, because it is easy for them to get Magicbane (which uses the dagger skill), and because throwing daggers at Expert skill later in the game does considerably more damage than using a <a href=\"/wiki/Quarterstaff\" title=\"Quarterstaff\">quarterstaff</a>. To that end, training daggers as soon as you come across some is a good idea. Easy ways to train daggers include throwing them at slow enemies, letting a <a href=\"/wiki/Fog_cloud\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fog cloud\">fog cloud</a> engulf you, or naming <a href=\"/wiki/Sting\" title=\"Sting\">Sting</a> and training it on goblins for the +d5 to-hit bonus. Descending briefly into the <a href=\"/wiki/Gnomish_Mines\" title=\"Gnomish Mines\">Gnomish Mines</a>, where daggers are plentiful, is a good way to acquire some.\n</p><p>In the very early game, daggers may still be hard to come by, so consider casting <a href=\"/wiki/Force_bolt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Force bolt\">force bolt</a> at a <a href=\"/wiki/Boulder\" title=\"Boulder\">boulder</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Statue\" title=\"Statue\">statue</a>, picking up the resulting <a href=\"/wiki/Stone\" title=\"Stone\">stones</a> (as many as can be carried while staying unburdened), and <a href=\"/wiki/Quiver\" title=\"Quiver\">quivering</a> them. Throwing rocks at a monster is better than nothing, especially if you're out of power. Of course, you should replace them with <a href=\"/wiki/Dart\" title=\"Dart\">darts</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Dagger\" title=\"Dagger\">daggers</a>, or other missiles as they become available.\n</p><p>Some players advocate dumping the starting quarterstaff early on, either as soon as you find a non-cursed <a href=\"/wiki/Dagger\" title=\"Dagger\">dagger</a> or you reach Basic skill in daggers. There is little reason to keep the staff after this point unless you plan to wish for <a href=\"/wiki/The_Staff_of_Aesculapius\" title=\"The Staff of Aesculapius\">The Staff of Aesculapius</a>, in which case you should continue training quarterstaff skill. The Staff of Aesculapius has become a more viable choice with the advent of the #<a href=\"/wiki/Tip\" title=\"Tip\">tip</a> command in <a href=\"/wiki/Nethack_3.6.0\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nethack 3.6.0\">Nethack 3.6.0</a>, as you can now access the means to uncurse it in the unlikely event it should become cursed while you are wielding it. In addition to having good damage, it provides hungerless <a href=\"/wiki/Regeneration\" title=\"Regeneration\">regeneration</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Drain_resistance\" title=\"Drain resistance\">drain resistance</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spellcasting_2\">Spellcasting</span></h4>\n<p>Players disagree on whether Wizards should wear high-AC metal armor and focus on melee skills, or ignore all metal armor in favor of being able to use spells in combat. Wearing metal is fine if it doesn't encumber you and you're confident in your ability to survive without relying on magic. Not wearing it is fine if you're prepared to flee from monsters when you run low on energy. If you do choose to wear metal, you should plan to swap it out later for nonmetal armor as that gradually becomes available.\n</p><p>Save your energy for when you really need it. You won't be able to cast force bolt more than a few times until you gain a few levels. \n</p><p>Read any non-cursed spellbook as soon as you find it. You will always get a warning if there's a chance of failing to read it, and if you do, it's likely to be too high level to be of much use right now.\n</p><p>If you start with a <a href=\"/wiki/Wand_of_polymorph\" title=\"Wand of polymorph\">wand of polymorph</a>, you may consider polymorphing your starting spellbooks. Your force bolt book, since it is blessed, will polymorph into another blessed book that can thus be read with a 100% success rate. However, this can be done only once or twice before the spellbook becomes too faint to read. You can also polymorph your starting pet at the same time, often ending up with something much stronger for an early pet (though this risks killing it).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mid_game\">Mid game</span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives_2\">Objectives</span></h4>\n<p>Raising your <a href=\"/wiki/Luck\" title=\"Luck\">Luck</a> and maintaining it should be a priority. Finish the Mines and Sokoban when you feel ready.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard_quest\" title=\"Wizard quest\">Wizard quest</a> is fairly easy, the <a href=\"/wiki/Dark_One\" title=\"Dark One\">Dark One</a> is a pushover, and the reward&#8212;<a href=\"/wiki/The_Eye_of_the_Aethiopica\" title=\"The Eye of the Aethiopica\">the Eye of the Aethiopica</a>&#8212;is so fantastically useful that a Wizard should probably go on the quest as soon as possible. One of the many things the Eye does is vastly enhance strategic mobility through the Mazes of Menace&#8212;in particular, you can get out of trouble in an instant. Many Wizards set up a base camp in <a href=\"/wiki/Sokoban\" title=\"Sokoban\">Sokoban</a> and leave most of their worldly possessions there, going back whenever they need to read a spellbook or pick up more food. Adjacent monsters may follow you through the Eye's magical portal, but this also has its uses, such as luring <a href=\"/wiki/Wraith\" title=\"Wraith\">wraiths</a> out of a <a href=\"/wiki/Graveyard\" title=\"Graveyard\">graveyard</a> level.\n</p><p>If you have found the quest portal, but are not yet level 14, be aware that the first level of the quest, the Lonely Tower, is often well-provided with wraiths. You may be able to gain a few levels and reach XL 14 before you meet your quest leader.\n</p><p>For Wizards with the Eye and the magic missile and create monster spells, <a href=\"/wiki/Farming#Altar_scumming\" title=\"Farming\">altar farming</a> is incredibly easy, since an arbitrary number of corpses for sacrifice can be created on demand. This is good for increasing your Luck or obtaining more sacrifice gifts and favors. If you decide to get <a href=\"/wiki/Crowned\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crowned\">crowned</a>, you will receive a <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_finger_of_death\" title=\"Spellbook of finger of death\">spellbook of finger of death</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapons_2\">Weapons</span></h4>\n<p>You can and should train daggers to Expert skill. Although Wizards don't get the <a href=\"/wiki/Multishot\" title=\"Multishot\">multishot</a> bonus at Skilled as of <a href=\"/wiki/NetHack_3.6.0\" title=\"NetHack 3.6.0\">NetHack 3.6.0</a>, throwing two daggers in a single turn is still powerful, so it is recommended to acquire a good number of daggers that stack together. <a href=\"/wiki/Elven_dagger\" title=\"Elven dagger\">Elven daggers</a> are especially useful.\n</p><p>Acquire Magicbane at this stage, unless you have some reason not to.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spellcasting_3\">Spellcasting</span></h4>\n<p>If you have come across a <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_marker\" title=\"Magic marker\">magic marker</a>, you can blank other spellbooks and write useful ones like <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_magic_missile\" title=\"Spellbook of magic missile\">magic missile</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_identify\" title=\"Spellbook of identify\">identify</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_polymorph\" title=\"Spellbook of polymorph\">polymorph</a>.\n</p><p>Since so many monsters are resistant to one or more forms of magical attack, you will need to build a diverse toolkit. A fire-resistant opponent may be especially vulnerable to cold attacks; an opponent with <a href=\"/wiki/Reflection\" title=\"Reflection\">reflection</a> can probably be brought down by splash effects from a <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_fireball\" title=\"Spellbook of fireball\">fireball</a>. Reading the wiki entries for new opponents to learn their immunities and weaknesses is a good idea. Ultimately, nothing has \"stab resistance\"&#8212;even <a href=\"/wiki/Shade\" title=\"Shade\">shades</a> will succumb to an enchanted or silver weapon&#8212;so a Wizard should always have a good physical combat option to fall back on. Still, spells are generally the most powerful means of attack by this point in the game.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Late_game\">Late game</span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives_3\">Objectives</span></h4>\n<p>Some players prefer to raise their experience level as high as possible in order to have the largest maximum HP and energy, and to maximize damage from casting magic missile. A level 30 Wizard gets 16d6 damage with each magic missile. Luring wraiths out of the Valley of the Dead and other graveyards will probably be required to reach this level. Remember to buy all the <a href=\"/wiki/Divine_protection\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Divine protection\">divine protection</a> you want before trying to level up.\n</p><p>Other players like to keep their experience level low, to keep higher-difficulty monsters from being generated. Ultimately, the choice is up to you.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapons_3\">Weapons</span></h4>\n<p>Magicbane remains an excellent weapon. With its magic resistance and ability to catch curses, you can fight powerful spellcasters like <a href=\"/wiki/Arch-lich\" title=\"Arch-lich\">arch-liches</a> head-on. Opinions vary as to whether you should enchant it to +7 or keep it at +2; see <a href=\"/wiki/Magicbane#Enchanting\" title=\"Magicbane\">Magicbane#Enchanting</a> for details.\n</p><p>Other weapons such as <a href=\"/wiki/Frost_Brand\" title=\"Frost Brand\">Frost Brand</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Stormbringer\" title=\"Stormbringer\">Stormbringer</a>, or The Staff of Aesculapius are good options that do significantly more damage than Magicbane. Note that the Staff of Aesculapius will not deal double damage to major <a href=\"/wiki/Demons\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Demons\">demons</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Undead\" title=\"Undead\">undead</a>, so it is best paired with high-level spells like <a href=\"/wiki/Cone_of_cold\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cone of cold\">cone of cold</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_missile\" title=\"Magic missile\">magic missile</a> (as well as <a href=\"/wiki/Fireball\" title=\"Fireball\">fireball</a> if you haven't genocided <a href=\"/wiki/Lich_(monster_class)\" title=\"Lich (monster class)\">liches</a>) along with other ranged damage options to handle these enemies in <a href=\"/wiki/Gehennom\" title=\"Gehennom\">Gehennom</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spellcasting_4\">Spellcasting</span></h4>\n<p>You should definitely have the <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_finger_of_death\" title=\"Spellbook of finger of death\">finger of death</a> spell in your repertoire by now. Save charges on your wands of death for when you really need them; e.g. when facing the <a href=\"/wiki/Riders\" title=\"Riders\">Riders</a> on the Astral Plane.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Helm_of_brilliance\" title=\"Helm of brilliance\">helm of brilliance</a> while not necessary, can be useful for reducing spell failure rates of difficult spells, or giving less capable wizards the benefit of <a href=\"/wiki/Hungerless_casting\" title=\"Hungerless casting\">hungerless casting</a>.\n</p><p>Getting a source of <a href=\"/wiki/Confusion\" title=\"Confusion\">confusion</a> for the Planes should be easy, since you probably have at least one useless forgotten spell like <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_cure_blindness\" title=\"Spellbook of cure blindness\">cure blindness</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_restore_ability\" title=\"Spellbook of restore ability\">restore ability</a>.\n</p><p>Casting spells when you have the <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor\" title=\"Amulet of Yendor\">Amulet of Yendor</a> can drain your power very fast. You can drop it on the ground when you need to cast a lot of spells without moving. Also, consider stocking up on a few <a href=\"/wiki/Scroll_of_charging\" title=\"Scroll of charging\">scrolls of charging</a> and reading them when confused to restore all your energy immediately.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rank_titles\">Rank titles</span></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Status_line\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Status line\">status line</a> shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\n</p>\n<ul><li>XL 1–2: Evoker</li>\n<li>XL 3–5: Conjurer</li>\n<li>XL 6–9: Thaumaturge</li>\n<li>XL 10–13: Magician</li>\n<li>XL 14–17: Enchanter/Enchantress</li>\n<li>XL 18–21: Sorcerer/Sorceress</li>\n<li>XL 22–25: Necromancer</li>\n<li>XL 26–29: Wizard</li>\n<li>XL 30: Mage</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Quest\">Quest</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><div class=\"noprint relarticle mainarticle\"><i>Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard_quest\" title=\"Wizard quest\">Wizard quest</a></i></div></dd></dl>\n<p>The Wizard quest sees you fighting the <a href=\"/wiki/Dark_One\" title=\"Dark One\">Dark One</a> for <a href=\"/wiki/The_Eye_of_the_Aethiopica\" title=\"The Eye of the Aethiopica\">the Eye of the Aethiopica</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Variants\">Variants</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"SLASH'EM\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"SLASH.27EM\">SLASH'EM</span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/SLASH%27EM\" title=\"SLASH&#39;EM\">SLASH'EM</a>, Wizards start with four spellbooks, with one book chosen randomly from each of:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_force_bolt\" title=\"Spellbook of force bolt\">force bolt</a>&#32;or <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_sleep\" title=\"Spellbook of sleep\">sleep</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_resist_poison\" title=\"Spellbook of resist poison\">resist poison</a>&#32;or <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_resist_sleep\" title=\"Spellbook of resist sleep\">resist sleep</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_detect_food\" title=\"Spellbook of detect food\">detect food</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_detect_monsters\" title=\"Spellbook of detect monsters\">detect monsters</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_light\" title=\"Spellbook of light\">light</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_knock\" title=\"Spellbook of knock\">knock</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_wizard_lock\" title=\"Spellbook of wizard lock\">wizard lock</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_magic_missile\" title=\"Spellbook of magic missile\">magic missile</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_confuse_monster\" title=\"Spellbook of confuse monster\">confuse monster</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_slow_monster\" title=\"Spellbook of slow monster\">slow monster</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_cure_blindness\" title=\"Spellbook of cure blindness\">cure blindness</a>,  <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_endure_heat\" title=\"Spellbook of endure heat\">endure heat</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_endure_cold\" title=\"Spellbook of endure cold\">endure cold</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_insulate\" title=\"Spellbook of insulate\">insulate</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_create_monster\" title=\"Spellbook of create monster\">create monster</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Spellbook_of_healing\" title=\"Spellbook of healing\">healing</a></li></ul>\n<p>SLASH'EM adds the rank titles Warlock/Witch (XL&#160;14–17), bumps Enchanter/Enchantress to XL&#160;18–21, Sorcerer/Sorceress to XL&#160;22–25, and removes the rank title of Necromancer (presumably, to avoid confusion with the new <a href=\"/wiki/Necromancer\" title=\"Necromancer\">Necromancer</a> role).\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Strategy_2\">Strategy</span></h4>\n<p>Wizards in SLASH'EM are a bit more difficult then in vanilla. In vanilla, once you get <a href=\"/wiki/Magicbane\" title=\"Magicbane\">Magicbane</a> you are likely to be on the road to ascension. Here, you had better stay sharp even after you get Magicbane. Keep your pet around you for longer. A good advice would be to stay careful and keep your pet until your AC is below &#8722;10 and your level is above 10.\n</p><p>An additional difficulty is that you don't have enough slots for all the extrinsics you would want. <a href=\"/wiki/Dragon_scale_mail\" title=\"Dragon scale mail\">Dragon scale mail</a> interferes with spellcasting now and generally isn't worth having in your <a href=\"/wiki/Ascension_kit\" title=\"Ascension kit\">ascension kit</a>.

(character class)}}\n{{otheruses|the player role}}\n\nThe '''Wizard''' is one of the [[role]]s in ''NetHack''. Wizards can be either [[neutral]] or [[chaotic]], and can be [[Human (starting race)|humans]], [[elf (starting race)|elves]], [[Gnome (starting race)|gnomes]] or [[Orc (starting race)|orcs]]. Their first [[Sacrifice#Gifts|sacrifice gift]] is [[Magicbane]]. They are relatively poor fighters, but are arguably the best [[spellcaster]]s in the game. The [[guidebook]] says of them:\n\n{{guidebook|Wizards start out with a knowledge of magic, a selection of magical items, and a particular affinity for dweomercraft. Although seemingly weak and easy to overcome at first sight, an experienced Wizard is a deadly foe.}}\n\n==Starting equipment==\nA wizard begins the game with:{{reffunc|u_init.c|Wizard initial inventory|nethack=3.6.0}}\n* a [[blessed]] [[enchantment|+1]] [[quarterstaff]]\n* a [[cloak of magic resistance]]\n* three random [[scroll]]s\n* a blessed [[spellbook of force bolt]]\n* a random non-force bolt [[spellbook]] of level 3 or lower {{refsrc|src/u_init.c|1027|nethack=3.6.0}}\n*three random [[potion]]s\n* two random [[ring]]s\n* one random [[wand]]\n* if an [[Elf (starting race)|elf]], random non-magical [[musical instrument]]{{reffunc|u_init.c|Elf initializations|nethack=3.6.0}}\n* 20% chance of [[magic marker]]{{reffunc|u_init.c|Wizard initializations|nethack=3.6.0}}\n* 20% chance of [[blindfold]]\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|As of {{commit|9d910773d0a5421a259a228f638f87a04ef2d7a0}}, the magic marker has a 100% chance, and it starts with with 19&ndash;23 charges.}}\n\nThe random items generated will <em>never</em> be any of the following:{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|1007|nethack=3.6.0}}\n* [[scroll of amnesia]]\n* [[scroll of blank paper]]\n* [[scroll of fire]]\n* [[spellbook of blank paper]]\n* [[potion of acid]]\n* [[potion of hallucination]]\n* any ring with an enchantment of +0 or lower{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|1036|nethack=3.6.0}}\n* [[ring of aggravate monster]]\n* [[ring of hunger]]\n* [[ring of levitation]]\n* [[ring of poison resistance]] if an [[orc (starting race)|orc]]\n* [[ring of polymorph control]] ''if'' you already have a [[wand of polymorph|wand]], [[ring of polymorph|ring]], or [[potion of polymorph|potion]] of polymorph\n* ring or potion of polymorph ''if'' you already have a ring of polymorph control\n* [[wand of nothing]]\n* [[wand of wishing]]\n\n==Intrinsics==\n*Level 15: [[warning]]\n*Level 17: [[teleport control]]\n\n==Skills==\n{{Wizard skill table}}\nWizards start always with ''Basic'' [[skill]] in [[quarterstaff]], [[attack spells]], and [[enchantment spells]]. This is independent of the category of the random spellbook, because the spellcasting skills are hardcoded in the function ''skill_init'' in [[weapon.c]].\n\n==Special rules==\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|As of {{commit|319dfbdaa3e608e88e39e0a296a9c41febfc1a59}}, wizards learn the appearances of spellbooks as they gain skill in the relevant spell schools, and start out with knowledge of all level-1 spellbooks.  Also, they no longer have an advantage when writing unknown spellbooks (but still have an advantage when writing scrolls).}}\n\n===Spellcasting===\n\nWizards with an intelligence of 15 or 16 have [[reduced-hunger casting]], and Wizards with an intelligence of 17 or above have hungerless casting.\n\nWizards have no bonus or penalty for [[emergency spell]]s, but their special spell is {{spell of|magic missile}}, which is probably the most useful special spell among the spellcasting roles.\n\nWizards regain [[energy]] more often than other roles.\n\n===Reading and writing===\n\nWizards can write scrolls and spellbooks they don't know yet with [[Magic marker#Unknown scrolls and spellbooks|much higher success rates]] than other roles. With maximized Luck, writing one is nearly a certainty.\n\nWizards get a warning when they have a chance of failing to read an uncursed spellbook: \"This spellbook is [very] difficult to comprehend. Continue?\"\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n[[Cornuthaum]]s give Wizards a [[charisma]] boost and [[clairvoyance]], and only Wizards can safely enchant them from up to +5.\n\nWizards cannot [[multishot|fire multiple projectiles at once]] unless they are Expert at the relevant weapon skill, and do not gain a multishot bonus for their racial [[launcher]].\n\nWizards with [[teleportitis]] can teleport at will at experience level 8 or higher, rather than 12 as with other roles. Wizards also spend less time as a [[beginner]] than other roles.\n\n==Strategy==\n=== Character creation ===\nAmong all roles, Wizards have the greatest variation in their starting items. Some players like to \"start scum\", quitting and rolling new Wizards repeatedly until they start with desirable items and spells.\n\n* Humans make the hardiest Wizards with their relatively high [[HP]] growth; their [[energy]] growth is competitive as well. On the downside, their lack of [[infravision]] makes it somewhat difficult to target spells at distant monsters until they obtain a source of [[warning]] or [[telepathy]] (usually via [[ring of warning]] or [[floating eye]]).\n* A gnomish Wizard will face a relatively peaceful [[Mines]]; although Wizards generally want to solve [[Sokoban]] first for the guaranteed food and [[strength]] training, they should still tackle the Mines at some point for access to [[Minetown]] and the guaranteed [[luckstone]]. Their higher maximum [[intelligence]] and bonus to energy growth are obvious advantages, but their hit points are mediocre.\n* Orcs are crippled by their penalties to HP and energy growth. Unlike other orcs, orcish Wizards start with no bonus food; their maximum intelligence makes uncursed [[spellbook]]s slightly riskier to read, and requires a [[helm of brilliance]] for hungerless casting. With that in mind, 16 intelligence is still enough for 100% reliable spellcasting, and they also gain modest benefits from [[poison resistance]]. While Wizards are generally frail enough that they should worry more about death from HP than a poison [[instadeath]], their low intelligence cap tends to distribute more points towards their physical stats, making them somewhat better at early-game combat than gnomes and elves - just how much varies greatly between individual characters.\n* Elves have the highest energy growth of any race, but due to their low maximum [[constitution]], their HP tends to lag far behind other races. If they're lucky enough to start with the maximum 20 intelligence, they'll have a relatively easy time reading new spellbooks, although this comes at the expense of their other attributes. Their maximum natural strength and constitution aren't enough to reach maximum [[encumbrance]], and [[gauntlets of power]] might not be a viable option due to their spellcasting penalty.\n\nChaotic characters have the usual benefit of a less malicious [[mysterious force]], although since they can acquire [[teleport control]] by leveling up, they can recover relatively easily from being sent down in Gehennom. Chaotic gods grant more prayer timeout reduction from [[sacrifice]], which is a boon to a Wizard who wants to altar farm for spellbooks. Being neutral is of relatively little benefit to a Wizard unless they want to wish for a specific [[quest artifact]].\n\n=== Skill slot management ===\nIt takes 6 [[skill]] slots to reach Expert in [[dagger]]s, and 20 slots to max out all the spellcasting skills. This means that a level 30 Wizard who chooses to enhance all spellcasting skills to maximum should have 3 slots free to spend on other skills, such as unrestricted [[artifact weapon]] skills.\n\nAs part of skill slot management, a Wizard should defer enhancing any spell skill until there comes a point when doing so would provide an in-game benefit. The benefits from enhancing a spell skill are that it lowers spell failure rates, and (depending on the spell) sometimes augments the effects of a spell. When advancing spell skills, it is a good idea to check which spells you have in each school, and make sure that at least one of your spells would benefit from being enhanced, before using up the skill slot.\n\nIt is important to note that a great many spells enjoy augmented effects when advancing from Basic to Skilled (notably, {{spellbook of|fireball|cone of cold|remove curse|and=1|detect monsters}}), but only two spells enjoy augmented effects when going from Skilled to Expert (namely, {{spellbook of|jumping|and=1|protection}}), and of these two, Wizards can only become Expert in jumping. Therefore, for spells other than [[escape spells]], a Wizard gains no benefit from advancing to Expert unless there is a currently known high level spell (e.g. {{spellbook of|finger of death|cancellation|or=1|polymorph}}) whose failure rate would be lowered by such advancement.\n\nIn particular, there is almost never any need to advance [[divination spells]] to Expert, since all divination spells have the same effects at Skilled as at Expert, and none of the divination spells are of very high spell level. The Skilled casting effects of [[enchantment spells]] and [[healing spells]] may also not be worth the skill slots. The skill slots saved thereby are valuable to have available for weapons, especially early in the game.\n\n{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Once you no longer need to throw daggers, a [[scroll of amnesia]] may reset your dagger skill, freeing those slots to be spent on spell skills. You may also forget spells and spell skills, but you can relearn your spells from your books and retrain your skills quickly with the energy regeneration from the Eye.}}\n\n===Early game===\n====Objectives====\nSome people advocate deliberately keeping your [[experience level]] low in the early game, but this is controversial. Increases in [[monster difficulty]] due to a higher experience levels are roughly balanced out with the spellcasting benefits of a higher experience level, such as higher maximum [[power]]. The easiest way to prevent yourself from over-leveling is to allow your pet to kill as many monsters as is feasible, although one would be wise to still gain a few levels for the additional survivability and spell power capacity. These constraints are loosened when you learn [[magic missile]], get [[Magicbane]], or obtain some other offensive upgrade.\n\nUnless you are playing an [[atheist]], if you manage to find an early coaligned altar, consider sacrificing at it until you get Magicbane, which will make your early game a lot easier.\n\nThe Mines are dangerous. Unless you are a gnome, all the normal inhabitants will want to kill you. It can be quite hard for inexperienced players to go straight to Minetown and survive long enough to return to the main dungeon. Exploring the deeper Mines past Minetown should perhaps be postponed, though you do eventually want to get there, as the [[Catacombs]] can be very profitable for a Wizard. \n\nCompleting Sokoban before doing anything else is likewise dangerous, because monsters difficulty increases with each completed puzzle, and your own experience level will probably not keep up with it.\n\nConsider going down to the Oracle level and breaking the centaur statues there in search of spare spellbooks, gaining a few levels in the process, then coming back up to do the Gnomish Mines.\n\nHunger may become an issue, especially if you do not start the game with Intelligence of 17 or above for hungerless casting. You may need to pray for food when weak, and the first floor of Sokoban with its guaranteed food might be a good place to go to stock up.\n\n====Weapons====\nEarly-game Wizards are very weak and should avoid engaging in melee combat with monsters. Finding a source of thrown weapons to damage or kill monsters before they can reach you is critical. \n\nMost Wizards pursue [[dagger]]s as their sole weapon skill, because it is easy for them to get Magicbane (which uses the dagger skill), and because throwing daggers at Expert skill later in the game does considerably more damage than using a [[quarterstaff]]. To that end, training daggers as soon as you come across some is a good idea. Easy ways to train daggers include throwing them at slow enemies, letting a [[fog cloud]] engulf you, or naming [[Sting]] and training it on goblins for the +d5 to-hit bonus. Descending briefly into the [[Gnomish Mines]], where daggers are plentiful, is a good way to acquire some.\n\nIn the very early game, daggers may still be hard to come by, so consider casting [[force bolt]] at a [[boulder]] or [[statue]], picking up the resulting [[stone]]s (as many as can be carried while staying unburdened), and [[quiver]]ing them. Throwing rocks at a monster is better than nothing, especially if you're out of power. Of course, you should replace them with [[dart]]s, [[dagger]]s, or other missiles as they become available.\n\nSome players advocate dumping the starting quarterstaff early on, either as soon as you find a non-cursed [[dagger]] or you reach Basic skill in daggers. There is little reason to keep the staff after this point unless you plan to wish for [[The Staff of Aesculapius]], in which case you should continue training quarterstaff skill. The Staff of Aesculapius has become a more viable choice with the advent of the #[[tip]] command in [[Nethack 3.6.0]], as you can now access the means to uncurse it in the unlikely event it should become cursed while you are wielding it. In addition to having good damage, it provides hungerless [[regeneration]] and [[drain resistance]].\n\n====Spellcasting====\nPlayers disagree on whether Wizards should wear high-AC metal armor and focus on melee skills, or ignore all metal armor in favor of being able to use spells in combat. Wearing metal is fine if it doesn't encumber you and you're confident in your ability to survive without relying on magic. Not wearing it is fine if you're prepared to flee from monsters when you run low on energy. If you do choose to wear metal, you should plan to swap it out later for nonmetal armor as that gradually becomes available.\n\nSave your energy for when you really need it. You won't be able to cast force bolt more than a few times until you gain a few levels. \n\nRead any non-cursed spellbook as soon as you find it. You will always get a warning if there's a chance of failing to read it, and if you do, it's likely to be too high level to be of much use right now.\n\nIf you start with a [[wand of polymorph]], you may consider polymorphing your starting spellbooks. Your force bolt book, since it is blessed, will polymorph into another blessed book that can thus be read with a 100% success rate. However, this can be done only once or twice before the spellbook becomes too faint to read. You can also polymorph your starting pet at the same time, often ending up with something much stronger for an early pet (though this risks killing it).\n\n===Mid game===\n====Objectives====\nRaising your [[Luck]] and maintaining it should be a priority. Finish the Mines and Sokoban when you feel ready.\n\nThe [[Wizard quest]] is fairly easy, the [[Dark One]] is a pushover, and the reward&mdash;[[the Eye of the Aethiopica]]&mdash;is so fantastically useful that a Wizard should probably go on the quest as soon as possible. One of the many things the Eye does is vastly enhance strategic mobility through the Mazes of Menace&mdash;in particular, you can get out of trouble in an instant. Many Wizards set up a base camp in [[Sokoban]] and leave most of their worldly possessions there, going back whenever they need to read a spellbook or pick up more food. Adjacent monsters may follow you through the Eye's magical portal, but this also has its uses, such as luring [[wraith]]s out of a [[graveyard]] level.\n\nIf you have found the quest portal, but are not yet level 14, be aware that the first level of the quest, the Lonely Tower, is often well-provided with wraiths. You may be able to gain a few levels and reach XL 14 before you meet your quest leader.\n\nFor Wizards with the Eye and the magic missile and create monster spells, [[Farming#Altar scumming|altar farming]] is incredibly easy, since an arbitrary number of corpses for sacrifice can be created on demand. This is good for increasing your Luck or obtaining more sacrifice gifts and favors. If you decide to get [[crowned]], you will receive a [[spellbook of finger of death]].\n\n====Weapons====\nYou can and should train daggers to Expert skill. Although Wizards don't get the [[multishot]] bonus at Skilled as of [[NetHack 3.6.0]], throwing two daggers in a single turn is still powerful, so it is recommended to acquire a good number of daggers that stack together. [[Elven dagger]]s are especially useful.\n\nAcquire Magicbane at this stage, unless you have some reason not to.\n\n====Spellcasting====\nIf you have come across a [[magic marker]], you can blank other spellbooks and write useful ones like {{spell of|magic missile}}, {{spell of|identify}}, or {{spell of|polymorph}}.\n\nSince so many monsters are resistant to one or more forms of magical attack, you will need to build a diverse toolkit. A fire-resistant opponent may be especially vulnerable to cold attacks; an opponent with [[reflection]] can probably be brought down by splash effects from a {{spell of|fireball}}. Reading the wiki entries for new opponents to learn their immunities and weaknesses is a good idea. Ultimately, nothing has \"stab resistance\"&mdash;even [[shade]]s will succumb to an enchanted or silver weapon&mdash;so a Wizard should always have a good physical combat option to fall back on. Still, spells are generally the most powerful means of attack by this point in the game.\n\n===Late game===\n====Objectives====\nSome players prefer to raise their experience level as high as possible in order to have the largest maximum HP and energy, and to maximize damage from casting magic missile. A level 30 Wizard gets 16d6 damage with each magic missile. Luring wraiths out of the Valley of the Dead and other graveyards will probably be required to reach this level. Remember to buy all the [[divine protection]] you want before trying to level up.\n\nOther players like to keep their experience level low, to keep higher-difficulty monsters from being generated. Ultimately, the choice is up to you.\n\n====Weapons====\nMagicbane remains an excellent weapon. With its magic resistance and ability to catch curses, you can fight powerful spellcasters like [[arch-lich]]es head-on. Opinions vary as to whether you should enchant it to +7 or keep it at +2; see [[Magicbane#Enchanting]] for details.\n\nOther weapons such as [[Frost Brand]], [[Stormbringer]], or The Staff of Aesculapius are good options that do significantly more damage than Magicbane. Note that the Staff of Aesculapius will not deal double damage to major [[demons]] or [[undead]], so it is best paired with high-level spells like [[cone of cold]] and [[magic missile]] (as well as [[fireball]] if you haven't genocided [[Lich (monster class)|liches]]) along with other ranged damage options to handle these enemies in [[Gehennom]].\n\n====Spellcasting====\nYou should definitely have the {{spell of|finger of death}} spell in your repertoire by now. Save charges on your wands of death for when you really need them; e.g. when facing the [[Riders]] on the Astral Plane.\n\nThe [[helm of brilliance]] while not necessary, can be useful for reducing spell failure rates of difficult spells, or giving less capable wizards the benefit of [[hungerless casting]].\n\nGetting a source of [[confusion]] for the Planes should be easy, since you probably have at least one useless forgotten spell like {{spell of|cure blindness}} or {{spell of|restore ability}}.\n\nCasting spells when you have the [[Amulet of Yendor]] can drain your power very fast. You can drop it on the ground when you need to cast a lot of spells without moving. Also, consider stocking up on a few [[scroll of charging|scrolls of charging]] and reading them when confused to restore all your energy immediately.\n\n==Rank titles==\n\nThe [[status line]] shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\n\n*XL 1–2: Evoker\n*XL 3–5: Conjurer\n*XL 6–9: Thaumaturge\n*XL 10–13: Magician\n*XL 14–17: Enchanter/Enchantress\n*XL 18–21: Sorcerer/Sorceress\n*XL 22–25: Necromancer\n*XL 26–29: Wizard\n*XL 30: Mage\n\n==Quest==\n{{main|Wizard quest}}\n\nThe Wizard quest sees you fighting the [[Dark One]] for [[the Eye of the Aethiopica]].\n\n==Variants==\n\n===SLASH'EM===\nIn [[SLASH'EM]], Wizards start with four spellbooks, with one book chosen randomly from each of:\n* {{spellbook of|force bolt|or=1|sleep}}\n* {{spellbook of|resist poison|or=1|resist sleep}}\n* {{spellbook of|detect food|detect monsters|light|knock|or=1|wizard lock}}\n* {{spellbook of|magic missile|confuse monster|slow monster|cure blindness|endure heat}}, {{spellbook of|endure cold|insulate|create monster|or=1|healing}}\n\nSLASH'EM adds the rank titles Warlock/Witch (XL 14–17), bumps Enchanter/Enchantress to XL 18–21, Sorcerer/Sorceress to XL 22–25, and removes the rank title of Necromancer (presumably, to avoid confusion with the new [[Necromancer]] role).\n\n====Strategy====\n\nWizards in SLASH'EM are a bit more difficult then in vanilla. In vanilla, once you get [[Magicbane]] you are likely to be on the road to ascension. Here, you had better stay sharp even after you get Magicbane. Keep your pet around you for longer. A good advice would be to stay careful and keep your pet until your AC is below &minus;10 and your level is above 10.\n\nAn additional difficulty is that you don't have enough slots for all the extrinsics you would want. [[Dragon scale mail]] interferes with spellcasting now and generally isn't worth having in your [[ascension kit]]. In addition, you have to deal with the [[create pool]] spell and more serious [[level drain]] attacks.\n\nSome possible equipment choices:\n\n*[[Water walking boots]]: You need these to deal with [[create pool]] spells. You can use {{spell of|haste self}} as a substitute to [[speed boots]]. The amulet slot is already crowded for other things, so no [[amulet of flying]] for you.\n*[[Ring of levitation]] with [[speed boots]]: With the ring, you are vulnerable to [[electric bug]]s. If you use this, you might want to blessed-genocide <code>x</code> to be safe, and this is no joke. The {{spell of|levitation}} spell is dangerously unreliable (unless Skilled or better in escape spells).\n*[[Robe of protection]]: The highest natural AC for the body armor slot without spellcasting interference. It can be [[upgrade]]d from plain [[Robe (SLASH'EM)|robe]]s with 50% chance. The [[robe of power]] is useless for a Wizard, unless you are wearing metallic armor. Robes take the body armor slot here, so you can't attempt to wear a [[robe of power]] on top of dragon scale mail.\n*Amulet of {{amulet of|reflection|or=1|drain resistance}}: You'll need to give up on the amulet of {{amulet of|flying|and=1|life saving}}.\n*Wielding [[The Hand of Vecna (SLASH'EM)|The Hand of Vecna]]: It confers [[drain resistance]]. You can rely on the {{spell of|remove curse}} spell for the curses. Be careful of the blast if you are neutral.\n*Wielding [[Stormbringer]] if chaotic for [[drain resistance]]. You can obtain Stormbringer easily by [[crowning]] <em>while carrying</em> a [[spellbook of finger of death]]; this will also unrestrict broadsword skill. Without already carrying finger of death spellbook, you'll get that instead.\n*Wielding [[Nighthorn]]: It confers reflection, but it is two-handed, so if it gets cursed, you can't cast spells anymore. Also, being lawful, it will blast you for sure.\n*Depending on your situation, you could forgo reflection or drain resistance, but this is risky.\n\nBad ideas:\n\n*Wielding [[the Staff of Aesculapius]]: It doesn't confer drain resistance in SLASH'EM. Because it is two-handed, you can't cast spells if it gets cursed.\n* Wearing a [[shield of reflection]]: Your success rate will not be higher than 55% for {{spell of|magic missile}} and 25% for anything else.\n\nNice wishes:\n\n[[The Wallet of Perseus]] can help overcome the role's initial low carrying capacity without wearing [[gauntlets of power]].\n\n===SporkHack===\nIn [[SporkHack]], Wizards start with a [[spellbook of protection]] and a [[cloak of protection]] instead of a cloak of magic resistance.\n\n===xNetHack===\nIn [[xNetHack]], energy regeneration is increased by 0.33 per turn if the player is a Wizard. They start with four spellbooks ({{spellbook of|force bolt|magic missile}}, and two random ones), but no potions, scrolls, rings, or wand.\n\n===FIQHack===\n\nIn [[FIQHack]], Wizards no longer get scrolls, potions, or rings as starting inventory. The only starting wand is the [[wand of striking]]. However, Wizards also start with 4 spells (force bolt, magic missile, and 2 random).\n\nSimilar to xNetHack, energy regeneration is increased by 0.33 per turn for Wizards.\n\n[[Hungerless casting]] no longer exists.\n\n==Encyclopedia entry==\n\n{{encyclopedia|\nEbenezum walked before me along the closest thing we could\nfind to a path in these overgrown woods.

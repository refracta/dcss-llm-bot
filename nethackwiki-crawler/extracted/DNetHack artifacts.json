Wishable artifacts include those artifacts that can be given as divine gifts, including the vanilla crowning gifts but excluding new crowning gifts. Non-wishable artifacts include any [quest artifacts](/wiki/Category:DNethack_Quests \"Category:DNethack Quests\"), as well as any first gifts for race-specific role/race combinations (dwarf noble, drow shared, etc.). Artifacts belonging to late-game enemies like demon or devil lords are unwishable, as are any found on alignment quests.\n\nRandomly found artifacts do not affect the odds of gifted or wished artifacts later. For the rules for wishing for artifacts, see [dNetHack artifact wishing](/wiki/DNetHack_artifact_wishing \"DNetHack artifact wishing\").

These explosions deal (1d12+enchantment), for a total of 3d12 + 3\\*enchantment on the target at the chosen direction.\n  - When invoked downwards, causes 3 magical explosions centered on you. The first hits only your square, the second is a typical 3x3 explosion, and the third is 5x5.

No initial insight check is made, and the chance of impaling targets is raised to 1⁄4. For targets that are in-line with you (can be targeted by normal zaps), there is an additional 1⁄4 chance of firing a 6d6 magic damage beam, ending the invoke. This beam pierces targets, does not reflect, and does not bounce (stops on walls).\n\n- Counts as an insight weapon, gaining extra bonus damage when used by a Madman\n\n- Can be enchanted to +10.\n\n#### The Silence Glaive\n\n- unaligned glaive\n\n- +1 to hit, +1 life drain damage\n\n- Drains one level from the target on hit\n\n- Grants drain resistance when wielded\n\n- Offers a variety of special effects when invoked\n\n  - Invoke and specify direction: magic missile attack, using attack skill\n  - Invoke and press up: protection, using clerical skill\n  - Invoke and press down: kills all genocide-susceptible creatures on the current level.

This affects the effects of madnesses as well as their chances to trigger.\n  - It also attempts to apply the effects of your madnesses to all monsters around you, doing similar effects to the ones you would suffer. This chance is rolled once per turn for any monster that can see you. To trigger, a normal madness effect roll is made but based on your actual sanity instead of your Nightmare-aware sanity, and so is a linear roll comparing a d100 against your sanity. If this passes, then you next roll 2d\\<your level> against the monster's level, and if your roll is higher than their monster level then they are affected by any and all madnesses you have. The practicality of this depends on the madnesses being applied.\n\n- Invoke to refill energy\n\n#### Star-emperor's Ring\n\n- unaligned elf-favoring Madmen-favoring ring of wishes\n- Found on the Stranger for Elf Madmen only\n- Always spawns with 2 stars\n  - Can be used to make an additional artifact wish, separate from any other artifacts used or unlocked\n- Allows you to summon up to 2 constellation pets. These pets are summoned just like from candles of invocation, but have the constellation monster template applied. This template makes them insubstantial, mindless, unholy-hating, silent, and grants them all resistances and the ability to fly.

two broad categories: wishable and non-wishable. Wishable artifacts include those artifacts that can be given as divine gifts, including the vanilla crowning gifts but excluding new crowning gifts. Non-wishable artifacts include any <a href=\"/wiki/Category:DNethack_Quests\" title=\"Category:DNethack Quests\">quest artifacts</a>, as well as any first gifts for race-specific role/race combinations (dwarf noble, drow shared, etc.). Artifacts belonging to late-game enemies like demon or devil lords are unwishable, as are any found on alignment quests. \n</p><p>Randomly found artifacts do not affect the odds of gifted or wished artifacts later. For the rules for wishing for artifacts, see <a href=\"/wiki/DNetHack_artifact_wishing\" title=\"DNetHack artifact wishing\">dNetHack artifact wishing</a>.

artifacts}}\n{{tocright}}\n'''Artifacts''' in [[dNetHack]] can be divided into two broad categories: wishable and non-wishable. Wishable artifacts include those artifacts that can be given as divine gifts, including the vanilla crowning gifts but excluding new crowning gifts. Non-wishable artifacts include any [[:Category:DNethack_Quests|quest artifacts]], as well as any first gifts for race-specific role/race combinations (dwarf noble, drow shared, etc.). Artifacts belonging to late-game enemies like demon or devil lords are unwishable, as are any found on alignment quests. \n\nRandomly found artifacts do not affect the odds of gifted or wished artifacts later. For the rules for wishing for artifacts, see [[dNetHack artifact wishing]]. (Spoilers!)\n\nThis page is currently being revised due to many updates changing artifact effects. Everything including and above the listed artifact has been revised and is accurate to the current version: Xiuhcoatl\n\n== Wishable artifacts ==\n=== Vanilla Crowning Gifts ===\n==== Excalibur ====\n*lawful intelligent knight-favoring long sword\n**Can be wished for as any material or size valid for a normal long sword, since an Excalibur with those properties could be obtained from dipping regardless\n*+1d20 to hit, +1d10 damage\n*Grants drain resistance and searching while wielded\n**Boosts the success rate of all searches performed, depending on its enchantment\n*If blessed, grants +7 to-hit and +3d7 damage vs holy-haters\n*Angers demon lords if approached while wielded\n\n==== Vorpal Blade ====\n*neutral long sword\n*+1d5 to hit, +1 damage\n*Rolls 2d8+2 or 2d12+2 for each hit, dice are [[exploding dice]] adding 1d8+1 for each explosion\n*Randomly beheads targets (5%)\n**100% chance against jabberwocks\n\n==== Stormbringer ====\n*chaotic intelligent runesword\n*Bloodthirsty (insanity% chance of attacking an adjacent monster every turn, including pets and peacefuls)\n*+1d5 to hit, +1d2 drain damage\n*Drains target's levels on hit\n**Gains +1d8 damage vs non-life-drain-resistant targets, reducing the target's maximum HP by the extra damage dealt, and healing you for half the extra damage dealt\n**Occasionally (10%) converts its entire base damage to level drain damage, rolling one d8 per per 4 points of damage\n*Grants drain resistance when wielded\n*Always counts as cursed for unholy damage, and does an extra 4d9 unholy damage vs. unholy haters\n*Grants 25 Str and 25 Con when wielded in main hand.\n*Ignores equipped armor for calculating hits and DR and deals full damage to insubstantial targets (shades, sharab kamerel)\n\n=== Nameable artifacts ===\n==== Orcrist ====\n*chaotic elf-favoring elven broadsword\n*Against orcs and demons grants 1d5 to hit, 2x damage, and [[Warned of monster type|warning]] while carried\n*Does not resist being held second to other weapons\n**However, it is too heavy to use in the offhand without suffering a &minus;20 penalty to hit, unless you are Large.\n\n==== Sting ====\n*chaotic elf-favoring elven dagger\n*Against orcs and spiders grants +1d5 to hit, 2x damage, and warning while carried\n*Cuts through spiderwebs in a single turn\n*Does not resist being held second to other weapons\n\n==== Grimtooth ====\n*chaotic orc-favoring orcish dagger\n*Against elves and humans, grants +1d5 to hit, 2x damage, and warning while carried\n*Does not resist being held second to other weapons\n\n==== Carnwennan ====\n*lawful knight-favoring dagger\n*Can be named by any character than began the game as lawful\n*Against fey and monsters that pick up magic items, grants +1d5 to hit, +1d10 damage, and warning while carried\n*Grants stealth when wielded\n*Invoke to toggle [[invisibility]]\n\n==== Slave to Armok ====\n*lawful dwarf-favoring dwarvish mattock\n*Bloodthirsty (insanity% chance of attacking an adjacent monster every turn, including pets and peacefuls)\n*Against elves, orcs, always-peaceful monsters, and monster lords, grants +1d5 to hit and 2x damage\n\n==== Claideamh ====\n*unaligned long sword\n*Against elves, [[Fey (dnethack)|fey]], giants, elementals, and [[primordial]]s, grants +1d5 to hit, 2x damage, and warning while wielded\n\n==== The Singing Sword ====\n*unaligned intelligent long sword\n**Does not favor any role, unless you are a Bard, in which case it is Bard-favoring\n*Can be named by Bards, elves, and anyone who has ever bound Orthos\n**Rapiers and sabers are also valid base items when naming, in addition to long swords\n*+1 to hit, +1 damage\n*Uses the [[musicalize spell]] skill instead of the [[long sword]] skill.\n*Passively learns songs while wielded, and can be instructed to sing a known song via #invoke.

This shakes off the blood on it, ending the active effect but causing a 6d6 rotten blood damage explosion of radius 1 centered on the player, hitting you and all adjacent squares.

These explosions deal (1d12+enchantment), for a total of 3d12 + 3*enchantment on the target at the chosen direction.\n**When invoked downwards, causes 3 magical explosions centered on you. The first hits only your square, the second is a typical 3x3 explosion, and the third is 5x5. These explosions deal the same damage as the sideways explosions, for 2d12 + 2*enchantment on adjacent targets and 1d12 + enchantment to targets 1 square away.\n**When invoked upwards, has similar effects to the living effects. No initial insight check is made, and the chance of impaling targets is raised to {{frac|4}}. For targets that are in-line with you (can be targeted by normal zaps), there is an additional {{frac|4}} chance of firing a 6d6 magic damage beam, ending the invoke.

For this purpose, special levels are considered\ndistinct from normal ones; for example, an Oracle level at DL 6 can leave\nbones despite the prior presence of a stored bones file for a regular\nDungeons level at that depth, and can be loaded in at a different depth if\nthat's where the Oracle happens to be located in the new game.\n\n\nLeaving bones files\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSome levels are ineligible to be saved as bones under any circumstances,\nand should you die on these levels you will never leave a bones file:\n\nDungeons of Doom levels 1-3*              Medusa's Island\nThe Castle                                Gnomish Mines level 1 (maybe)**\nMines' End                                Sokoban (all levels)\nQuest home and goal levels                Fort Ludios\nWizard's Tower top and bottom levels      Fake Wizard's Tower with portal\nVibrating Square level                    Moloch's Sanctum\nVlad's Tower top and bottom levels        Endgame (all levels)\nAny level with a dungeon branch\n\n* This is a consequence of the formula given below\n** If at DL3, as a consequence of the formula given below\n\nThis means that the following levels are eligible to leave bones and have\nbones files loaded for them (provided they don't contain the entrance to\nanother dungeon branch):\n\nDungeons of Doom (normal) DL 4+           Oracle\nBig Room                                  Rogue Level\nGnomish Mines (normal) DL 4+*             Minetown\nQuest locate and filler levels            Gehennom (normal)\nValley of the Dead                        Asmodeus' Lair\nJuiblex' Swamp                            Baalzebub's Lair\nOrcus-town                                Wizard's Tower middle level\nFake Wizard's Tower without portal        Vlad's Tower middle level\n\n* Stored bones for Mines level 1 may be loaded at DL3, but not left\n  at that depth.\n\nIf you die on a level that is eligible to leave bones and for which there\nis not currently a bones file on the system, the chance of one being\ncreated is dependent on the depth of that level: 1-(1/(1+(DL/4))) (note that\nthis, combined with NetHack's use of integer arithmetic, means that no level\nabove DL 4 will ever leave bones). The only other factor is that you will\nnot leave bones if you were swallowed or engulfed when you died; \"Nothing\nelse. Not how you died, not what level you were, not what's in your\ninventory, not whether it was loaded as bones, not any intrinsics or god\nstatus or nearby monster.\" (from a Usenet article).\n\nWhen bones are saved, you and your possessions are saved along with them,\nalong with the level layout, objects, and monsters. There are, however,\ncertain modifications made:\n\nYou leave a corpse, under most circumstances. If you were polymorphed and\nunchanging, it will be that of your monster form (if that can leave\ncorpses); otherwise, it will be that of your race. No corpse will be left\nif you are disintegrated, burned to death, die while unchanging and\npolymorphed into a monster that does not leave corpses, or arise from the\ndead as a different monster as detailed below. If you are stoned, you will\ninstead leave a statue containing your possessions.\n\nIf you leave a corpse, a grave is created (with the tombstone bearing your\ncharacter's name and manner of death) if the location is one where a grave\ncan occur (a non-trapped \"floor of a room\" square of open space).\n\nYou become a ghost, under most circumstances. If you died by sliming, you\ninstead arise from the dead as a green slime. If you were killed by any W,\nyou arise from the dead as a wraith; by any M, as a mummy of your race; by\nany V and you are human, as a vampire; by a ghoul, as a ghoul. In each\ncase, the monster you arise as will be carrying your possessions. If you\nare stoned, no ghost is created.\n\nItems that were in your character's main inventory each have an 80% chance\nof becoming cursed, if they weren't already. Items that were inside\ncontainers are unaffected, whether the container is cursed or not.\n\nSome monsters will never be saved in bones: the Wizard of Yendor, your\nQuest Nemesis and Leader, Vlad the Impaler, and Medusa.\n\n\nLoading bones files\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWhen you first arrive at a level for which bones are eligible to be loaded\nand for which a stored bones file exists on the system, there is a flat 1/3\nchance that that file will be loaded.\n\nThe monsters on the level will have their peaceful status adjusted to suit\nthe character arriving there (for example, just because the dwarves and\ngnomes on a Mines level were peaceful towards the dwarvish character that\ndied there, doesn't mean they'll be peaceful towards your orc who's found\nthose bones). In particular, this means that the previous character's pets\nwill often be found hostile. Monsters in the bones file that are extinct\nor genocided in the new game will be removed.\n\nArtifacts in the bones file that exist or have existed in the new game will\nbe converted to an ordinary non-artifact object of their type, as will the\nQuest Artifact for the new character's role. The four Unique Items will\nbecome normal items: the Amulet of Yendor a cursed cheap plastic imitation,\nthe Bell of Opening a cursed bell, the Book of the Dead a cursed blank\nspellbook, and the Candelabrum of Invocation a number of cursed partly-used\nwax candles corresponding to the number of candles (of any type) as had\nbeen in the Candelabrum (at least one). Tins of unique monsters will become\nempty.\n\n\nBones compatibility\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGenerally, bones files created by different versions of NetHack, or builds\non different platforms or with different compile options, will not be\ncompatible with each other. Bones created by a sufficiently similar build\nof the same version on a sufficiently similar platform may be compatible\nenough to be loaded; you can move them into place manually, or use a bones\nexchange service such as Hearse (http://hearse.krollmark.com/).\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCorrections and clarifications provided by Kristoffer Björkman, John Cater,\nDayv, Jukka Lahtinen, and Spike.\n```\n\n*This page is based on a spoiler by [Dylan O'Donnell](https://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.spod-central.org/%257Epsmith/).

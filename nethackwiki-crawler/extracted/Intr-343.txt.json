It\ndoes not cover statuses (confusion, hallucination, etc); the dividing line\nis sometimes blurry, but as a general rule of thumb if it appears on the\nstatus line it's a status, not an intrinsic. Note that, as a general rule,\nany intrinsics acquired solely by experience level can be lost by being\ndrained below that level.\n\namphibiousness\n  acquired by\n    Polymorphing into a floating eye, water elemental, newt, (baby)\n    crocodile, or any ;.\n  effects\n    You can enter water safely.\n    Eels' drowning attacks will not drown you.\n    Fog clouds' moisture attacks will not harm you.\n\nastral vision\n  acquired by\n    Wearing the Eyes of the Overworld (Monk Quest Artifact).\n  effect\n    Spaces within a radius 3 are visible even if dark or if line of sight\n    is blocked.\n    Blinding has no effect on your ability to see.\n\nblinding resistance\n  acquired by\n    Wielding Sunsword (light-based only).\n    Wearing lenses or a visored helmet (physical-based only).\n  effects\n    Light-based resistance protects against the blinding attacks of\n    yellow lights and Archons, and blinding from lightning bolts,\n    engraving with a wand of lightning, failed use of a crystal ball,\n    magic traps, and expensive cameras.\n    Physical-based resistance protects against the blinding attack of\n    ravens and cobras, but not against dust vortices or thrown cream pies.\n    Note that being blinded already, or being polymorphed into a form\n    that has no eyes, is an absolute defence against blinding.\n\nclairvoyance\n  acquired by\n    Wearing a cornuthaum as a Wizard.\n    Donating between 200*XL and (400*XL)-1 zorkmids, more than 1/3 your\n    current visible gold, to a priest (lasts 500 to 999 (more) turns per\n    donation).\n    Carrying the Amulet of Yendor.\n  effects\n    Maps a 12x20 rectangle around you every so often (50% chance every\n    fifteenth turn). Blocked by wearing a cornuthaum when not a Wizard.\n    Exercises wisdom every five turns.\n\ndisplacement\n  acquired by\n    Wearing a cloak of displacement.\n  effects\n    Monsters may believe your location to be in your vicinity rather than\n    at your actual location (doesn't fool priests or shopkeepers).\n    1/4 chance of finding you anyway, and remembering your location until\n    you move away.\n\nflying\n  acquired by\n    Polymorphing into killer or queen bee, winged gargoyle, (master) mind\n    flayer, homunculus, lurker above, xan, couatl, titan, jabberwock,\n    wraith, succubus, incubus, balrog, or any of vyBDEV.\n    Riding a couatl, ki-rin, jabberwock, or any D.\n  effects\n    Can pass over pits, holes, trap doors, squeaky boards, bear traps, water\n    or lava safely. (Pits and holes in Sokoban will still trap you.)\n    Land mines have a chance of not being triggered, and will not wound your\n    legs.\n    Improved chances of avoiding death by drawbridge.\n    Can move freely over ice or on the Plane of Air.\n    Wounded legs do not reduce your carrying capacity.\n    No ill effects from descending stairs when encumbered, fumbling or\n    punished.\n    You are out of reach of xans' attacks.\n    You escape the dungeon rather than dying by level teleporting to levels\n    between -9 and -1.    \n\nfood appraisal\n  acquired by\n    Reading a blessed scroll of food detection or casting a spell of detect\n    food at skilled or expert (lasts until you receive a warning).\n  effects\n    You are warned before eating food that may be tainted, petrify you,\n    slime you, be rotten, poison you, break a Monk's vegetarian conduct,\n    be acidic, be rustproof if you are polymorphed into a rust monster,\n    break vegan conduct, or break vegetarian conduct. Warnings occur in\n    that order of preference, and you are given the choice of whether to\n    continue eating.\n\nfumbling\n  acquired by\n    Wearing gauntlets of fumbling or fumble boots.\n    Walking on ice without either wearing snow boots or being polyed into\n    a monster with cold resistance (not lasting effect).\n  effects\n    Abuses dexterity every five turns.\n    Every d20 turns, you'll slip or trip if you attempt to move that\n    turn;

how far you can jump depends on the source of the intrinsic.\n    Knights can jump as the chess piece; boots allow jumping as if the\n    spell were cast at unskilled level ('u' below). Casting the spell\n    allows you one jump of a distance depending on the level of the spell.\n\n                                eee\n                              esbubse\n                              suuuuus\n                             ebuuuuube\n                             euuu@uuue\n                             ebuuuuube\n                              suuuuus\n                              esbubse\n                                eee\n\n    Jumping out of bear traps will wound your leg.

It\ndoes not cover statuses (confusion, hallucination, etc); the dividing line\nis sometimes blurry, but as a general rule of thumb if it appears on the\nstatus line it's a status, not an intrinsic. Note that, as a general rule,\nany intrinsics acquired solely by experience level can be lost by being\ndrained below that level.\n\namphibiousness\n  acquired by\n    Polymorphing into a floating eye, water elemental, newt, (baby)\n    crocodile, or any&#160;;.\n  effects\n    You can enter water safely.\n    Eels' drowning attacks will not drown you.\n    Fog clouds' moisture attacks will not harm you.\n\nastral vision\n  acquired by\n    Wearing the Eyes of the Overworld (Monk Quest Artifact).\n  effect\n    Spaces within a radius 3 are visible even if dark or if line of sight\n    is blocked.\n    Blinding has no effect on your ability to see.\n\nblinding resistance\n  acquired by\n    Wielding Sunsword (light-based only).\n    Wearing lenses or a visored helmet (physical-based only).\n  effects\n    Light-based resistance protects against the blinding attacks of\n    yellow lights and Archons, and blinding from lightning bolts,\n    engraving with a wand of lightning, failed use of a crystal ball,\n    magic traps, and expensive cameras.\n    Physical-based resistance protects against the blinding attack of\n    ravens and cobras, but not against dust vortices or thrown cream pies.\n    Note that being blinded already, or being polymorphed into a form\n    that has no eyes, is an absolute defence against blinding.\n\nclairvoyance\n  acquired by\n    Wearing a cornuthaum as a Wizard.\n    Donating between 200*XL and (400*XL)-1 zorkmids, more than 1/3 your\n    current visible gold, to a priest (lasts 500 to 999 (more) turns per\n    donation).\n    Carrying the Amulet of Yendor.\n  effects\n    Maps a 12x20 rectangle around you every so often (50% chance every\n    fifteenth turn). Blocked by wearing a cornuthaum when not a Wizard.\n    Exercises wisdom every five turns.\n\ndisplacement\n  acquired by\n    Wearing a cloak of displacement.\n  effects\n    Monsters may believe your location to be in your vicinity rather than\n    at your actual location (doesn't fool priests or shopkeepers).\n    1/4 chance of finding you anyway, and remembering your location until\n    you move away.\n\nflying\n  acquired by\n    Polymorphing into killer or queen bee, winged gargoyle, (master) mind\n    flayer, homunculus, lurker above, xan, couatl, titan, jabberwock,\n    wraith, succubus, incubus, balrog, or any of vyBDEV.\n    Riding a couatl, ki-rin, jabberwock, or any D.\n  effects\n    Can pass over pits, holes, trap doors, squeaky boards, bear traps, water\n    or lava safely. (Pits and holes in Sokoban will still trap you.)\n    Land mines have a chance of not being triggered, and will not wound your\n    legs.\n    Improved chances of avoiding death by drawbridge.\n    Can move freely over ice or on the Plane of Air.\n    Wounded legs do not reduce your carrying capacity.\n    No ill effects from descending stairs when encumbered, fumbling or\n    punished.\n    You are out of reach of xans' attacks.\n    You escape the dungeon rather than dying by level teleporting to levels\n    between -9 and -1.    \n\nfood appraisal\n  acquired by\n    Reading a blessed scroll of food detection or casting a spell of detect\n    food at skilled or expert (lasts until you receive a warning).\n  effects\n    You are warned before eating food that may be tainted, petrify you,\n    slime you, be rotten, poison you, break a Monk's vegetarian conduct,\n    be acidic, be rustproof if you are polymorphed into a rust monster,\n    break vegan conduct, or break vegetarian conduct. Warnings occur in\n    that order of preference, and you are given the choice of whether to\n    continue eating.\n\nfumbling\n  acquired by\n    Wearing gauntlets of fumbling or fumble boots.\n    Walking on ice without either wearing snow boots or being polyed into\n    a monster with cold resistance (not lasting effect).\n  effects\n    Abuses dexterity every five turns.\n    Every d20 turns, you'll slip or trip if you attempt to move that\n    turn; if you're carrying more than a certain amount, you'll make\n    noise and alert nearby monsters; if you're riding, you'll fall off.\n    You fall going downstairs.\n    Your dexterity is abused if you try to move through a closed door.\n    Saddling ridable monsters is less likely to succeed.\n    Attempting to mount a steed will always fail.\n    Digging with an implement may not succeed, and may cause it to hit you\n    or be dropped.\n    Your chance of disarming a dungeon trap is halved.\n    You have no chance of disarming a chest or door trap.\n    You have no chance of escaping traps.\n    Setting traps can cause them to go off.\n    Applying cans of grease can cause you to drop them.\n    Reduces likelihood of applying a bullwhip having desired effect, and\n    can make you drop it instead.\n    Kicking monsters or objects is less likely to be successful.\n    Mjollnir will hit a Valkyrie's arm rather than be caught on its return.\n    Returning boomerangs will hit you rather than be caught.\n    The following items will end up on the floor rather than in your\n    inventory: potions of oil that you light (if one of several), wished-for\n    items, tins made with a tinning kit, food from a horn of plenty, scrolls\n    of mail, gems thrown at you while you're a unicorn, items stolen as a\n    nymph, weapons snagged with a bullwhip, arrows created by the Longbow of\n    Diana, saddles removed from a steed, and written scrolls and\n    spellbooks.\n\nhalf physical damage\n  acquired by\n    Carrying the Orb of Fate or the Master Key of Thievery (Valkyrie and\n    Rogue Quest Artifacts).\n    Wearing the Mitre of Holiness (Priest(ess) Quest Artifact) as a\n    Priest(ess) (only against physical attacks from demons and undead).\n  effects\n    Halves damage from physical monster attacks, falling piercers,\n    exploding gas spores, effects of poison, thrown/spat objects, and\n    bites from carnivorous bags.\n    Halves damage from geyser spells cast by monsters.\n    Halves damage from rust traps as an iron golem.\n    Halves energy drain and exhaustion from bad sex.\n    Does not protect against total digestion attacks.\n\nhalf spell damage\n  acquired by\n    Carrying the Orb of Detection, the Platinum Yendorian Express Card,\n    the Orb of Fate, or the Eye of the Aethiopica (Archeologist, Tourist,\n    Valkyrie, and Wizard Quest Artifacts).\n  effects\n    Halves damage from cold attack of Asmodeus.\n    Halves damage from psi bolt, pillar of fire, lightning bolt, and open\n    wounds spells cast by monsters.\n    Halves duration of stunning, confusion, blinding, and paralysis spells\n    cast by monsters.\n    Reduces attribute loss from strength drain spells cast by monsters.\n    Halves damage from psychic blast of (master) mind flayers.\n    Halves damage from wands zapped by monsters.\n    Halves damage from scrolls of fire read by monsters.\n    Reduces number of objects cursed from a \"malignant aura\"-type curse.\n\nhallucination resistance\n  acquired by\n    Wielding Grayswandir.\n    Polymorphing into a black light.\n  effects\n    Protects against hallucination from quaffing potions, applying cursed\n    unicorn horns, applying crystal balls, or triggering chest traps.\n    Protects against hallucination from eating yellow molds, violet fungi\n    or abbots.\n    Protects against the hallucination attack of black lights.\n    \ninfravision\n  acquired by\n    Being an unpolymorphed dwarf, elf, gnome or orc by race.\n    Polymorphing into a stalker, pit viper, python, Woodland-elf, Green-elf,\n    Grey-elf, elf-lord, Elvenking, horned devil, succubus, incubus, barbed\n    devil, marilith, vrock, hezrou, bone devil, ice devil, nalfeshnee,\n    pit fiend, balrog, or any of hikoAGHLMOTZ.\n  effects\n    Warm-blooded, fire-based, or ice-based monsters are visible if in line\n    of sight, even if their location is dark.\n    \ninvulnerability\n  acquired by\n    Praying successfully (for the duration of the prayer).\n  effects\n    Monsters will not attack; being swallowed has no ill effects.\n    No exertion damage suffered from overencumbrance.\n    No HP regeneration.\n    No hunger increase.\n    Teleportitis, polymorphitis, and lycanthropy will not kick in.\n    All timers other than luck normalisation are halted.\n\njumping\n  acquired by\n    Wearing jumping boots.\n    From the start as a Knight.\n    Casting the spell 'jump' (temporary).\n  effects\n    You can use the #jump command to move to distant, visible, open\n    squares; how far you can jump depends on the source of the intrinsic.\n    Knights can jump as the chess piece; boots allow jumping as if the\n    spell were cast at unskilled level ('u' below). Casting the spell\n    allows you one jump of a distance depending on the level of the spell.\n\n                                eee\n                              esbubse\n                              suuuuus\n                             ebuuuuube\n                             euuu@uuue\n                             ebuuuuube\n                              suuuuus\n                              esbubse\n                                eee\n\n    Jumping out of bear traps will wound your leg.
